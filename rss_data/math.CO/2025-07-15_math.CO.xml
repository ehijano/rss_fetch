      <title>Unavoidable Minors of Matroids with Minimum Cocircuit Size Four</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1963, Halin and Jung proved that every simple graph with minimum degree at least four has $K_5$ or $K_{2,2,2}$ as a minor. Mills and Turner proved an analog of this theorem by showing that every $3$-connected binary matroid in which every cocircuit has size at least four has $F_7, M^*(K_{3,3}), M(K_5),$ or $ M(K_{2,2,2})$ as a minor. Generalizing these results, this paper proves that every simple matroid in which all cocircuits have at least four elements has as a minor one of nine matroids, seven of which are well known. All nine of these special matroids have rank at most five and have at most twelve elements.</description>

      <title>On the Importance of Studying the Membership Problem for Pedigree Polytopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09069v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given $n \geq 3$, a combinatorial object called a \textit{ pedigree } is defined using $3$-element subsets from $[n]$ obeying certain conditions. The convex hull of pedigrees is called the pedigree polytope for $n$. Pedigrees are in $1-1$ correspondence with Hamiltonian cycles. Properties of pedigrees, pedigree polytopes, adjacency structure of the graph of the pedigree polytope and their implication on the adjacency structure of the Symmetric Travelling Salesman problem (STSP) polytope have been studied earlier in the literature by the author.
  The question: Given $X$, does it belong to the pedigree polytope for $n$? is called the membership problem. This article provides proof that the membership problem for pedigree polytopes can be solved efficiently. Due to the pedigree's stem property, we can check the membership problem sequentially for $ k \in [4, n]$. One constructs a layered network, recursively, to check membership in the pedigree polytope. Proof of the proposed framework's validity is given. This article's significant and far-reaching contribution is that the membership problem has a strongly polynomial-time framework.
  Since the polynomial solvability of the membership problem implies that one can solve efficiently any linear optimisation problem over the pedigree polytope. And a specific linear optimisation over the pedigree polytope (the multistage insertion formulation) solves the STSP.
  The consequence of this result is that we have proof of $NP = P$. A recent book by the author entitled \textit{Pedigree Polytopes} brings together published results on pedigrees and some new results, mainly in Chapters 5 and 6. The primary purpose of this article is to present the latest results from that book in a self-contained fashion so that experts can vet the same. Some of the proofs and presentation of concepts in this article are new.</description>

      <title>A bijection between $321$- and $213$-avoiding permutations preserving $t$-stack-sortability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a bijection between $321$- and $213$-avoiding permutations that preserves the property of $t$-stack-sortability. Our bijection transforms natural statistics between these two classes of permutations and proves a refinement of an enumerative conjecture posed by Zhang and Kitaev. This work contributes further to the long-standing line of research on bijections between length-3 pattern avoiding permutations. Increasing binary trees lie at the heart of our approach.</description>

      <title>Explicit geometric construction of triangle-free Ramsey graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09235v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe an explicit geometric construction of a vast family of graphs without $m$-cliques with bounded independence number generalizing triangle-free Ramsey graphs described by Codenotti, Pudl\'ak and Resta and provide a combinatorial proof for the upper bound on the independence number of the latter. We focus on triangle-free graphs and describe some families of such graphs with $n$ vertices and independence number $O(n^{\frac{2}{3}})$, matching the best-known constructive bound. We describe an additional family of graphs that don't match the best-known bound but still have a small independence number and are based on Euclidean geometry. We also present a linear $\frac{1}{2}$-approximation algorithm for finding the largest independent set that works for a significant subset of our family of graphs.</description>

      <title>Counting fixed-point-free Cayley permutations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cayley permutations generalize permutations by allowing repeated values. We use two-sort species to derive differential equations that capture the recursive structure of their functional digraphs. These equations enable us to enumerate fixed-point-free Cayley permutations. Our approach also yields combinatorial identities and counting formulas for Cayley permutations whose functional digraphs have specific graph-theoretical properties, such as being a tree, being a forest, or being connected.</description>

      <title>Oriented Steiner Triple Systems, Steiner Products, and Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let S denote a Steiner triple system on an n-element set. An orientation of S is an assignment of a cyclic ordering to each of the triples in S. From an oriented Steiner triple system, one can define an anticommutative bilinear operation on Rn resembling the cross product. We call this bilinear operation a Steiner product. We classify the oriented Steiner triple systems on sets of size 7 and 9 and investigate the dynamics of their associated Steiner products.</description>

      <title>Lattice paths and the Geode</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09405v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $t_1,t_2,\dots$ be variables, and let $S$ be the formal power series in the variables $t_1, t_2,\dots$ satisfying $S=1+\sum_{i=1}^\infty t_n S^n.$ Let $S_1 =\sum_{n=1}^\infty t_n$. Wildberger and Rubine recently showed that there is a formal power series $G$ in the $t_i$, which they called the Geode, satisfying $S=1+GS_1$. In this paper we discuss some of the properties of the Geode and of the related series $H=G/S$, which satisfies $S=1/(1-HS_1)$. We show that \begin{equation*} G=\biggl(1-\sum_{n=1}^\infty t_n (1+S+S^2+\cdots+S^{n-1})\biggr)^{-1}, \end{equation*} and \begin{equation*} H=\biggl( 1-\sum_{n=2}^\infty t_n (S+S^2+\cdots+S^{n-1})\biggr)^{-1}, \end{equation*} and we give combinatorial interpretations of $G$ and $H$ in terms of lattice paths.</description>

      <title>Polynomial-to-exponential transition in 3-uniform Ramsey numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $r_k(s, e; t)$ denote the smallest $N$ such that any red/blue edge coloring of the complete $k$-uniform hypergraph on $N$ vertices contains either $e$ red edges among some $s$ vertices, or a blue clique of size $t$. Erd\H os and Hajnal introduced the study of this Ramsey number in 1972 and conjectured that for fixed $s&gt;k\geq 3$, there is a well defined value $h_k(s)$ such that $r_k(s, h_k(s)-1; t)$ is polynomial in $t$, while $r_k(s, h_k(s); t)$ is exponential in a power of $t$. Erd\H os later offered \$500 for a proof. Conlon, Fox, and Sudakov proved the conjecture for $k=3$ and $3$-adically special values of $s$, and Mubayi and Razborov proved it for $s &gt; k \geq 4$. We prove the conjecture for $k=3$ and all $s$, settling all remaining cases of the problem. We do this by solving a novel Tur\'an-type problem: what is the maximum number of edges in an $n$-vertex $3$-uniform hypergraph in which all tight components are tripartite? We show that the balanced iterated blowup of an edge is an exact extremizer for this problem for all $n$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.09504v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is twofold. First, we demonstrate how Riordan matrices can be employed to connect well-known concepts in geometric combinatorics, such as $f$-vectors, $h$-vectors $\gamma$-vectors, in a similar fashion to the McMullen Correspondence, and the Dehn-Sommerville equations, among others. Second, we investigate the combinatorial properties of the topological join operation, both for simplicial complexes and for Alexandroff spaces. Finally, we explore the Riordan matrices arising from the iteration of this topological operation and analyze their properties.</description>

      <title>Equiangular lines via nodal domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09511v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For given $\Delta&gt;0$ and $0&lt;\lambda&lt;3/\sqrt{2}$, we show that the maximum multiplicity that $\lambda$ can appear as the second largest eigenvalue of a connected graph with maximum degree at most $\Delta$ is $O_{\Delta,\lambda}(1)$. This result answers a question due to Jiang, Tidor, Yao, Zhang and Zhao [Question 6.4, Ann. of Math. (2) 194 (2021), no. 3, 729-743] in the case of $0&lt;\lambda&lt;3/\sqrt{2}$, and consequently leads to improvements in their results on equiangular lines. Our proof is based on the concept of nodal domains of eigenfunctions. Indeed, we establish a multiplicity estimate in terms of maximum degree and cyclomatic number of the graph, via a novel construction of eigenfunctions with large number of nodal domains.</description>

      <title>Correlations in random cluster model at $q=1$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09520v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mu$ be a measure that samples a subset of a finite ground set, and let $\mathcal{A}_e$ be the event that element $e$ is sampled. The measure $\mu$ is negatively correlated if for any pair of elements $e, f$ one has $\mu(\mathcal{A}_e \cap \mathcal{A}_f) - \mu(\mathcal{A}_e) \mu(\mathcal{A}_f) \leq 0$. A measure is positively correlated if the direction of the inequality is reversed. For the random cluster model on graphs positive correlation between edges is known for $q \geq 1$ due to the FKG inequality, while the negative correlation is only conjectured for $0 \leq q \leq 1$. The main result of this paper is to give a combinatorial formula for the difference in question at $q=1$. Previously, such a formula was known in the uniform spanning tree case, which is a limit of the random cluster model at $q=0$.</description>

      <title>Correlation Clustering for General Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09576v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Correlation clustering provides a method for separating the vertices of a signed graph into the optimum number of clusters without specifying that number in advance. The main goal in this type of clustering is to minimize the number of disagreements: the number of negative edges inside clusters plus the number of positive edges between clusters. In this paper, we present an algorithm for correlation clustering in general case. Also, we show that there is a necessary and sufficient condition under which the lower bound, maximum number of edge disjoint weakly negative cycles, is equal to minimum number of disagreements. Finally, we prove that the presented algorithm gives a $2$-approximation for a subclass of signed graphs.</description>

      <title>Breaking the Symmetries of Amenable Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09710v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider two ways of breaking a graph's symmetry: distinguishing labelings and fixing sets. A distinguishing labeling $\phi$ of $G$ colors the vertices of $G$ so that the only automorphism of the labeled graph $(G, \phi)$ is the identity map. The distinguishing number of $G$, $D(G)$, is the fewest number of colors needed to create a distinguishing labeling of $G$. A subset $S$ of vertices is a fixing set of $G$ if the only automorphism of $G$ that fixes every element in $S$ is the identity map. The fixing number of $G$, $Fix(G)$, is the size of a smallest fixing set. A fixing set $S$ of $G$ can be translated into a distinguishing labeling $\phi_S$ by assigning distinct colors to the vertices in $S$ and assigning another color (e.g., the ``null" color) to the vertices not in $S$.
  Color refinement is a well-known efficient heuristic for graph isomorphism. A graph $G$ is amenable if, for any graph $H$, color refinement correctly determines whether $G$ and $H$ are isomorphic or not. Using the characterization of amenable graphs by Arvind et al. as a starting point, we show that both $D(G)$ and $Fix(G)$ can be computed in $O((|V(G)|+|E(G)|) \log |V(G)|)$ time when $G$ is an amenable graph.</description>

      <title>A Family of Congruences Modulo 7 for Partitions with Monochromatic Even Parts and Multi--Colored Odd Parts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent work, Amdeberhan and Merca considered the integer partition function $a(n)$ which counts the number of integer partitions of weight $n$ wherein even parts come in only one color (i.e., they are monochromatic), while the odd parts may appear in one of three colors. One of the results that they proved was that, for all $n\geq 0$, $a(7n+2) \equiv 0 \pmod{7}$. In this work, we generalize this function $a(n)$ by naturally placing it within an infinite family of related partition functions. Using elementary generating function manipulations and classical $q$--series identities, we then prove infinitely many congruences modulo 7 which are satisfied by members of this family of functions.</description>

      <title>The Fractional Haemers Bound of The Mycielski Construction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09811v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the effect of the generalized Mycielski construction $M_r(G)$ on the complementary fractional Haemers bound $\bar{\mathcal{H}}_f(G; \mathbb{F})$, a parameter that depends on a graph $G$ and a field $\mathbb{F}$. The effect of the Mycielski construction on graph parameters has already been studied for the fractional chromatic number $\chi_f$ and the complementary Lov\'asz theta number $\bar{\vartheta}$. Larsen, Propp, and Ullman provided a formula for $ \chi_f(M_2(G)) $ in terms of $\chi_f(G)$. This was later generalized by Tardif to $ \chi_f(M_r(G)) $ for any $r$, and Simonyi and the author gave a similar expression for $ \bar{\vartheta}(M_2(G)) $ in terms of $\bar{\vartheta}(G)$. In this paper, we show that Tardif's formula for the fractional chromatic number remains valid for $ \bar{\mathcal{H}}_f $ whenever $ \bar{\mathcal{H}}_f(G; \mathbb{F})$ equals the clique number of $G$. In particular, we provide a general upper bound on $\bar{\mathcal{H}}_f(M_r(G); \mathbb{F})$ in terms of $\bar{\mathcal{H}}_f(G;\mathbb{F})$ and we prove that this bound is tight whenever $ \bar{\mathcal{H}}_f(G; \mathbb{F})$ equals the clique number of $G$.</description>

      <title>Ramsey numbers of sparse graphs versus disjoint books</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $B_k$ denote a book on $k+2$ vertices and $tB_k$ be $t$ vertex-disjoint $B_k$'s. Let $G$ be a connected graph with $n$ vertices and at most $n(1+\epsilon)$ edges, where $\epsilon$ is a constant depending on $k$ and $t$. In this paper, we show that the Ramsey number $$r(G,tB_k)=2n+t-2$$ provided $n\ge 111t^3k^3$. Our result extends the work of Erd\H{o}s, Faudree, Rousseau, and Schelp (1988), who established the corresponding result for $G$ being a tree and $t=1$.</description>

      <title>Fan-goodness of sparse graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.09832v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a connected graph of order $n$, $F_k$ be a fan consisting of $k$ triangles sharing a common vertex, and $tF_k$ be $t$ vertex-disjoint copies of $F_k$. Brennan (2017) showed the Ramsey number $r(G,F_k)=2n-1$ for $G$ being a unicyclic graph for $n \geq k^2-k+1$ and $k\ge 18$, and asked the threshold $c(n)$ for which $r(G,F_k) \geq 2n$ holds for any $G$ containing at least $c(n)$ cycles and $n$ being large. In this paper, we consider fan-goodness of general sparse graphs and show that if $G$ has at most $n(1+\epsilon(k))$ edges, where $\epsilon(k)$ is a constant depending on $k$, then $$r(G,F_k)=2n-1$$ for $n\ge 36k^4$, which implies that $c(n)$ is greater than $\epsilon(k) n$. Moreover, if $G$ has at most $n(1+\epsilon(k,t))$ edges, where $\epsilon(k,t)$ is a constant depending on $k,t$, then $$r(G,tF_k)=2n+t-2$$ provided $n\ge 161t^2k^4$.</description>

      <title>An Alon-Boppana--type bound for very dense graphs, with applications to max-cut</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For any $\epsilon &gt; 0$, we show that if $G$ is a regular graph on $n \gg_\epsilon 1$ vertices that is $\epsilon$-far (differs by at least $\epsilon n^2$ edges) from any Tur\'{a}n graph, then its second eigenvalue $\lambda_2$ satisfies $$\lambda_2 \geq n^{1/4 - \epsilon}.$$ The exponent $1/4$ is optimal. Our result generalizes an analogous bound, independently obtained by Balla, R\"{a}ty -- Sudakov-Tomon, and Ihringer, which only applies to graphs with density at most $\frac{1}{2}$. Up to a lower-order factor, this confirms a conjecture of R\"{a}ty, Sudakov and Tomon. Our spectral approach has interesting applications to max-cut. First, we show that if a graph $G$, on $n \gg_\epsilon 1$ vertices and $m$ edges, is $\epsilon$-far from a disjoint union of cliques, then it has a max-cut of size at least $$\frac{m}{2} + n^{1.01}.$$ Our result improves upon a classical result of Edwards by a non-trivial polynomial factor, making progress towards another conjecture of R\"{a}ty, Sudakov and Tomon. As another application of our method, we show that if a graph $G$ is $H$-free and has $m$ edges, then $G$ has a max-cut of size at least $$\frac{m}{2} + c_H m^{0.5001}$$ where $c_H &gt; 0$ is some constant depending on $H$ only. This result makes progress towards a conjecture of Alon, Bollob\'{a}s, Krivelevich and Sudakov, and answers recent questions by Glock-Janzer-Sudakov and Balla-Janzer-Sudakov.</description>

      <title>Note on extremal problems about connected subgraph sums</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10114v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a graph $G$ with vertex assignment $c:V(G)\to \mathbb{Z}^+$, we define $\sum_{v\in V(H)}c(v)$ for $H$ a connected subgraph of $G$ as a connected subgraph sum of $G$. We study the set $S(G,c)$ of connected subgraph sums and, in particular, resolve a problem posed by Solomon Lo in a strong form. We show that for each $n$-vertex graph, there is a vertex assignment $c:V(G)\to \{1,\dots,12n^2\}$ such that for every $n$-vertex graph $G'\not\cong G$ and vertex assignment $c'$ for $G'$, the corresponding collections of connected subgraph sums are different (i.e., $S(G,c)\neq S(G',c')$). We also provide some remarks on vertex assignments of a graph $G$ for which all connected subgraph sums are different.</description>

      <title>$(\Delta-1)$-dicolouring of digraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10266v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1977, Borodin and Kostochka conjectured that every graph with maximum degree $\Delta \geq 9$ is $(\Delta-1)$-colourable, unless it contains a clique of size $\Delta$. In 1999, Reed confirmed the conjecture when $\Delta\geq 10^{14}$.
  We propose different generalisations of this conjecture for digraphs, and prove the analogue of Reed's result for each of them. The chromatic number and clique number are replaced respectively by the dichromatic number and the biclique number of digraphs. If $D$ is a digraph such that $\min(\tilde{\Delta}(D),\Delta^+(D)) = \Delta \geq 9$, we conjecture that $D$ has dichromatic number at most $\Delta-1$, unless either (i) $D$ contains a biclique of size $\Delta$, or (ii) $D$ contains a biclique $K$ of size $\Delta-2$, a directed $3$-cycle $\vec{C_3}$ disjoint from $K$, and all possible arcs in both directions between $\vec{C_3}$ and $K$. If true, this implies the conjecture of Borodin and Kostochka. We prove it when $\Delta$ is large enough, thereby generalising the result of Reed.
  We finally give a sufficient condition for a digraph $D$ to have dichromatic number at most $\Delta_{\min}(D)-1$, assuming that $\Delta_{\min}(D)$ is large enough. In particular, this holds when the underlying graph of $D$ has no clique of size $\Delta_{\min}(D)$, thus yielding a third independent generalisation of Reed's result. We further give a hardness result witnessing that our sufficient condition is best possible.
  To obtain these new upper bounds on the dichromatic number, we prove a dense decomposition lemma for digraphs having large maximum degree, which generalises to the directed setting the so-called dense decomposition of graphs due to Molloy and Reed. We believe this may be of independent interest, especially as a tool in various applications.</description>

      <title>Leaf to leaf path lengths in trees of given degree sequence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10351v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a tree $T$, let $lp(T)$ be the number of different lengths of leaf to leaf paths in $T$. For a degree sequence $s$ of a tree, let ${\rm rad}(s)$ be the minimum radius of a tree with degree sequence $s$. Recently, Di Braccio, Katsamaktsis, and Malekshahian provided a lower bound on $lp(T)$ in terms of the number of leaves and the maximum degree of $T$, answering a related question posed by Narins, Pokrovskiy, and Szab\'o. Here we show $lp(T)\geq {\rm rad}(s)-\log_2\left({\rm rad}(s)\right)$ for a tree $T$ with no vertex of degree $2$ and degree sequence $s$, and discuss possible improvements and variants.</description>

      <title>Degree-truncated choosability of graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A graph $G$ is called degree-truncated $k$-choosable if for every list assignment $L$ with $|L(v)| \ge \min\{d_G(v), k\}$ for each vertex $v$, $G$ is $L$-colourable. Richter asked whether every 3-connected non-complete planar graph is degree-truncated 6-choosable. We answer this question in negative by constructing a 3-connected non-complete planar graph which is not degree-truncated 7-choosable. Then we prove that every 3-connected non-complete planar graph is degree-truncated 16-DP-colourable (and hence degree-truncated $16$-choosable). We further prove that for an arbitrary proper minor closed family ${\mathcal G}$ of graphs, let $s$ be the minimum integer such that $K_{s,t} \notin \mathcal{G}$ for some $t$, then there is a constant $k$ such that every $s$-connected graph $G \in {\mathcal G}$ other than a GDP tree is degree-truncated DP-$k$-colourable (and hence degree-truncated $k$-choosable), where a GDP-tree is a graph whose blocks are complete graphs or cycles. In particular, for any surface $\Sigma$, there is a constant $k$ such that every 3-connected non-complete graph embeddable on $\Sigma$ is degree-truncated DP-$k$-colourable (and hence degree-truncated $k$-choosable). The $s$-connectedness for graphs in $\mathcal{G}$ (and 3-connectedness for graphs embeddable on $\Sigma$) is necessary, as for any positive integer $k$, $K_{s-1,k^{s-1}} \in \mathcal{G}$ ($K_{2,k^2}$ is planar) is not degree-truncated $k$-choosable. Also, non-completeness is a necessary condition, as complete graphs are not degree-choosable.</description>

      <title>Colorful Minors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.10467v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of colorful minors, which generalizes the classical concept of rooted minors in graphs. $q$-colorful graph is defined as a pair $(G, \chi),$ where $G$ is a graph and $\chi$ assigns to each vertex a (possibly empty) subset of at most $q$ colors. The colorful minor relation enhances the classical minor relation by merging color sets at contracted edges and allowing the removal of colors from vertices. This framework naturally models algorithmic problems involving graphs with (possibly overlapping) annotated vertex sets. We develop a structural theory for colorful minors by establishing several theorems characterizing $\mathcal{H}$-colorful minor-free graphs, where $\mathcal{H}$ consists either of a clique or a grid with all vertices assigned all colors, or of grids with colors segregated and ordered on the outer face. Leveraging our structural insights, we provide a complete classification - parameterized by the number $q$ of colors - of all colorful graphs that exhibit the Erd\H{o}s-P\'osa property with respect to colorful minors. On the algorithmic side, we provide a fixed-parameter tractable algorithm for colorful minor testing and a variant of the $k$-disjoint paths problem. Together with the fact that the colorful minor relation forms a well-quasi-order, this implies that every colorful minor-monotone parameter on colorful graphs admits a fixed-parameter algorithm. Furthermore, we derive two algorithmic meta-theorems (AMTs) whose structural conditions are linked to extensions of treewidth and Hadwiger number on colorful graphs. Our results suggest how known AMTs can be extended to incorporate not only the structure of the input graph but also the way the colored vertices are distributed in it.</description>

      <title>Multiplicative Modular Nim (MuM)</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.08830v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce Multiplicative Modular Nim (MuM), a variant of Nim in which the traditional nim-sum is replaced by heap-size multiplication modulo m. We establish a complete theory for this game, beginning with a direct, Bouton-style analysis for prime moduli. Our central result is an analogue of the Sprague-Grundy theorem, where we define a game-theoretic value, the mumber, for each position via a multiplicative mex recursion. We prove that these mumbers are equivalent to the heap-product modulo m, and show that for disjunctive sums of games, they combine via modular multiplication in contrast to the XOR-sum of classical nimbers. For composite moduli, we show that MuM decomposes via the Chinese Remainder Theorem into independent subgames corresponding to its prime-power factors. We extend the game to finite fields F(pn), motivated by the pedagogical need to make the algebra of the AES S-box more accessible. We demonstrate that a sound game in this domain requires a Canonical Heap Model to resolve the many-to-one mapping from integer heaps to field elements. To our knowledge, this is the first systematic analysis of a multiplicative modular variant of Nim and its extension into a complete, non-additive combinatorial game algebra.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.08889v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop the groundwork for a graph theoretic toy model of supersymmetric quantum mechanics. Using discrete Witten-Morse theory, we demonstrate that finite graphs have a natural supersymmetric structure and use this structure to incorporate supersymmetry into an existing model of graph quantum mechanics. We prove that although key characteristics of continuum supersymmetric systems are preserved on finite unweighted graphs, supersymmetry cannot be spontaneously broken. Finally, we prove new results about the behavior of supersymmetric graph quantum systems under edge rewiring.</description>

      <title>On Lattice Isomorphism Problems for Lattices from LCD Codes over Finite Rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09257v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: These days, post-quantum cryptography based on the lattice isomorphism problem has been proposed. Ducas-Gibbons introduced the hull attack, which solves the lattice isomorphism problem for lattices obtained by Construction A from an LCD code over a finite field. Using this attack, they showed that the lattice isomorphism problem for such lattices can be reduced to the lattice isomorphism problem with the trivial lattice $\mathbb{Z}^n$ and the graph isomorphism problem. While the previous work by Ducas-Gibbons only considered lattices constructed by a code over a \textit{finite field}, this paper considers lattices constructed by a code over a \textit{finite ring} $\mathbb{Z}/k\mathbb{Z}$, which is a more general case. In particular, when $k$ is odd, an odd prime power, or not divisible by $4$, we show that the lattice isomorphism problem can be reduced to the lattice isomorphism problem for $\mathbb{Z}^n$ and the graph isomorphism problem.</description>

      <title>m-Eternal Domination and Variants on Some Classes of Finite and Infinite Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09283v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the m-Eternal Domination problem, which is the following two-player game between a defender and an attacker on a graph: initially, the defender positions k guards on vertices of the graph; the game then proceeds in turns between the defender and the attacker, with the attacker selecting a vertex and the defender responding to the attack by moving a guard to the attacked vertex. The defender may move more than one guard on their turn, but guards can only move to neighboring vertices. The defender wins a game on a graph G with k guards if the defender has a strategy such that at every point of the game the vertices occupied by guards form a dominating set of G and the attacker wins otherwise. The m-eternal domination number of a graph G is the smallest value of k for which (G,k) is a defender win.
  We show that m-Eternal Domination is NP-hard, as well as some of its variants, even on special classes of graphs. We also show structural results for the Domination and m-Eternal Domination problems in the context of four types of infinite regular grids: square, octagonal, hexagonal, and triangular, establishing tight bounds.</description>

      <title>Asymptotically optimal cyclic subspace codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09290v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Subspace codes, and in particular cyclic subspace codes, have gained significant attention in recent years due to their applications in error correction for random network coding. In this paper, we introduce a new technique for constructing cyclic subspace codes with large cardinality and prescribed minimum distance. Using this new method, we provide new constructions of cyclic subspace codes in the Grassmannian $\mathcal{G}_q(n,k)$ of all $k$-dimensional $\mathbb{F}_q$-subspaces of an $n$-dimensional vector space over $\mathbb{F}_q$, when $k\mid n$ and $n/k$ is a composite number, with minimum distance $2k-2$ and large size. We prove that the resulting codes have sizes larger than those obtained from previously known constructions with the same parameters. Furthermore, we show that our constructions of cyclic subspace codes asymptotically reach the Johnson type bound II for infinite values of $n/k$.</description>

      <title>Reconstruction of real algebraic maps into curves with prescribed Reeb graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09467v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss reconstructing smooth real algebraic maps onto curves whose Reeb graph is as prescribed. %This can be contribut\ed to real algebraic geometry, especially in explicit examples in real algebraic geometry in a new way. The Reeb graph of a smooth function is the space of all connected components of preimages of all single points and a natural quotient space of the manifold with the vertex set being all connected components containing some singular points of it. This gives a strong tool in geometry of manifolds and appeared already in 1950 with Morse functions.
  The Reeb graph of the natural height of the unit sphere of dimension at least 2 is a graph with exactly two vertices and one edge. We reconstruct functions, from general finite graphs, conversely. In the differentiable situations, Sharko pioneered this in 2006, followed by Masumoto-Saeki and Michalak, mainly. Related real algebraic situations have been launched and studied by the author. The curve-valued case is first considered here.</description>

      <title>A bound for plany Kakeya sets in $\mathbb{F}_q^4$ using the planebrush method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09605v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Katz and Zahl used a planebrush argument to prove that Kakeya sets in $\mathbb{R}^4$ have Hausdorff dimension at least 3.059. In the special case when the Kakeya set is plany, their argument gives a better lower bound of 10/3. We give a nontechnical exposition of the Katz-Zahl argument for plany Kakeya sets in the finite field setting.</description>

      <title>Paths and Intersections: Exact Emulators for Planar Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09620v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study vertex sparsification for preserving distances in planar graphs. Given an edge-weighted planar graph with $k$ terminals, the goal is to construct an emulator, which is a smaller edge-weighted planar graph that contains the terminals and exactly preserves the pairwise distances between them. We construct exact planar emulators of size $O(f^2k^2)$ in the setting where terminals lie on $f$ faces in the planar embedding of the input graph. Our result generalizes and interpolates between the previous results of Chang and Ophelders and Goranci, Henzinger, and Peng which is an $O(k^2)$ bound in the setting where all terminals lie on a single face (i.e., $f=1$), and the result of Krauthgamer, Nguyen, and Zondiner, which is an $O(k^4)$ bound for the general case (i.e., $f=k$).
  Our construction follows a recent new way of analyzing graph structures, by viewing graphs as paths and their intersections, which we believe is of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Acyclonesto-cosmohedra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09736v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Acyclonestohedra are generalisations of Stasheff associahedra and graph associahedra defined on the data of a partially ordered set or, more generally, an acyclic realisable matroid on a building set. When the acyclonestohedron is associated to a partially ordered set, it may be interpreted as arising from Chan-Paton-like factors that are only (cyclically) partially ordered, rather than (cyclically) totally ordered as for the ordinary open string. In this paper, we argue that the canonical forms of acyclonestohedra encode scattering-amplitude-like objects that factorise onto themselves, thereby extending recent results for graph associahedra.
  Furthermore, just as Stasheff associahedra admit truncation into cosmohedra that encode the flat-space wavefunction coefficients of $\operatorname{tr}(\phi^3)$ theory, we show the acyclonestohedra also admit a truncation into acyclonesto-cosmohedra whose canonical forms may be interpreted as encoding a generalisation of the cosmological wavefunction coefficients. As a byproduct, we provide evidence that acyclonesto-cosmohedra can be obtained as sections of graph cosmohedra.</description>

      <title>Hilbert Series for Configuration Spaces of Punctured Surfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.09746v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\Sigma_{g,r}$ denote the $r$-punctured closed Riemann surface of genus $g$. For every $g\geq 0$, we determine the four-variable generating function for the mixed Hodge numbers of the unordered configuration spaces of $\Sigma_{g,1}$. The cases where $g\geq 2$ are new. Combining a result of \cite{huang2020cohomology}, this determines the analogous generating function for $\Sigma_{g,r}$ for all $r\geq 1$. As an application of our formula we illustrate how classical homological stability results, as well as so-called secondary stability results of \cite{miller2019higher} can be interpolated to illustrate stable behaviors in the mixed Hodge numbers of these spaces which have been thus-far undiscovered.</description>

      <title>Vector-valued Laurent polynomial equations, toric vector bundles and matroids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09793v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $L \subset \mathbb{C}^r \otimes \mathbb{C}[x_1^\pm, \ldots, x_n^\pm]$ be a finite dimensional subspace of vector-valued Laurent polynomials invariant under the action of torus $(\mathbb{C}^*)^n$. We study subvarieties in the torus, defined by equations $f = 0$ for generic $f \in L$. We generalize the BKK theorem, that counts the number of solutions of a system of Laurent polynomial equations generic for their Newton polytopes, to this setting. The answer is in terms of mixed volume of certain virtual polytopes encoding discrete invariants of $L$ which involves matroid data. Moreover, we prove an Alexandrov-Fenchel type inequality for these virtual polytopes. Finally, we extend this inequality to non-representable polymatroids. This extends the usual Alexandrov-Fenchel inequality for polytopes as well as log-concavity results related to matroids.</description>

      <title>Testing APS conjecture on regular graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.10050v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The maximum energy of the EPR model on a weighted graph is known to be upper-bounded by the sum of the total weight and the value of maximum-weight fractional matching~(MWFM). Recently, Apte, Parekh and Sud~(APS) conjecture that the bound could be strengthened by replacing MWFM with maximum weight matching~(MWM). Here we test this conjecture on a special class of regular graphs that Henning and Yeo constructed many years ago. On this class of regular graphs, MWMs achieve tight lower bounds. As for the maximum energy of the EPR model, we have recently devised a new algorithm called Fractional Entanglement Distribution~(FED) based on quasi-homogeneous fractional matchings, which could achieve rather high accuracy. Applying the FED algorithm to the EPR model on Henning-Yeo graphs, we could thus obtain energy as high as possible and matching value as low as possible, and then make high-precision tests of the APS conjecture. Nevertheless, our numerical results do not show any evidence that the APS conjecture could be violated.</description>

Abstract: We investigate a one-time single shelf shuffle by establishing the position matrix explicitly. In some cases, we prove a no-feedback optimal guessing strategy. A general no-feedback strategy is conjectured, and asymptotics for the expected reward are given. For the complete-feedback case, we give a guessing strategy, prove that it is optimal and unique, and find the expected reward. Our results prove a conjecture of Diaconis, Fulman, and Holmes in a special case.</description>

Abstract: Let $\Omega_1, \ldots, \Omega_m$ be probability spaces, let $\Omega=\Omega_1 \times \cdots \times \Omega_m$ be their product and let $A_1, \ldots, A_n \subset \Omega$ be events. Suppose that each event $A_i$ depends on $r_i$ coordinates of a point $x \in \Omega$, $x=\left(\xi_1, \ldots, \xi_m\right)$, and that for each event $A_i$ there are $\Delta_i$ of other events $A_j$ that depend on some of the coordinates that $A_i$ depends on. Let $\Delta=\max\{5,\ \Delta_i: i=1, \ldots, n\}$ and let $\mu_i=\min\{r_i,\ \Delta_i+1\}$ for $i=1, \ldots, n$. We prove that if $P(A_i) &lt; (3\Delta)^{-3\mu_i}$ for all $I$, then for any $0 &lt; \epsilon &lt; 1$, the probability $P\left( \bigcap_{i=1}^n \overline{A}_i\right)$ of the intersection of the complements of all $A_i$ can be computed within relative error $\epsilon$ in polynomial time from the probabilities $P\left(A_{i_1} \cap \ldots \cap A_{i_k}\right)$ of $k$-wise intersections of the events $A_i$ for $k = e^{O(\Delta)} \ln (n/\epsilon)$.</description>

Abstract: Hypergraphs extend traditional graphs by enabling the representation of N-ary relationships through higher-order edges. Akin to a common approach of deriving graph Laplacians, we define function spaces and corresponding symmetric products on the nodes and edges to derive hypergraph Laplacians. While this has been done before for Euclidean features, this work generalizes previous hypergraph Laplacian approaches to accommodate manifold-valued hypergraphs for many commonly encountered manifolds.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.10512v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: If $A$ and $B$ are subsets of an abelian group, their sumset is $A+B:=\{a+b:a\in A, b\in B\}$. We study sumsets in discrete abelian groups, where at least one summand has positive upper Banach density.
  Renling Jin proved that if $A$ and $B$ are sets of integers having positive upper Banach density, then $A+B$ is piecewise syndetic. Bergelson, Furstenberg, and Weiss improved the conclusion to "$A+B$ is piecewise Bohr." Beiglb\"ock, Bergelson, and Fish showed this to be qualitatively optimal, in the sense that if $C\subseteq \mathbb Z$ is piecewise Bohr, then there are $A, B\subseteq \mathbb Z$ having positive upper Banach density such that $A+B\subseteq C$.
  We improve these results by establishing a strong correspondence between sumsets in discrete abelian groups, level sets of convolutions in compact abelian groups, and sumsets in compact abelian groups. Our proofs avoid measure preserving dynamics and nonstandard analysis, and our results apply to discrete abelian groups of any cardinality.</description>

Abstract: A \textit{grounded set family} on $I$ is a subset $F\subseteq2^I$ such that $\emptyset\in F$. We study a linearized Hopf monoid \textbf{SF} on grounded set families, with restriction and contraction inspired by the corresponding operations for antimatroids. Many known combinatorial species, including simplicial complexes and matroids, form Hopf submonoids of \textbf{SF}, although not always with the "standard" Hopf structure (for example, our contraction operation is not the usual contraction of matroids). We use the topological methods of Aguiar and Ardila to obtain a cancellation-free antipode formula for the Hopf submonoid of lattices of order ideals of finite posets. Furthermore, we prove that the Hopf algebra of lattices of order ideals of chain gangs extends the Hopf algebra of symmetric functions, and that its character group extends the group of formal power series in one variable with constant term 1 under multiplication.</description>

      <title>A Sharp Ramsey Theorem for Ordered Hypergraph Matchings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.04813v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove essentially sharp bounds for Ramsey numbers of ordered hypergraph matchings, inroduced recently by Dudek, Grytczuk, and Ruci\'{n}ski. Namely, for any $r \ge 2$ and $n \ge 2$, we show that any collection $\mathcal H$ of $n$ pairwise disjoint subsets in $\mathbb Z$ of size $r$ contains a subcollection of size $\lfloor n^{1/(2^r-1)}/2\rfloor$ in which every pair of sets are in the same relative position with respect to the linear ordering on $\mathbb Z$. This improves previous bounds of Dudek-Grytczuk-Ruci\'nski and of Anastos-Jin-Kwan-Sudakov and is sharp up to a factor of $2$. For large $r$, we even obtain such a subcollection of size $\lfloor (1-o(1))\cdot n^{1/(2^r-1)}\rfloor$, which is asymptotically tight (here, the $o(1)$-term tends to zero as $r \to \infty$, regardless of the value of $n$). Furthermore, we prove a multiparameter extension of this result where one wants to find a clique of prescribed size $m_P$ for each relative position pattern $P$. Our bound is sharp for all choices of parameters $m_P$, up to a constant factor depending on $r$ only. This answers questions of Anastos-Jin-Kwan-Sudakov and of Dudek-Grytczuk-Ruci\'nski.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a new partial order on the set of all antichains of a fixed size in any poset. When applied to minuscule posets, these partial orders give rise to distributive lattices that appear in the branching rules for minuscule representations of complex simple Lie algebras.</description>

      <title>Degree-truncated choosability of planar graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06035v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Assume $G$ is a graph and $k$ is a positive integer. Let $f:V(G)\to \mathbb{N}$ be defined as $f(v)=\min\{k,d_G(v)\}$. If $G$ is $f$-choosable, then we say $G$ is degree-truncated $k$-choosable. Answering a question of Richter, it was proved in [Zhou,Zhu,Zhu, Degree-truncated choice number of graphs, arXiv:2308.15853] that there exists a 3-connected non-complete planar graph that is not degree-truncated 7-choosable, and every 3-connected non-complete planar graph is degree-truncated 16-choosable. This paper improves the bounds, and proves that there exists a 3-connected non-complete planar graph that is not degree-truncated 8-choosable, and that every 3-connected non-complete planar graph is degree-truncated $12$-choosable.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00186v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a symbolic computation method for automatically transforming $q$-hypergeometric identities to $q$-binomial identities. Through this method, many previously proven $q$-binomial identities, including $q$-Saalsch\"utz's formula and $q$-Suranyi's formula, are re-fund, and numerous new ones are discovered. Moreover, the generation of the identities is accompanied by the corresponding proofs. During the transformation process, different ranges of variable values and various combinations of $q$-Pochhammer symbols yield different identities. The algorithm maps variable constraints to positive elements in an ordered vector space and employs a backtracking method to provide the feasible variable constraints and $q$-binomial coefficient combinations for each step.</description>

      <title>Connections between Combinations Without Specified Separations and Strongly Restricted Permutations, Compositions, and Bit Strings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00624v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $S_n$ and $S_{n,k}$ be, respectively, the number of subsets and $k$-subsets of $\mathbb{N}_n=\{1,\ldots,n\}$ such that no two subset elements differ by an element of the set $\mathcal{Q}$, the largest element of which is $q$. We prove a bijection between such $k$-subsets when $\mathcal{Q}=\{m,2m,\ldots,jm\}$ with $j,m&gt;0$ and permutations $\pi$ of $\mathbb{N}_{n+jm}$ with $k$ excedances satisfying $\pi(i)-i\in\{-m,0,jm\}$ for all $i\in\mathbb{N}_{n+jm}$. We also identify a bijection between another class of restricted permutation and the cases $\mathcal{Q}=\{1,q\}$ and obtain generating functions for $S_n$ when $q=4,5,6$. We give some classes of $\mathcal{Q}$ for which $S_n$ is also the number of compositions of $n+q$ into a given set of allowed parts. A bijection between the $k$-subsets for any $\mathcal{Q}$ and bit strings is also noted. Aided by this, an efficient algorithm for finding $S_n$ and $S_{n,k}$ is given. We also prove a bijection between $k$-subsets for a class of $\mathcal{Q}$ and the set representations of size $k$ of equivalence classes for the occurrence of a given length-($q+1$) subword within bit strings. We then formulate a straightforward procedure for obtaining the generating function for the number of such equivalence classes.</description>

      <title>Frequent elements in union-closed set families</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03862v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Union-Closed Sets Conjecture asks whether every union-closed set family $\mathcal{F}$ has an element contained in half of its sets. In 2022, Nagel posed a generalisation of this problem, suggesting that the $k$th-most popular element in a union-closed set family must be contained in at least $\frac{1}{2^{k-1} + 1} |\mathcal{F}|$ sets.
  We combine the entropic method of Gilmer with the combinatorial arguments of Knill to show that this is indeed the case for all $k \ge 2$, and characterise the families that achieve equality. Furthermore, we show that when $|\mathcal{F}| \to \infty$, the $k$th-most frequent element will appear in at least $\left( \frac{3 - \sqrt{5}}{2} - o(1) \right) |\mathcal{F}|$ sets, reflecting the recent progress made for the Union-Closed Set Conjecture.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.07006v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a finite abelian group and $A$ be a subset of $G \times G$ which is corner--free, meaning that there are no $x, y \in G$ and $d \in G \setminus \{0\}$ such that $(x, y)$, $(x+d, y)$, $(x, y+d) \in A$. We prove that \[|A| \le |G|^2 \cdot \exp(-(\log |G|)^{\Omega(1)}).\] As a consequence, we obtain polynomial (in the input length) lower bounds on the nondeterministic communication complexity of Exactly-N in the 3-player Number-on-Forehead model. We also obtain the first "reasonable'' lower bounds on the coloring version of the $3$-dimensional corners problem, as well as on the nondeterministic communication complexity of Exactly-N in the 4-player Number-on-Forehead model.</description>

      <title>On increasing sequences formed by points from a random finite subset of a hypercube</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.05365v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Consider $S$, a set of $n$ points chosen uniformly at random and independently from the unit hypercube of dimension $t&gt;2$. Order $S$ by using the Cartesian product of the $t$ standard orders of $[0,1]$. We determine a constant $\bar x(t)&lt;e$ such that, with probability $\ge 1-\exp(-\Theta(\eps)n^{1/t})$, cardinality of a largest subset of comparable points is at most $(\bar x(t)+\eps)n^{1/t}$. The bound $\bar x(t)$ complements an explicit lower bound obtained by Bollob\'as and Winkler in 1982. Furthermore, we use Dilworth's theorem on partitions of a set into chains to prove that the cardinality of a largest antichain, i. e. a largest subset of incomparable points, is at least $(1-\eps) (n/e)^{1-1/t}$ with probability exponentially close to $1$.</description>

      <title>A Generic Construction of $q$-ary Near-MDS Codes Supporting 2-Designs with Lengths Beyond $q+1$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16793v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A linear code with parameters $[n, k, n - k + 1]$ is called maximum distance separable (MDS), and one with parameters $[n, k, n - k]$ is called almost MDS (AMDS). A code is near-MDS (NMDS) if both it and its dual are AMDS. NMDS codes supporting combinatorial $t$-designs have attracted growing interest, yet constructing such codes remains highly challenging. In 2020, Ding and Tang initiated the study of NMDS codes supporting 2-designs by constructing the first infinite family, followed by several other constructions for $t &gt; 2$, all with length at most $q + 1$. Although NMDS codes can, in principle, exceed this length, known examples supporting 2-designs and having length greater than $q + 1$ are extremely rare and limited to a few sporadic binary and ternary cases. In this paper, we present the first \emph{generic construction} of $q$-ary NMDS codes supporting 2-designs with lengths \emph{exceeding $q + 1$}. Our method leverages new connections between elliptic curve codes, finite abelian groups, subset sums, and combinatorial designs, resulting in an infinite family of such codes along with their weight distributions.</description>

      <title>Permanental Analog of the Rank-Nullity Theorem for Symmetric Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01344v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rank-nullity theorem is a core result in the study of matrices. The rank of an $n \times n$ matrix is equal to the size of its largest square submatrix with a nonzero determinant; it can be computed in $O(n^{2.37})$ time. For symmetric matrices, the rank equals to the number of nonzero eigenvalues (that is, the nonzero roots of the characteristic polynomial), which implies that the nullity equals the multiplicity of zero eigenvalue. Similar to the rank, the permanental rank of a matrix is the size of the largest square submatrix with nonzero permanent (whose computation is #P-complete), while the permanental nullity is the multiplicity of zero as a root of the permanental polynomial. In this paper, we prove a permanental analog of the rank-nullity theorem for any non-negative symmetric matrix, positive semi-definite matrix and (-1, 0, 1)-balanced symmetric matrices.</description>

      <title>A Study of the Binary and Boolean Rank of Matrices with Small Constant Real Rank</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05824v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We initiate the study of the binary and Boolean rank of $0,1$ matrices that have a small rank over the reals. The relationship between these three rank functions is an important open question, and here we prove that when the real rank $d$ is a small constant, the gap between the real and the binary and Boolean rank is a small constant. We give tight upper and lower bounds on the Boolean and binary rank of matrices with real rank $1 \leq d \leq 4$, as well as determine the size of the largest isolation set in each case. Furthermore, we prove that for $d = 3,4$, the circulant matrix defined by a row with $d-1$ consecutive ones followed by $d-1$ zeros, is the only matrix of size $(2d-2)\times (2d-2)$ with real rank $d$ and Boolean and binary rank and isolation set of size $2d-2$, and this matrix achieves the maximal gap possible between the real and the binary and Boolean rank for these values of $d$.
  Our results can also be interpreted in other equivalent terms, such as finding the minimal number of bicliques needed to partition or cover the edges of a bipartite graph whose reduced adjacency matrix has real rank $1 \leq d \leq 4$. We use a combination of combinatorial and algebraic techniques combined with the assistance of a computer program.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.06390v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fix integers $r \ge 2$ and $1\le s_1\le \cdots \le s_{r-1}\le t$ and set $s=\prod_{i=1}^{r-1}s_i$. Let $K=K(s_1, \ldots, s_{r-1}, t)$ denote the complete $r$-partite $r$-uniform hypergraph with parts of size $s_1, \ldots, s_{r-1}, t$. We prove that the Zarankiewicz number $z(n, K)= n^{r-1/s-o(1)}$ provided $t&gt; 3^{s+o(s)}$. Previously this was known only for $t &gt; ((r-1)(s-1))!$ due to Pohoata and Zakharov. Our novel approach, which uses Behrend's construction of sets with no 3 term arithmetic progression, also applies for small values of $s_i$, for example, it gives $z(n, K(2,2,7))=n^{11/4-o(1)}$ where the exponent 11/4 is optimal, whereas previously this was only known with 7 replaced by 721.</description>

      <title>Bounds and Bugs: The Limits of Symmetry Metrics to Detect Partisan Gerrymandering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12167v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider two symmetry metrics commonly used to analyze partisan gerrymandering: the Mean-Median Difference (MM) and Partisan Bias (PB). Our main results compare, for combinations of seats and votes achievable in districted elections, the number of districts won by each party to the extent of potential deviation from the ideal metric values, taking into account the political geography of the state. These comparisons are motivated by examples where the MM and PB have been used in efforts to detect when a districting plan awards extreme number of districts won by some party. These examples include expert testimony, public-facing apps, recommendations by experts to redistricting commissions, and public policy proposals. To achieve this goal we perform both theoretical and empirical analyses of the MM and PB. In our theoretical analysis, we consider vote-share, seat-share pairs (V, S) for which one can construct election data having vote share V and seat share S, and turnout is equal in each district. We calculate the range of values that MM and PB can achieve on that constructed election data. In the process, we find the range of (V,S) pairs that achieve MM = 0, and see that the corresponding range for PB is the same set of (V,S) pairs. We show how the set of such (V,S) pairs allowing for MM = 0 (and PB = 0) changes when turnout in each district is allowed to vary. By observing the results of this theoretical analysis, we can show that the values taken on by these metrics do not necessarily attain more extreme values in plans with more extreme numbers of districts won. We also analyze specific example elections, showing how these metrics can return unintuitive results. We follow this with an empirical study, where we show that on 18 different U.S. maps these metrics can fail to detect extreme seats outcomes.</description>

      <title>A combinatorial formula for the coefficients of multidimensional resultants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04429v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The classical multidimensional resultant can be defined as the, suitably normalized, generator of a projective elimination ideal in the ring of universal coefficients. This is the approach via the so-called inertia forms or Tr\"{a}gheitsformen. Using clever substitutions, Mertens and Hurwitz gave a criterion, for recognizing such inertia forms, which amounts to a linear system for their numerical coefficients. In this article we explicitly solve this linear system. We do so by identifying a subset of the available equations which forms a unitriangular system. The key notion we use is that of transversal, i.e., a selection of a monomial term in each of the homogeneous polynomials at hand. We need two such transversals which are disjoint and extremal, in the sense that they relate to extremizers of a, possibly new, determinantal inequality for differences of two substochastic matrices. Thanks to this notion of extremal pair of transversals, we derive an explicit formula for the coefficients of general multidimensional resultants, as a sum of terms made of a sign times a product of multinomial coefficients, thereby explicitly showing they are integer-valued. As an application of our formula, we recover Sombra's bound on the height of resultants, in the classical case.</description>

      <title>Estimates on the decay of the Laplace-Polya integral</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12835v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Laplace--P\'olya integral, defined by $J_n(r) = \frac1\pi\int_{-\infty}^\infty \mathrm{sinc}^n t \cos(rt) \mathrm{d} \, t$, appears in several areas of mathematics. We study this quantity by combinatorial methods; accordingly, our investigation focuses on the values at integer $r$'s. Our main result establishes a lower bound for the ratio $\frac{J_n(r+2)}{J_n(r)}$ which extends and generalises the previous estimates of Lesieur and Nicolas, and provides a natural counterpart to the upper estimate established in our previous work. We derive the statement by purely combinatorial, elementary arguments. As a corollary, we deduce that no subdiagonal central sections of the unit cube are extremal, apart from the minimal, maximal, and the main diagonal sections. We also prove several consequences for Eulerian numbers.</description>

      <title>Denominator identity for the affine Lie superalgebra $\widehat{\mathfrak{spo}}(2m,2m+1)$ and indefinite theta functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06449v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In 1994, Kac and Wakimoto found the denominator identity for classical affine Lie superalgebras, generalizing that for affine Lie algebras. As an application, they obtained power series identities for some powers of $\triangle(q)$, where $\triangle(q)$ is the generating function of triangular numbers. In this article, we give a different proof of one of their identities. The main step is to prove that a certain indefinite theta function involving spherical polynomials is a modular form. We use the technique recently developed by Roehrig and Zwegers.</description>

      <title>Odd Verma's Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14274v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: By applying the exchange property of odd reflections, we describe compositions of homomorphisms between Verma modules associated with different Borel subalgebras that share the same character. As an application, we realize the module category of certain finite-dimensional algebras containing Verma modules, such as the preprojective algebra of type \( A_2 \), as extension-closed abelian subcategories of category \( \mathcal{O} \). This allows us to establish lower bounds on the length of socle of Verma modules in terms of combinatorial invariants of graphs, such as finite Young lattices.
  In addition, we investigate variants of Verma modules obtained by changing Borel subalgebras. These variants enable us to realize the principal block of \( \mathfrak{gl}(1|1) \) as an extension-closed abelian subcategory of category \( \mathcal{O} \).
  We further apply the exchange property of odd reflections to refine existing results on the associated varieties and projective dimensions of Verma modules.
  As explained in our companion manuscript, many of our results extend to the setting of regular symmetrizable Kac Moody Lie superalgebras and Nichols algebras of diagonal type, in view of the Weyl groupoids framework in the sence of Heckenberger and Yamane.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.10890v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate some weighted integer partitions whose generating functions are double-series. We will establish closed formulas for these $q$-double series and deduce that their coefficients are non-negative. This leads to inequalities among integer partitions.</description>

      <title>Linear operators preserving volume polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18146v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study linear operators preserving the property of being a volume polynomial. More, precisely we show that a linear operator preserves this property if the associated symbol is itself a volume polynomial. This can be seen as an analogue to theorems by Borcea-Br\"and\'en and Br\"and\'en-Huh for stable polynomials and Lorentzian polynomials, respectively.</description>

      <title>Maximal Achievable Service Rates of Codes and Connections to Combinatorial Designs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16983v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the service-rate region (SRR) of distributed storage systems that employ linear codes. We focus on systems where each server stores one code symbol, and a user recovers a data symbol by accessing any of its recovery groups, subject to per-server capacity limits. The SRR--the convex polytope of simultaneously achievable request rates--captures system throughput and scalability. We first derive upper and lower bounds on the maximum request rate of each data object. These bounds hold for all linear codes and depend only on the number of parity checks orthogonal to a particular set of codeword coordinates associated with that object, i.e., the equations used in majority-logic decoding, and on code parameters. We then check the bound saturation for 1) all non-systematic codes whose SRRs are already known and 2) systematic codes. For the former, we prove the bounds are tight. For systematic codes, we show that the upper bound is achieved whenever the supports of minimum-weight dual codewords form a 2-design. As an application, we determine the exact per-object demand limits for binary Hamming codes. Our framework provides a new lens to address the SRR problem through combinatorial design theory.</description>

      <title>Galton-Watson processes, simple varieties of trees and Khinchin families</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18370v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this note, we introduce a unified analytic framework that connects simple varieties of trees, Bienayme-Galton-Watson processes and Khinchin families. Using Lagrange's inversion formula, we derive new coefficient-based expressions for extinction probabilities and reinterpret them as boundary phenomena tied to the domain of the inverse of the solution to Lagrange's equation. This perspective reveals a structural bridge between combinatorial and probabilistic models, simplifying classical arguments and yielding new results. It also leads to a computationally efficient method for simulating Galton-Watson processes via power series coefficients.</description>
