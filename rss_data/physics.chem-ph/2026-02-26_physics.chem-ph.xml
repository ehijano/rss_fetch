      <title>The Effect of Base-Pairing on the Shape Resonances of Nucleobases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we have studied the effect of base-pairing on the shape resonances of guanine and cytosine nucleobases. Among the seven {\pi}* resonances we identified in the guanine-cytosine (GC) anion radical, three were centered on cytosine, and the remaining were guanine-centered. Relative to the isolated bases, upon base pair formation, the cytosine resonances were red shifted, while the guanine-centered states showed an opposite trend - where their energy was blue shifted. In addition to the electronic interactions, geometric distortion and basis set superposition error plays a crucial role in the resonance positions and widths of the GC radical anion. The electronic interaction from the complementary base seems to have a larger effect on the stabilization of the anionic resonances than the surrounding environment.</description>

      <title>Inclusion of Three-body Correction to Relativistic Equation-of-Motion Coupled Cluster Method: The Application to Electron Detachment Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21834v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the formulation and implementation of triples correction scheme to the relativistic equation-of-motion coupled-cluster method for ionization potential. Both full and partial triples correction schemes are implemented using the exact two-component atomic mean-field (X2CAMF) Hamiltonian in combination with Cholesky-Decomposition (CD) of two-electron integrals and a frozen natural spinor (FNS) truncation scheme to reduce computational cost. Benchmark calculations on halide anions, noble gas atoms, hydrogen halides, and dihalogen molecules demonstrate that triple excitations are essential for achieving quantitative ionization potentials, reducing mean absolute errors to approximately 0.01--0.08~eV relative to reference and experimental values. The X2CAMF approximation reproduces four-component Dirac-Coulomb results with negligible deviations, while the CD-FNS strategy yields substantial reductions in wall time. The resulting partial triples correction scheme scales as non-iterative $\mathcal{O}(n^7)$ with storage comparable to CCSD, offering an accurate and practical route for relativistic ionization energy calculations in heavy-element systems.</description>

      <title>MBD-ML: Many-body dispersion from machine learning for molecules and materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Van der Waals (vdW) interactions are essential for describing molecules and materials, from drug design and catalysis to battery applications. These omnipresent interactions must also be accurately included in machine-learned force fields. The many-body dispersion (MBD) method stands out as one of the most accurate and transferable approaches to capture vdW interactions, requiring only atomic $C_6$ coefficients and polarizabilities as input. We present MBD-ML, a pretrained message passing neural network that predicts these atomic properties directly from atomic structures. Through seamless integration with libMBD, our method enables the immediate calculation of MBD-inclusive total energies, forces, and stress tensors. By eliminating the need for intermediate electronic structure calculations, MBD-ML offers a practical and streamlined tool that simplifies the incorporation of state-of-the-art vdW interactions into any electronic structure code, as well as empirical and machine-learned force fields.</description>

      <title>Ab Initio Random Matrix Theory of Molecular Electronic Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21299v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use ab initio electronic-structure methods to investigate random-matrix theory (RMT) universality in molecular electronic structure. Using single-reference electronic structure methods, including Hartree-Fock, configuration-interaction singles (CIS), density functional theory, and linear-response time-dependent density-functional theory, we compute single-particle orbital energies and many-electron excitations of several representative molecules (benzene, alanine, 1-phenylethylamine, methyloxirane, and helicene chains). For generic low-symmetry geometries, the unfolded spectra of these ab initio Hamiltonians exhibit Wigner-Dyson level statistics of the Gaussian orthogonal ensemble (GOE). For extended helicene chains we explicitly restrict to bound valence excitations below the ionization threshold and still observe GOE statistics, indicating that the RMT universality is present for physical states of direct relevance to real molecules. We further explore the electric and magnetic field dependence of the molecular electronic spectra. The variance of electric polarizability (level curvature K) is predicted to be non-analytic in the magnetic field which serves as an infrared cutoff, &lt;K^2&gt; proportional to log(1/|B|). We observe a transition to the Gaussian unitary ensemble (GUE) by increasing the magnetic fields, although it occurs only at magnetic fields far beyond experimentally accessible scales. Our results indicate that random matrix universality provides a general framework for organizing ab initio predictions of interacting electron spectra in complex systems.</description>

      <title>Automatic Identification of Compounds in Molecular Mixtures from Liquid-Phase Infrared Spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21308v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Interpreting spectroscopy data is a critical bottleneck in automating chemical research and industrial characterization. Particularly within infrared (IR) spectroscopy, identifying compounds in complex, liquid-phase chemical mixtures largely relies on expert knowledge, as variable peak assignment, broadening, and shifts hinder data-driven methods. Here, we show that an algorithmic approach can identify components in both simulated and experimental mixture spectra with high accuracy despite nonlinearities in liquid-phase IR data. The method is comprehensively benchmarked with a dataset of over 44,000 simulated liquid-phase IR spectra for mixtures and achieves up to 90% accuracy in identifying molecular components across a dataset of binary and ternary liquid mixtures. Our strategy is robust to perturbation of spectra, and its accuracy is capped by near-identical liquid-phase IR spectra that limit the resolution of chemical identification, imposing theoretical limits on achieving perfect accuracy in structure identification. Finally, we apply the method to automatically interpret IR spectra in experimental settings, correctly identifying the components of nearly all samples within a blind study. This work provides tools and data to advance automated chemical laboratories through algorithmic interpretation of liquid-phase IR spectra of mixtures.</description>

      <title>Emergent Rate Laws for Collective Lying-Standing Transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21747v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lying-standing transitions in the first molecular monolayer at organic-inorganic interfaces strongly influence interface dipoles, energy-level alignment, and growth modes, yet their collective kinetics remain difficult to predict. Here, we establish a quantitative adsorbate-to-kinetics relationship using first-principles-based kinetic Monte Carlo simulations combined with a mean-field coarse-graining strategy. Focusing on tetracyanoethylene on Cu(111), we show that the collective transition rate cannot be inferred from any single elementary step but emerges from coupled microscopic processes, including reorientation, adsorption, and diffusion. A local two-step reorientation mechanism captures the diffusion-limited regime, while diffusion of lying molecules accelerates the transition in diffusion-enhanced regimes by suppressing back-reorientation via vacancy-molecule decoupling. This effect is described by a regime-dependent geometric factor accounting for deviations between single-molecule and collective rate constants. By varying molecular size and footprint ratio, we demonstrate that geometry is an intrinsic control parameter. While the collective rate scales approximately with molecular area, increasing the footprint ratio between lying and standing configurations yields order-of-magnitude accelerations due to enhanced vacancy creation and diffusion-assisted stabilization. Finally, we derive an analytical expression for the collective reorientation rate constant linking temperature- and pressure-dependent microscopic rate constants to geometric parameters. The formulation reproduces the simulations across kinetic regimes and provides transferable design principles for engineering lying-standing transition timescales at organic-inorganic interfaces.</description>

      <title>From raw data to processed spectra: A step-by-step guide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21817v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optical spectroscopy is an important and widely used technique, for instance, to characterize new materials and to identify unknown compounds. Spectra are typically reported as a function of the wavelength of light, yet the information extracted from such spectra can be misleading. In contrast, spectra represented as a function of the frequency (or photon energy) allow for a more direct extraction of the intrinsic quantum-mechanical properties of the materials under investigation. Here we discuss this conversion for absorption, fluorescence and fluorescence excitation spectra. We show step-by-step the different factors that lead to a rescaling of the measured absorption and fluorescence signals. This paper will assist instructors who aim at developing an (under-)graduate lab to introduce into the methodology and terminology of spectroscopic experiments and to provide clear, step-by-step guidelines for data analysis and representation.</description>

      <title>High-Pressure X-Ray Diffraction Study of Scheelite-type Perrhenates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22156v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The effects of pressure on the crystal structure of scheelite-type perrhenates were studied using synchrotron powder X-ray diffraction and density-functional theory. At ambient conditions, the studied materials AgReO4, KReO4, and RbReO4, exhibit a tetragonal scheelite-type crystal structure described by space group I41/a. Under compression, a transition from scheelite-to-M${\prime}$-fergusonite (space group P21/c) was observed at 1.6 and 7.4 GPa for RbReO4 and KReO4, respectively. The transition involves a relative volume decrease. On the other hand, AgReO4 underwent a phase transition to the M-fergusonite structure (space group I2/a) at 13.6 GPa. In this case there is no appreciable volume discontinuity. The room-temperature pressure-volume equation of state for the three studied perrhenates was estimated using a second-order Birch-Murnaghan equation of state. The results for the low-pressure phase are confirmed by density-functional theory calculations. The analysis of the bulk modulus shows that the compressibility of the compounds decreases following the sequence RbReO4 &gt; KReO4 &gt; AgReO4, which is related to the compressibility of the RbO8, KO8, and AgO8 bidisphenoid units. Density-functional theory also offers valuable insights into the elastic constants. Despite giving a good description for the low-pressure phase in the three compounds, density-functional theory cannot catch the structural phase transition observed in experiments. Reasons for it are discussed in the manuscript.</description>

      <title>Modeling the coincident three-ion momentum imaging of diiodomethane photodissociation on reduced-dimensional potential energy surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14611v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an efficient theoretical model to simulate observables in the time-resolved coincident three-ion Coulomb explosion experiment of diiodomethane. The model employs two degrees of freedom to describe the C-I bond breaking and the $\text{CH}_2\text{I}$ rotation during photodissociation, and three degrees of freedom to describe the coincident $\text{CH}_2^{+} + \text{I}^{2+} + \text{I}^{2+}$ fragmentation during the subsequent Coulomb explosion. By solving the equations of motion, the photodissociation pathways are obtained on two-dimensional potential energy surfaces of the valence excited states of the neutral molecule, and the asymptotic momenta of the three ionic fragments are determined on the three-dimensional ground-state potential energy surface of the fivefold-charged cation. The photodissociation pathways are consistent with previous \textit{ab initio} molecular dynamics simulations and indicate a $\text{CH}_2\text{I}$ rotational period of approximately 340 fs. The theoretical time-resolved kinetic energy release and the correlation between the kinetic energy release and the angle between the two $\text{I}^{2+}$ momenta show good agreement with experimental signals in part, reflecting and confirming the static $\text{CH}_2\text{I}_2$ state and the $\text{CH}_2\text{I} + \text{I}$ dissociation channels.</description>

      <title>Ground and low-lying excited state potential energy surfaces of diiodomethane in four dimensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.14843v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report a set of adiabatic potential energy surfaces (PESs) for diiodomethane, including the ground electronic state and all excited states accessible via single-photon absorption near 260 nm. Although constrained to four dimensions, these PESs capture the essential photochemical processes following photoexcitation--namely, bond breaking and rearrangement among the methyl radical and the two iodine atoms. Constructed using an accurate and efficient spline interpolation algorithm, the PESs reproduce local features with high fidelity and exhibit overall smooth first-order derivatives, making them suitable for molecular dynamics simulations. We identify key stationary points on the ground-state PES and on three excited-state PESs, and map reaction pathways leading to $\text{CH}_2\text{I}+\text{I}$ dissociation via the intermediate formation of a $\text{CH}_2\text{I-I}$ isomer. These PESs provide a valuable resource for molecular dynamics studies, enabling detailed exploration of photochemistry in diiodomethane.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.03516v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Stereoisomers of C$_{13}$Cl$_2$ exhibiting helical orbitals around a ring of carbon atoms were synthesized by atom manipulation on NaCl surfaces. We resolved the enantiomeric geometries of the singlet states by atomic force microscopy and mapped their helical orbital densities by scanning tunnelling microscopy. A ${\pi}$-orbital basis of the helical, non-planar singlets that twists by 90{\deg} in one circulation is consistent with a half-M\"obius topology. In such a topology, the ${\pi}$-orbital basis changes sign with respect to two circumnavigations and is periodic with respect to four circumnavigations. A quasiparticle on a ring with this boundary condition could be interpreted as carrying a Berry phase of ${\pi}$/2. We demonstrate reversible switching of the topology, between the two singlets of oppositely threaded half-M\"obius topology, and the planar, topologically trivial, triplet state. Multireference calculations, including large-scale sample-based ab initio calculations executed on quantum hardware, reveal that the switching is associated with a helical pseudo Jahn-Teller effect.</description>

Abstract: Error mitigation is essential for the practical implementation of quantum algorithms on noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. This work explores and extends Clifford Data Regression (CDR) to mitigate noise in quantum chemistry simulations using the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE). Using the H$_4$ molecule with the tiled Unitary Product State (tUPS) ansatz, we perform noisy simulations with the ibm torino noise model to investigate in detail the effect of various hyperparameters in CDR on the error mitigation quality. Building on these insights, two improvements to the CDR framework are proposed. The first, Energy Sampling (ES), improves performance by selecting only the lowest-energy training circuits for regression, thereby further biasing the sample energies toward the target state. The second, Non-Clifford Extrapolation (NCE), enhances the regression model by including the number of non-Clifford parameters as an additional input, enabling the model to learn how the noisy-ideal mapping evolves as the circuit approaches the optimal one. Our numerical results demonstrate that both strategies outperform the original CDR.</description>

      <title>Frequency- and time-resolved second order quantum coherence function of IDTBT single-molecule fluorescence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19006v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The frequency- and time-resolved second order quantum coherence function (g(2)({\tau})) of single-molecule fluorescence has recently been proposed as a powerful new quantum light spectroscopy that can reveal intrinsic quantum coherence in excitation energy transfer in molecular systems ranging from simple dimers to photosynthetic complexes. Yet, no experiments have been reported to date. Here, we have developed a single-molecule fluorescence g(2)({\tau}) quantum light spectroscopy (SMFg2-QLS) that can simultaneously measure the fluorescence intensity, lifetime, spectra, and g(2)({\tau}) with frequency resolution, for a single molecule in a controlled environment at both room temperature and cryogenic temperature. As a proof of principle, we have studied single molecules of IDTBT (indacenodithiophene-co-benzothiadiazole), a semiconducting donor-acceptor conjugated copolymer with a chain-like structure that shows a high carrier mobility and annihilation-limited long-range exciton transport. We have observed different g(2)({\tau}=0) values with different bands or bandwidths of the single molecule IDTBT fluorescence. The general features are consistent with theoretical predictions and suggest non-trivial excited state quantum dynamics, possibly showing quantum coherence, although further analysis and confirmation will require additional theoretical calculations that take into account the complexity and inhomogeneity of individual IDTBT single molecular chains. Our results demonstrate the feasibility and promise of frequency- and time-resolved SMFg2-QLS to provide new insights into molecular quantum dynamics and to reveal signatures of intrinsic quantum coherence in photosynthetic light harvesting that are independent of the nature of the light excitation.</description>
