      <title>Electric dipole moments of charged leptons in models with pseudo-Dirac sterile fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01648v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we address the impact of a small lepton number violation on charged lepton electric dipole moments - EDMs. Low-scale seesaw models protected by lepton number symmetry and leading to pseudo-Dirac pairs in the neutrino heavy spectrum provide a natural explanation for the smallness of neutrino masses with potentially testable consequences. Among which, it was thought that the small mass gap in each pair of pseudo-Dirac neutrinos may induce important contribution to the charged lepton EDMs. Recently, it has been shown that the contribution from some of the Feynman diagrams to charged lepton EDMs exactly cancel by virtue of the Ward-Takahashi identity in quantum electrodynamics. We thus consider here the Standard Model minimally extended with pairs of pseudo-Dirac sterile fermions and derive the complete analytical formula at two loops for the charged lepton EDMs. In addition, we numerically evaluate the order of the predicted EDMs consistent with the experimental bounds and constraints such as neutrino oscillation data, charged lepton flavour violating processes, sterile neutrino direct searches, meson decays, sterile neutrino decays, and cosmological and astrophysical observations. We find that, in the minimal setup accommodating neutrino data (masses and mixings) with only two pseudo-Dirac pairs, the predicted electron EDM is $\mathcal{O}(10^{-36})~e\hspace{0.05cm}\mathrm{cm}$, at most, which is much smaller than the current experimental bound and even future sensitivity. Hopefully, the electron EDM might reach future sensitivity, once extra pseudo-Dirac neutrinos are taken into account. The analytical formulae we derive are generic to any model involving pseudo-Dirac pairs in the heavy neutrino spectrum.</description>

      <title>Enhanced primordial gravitational waves from a stiff post-inflationary era due to an oscillating inflaton</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01679v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate two classes of inflationary models, which lead to a stiff period after inflation that boosts the signal of primordial gravitational waves (GWs). In both families of models studied, we consider an oscillating scalar condensate, which when far away from the minimum it is overdamped by a warped kinetic term, a la $\alpha$-attractors. This leads to successful inflation. The oscillating condensate is in danger of becoming fragmented by resonant effects when non-linearities take over. Consequently, the stiff phase cannot be prolonged enough to enhance primordial GWs at frequencies observable in the near future for low orders of the envisaged scalar potential. However, this is not the case for a higher-order scalar potential. Indeed, we show that this case results in a boosted GW spectrum that overlaps with future observations without generating too much GW radiation to de-stabilise Big Bang Nucleosynthesis. For example, taking $\alpha={\cal O}(1)$, we find that the GW signal can be safely enhanced up to $\Omega_{\rm GW}(f)\sim 10^{-11}$ at frequency $f\sim 10^2\,$Hz, which will be observable by the Einstein Telescope (ET). Our mechanism ends up with a characteristic GW spectrum, which if observed, can lead to the determination of the inflation energy scale, the reheating temperature and the shape (steepness) of the scalar potential around the minimum.</description>

      <title>Multiplicity dependence of the $p_T$-spectra for identified particles and its relationship with partonic entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01712v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the multiplicity dependence of the transverse momentum $p_T$ spectra of hadrons produced in high-energy collisions. We propose that the partonic distribution be parameterized by its non-extensive entropy and the parton saturation scale $Q_s(x)$. These two variables can be identified from the produced charged hadron distributions and provide important information on the gluon dynamics at the moment of interaction. From this perspective we interpret data from different ALICE multiplicity classes at $\sqrt{s}= 13$ TeV and $\sqrt{s}= 5.02$ TeV. A multiplicity dependent scaling function is presented and the dependence of the interaction area on multiplicity is also investigated.</description>

      <title>Exploring hadronic de-excitation via Lepton Flavor Violation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01782v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we consider a particular case of hadronic de-excitation via lepton flavor violation (LFV). Namely, $\rho^\prime \to \rho \mu e$ decay, described considering effective dim-5 and dim-7 operators. Using the current bounds for the couplings from direct processes, we exhibit the different features in the dilepton invariant mass distribution and the branching ratios, depending on the effective operator. The results, although heavily suppressed, show that they may be useful to impose constraints on individual contributions and help to disentangle them, when complemented with observables from nuclei. Our particular case can be taken as an initial step to look for other hadronic states, such as in quarkonia, where the de-excitation can have enough energy to search for LFV involving the $\tau$ lepton.</description>

      <title>Excited electron production at the SPPC-based ep colliders via contact interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01900v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: If a linear electron accelerator is installed into the SPPC (Super Proton-Proton Collider) complex, ep collision options will be available in addition to pp collisions. We consider the production of excited electrons with spin-1/2 at the future SPPC-based electron-proton colliders with center-of-mass energies of $8.44$, $11.66$, $26.68$ and $36.88$ TeV. In the $ep\rightarrow e^{\star}X\rightarrow e\gamma X$ signal process, excited electrons are produced by contact interactions and decay into the photon channel by gauge interactions. Taking into account the corresponding background process, the pseudorapidity and transverse momentum distributions of the final state particles are plotted. We reported the discovery, observation and exclusion mass limits of excited electrons by applying appropriate kinematical cuts best suited for amplify the signal of the excited electron signature. We also investigated the highest achievable values of the compositeness scale for the discovery of excited electrons at these colliders.</description>

      <title>On the (in)consistency of perturbation theory at finite temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02009v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A well-known difficulty of perturbative approaches to quantum field theory at finite temperature is the necessity to address theoretical constraints that are not present in the vacuum theory. In this work, we use lattice simulations of scalar correlation functions in massive $\phi^{4}$ theory to analyse the extent to which these constraints affect the perturbative predictions. We find that the standard perturbative predictions deteriorate even in the absence of infrared divergences at relatively low temperatures, and that this is directly connected to the analytic structure of the propagators used in the expansion. This suggests that the incorporation of non-perturbative thermal effects in the propagators is essential for a consistent perturbative formulation of scalar quantum field theories at finite temperature. By utilising the spectral constraints imposed on finite-temperature correlation functions, we explore how these effects manifest themselves in the lattice data, and discuss why the presence of distinct thermoparticle excitations provides a potential resolution to these issues.</description>

      <title>Muon g-2, Long-Range Muon Spin Force, and Neutrino Oscillations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02084v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent studies have proposed using a geocentric muon spin force to account for the $(g-2)_\mu$ anomaly, with the long-range force mediator being a light axion-like particle. The mediator exhibits a CP-violating scalar coupling to nucleons and a normal derivative coupling to muons. Due to the weak symmetry, this axion inevitably couples to neutrinos, providing potential impact on neutrino oscillations. By utilizing neutrino data from BOREXINO, IceCube DeepCore, Super-Kamiokande, and SNO, we have identified that atmospheric neutrino data can impose stringent constraints on the long-range muon spin force model and the $(g-2)_\mu$ parameter space. Additionally, solar neutrino data places a strong limit on the model but provides a weaker constraint on the $(g-2)_\mu$ parameter space due to a sign mismatch. With optimized data analysis techniques and the potential from future experiments, such as JUNO, Hyper-Kamiokande, SNO+, and IceCube PINGU, there exists a promising opportunity to achieve even greater sensitivities. Indeed, neutrino oscillations offer a robust and distinctive cross-check for the model, offering stringent constraints on the $(g-2)_\mu$ parameter space.</description>

      <title>Searching for a new light gauge boson with axial couplings in muon beam dump experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a formalism for new $U(1)$ interactions involving weak hypercharge, baryon, and lepton numbers, and a possible axial symmetry generator $F_A$ in the presence of a second Brout-Englert-Higgs doublet. The resulting $U$ boson, after mixing with the $Z$, interpolates between a generalised dark photon, a dark $Z$, and an axially coupled gauge boson. We especially focus on the axial couplings originating from $F_A$ or from mixing with the $Z$, determined by the scalar sector via parameters like $\tan\beta$ and the v.e.v. of an extra dark singlet. We explore the distinctive features of axially coupled interactions, especially in the ultrarelativistic limit, where the $U$ boson behaves much as an axion-like particle, with enhanced interactions to quarks and leptons. This enhancement is particularly relevant for future muon beam dump experiments, since the muon mass considerably increases the effective coupling, proportional to $2m_\mu/m_U$, compared to analogous experiments with electrons. We also analyse the shape of the expected beam dump exclusion or discovery regions, influenced by $U$ boson interactions and the experiment geometry. Different situations are considered, limited in particular by cases for which the $U$ decays before reaching the detector, or has too small couplings to produce detectable events. We also compare to vectorially coupled bosons and axion-like pseudoscalars, highlighting the importance of understanding the parameter space for future experiment design and optimisation.</description>

      <title>Intriguing aspects of light baryon resonances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss that some light baryon resonances exhibit properties which cannot be described when attributing a three-valence quark structure to them. Besides pointing out the hadron resonances which clearly require description beyond the quark model, we focus on the third $s_{11},~ N^*$ state and its decay to final states consisting of the lightest hyperon resonances which have a partial width comparable to that for the decay to $\pi N$. Such properties of the mentioned nucleon resonance get manifested in the cross sections and other observables related to processes producing the lightest hyperon resonances. We show that all these findings arise from the strong association of the baryon resonances to the dynamics among the ground-state hadrons.</description>

      <title>Pseudoscalar Higgs plus jet production at Next-to-Next-to-Leading Order in QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a calculation of pseudoscalar Higgs production in association with a jet at Next-to-Next-to Leading Order (NNLO) accuracy in QCD. We work in an effective field theory in which $m_t \rightarrow \infty$ resulting in effective operators which couple the pseudoscalar to gluons and (massless) quarks. We have calculated all of the relevant amplitudes for the two-loop, one-loop and tree-level contributions. As a cross-check of our calculation we have re-calculated all of the scalar Higgs plus parton amplitudes and perform a detailed comparison to the literature. In order to regulate the infra-red singularities present at this order we employ the $N-$jettiness slicing method. In addition to a detailed validation of our calculation at this order we investigate LHC phenomenology for a selection of pseudoscalar Higgs masses. Our results are implemented into the parton-level Monte Carlo code MCFM.</description>

      <title>Unitarity in the non-relativistic regime and implications for dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unitarity sets upper limits on partial-wave elastic and inelastic cross-sections, which are often violated by perturbative computations. We discuss the dynamics underlying these limits in the non-relativistic regime, namely long-range interactions, and show how the resummation of the elastic 2-particle-irreducible diagrams arising from squaring inelastic processes unitarizes inelastic cross-sections. Our results are model-independent, apply to all partial waves, and affect elastic and inelastic cross-sections, with extensive implications for new physics scenarios, including dark-matter freeze-out and self-interactions.</description>

      <title>QCD analysis of valence structure functions using deep inelastic lepton-nucleon scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02254v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new ''$\mathtt{SK24}$'' non-singlet QCD analysis of the structure functions at the NNLO approximation is performed, utilizing the global fit of the data from various charged lepton scattering experiments. We extract the valence parton distribution functions (PDFs) and provide a parametrization of them, along with the correlated errors for a wide range of $x$ and $Q^2$. We compare valence PDFs and their uncertainties with those from different PDF sets provided by various groups. We also obtain valence PDFs and the strong coupling constant $\alpha_{s}(M_Z^2)$, taking into account the nuclear correction concerning large $x$ as well as the target mass correction (TMC) and higher twist (HT) effects at the NNLO. In the large $x$ region, we extract the higher twist contributions of $xF_3(x,Q^2)$, $F_2^p (x,Q^2)$, and $F_2^d(x,Q^2)$. We determine $\alpha_{s}(M_Z^2)$ without and with considering the TMC and HT corrections and perform a comparison with the world average of $\alpha_{s}(M_Z^2)$ and other reported results. The extracted results concerning valence PDFs with their uncertainties and $\alpha_{s}(M_Z^2)$ value agree with available theoretical models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.16933v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Discrete flavor symmetries provide a promising approach to understand the flavor sector of the standard model of particle physics. Top-down (TD) explanations from string theory reveal two different types of such flavor symmetries: traditional and modular flavor symmetries that combine to the eclectic flavor group. There have been many bottom-up (BU) constructions to fit experimental data within this scheme. We compare TD and BU constructions to identify the most promising groups and try to give a unified description. Although there is some progress in joining BU and TD approaches, we point out some gaps that have to be closed with future model building.</description>

      <title>Mineral Detection of Neutrinos and Dark Matter 2024. Proceedings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01626v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The second "Mineral Detection of Neutrinos and Dark Matter" (MDvDM'24) meeting was held January 8-11, 2024 in Arlington, VA, USA, hosted by Virginia Tech's Center for Neutrino Physics. This document collects contributions from this workshop, providing an overview of activities in the field. MDvDM'24 was the second topical workshop dedicated to the emerging field of mineral detection of neutrinos and dark matter, following a meeting hosted by IFPU in Trieste, Italy in October 2022. Mineral detectors have been proposed for a wide variety of applications, including searching for dark matter, measuring various fluxes of astrophysical neutrinos over gigayear timescales, monitoring nuclear reactors, and nuclear disarmament protocols; both as paleo-detectors using natural minerals that could have recorded the traces of nuclear recoils for timescales as long as a billion years and as detectors recording nuclear recoil events on laboratory timescales using natural or artificial minerals. Contributions to this proceedings discuss the vast physics potential, the progress in experimental studies, and the numerous challenges lying ahead on the path towards mineral detection. These include a better understanding of the formation and annealing of recoil defects in crystals; identifying the best classes of minerals and, for paleo-detectors, understanding their geology; modeling and control of the relevant backgrounds; developing, combining, and scaling up imaging and data analysis techniques; and many others. During the last years, MDvDM has grown rapidly and gained attention. Small-scale experimental efforts focused on establishing various microscopic readout techniques are underway at institutions in North America, Europe and Asia. We are looking ahead to an exciting future full of challenges to overcome, surprises to be encountered, and discoveries lying ahead of us.</description>

      <title>Constraints on conformal ultralight dark matter couplings from the European Pulsar Timing Array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01633v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Millisecond pulsars are extremely precise celestial clocks: as they rotate, the beamed radio waves emitted along the axis of their magnetic field can be detected with radio telescopes, which allows for tracking subtle changes in the pulsars' rotation periods. A possible effect on the period of a pulsar is given by a potential coupling to dark matter, in cases where it is modeled with an "ultralight" scalar field. In this paper, we consider a universal conformal coupling of the dark matter scalar to gravity, which in turn mediates an effective coupling between pulsars and dark matter. If the dark matter scalar field is changing in time, as expected in the Milky Way, this effective coupling produces a periodic modulation of the pulsar rotational frequency. By studying the time series of observed radio pulses collected by the European Pulsar Timing Array experiment, we present constraints on the coupling of dark matter, improving on existing bounds. These bounds can also be regarded as constraints on the parameters of scalar-tensor theories of the Fierz-Jordan-Brans-Dicke and Damour-Esposito-Far\`{e}se types in the presence of a (light) mass potential term.</description>

      <title>Ab initio calculation of hyper-neutron matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01887v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The equation of state (EoS) of neutron matter plays a decisive role in our understanding of the properties of neutron stars as well as the generation of gravitational waves in neutron star mergers. At sufficient densities, it is known that the appearance of hyperons generally softens the EoS, thus leading to a reduction in the maximum mass of neutron stars well below the observed values of about 2 solar masses. Even though repulsive three-body forces are known to solve this so-called "hyperon puzzle", so far performing \textit{ab initio} calculations with a substantial number of hyperons has remained elusive. In this work, we address this challenge by employing simulations based on Nuclear Lattice Effective Field Theory with up to 232 neutrons (pure neutron matter) and up to 116 $\Lambda$ hyperons (hyper-neutron matter) in a finite volume. We introduce a novel auxiliary field quantum Monte Carlo algorithm, allowing us to simulate for both pure neutron matter and hyper-neutron matter systems up to 5 times the density of nuclear matter using a single auxiliary field without any sign oscillations. Also, for the first time in {\em ab initio} calculations, we not only include $N\Lambda$ two-body and $NN\Lambda$ three-body forces, but also $\Lambda\Lambda$ and $N \Lambda\Lambda$ interactions. Consequently, we determine essential astrophysical quantities such as the mass-radius relation, the speed of sound and the tidal deformability of neutron stars. Our findings also confirm the existence of the $I$-Love-$Q$ relation, which gives access to the moment of inertia of the neutron star.</description>

      <title>Bubble wall velocity and gravitational wave in the minimal left-right symmetric model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01949v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The bubble wall velocity in the first order phase transition plays an important role in determining both the amplitude and the pivot frequency of stochastic gravitational wave background. In the framework of the minimal left-right symmetric model, we study the wall velocity when the first order phase transition can occur. The wall velocity can be determined by matching the distribution functions in the free particle approximation and the local thermal equilibrium approximation. It is found that the wall velocity can be determined in the range $ 0.2 &lt; v_w &lt; 0.5 $ for the parameter space with the first order phase transition. It is also found that for the case when the wall velocity is close to the speed of sound, the peak amplitude of gravitational wave spectrum can be larger than that in the runaway case. Moreover, It is also found that there exists an approximate power law between the wall velocity and pressure difference between broken and symmetry phases, and the power index is equal to 0.41 or so.</description>

      <title>Relic gravitons and non-stationary processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02193v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stationary processes do not accurately describe the diffuse backgrounds of relic gravitons whose correlations are homogeneous in space (i.e. only dependent upon the distance between the two spatial locations) but not in time. The symmetries of the autocorrelations ultimately reflect the quantum mechanical origin of the diffuse backgrounds and lead to non-stationary observables at late time. In particular, large oscillations are believed to arise in the spectral energy density that is customarily (but approximately) related to the tensor power spectrum. When the full expression of the spectral energy density is employed the amplitudes of oscillation are instead suppressed in the large-scale limit and the non-stationary features of the late-time signal practically disappear. For similar reasons the relations between the spectral energy density and the spectral amplitude are ambiguous in the presence of non-stationary features. While it is debatable if the non-stationary features are (or will be) directly detectable, we argue that the spectral amplitude following from the Wiener-Khintchine theorem is generally inappropriate for a consistent description of the relic signal. Nevertheless the strong oscillatory behaviour of the late-time observables is naturally smeared out provided the spectral energy density is selected as pivotal variable.</description>

      <title>Lectures on Resurgence in Integrable Field Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02224v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There has been recently considerable progress in understanding the nature of perturbation theory in UV free and gapped $2d$ integrable field theories with renormalon singularities. Thanks to Bethe ansatz and large $N$ techniques, non-perturbative corrections can also be computed and lead to the reconstruction of the trans-series for the free energy in presence of a chemical potential. This is an ideal arena to test resurgence in QFT and determine if and how the exact result can be reconstructed from the knowledge of the perturbative series only. In these notes we give a pedagogical introduction to this subject starting from the basics. In the first lecture we give an overview of applications in QFT of Borel resummations before the advent of resurgence. The second lecture introduces the key concepts of resurgence and finally in the third lecture we discuss a specific application in the context of the principal chiral field model. Extended version of three lectures given at IHES and review talks given at Les Diablerets and Mainz, in 2023.</description>

Abstract: We study multi-particle azimuthal correlations in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 200$ GeV. We use initial conditions obtained from a Monte-Carlo Glauber model and evolve them within a viscous relativistic hydrodynamics framework that eventually gives way to a transport model in the late hadronic stage of the evolution. We compute the multi-particle symmetric and asymmetric cumulants and present the results for their sensitivity to the shear and bulk viscosities during the hydrodynamic evolution. We show that these observables are more sensitive to the transport coefficients than the traditional flow observables.</description>

      <title>Cubic color charge correlator in a proton made of three quarks and a gluon</title>

      <description>arXiv:2106.12623v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The three point correlation function of color charge densities is evaluated explicitly in light cone gauge for a proton on the light cone. This includes both $C$-conjugation even and odd contributions. We account for perturbative corrections to the three-quark light cone wave function due to the emission of an internal gluon which is not required to be soft. We verify the Ward identity as well as the cancellation of UV divergences in the sum of all diagrams so that the correlator is independent of the renormalization scale. It does, however, exhibit the well known soft and collinear singularities. The expressions derived here provide the $C$-odd contribution to the initial conditions for high-energy evolution of the dipole scattering amplitude to small $x$. Finally, we also present a numerical model estimate of the impact parameter dependence of quantum color charge three-point correlations in the proton at moderately small $x$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2203.05889v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide a roadmap for analyzing the interplay between hypothetical future collider observations and the detection of a gravitational wave signal produced by a strong first order electroweak phase transition in beyond the Standard Model (BSM) theories. A cornerstone of this roadmap is a combination of a dimensionally reduced, three-dimensional effective field theory and results of both perturbation theory and non-perturbative lattice simulations. For the first time we apply these state-of-the-art methods to a comprehensive parameter space scan of a BSM theory. Concretely, we study an extension with the real scalar triplet, which admits a possible two-step electroweak symmetry-breaking thermal history. We find that (1) a first order transition during the second step could generate a signal accessible to LISA generation detectors and (2) the gravitational wave signal displays a strong sensitivity to the portal coupling between the new scalar and the Higgs boson, and (3) the ability for future experiments to detect the produced gravitational waves depends decisively on the wall velocity of the bubbles produced during the phase transition. We illustrate how a combination of direct and indirect measurements of the new scalar properties, in combination with the presence or absence of a gravitational wave detection, could test the model and identify the values of the model parameters.</description>

      <title>ALP Dark Matter Mini-Clusters from Kinetic Fragmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.10111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.10111v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that very compact axion mini-clusters can form in models where axion-like-particle (ALP) dark matter is produced via the kinetic misalignment mechanism, which is well-motivated in pre-inflationary $U(1)$ symmetry breaking scenarios. This is due to ALP fragmentation. We predict denser halos than what has been obtained so far in the literature from standard misalignment in post-inflationary $U(1)$ breaking scenarios or from large misalignment. The main reason is that adiabatic fluctuations are significant at early times; therefore, even if amplification from parametric resonance effects is moderate, the final size of ALP fluctuations is larger in kinetic misalignment. We compare halo mass functions and halo spectra obtained in kinetic misalignment, large misalignment, and standard misalignment, respectively. Our analysis does not depend on the specific model realization of the kinetic misalignment mechanism. We present our results generally as a function of the ALP mass and the ALP decay constant only. We show that a sizable region of this ALP parameter space can be tested by future experiments that probe small-scale structures.</description>

      <title>LiteBIRD and CMB-S4 Sensitivities to Reheating in Plateau Models of Inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.13503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.13503v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the sensitivity of LiteBIRD and CMB-S4 to the reheating temperature and the inflaton coupling in three types of plateau-potential models of inflation, namely mutated hilltop inflation, radion gauge inflation, and $\alpha$-attractor T models. We first find relations between model parameters and CMB observables in all models. We then perform Monte Carlo Markov Chain based forecasts to quantify the information gain on the reheating temperature, the inflaton coupling, and the scale of inflation that can be achieved with LiteBIRD and CMB-S4, assuming a fiducial tensor-to-scalar ratio $\bar{r} \sim 0.02$ and neglecting foreground contamination of the B-mode polarization spectrum. We compare the results of the forecasts to those obtained from a recently proposed simple analytic method. We find that both LiteBIRD and CMB-S4 can simultaneously constrain the scale of inflation and the reheating temperature in all three types of models. They can for the first time obtain both an upper and lower bound on the latter, comprising the first ever measurement of the big bang temperature. In the mutated hilltop inflation and radion gauge inflation models this can be translated into a measurement of the inflaton coupling in parts of the parameter space. Constraining this microphysical parameter will help to understand how these models of inflation may be embedded into a more fundamental theory of particle physics.</description>

      <title>Explanation of the Hints for a 95 GeV Higgs Boson within a 2-Higgs Doublet Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.09029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.09029v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We suggest an explanation for and explore the consequences of the excess around 95 GeV in the di-photon and di-tau invariant mass distributions recently reported by the CMS collaboration at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), together with the discrepancy that has long been observed at the Large Electron-Positron (LEP) collider in the $b\bar b$ invariant mass. Interestingly, the most recent findings announced by the ATLAS collaboration do not contradict, or even support, these intriguing observations. Their search in the di-photon final state similarly reveals an excess of events within the same mass range, albeit with a bit lower significance, thereby corroborating and somewhat reinforcing the observations made by CMS. We demonstrate that the lightest CP-even Higgs boson in the general 2-Higgs Doublet Model (2HDM) Type-III can explain simultaneously the observed excesses at approximately 1.3 $\sigma$ C.L. while satisfying up-to-date theoretical and experimental constraints. Moreover, the 2HDM Type-III predicts an excess in the $pp\to t\bar t H_{\rm SM}$ production channel of the 125 GeV Higgs boson, $H_{\rm SM}$. This effect is caused by a up to 12\% enhancement of the $H_{\rm SM}tt$ Yukawa coupling in comparison to that predicted by the Standard Model. Such an effect can be tested at the High Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC), which can either discover or exclude the scenario we suggest. This unique characteristic of the 2HDM Type-III makes this scenario with the 95 GeV resonance very attractive for further theoretical and experimental investigations at the (HL-)LHC and future colliders.</description>

      <title>The effective potential of composite operator in the first order region of QCD phase transition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.00382v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a method to determine the effective potential of QCD from the gap equation, by introducing the homotopy method between the solutions of the equation of motion. Via this method, the effective potential beyond the bare vertex approximation is obtained, which then generalizes the Cornwall, Jackiw and Tomboulis (CJT) effective potential for the bilocal composite operators. Moreover, the extended effective potential is set to be a function of self energy instead of the propagator, which is the key point for the potential to be bounded from below. We then investigate the extended effective potential in the cases of phase transition of the QCD vacuum with a small current quark mass, and the first-order phase transition of QCD at finite temperature and high baryon chemical potential. In the former case, the effective potential shows as an inflection point at the critical mass where the multiple solutions of the Dyson-Schwinger equation (DSE) vanishes, which is consistent with that obtained by solving the DSE directly. For the latter case, the in-medium properties, such as the latent heat and the difference of trace anomaly, of QCD is obtained.</description>

Abstract: The Nonrelativistic Effective Theory (NRET) is widely used in dark matter direct detection and charged-lepton flavor violation studies through $\mu \to e$ conversion. However, existing literature has not fully considered tensor couplings. This study bridges this gap by utilizing an innovative tensor decomposition method, extending NRET to incorporate previously overlooked tensor interactions. We find additional operators in the $\mu \to e$ conversion that are not present in the scalar and vector couplings. This development is expected to have a significant impact on ongoing experiments seeking physics beyond the Standard Model and on our understanding of the new-physics interactions. To support further research and experimental analyses, comprehensive tables featuring tensor matrix elements and their corresponding operators are provided.</description>

      <title>Exotic tetraquarks at the HL-LHC with JETHAD: A high-energy viewpoint</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.15639v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We review the semi-inclusive hadroproduction of a neutral hidden-flavor tetraquark with light and heavy quark flavor at the HL-LHC, accompanied by another heavy hadron or a light-flavored jet. We make use of the novel TQHL1.0 determinations of leading-twist fragmentation functions to describe the formation mechanism of a tetraquark state within the next-to-leading order perturbative QCD. This framework builds on the basis of a spin-physics inspired model, taken as a proxy for the lowest-scale input of the constituent heavy-quark fragmentation channel. Then, all parton-to-tetraquark fragmentation functions are consistently obtained via the above-threshold DGLAP evolution in a variable-flavor number scheme. We provide predictions for a series of differential distributions calculated by the hands of the JETHAD method well-adapted to NLL/NLO+ hybrid-factorization studies, where the resummation of next-to-leading energy logarithms and beyond is included in the collinear picture. We provide corroborating evidence that high-energy observables sensitive to semi-inclusive tetraquark emissions at the HL-LHC exhibit a fair stability under radiative corrections as well as MHOU studies. Our analysis constitutes a prime contact point between QCD resummations and the exotic matter.</description>

Abstract: We demonstrate that it is not necessary to substantially break the mass degeneracy between the Standard Model Higgs boson doublet and the corresponding scalar leptoquark, where these two fields comprise a single five-dimensional $SU(5)$ representation. More precisely, we show that the experimental data on partial proton decay lifetimes cannot place any meaningful bound on the mass of the scalar leptoquark, a.k.a. the color triplet, if one includes effects of higher-dimensional operators within the Georgi-Glashow model. We also point out that the complete suppression of proton decay via the scalar leptoquark mediation is compatible with the partial suppression of the gauge mediated two-body proton decay signatures. Finally, we derive a proper limit on the cutoff scale of the aforementioned higher-dimensional operators and outline how this scenario could be tested.</description>

Abstract: Ultra-light dark matter is a class of dark matter models where the mass of the dark matter particle is very small and the dark matter behaves as a classical field pervading our galaxy. If astrophysical neutrinos interact with ultra-light dark matter, these interactions would produce a matter potential in our galaxy which may cause anomalous flavor conversions. Recently, IceCube high-energy starting event flavor measurements are used to set stringent limits on isotropic Lorentz violating fields under the Standard-Model Extension framework. We apply the IceCube Lorentz violation limits to set limits on neutrino - ultra-light dark matter couplings. We assume the dark matter field undergoes fast oscillations in our galaxy, yielding neutrino interactions with dark matter that broaden and smear the observed flavor structure of astrophysical neutrinos at IceCube. The constraints we obtain are an order of magnitude tighter than current and future terrestrial neutrino experimental limits. The sensitivity of ultra-light dark matter can be further improved in the near future by new particle identification algorithms in IceCube and the emergence of next-generation neutrino telescopes.</description>

      <title>The effects of Lorentz violation on unitarity in $e^{+}e^{-} \rightarrow \mu^{+}\mu^{-}$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18157v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigated two distinct models incorporating LIV with nonminimal coupling in scattering processes of $e^+e^- \rightarrow \mu^+\mu^-$. We verified that employing the model with dual electromagnetic tensor $(\tilde{F}_{\mu\nu})$ led to violations of unitarity in both vector and axial scenarios. Conversely, utilizing the model with nonminimal coupling with $(F_{\mu\nu})$ preserved unitarity in both vector and axial cases. Consequently, this could hold promising implications, considering that the nonminimal coupling model with dual electromagnetic tensor $\tilde {F}_{\mu\nu}$ appeared potentially superior to the electromagnetic tensor $F_{\mu\nu}$. Hence, we anticipate that these findings might offer a valuable roadmap for further exploration into the investigation of CPT and Lorentz breaking phenomena, with phenomenological implications that are certainly not trivial.</description>

      <title>Automatic generation of helicity amplitudes in Feynman-Diagram gauge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01256v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a method to calculate helicity amplitudes of an arbitrary tree-level process in Feynman-Diagram (FD) gauge for an arbitrary gauge model with MadGraph5_aMC@NLO. We start from the 't Hooft-Feynman gauge Lagrangian in FeynRules and generate scattering amplitudes by identifying the Goldstone boson as the $5^{\rm th}$ component of each weak boson. All the vertices of the 5-component weak bosons are then created automatically by assembling the relevant weak boson and Goldstone boson vertices in the Feynman gauge. The 5-component weak boson vertices are then connected by the $5\times5$ matrix propagator in the FD gauge. As a demonstration of the method we calculate the cross section for the process $\mu^-\mu^+\to\nu_\mu\bar{\nu}_\mu t\bar{t}H$ with complex top Yukawa coupling, which can be obtained by adding a gauge invariant dimension-6 operator to the Standard Model (SM) Lagrangian. The FD gauge and the unitary (U) gauge amplitudes give exactly the same cross section, and subtle gauge theory cancellation among diagrams in the U gauge at high energies is absent in the FD gauge, as has been observed for various SM processes. In addition, we find that the total cross sections at high energies are dominated by a single, or a set of non-vanishing Feynman amplitudes with the higher dimensional vertices in the FD gauge.</description>

      <title>Complexity in Tame Quantum Theories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.01484v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inspired by the notion that physical systems can contain only a finite amount of information or complexity, we introduce a framework that allows for quantifying the amount of logical information needed to specify a function or set. We then apply this methodology to a variety of physical systems and derive the complexity of parameter-dependent physical observables and coupling functions appearing in effective Lagrangians. In order to implement these ideas, it is essential to consider physical theories that can be defined in an o-minimal structure. O-minimality, a concept from mathematical logic, encapsulates a tameness principle. It was recently argued that this property is inherent to many known quantum field theories and is linked to the UV completion of the theory. To assign a complexity to each statement in these theories one has to further constrain the allowed o-minimal structures. To exemplify this, we show that many physical systems can be formulated using Pfaffian o-minimal structures, which have a well-established notion of complexity. More generally, we propose adopting sharply o-minimal structures, recently introduced by Binyamini and Novikov, as an overarching framework to measure complexity in quantum theories.</description>

      <title>Dissecting the Stochastic Gravitational Wave Background with Astrometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.03069v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Astrometry, the precise measurement of star motions, offers an alternative avenue to investigate low-frequency gravitational waves through the spatial deflection of photons, complementing pulsar timing arrays reliant on timing residuals. Upcoming data from Gaia and Roman can not only cross-check pulsar timing array findings but also explore the uncharted frequency range bridging pulsar timing arrays and LISA. We present an analytical framework to evaluate the feasibility of detecting a gravitational wave background, considering measurement noise and the intrinsic variability of the stochastic background. Furthermore, we highlight astrometry's crucial role in uncovering key properties of the gravitational wave background, such as spectral index and chirality, employing information-matrix analysis. Finally, we simulate the emergence of quadrupolar correlations, commonly referred to as the generalized Hellings-Downs curves.</description>

      <title>Kaluza-Klein tower and bubble nucleation in six dimensional Einstein-Maxwell theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.03184v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the implication of the distance and the cobordism conjecture on the 6-dimensional Einstein-Maxwell theory compactified on $S^2$. In this toy model, the radion potential is stabilized by the conspiracy of the curvature of $S^2$ and the flux through $S^2$ parametrized by $f$, and uplifted by the positive 6-dimensional cosmological constant parametrized by $\lambda$. When $\lambda=0$, the radion is stabilized at the anti-de Sitter (AdS) vacuum, which cannot be interpolated to the Minkowski vacuum since the Kaluza-Klein (KK) tower descends from UV in the vanishing limit of the 4-dimensional cosmological constant. For nonzero $\lambda$ which realizes the metastable de Sitter (dS) vacuum, as well as the AdS and the Minkowski vacuum, such an obstruction can be found provided the combination $f^2\lambda$ is fixed and the limit $\lambda\to 0$ is taken. Moreover, the 6-dimensional Einstein-Maxwell theory allows the transition between vacua through the nucleation of the bubble. In this case, the values of the 4-dimensional cosmological constant inside and outside the bubble are different as $f$ is changed at the bubble wall, while $\lambda$ remains unchanged. Regarding the AdS vacuum with the vanishing curvature radius as the `nothing', we find that the transition from the metastable dS vacuum to the nothing is not prevented by the descent of the KK tower since $f^2\lambda$ is not fixed.</description>

      <title>A nonperturbative test of nucleation calculations for strong phase transitions</title>

Abstract: Nucleation rate computations are of broad importance in particle physics and cosmology. Perturbative calculations are often used to compute the nucleation rate $\Gamma$, but these are incomplete. We perform nonperturbative lattice simulations of nucleation in a scalar field theory with a tree-level barrier, computing a final result extrapolated to the thermodynamic and continuum limits. Although the system in question should be well-described by a complete one-loop perturbative calculation, we find only qualitative agreement with the full perturbative result, with a 20% discrepancy in $|\log \Gamma|$. Our result motivates further testing of the current nucleation paradigm.</description>

      <title>Global data-driven determination of baryon transition form factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17444v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hadronic resonances emerge from strong interactions encoding the dynamics of quarks and gluons. The structure of these resonances can be probed by virtual photons parameterized in transition form factors. In this study, twelve $N^*$ and $\Delta$ transition form factors at the pole are extracted from data with the center-of-mass energy from $\pi N$ threshold to $1.8\,{\rm GeV}$, and the photon virtuality $0\leq Q^2/{\rm GeV}^2\leq 8$. For the first time, these results are determined from a simultaneous analysis of more than one state, i.e., $\sim 10^5$ $\pi N$, $\eta N$, and $K\Lambda$ electroproduction data. In addition, about $ 5\cdot 10^4$ data in the hadronic sector as well as photoproduction serve as boundary conditions. For the $\Delta(1232)$ and $N(1440)$ states our results are in qualitative agreement with previous studies, while the transition form factors at the poles of some higher excited states are estimated for the first time. Realistic uncertainties are determined by further exploring the parameter space.</description>
