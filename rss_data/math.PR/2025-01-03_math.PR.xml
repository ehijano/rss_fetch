      <title>Notes on stochastic integration theory with respect to c\`adl\`ag semimartingales and a brief introduction to L\'evy processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00140v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The purpose of these notes is to distribute, mostly without proofs, fundamental definitions and results concerning the theory of semimartingales and stochastic integration. The material serves as a foundational guide for those interested in applying these concepts, particularly in the study of stochastic (functional) differential equations driven by L\'evy processes. These notes are adapted from the preliminary chapter of the author's master's thesis (with only minor changes) and are intended to introduce newcomers to the essentials of c\`adl\`ag semimartingale theory while also discussing the advantages, limitations, and subtleties as compared to stochastic integration in the continuous setting.</description>

      <title>Eigenvalue gaps of the Laplacian of random graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that, with very high probability, the random graph Laplacian has simple spectrum. Our method provides a quantitatively effective estimate of the spectral gaps. Along the way, we establish results on affine no-gaps delocalization, no-structure delocalization, overcrowding and small entries of the eigenvectors for the Laplacian model. These findings are of independent interest.</description>

      <title>On a population model with memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider first a memoryless population model described by the usual branching process with a given mean reproduction matrix on a finite space of types. Motivated by the consequences of atavism in Evolutionary Biology, we are interested in a modification of the dynamics where individuals keep full memory of their forebears and procreation involves the reactivation of a gene picked at random on the ancestral lineage. By comparing the spectral radii of the two mean reproduction matrices (with and without memory), we observe that, on average, the model with memory always grows at least as fast as the model without memory. The proof relies on analyzing a biased Markov chain on the space of memories, and the existence of a unique ergodic law is demonstrated through asymptotic coupling.</description>

      <title>Multitype $\Lambda$-coalescents and continuous state branching processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00329v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide new connections between multitype $\Lambda$-coalescents and multitype continuous state branching processes via duality and a homeomorphism on their parameter space. The approach is based on a sequential sampling procedure for the frequency process of independent CSBPs, and provides forward and backward processes for multitype population models under $\Lambda$-type reproduction. It provides some insight on different approaches to generalise $\Lambda$-coalescents to the multitype setup.</description>

      <title>Superdiffusive Central Limit Theorem for the Stochastic Burgers Equation at the critical dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00344v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Stochastic Burgers Equation (SBE) is a singular, non-linear Stochastic Partial Differential Equation (SPDE) that describes, on mesoscopic scales, the fluctuations of stochastic driven diffusive systems with a conserved scalar quantity. In space dimension d = 2, the SBE is critical, being formally scale invariant under diffusive scaling. As such, it falls outside of the domain of applicability of the theories of Regularity Structures and paracontrolled calculus. In apparent contrast with the formal scale invariance, we fully prove the conjecture first appeared in [H. van Beijeren, R. Kutner, &amp; H. Spohn, Phys. Rev. Lett., 1986] according to which the 2d-SBE is logarithmically superdiffusive, i.e. its diffusion coefficient diverges like $(\log t)^{2/3}$ as $t\to\infty$, thus removing subleading diverging multiplicative corrections in [D. De Gaspari &amp; L. Haunschmid-Sibitz, Electron. J. Probab., 2024] and in [H.-T. Yau, Ann. of Math., 2004] for 2d-ASEP. We precisely identify the constant prefactor of the logarithm and show it is proportional to $\lambda^{4/3}$, for $\lambda&gt;0$ the coupling constant, which, intriguingly, turns out to be exactly the same as for the one-dimensional Stochastic Burgers/KPZ equation. More importantly, we prove that, under super-diffusive space-time rescaling, the SBE has an explicit Gaussian fixed point in the Renormalization Group sense, by deriving a superdiffusive central limit-type theorem for its solution.
  This is the first scaling limit result for a critical singular SPDE, beyond the weak coupling regime, and is obtained via a refined control, on all length-scales, of the resolvent of the generator of the SBE. We believe our methods are well-suited to study other out-of-equilibrium driven diffusive systems at the critical dimension, such as 2d-ASEP, which, we conjecture, have the same large-scale Fixed Point as SBE.</description>

      <title>Applications of the Quantile-Based Probabilistic Mean Value Theorem to Distorted Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Distorted distributions were introduced in the context of actuarial science for several variety of insurance problems. In this paper we consider the quantile-based probabilistic mean value theorem given in Di Crescenzo et al. [4] and provide some applications based on distorted random variables. Specifically, we consider the cases when the underlying random variables satisfy the proportional hazard rate model and the proportional reversed hazard rate model. A setting based on random variables having the 'new better than used' property is also analyzed.</description>

      <title>Large time analysis of the rate function associated to the Boltzmann equation: dynamical phase transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyse the large time behaviour of the rate function that describes the probability of large fluctuations of an underlying microscopic model associated to the homogeneous Boltzmann equation, such as the Kac walk. We consider in particular the asymptotic of the number of collisions, per particle and per unit of time, and show it exhibits a phase transition in the joint limit in which the number of particles N and the time interval [0,T] diverge. More precisely, due to the existence of Lu-Wennberg solutions, the corresponding limiting rate function vanishes for subtypical values of the number of collisions. We also analyse the second order large deviations showing that the probability of subtypical fluctuations is exponentially small in N, independently on T. As a key point, we establish the controllability of the homogeneous Boltzmann equation.</description>

      <title>Poincare Inequality for Local Log-Polyak-Lojasiewicz Measures: Non-asymptotic Analysis in Low-temperature Regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00429v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish the Poincar\'e inequality (PI) for a class of Gibbs measures of the form $\mu_\epsilon \propto \exp(-V/\epsilon)$, where the potential $V$ satisfies a local Polyak-{\L}ojasiewicz (PL) inequality, and its set of local minima is \emph{connected}. Our results hold for sufficiently small temperature parameters $\epsilon$. Notably, the potential $V$ can exhibit local maxima, and its optimal set may be \emph{non-simply connected}, distinguishing our function class from the convex setting. We consider two scenarios for the optimal set $S$: (1) $S$ has interior in $\mathbb{R}^d$ with a Lipschitz boundary, and (2) $S$ is a compact $\mathcal{C}^2$ embedding submanifold of $\mathbb{R}^d$ without boundary. In these cases, the Poincar\'e constant is bounded below by the spectral properties of differential operators on $S$--specifically, the smallest Neumann eigenvalue of the Laplacian in the first case and the smallest eigenvalue of the Laplace-Beltrami operator in the second. These quantities are temperature-independent. As a direct consequence, we show that Langevin dynamics with the non-convex potential $V$ and diffusion coefficient $\epsilon$ converges to its equilibrium $\mu_\epsilon$ at a rate of $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(1/\epsilon)$, provided $\epsilon$ is sufficiently small. Here $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}$ hides logarithmic terms. Our proof leverages the Lyapunov function approach introduced by Bakry et al. [2008a], reducing the verification of the PI to the stability of the spectral gap of the Laplacian (or Laplacian-Beltrami) operator on $S$ under domain expansion. We establish this stability through carefully designed expansion schemes, which is key to our results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.00445v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a pinning model in correlated Gaussian random environments. For the model that is disorder relevant, we study its intermediate disorder regime and show that the rescaled partition functions converge to a non-trivial continuum limit in the Skorohod setting and in the Stratonovich setting, respectively. Our results partially confirm the prediction of Weinrib and Halperin for disorder relevance/irrelevance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.00458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We obtain assumption-free, non-asymptotic, uniform bounds on the product of the height and the width of uniformly random trees with a given degree sequence, conditioned Bienaym\'e trees and simply generated trees. We show that for a tree of size $n$, this product is $O(n \log n)$ in probability, answering a question by Addario-Berry (2019). The order of this bound is tight in this generality.</description>

      <title>Stationary properties of the Gauss-Galerkin QMoM truncation of MV-SDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00605v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Gauss Galerkin Method/Quadrature method of moments (GG-QMoM) closure scheme, introduced by Dawson, closes a truncated set of moment equations of an SDE by a Galerkin approximation of its law in the space of probability measures. Here, results are presented on stationary solutions of the closed equations, irrespective of the number of moments retained (hence not dependent on the convergence theorem). These are applied to polynomial MV-SDEs, with explicit dependence on its moments in the drift, which can possess multiple stationary solutions. Particularly, we show in the deterministic limit, there are as many stationary solutions as extrema of the potential (critically, not just the minima), preserving the bifurcation diagram of the full equations. Further, a scaling property of solutions is proven, allowing changes of stability to be directly probed. Finally, this is applied to the GG-QMoM truncation of Dawson-Shiino model, whose stationary measures and change in stability has been previously studied.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.00671v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider $d+2$ i.i.d. random points $X_1,\ldots, X_{d+2}$ in $\mathbb R^d$. In this short note we compute the probability that their convex hull is a simplex in the following three cases: (i) the distribution of $X_1$ is multivariate standard normal; (ii) the density of $X_1$ is proportional to $(1-\|x\|^2)^{\beta}$ on the unit ball (beta distribution); (iii) the density of $X_1$ is proportional to $(1+\|x\|^2)^{-\beta}$ (beta prime distribution). In the normal case, the above probability is twice the sum of solid angles of a regular $(d+1)$-dimensional simplex.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00719v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose and study a system of Schr\"odinger's problems and functional equations in probability theory. More precisely, we consider a system of variational problems of relative entropies for probability measures with given two endpoint marginals, which can be defined inductively. We also consider an inductively defined system of functional equations, which are Euler's equations for our variational problems. These are generalizations of Schr\"odinger's problem and functional equation in probability theory. We prove the existence and uniqueness of solutions to our functional equations up to a multiplicative function, from which we show the existence and uniqueness of a minimizer of our variational problem. Our problem gives an approach for a stochastic optimal transport analog of the Knothe--Rosenblatt rearrangement from a variational problem point of view.</description>

Abstract: In this note, we study the Macroscopic Hausdorff dimension on the upper and lower level sets of the Airy$_1$ process, following the general approach developed in Khoshnevisan et al. \cite{KKX17}. The proofs of the main results hinge on some inequalities for the joint probabilities of the Airy$_1$ process and the estimates of the tail probabilities of its maximum and minimum over an interval.</description>

      <title>Central limit theorem for random walks in divergence free random drift field -- revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00897v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In [Kozma-Toth, Ann. Probab. v 45, pp 4307-4347 (2017)] the weak CLT was established for random walks in doubly stochastic (or, divergence-free) random environments, under the following conditions: 1. Strict ellipticity assumed for the symmetric part of the drift field. 2. $H_{-1}$ assumed for the antisymmetric part of the drift field.
  The proof relied on a martingale approximation (a la Kipnis-Varadhan) adapted to the non-self-adjoint and non-sectorial nature of the problem. The two substantial technical components of the proof were: 1. A functional analytic statement about the unbounded operator formally written as $|L+L^*|^{-1/2}(L-L^*)|L+L^*|^{-1/2}$, where $L$ is the infinitesimal generator of the environment process, as seen from the position of the moving random walker. 2. A diagonal heat kernel upper bound which follows directly from Nash's inequality, or, alternatively, from the "evolving sets" arguments of [Morris-Peres, Probab. Theory Rel. Fields. v. 133 pp 245-266 (2005)] valid only under the assumed strict ellipticity.
  In this note we present a partly alternative proof of the same result which relies only on functional analytic arguments and not on the diagonal heat kernel upper bound provided by Nash's inequality. This alternative proof is relevant since it can be naturally extended to non-elliptic settings pushed to the optimum, which will be presented in a forthcoming paper. The goal of this note is to present the argument in its simplest and most transparent form.</description>

      <title>An upper tail field of the KPZ fixed point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00932v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The KPZ fixed point is a (1+1)-dimensional space-time random field conjectured to be the universal limit for models within the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) universality class. We consider the KPZ fixed point with the narrow-wedge initial condition, conditioning on a large value at a specific point. By zooming in the neighborhood of this high point appropriately, we obtain a limiting random field which we call an upper tail field of the KPZ fixed point. Different from the KPZ fixed point, where the time parameter has to be nonnegative, the upper tail field is defined in the full $2$-dimensional space. Especially, if we zoom out the upper tail field appropriately, it behaves like a Brownian-type field in the negative time regime, and the KPZ fixed point in the positive time regime. One main ingredient of the proof is an upper tail estimate of the joint tail probability functions of the KPZ fixed point near the given point, which generalizes the well know one-point upper tail estimate of the GUE Tracy-Widom distribution.</description>

      <title>Spectral radius concentration for inhomogeneous random matrices with independent entries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01079v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $A$ be a square random matrix of size $n$, with mean zero, independent but not identically distributed entries, with variance profile $S$. When entries are i.i.d. with unit variance, the spectral radius of $n^{-1/2}A$ converges to $1$ whereas the operator norm converges to 2. Motivated by recent interest in inhomogeneous random matrices, in particular non-Hermitian random band matrices, we formulate general upper bounds for $\rho(A)$, the spectral radius of $A$, in terms of the variance $S$. We prove (1) after suitable normalization $\rho(A)$ is bounded by $1+\epsilon$ up to the optimal sparsity $\sigma_*\gg (\log n)^{-1/2}$ where $\sigma_*$ is the largest standard deviation of an individual entry; (2) a small deviation inequality for $\rho(A)$ capturing fluctuation beyond the optimal scale $\sigma_*^{-1}$; (3) a large deviation inequality for $\rho(A)$ with Gaussian entries and doubly stochastic variance; and (4) boundedness of $\rho(A)$ in certain heavy-tailed regimes with only $2+\epsilon$ finite moments and inhomogeneous variance profile $S$. The proof relies heavily on the trace moment method.</description>

      <title>Cutoff for non-negatively curved diffusions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We resolve the long-standing problem of elucidating the cutoff phenomenon for a vast and important class of Markov processes, namely Markov diffusions with non-negative curvature in the sense of Bakry and \'Emery. More precisely, we prove that any sequence of non-negatively curved diffusions exhibits cutoff in total variation as soon as the product condition is satisfied. Our result holds in Euclidean spaces as well as on Riemannian manifolds, and for arbitrary non-random initial conditions. It vastly simplifies, unifies and generalizes a number of isolated works that have established cutoff through a delicate and model-dependent analysis of mixing times. The proof is elementary: we exploit a new simple differential relation between varentropy and entropy to produce a quantitative bound on the width of the mixing window.</description>

Abstract: We provide a simple proof for of the central limit theorem for the number of vertices in the giant for super-critical stochastic block model using the breadth-first walk of Konarovskyi, Limic and the author (2024). Our approach follows the recent work of Corujo, Limic and Lemaire (2024) and reduces to the classic central limit theorem for the Erd\H{o}s-R\'{e}nyi model obtained by Stepanov (1970).</description>

Abstract: Enriquez, Faraud, and Lemaire (2023) have established process-level fluctuations for the giant of the dynamic Erd\H{o}s-R\'{e}nyi random graph above criticality and show that the limit is a centered Gaussian process with continuous sample paths. A random walk proof was recently obtained by Corujo, Limic and Lemaire (2024). We show that a similar result holds for rank-one inhomogeneous models whenever the empirical weight distribution converges to a limit and its second moment converges as well.</description>

      <title>Random walks and Lorentz processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Random walks and Lorentz processes serve as fundamental models for Brownian motion. The study of random walks is a favorite object of probability theory, whereas that of Lorentz processes belongs to the theory of hyperbolic dynamical systems. Here, we first present examples where the method based on the probabilistic approach led to new insights into the study of the Lorentz process. Motivated by a 1981 question of Sinai about limiting laws for planar locally perturbed Lorentz processes, we first derived that, in the plane, local perturbations of homogeneous random walks leave the limit laws and the limiting processes unchanged - independently whether the walk had bounded or unbounded jumps. Afterward, we obtained probabilistic statements for local perturbations of planar Lorentz processes with finite horizon. (Similar statements for local perturbations of Lorentz processes with infinite horizon is a most interesting open problem!) Often an interesting consequence of a local limit theorem for a process is the recurrence of the same process. In this way, our approach also provides an alternative proof for a 2003 result of Lenci about the recurrence of the locally perturbed Lorentz processes with finite horizon. Afterward an unsolved problem, related to Sinai 1981 question, is formulated as an analogous problem in the language of random walks.</description>

      <title>The Pseudospectrum of Random Compressions of Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01418v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The compression of a matrix $A\in\mathbb C^{n\times n}$ onto a subspace $V\subset\mathbb C^n$ is the matrix $Q^*AQ$ where the columns of $Q$ form an orthonormal basis for $V$. This is an important object in both operator theory and numerical linear algebra. Of particular interest are the eigenvalues of the compression and their stability under perturbations. This paper considers compressions onto subspaces sampled from the Haar measure on the complex Grassmannian. We show the expected area of the $\varepsilon$-pseudospectrum of such compressions is bounded by $\text{poly}(n)\log^2(1/\varepsilon)\cdot\varepsilon^\beta$, where $\beta=6/5,4/3$, or $2$ depending on some mild assumptions on $A$. Along the way, we obtain (a) tail bounds for the least singular value of compressions and (b) non-asymptotic small-ball estimates for random non-Hermitian quadratic forms surpassing bounds achieved by existing methods.</description>

      <title>Existence of Invariant Measures for Delay Equations with Stochastic Negative Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00141v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide sufficient conditions for the existence of invariant probability measures for generic stochastic differential equations with finite time delay. Applications include the Mackey--Glass equations and Nicholson's blowflies equation, each perturbed by a (small) multiplicative noise term. Solutions to these stochastic negative feedback systems persist globally and all solutions are bounded above in probability. It turns out that the occurrence of finite time blowups and boundedness in probability of solutions and solution segments are closely related. A non-trivial invariant measure is shown to exist if and only if there is at least one initial condition for which the solution remains bounded away from zero in probability. The noise driving the dynamical system is allowed to be an integrable L\'evy process.</description>

      <title>The Aldous--Lyons Conjecture II: Undecidability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00173v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper, and its companion [BCLV24], are devoted to a negative resolution of the Aldous--Lyons Conjecture [AL07, Ald07].
  In this part we study tailored non-local games. This is a subclass of non-local games -- combinatorial objects which model certain experiments in quantum mechanics, as well as interactive proofs in complexity theory. Our main result is that, given a tailored non-local game $G$, it is undecidable to distinguish between the case where $G$ has a special kind of perfect strategy, and the case where every strategy for $G$ is far from being perfect. Using a reduction introduced in the companion paper [BCLV24], this undecidability result implies a negative answer to the Aldous--Lyons conjecture. Namely, it implies the existence of unimodular networks that are non-sofic.
  To prove our result, we use a variant of the compression technique developed in MIP*=RE [JNV+21]. Our main technical contribution is to adapt this technique to the class of tailored non-local games. The main difficulty is in establishing answer reduction, which requires a very careful adaptation of existing techniques in the construction of probabilistically checkable proofs. As a byproduct, we are reproving the negation of Connes' embedding problem [Con76] -- i.e., the existence of a $\mathrm{II}_1$-factor which cannot be embedded in an ultrapower of the hyperfinite $\mathrm{II}_1$-factor -- first proved in [JNV+21], using an arguably more streamlined proof. In particular, we incorporate recent simplifications from the literature [dlS22b, Vid22] due to de la Salle and the third author.</description>

      <title>Analyzing Scalogram Ridges in the Presence of Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00270v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While ridges in the scalogram, determined by the squared modulus of analytic wavelet transform (AWT), have been widely applied in time series analysis and time-frequency analysis, their behavior in noisy environments remains underexplored. We fill in this gap in this paper. We define ridges as paths formed by local maximizers of the scalogram along the scale axis, and analyze their properties when the signal is contaminated by stationary Gaussian noise. In addition to establishing several key properties of the AWT for random processes, we investigate the probabilistic characteristics of the resulting random ridge points in the scalogram. Specifically, we establish the uniqueness property of the ridge point at individual time instances and prove the upper hemicontinuity of the set of ridge points. Furthermore, we derive bounds on the probability that the deviation between the ridge points of noisy and clean signals exceeds a specified threshold. These bounds are expressed in terms of constants related to the signal-to-noise ratio and apply when the signal satisfies the adaptive harmonic model and is corrupted by a stationary Gaussian process. To achieve these results, we derive maximal inequalities for the complex modulus of nonstationary Gaussian processes, leveraging classical tools such as the Borell-TIS inequality and Dudley's theorem, which might be of independent interest.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.00351v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Granville and Soundararajan showed that the $k$th moment in the Erd\H{o}s--Kac theorem is equal to the $k$th moment of the standard Gaussian distribution in the range $k=o((\log \log x)^{1/3})$, up to a negligible error term. We show that their range is sharp: when $k/(\log \log x)^{1/3}$ tends to infinity, a different behavior emerges, and odd moments start exhibiting similar growth to even moments. For odd $k$ we find the asymptotics of the $k$th moment when $k=O((\log \log x)^{1/3})$, where previously only an upper bound was known. Our methods are flexible and apply to other distributions, including the Poisson distribution, whose centered moments turn out to be excellent approximations for the Erd\H{o}s--Kac moments.</description>

Abstract: We study the Riesz and logarithmic energies on the Grassmannian $\operatorname{Gr}_{2,4}$ of $2$-dimensional subspaces of $\mathbb{R}^4$. We prove that the continuous Riesz and logarithmic energies are uniquely minimized by the uniform measure, and we obtain asymptotic upper and lower bounds for the minimal discrete energies, with matching orders for the next-order terms. Additionally, we define a determinantal point process on $\operatorname{Gr}_{2,4}$ and compute the expected energy of the points coming from this random process, thereby obtaining explicit constants in the upper bounds for the Riesz and logarithmic energies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.00703v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the interaction between entropy and Wasserstein distance in free probability theory. In particular, we give lower bounds for several versions of free entropy dimension along Wasserstein geodesics, as well as study their topological properties with respect to Wasserstein distance. We also study moment measures in the multivariate free setting, showing the existence and uniqueness of solutions for a regularized version of Santambrogio's variational problem. The role of probability distributions in these results is played by types, functionals which assign values not only to polynomial test functions, but to all real-valued logical formulas built from them using suprema and infima. We give an explicit counterexample showing that in the framework of non-commutative laws, the usual notion of probability distributions using only non-commutative polynomial test functions, one cannot obtain the desired large-$n$ limiting behavior for both Wasserstein distance and entropy simultaneously in random multi-matrix models.</description>

      <title>Avoiding Oversmoothing in Deep Graph Neural Networks: A Multiplicative Ergodic Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00762v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have achieved remarkable empirical success in processing and representing graph-structured data across various domains. However, a significant challenge known as "oversmoothing" persists, where vertex features become nearly indistinguishable in deep GNNs, severely restricting their expressive power and practical utility. In this work, we analyze the asymptotic oversmoothing rates of deep GNNs with and without residual connections by deriving explicit convergence rates for a normalized vertex similarity measure. Our analytical framework is grounded in the multiplicative ergodic theorem. Furthermore, we demonstrate that adding residual connections effectively mitigates or prevents oversmoothing across several broad families of parameter distributions. The theoretical findings are strongly supported by numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Solving McKean-Vlasov Equation by deep learning particle method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00780v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel meshless simulation method for the McKean-Vlasov Stochastic Differential Equation (MV-SDE) utilizing deep learning, applicable to both self-interaction and interaction scenarios. Traditionally, numerical methods for this equation rely on the interacting particle method combined with techniques based on the It\^o-Taylor expansion. The convergence rate of this approach is determined by two parameters: the number of particles $N$ and the time step size $h$ for each Euler iteration. However, for extended time horizons or equations with larger Lipschitz coefficients, this method is often limited, as it requires a significant increase in Euler iterations to achieve the desired precision $\epsilon$. To overcome the challenges posed by the difficulty of parallelizing the simulation of continuous interacting particle systems, which involve solving high-dimensional coupled SDEs, we propose a meshless MV-SDE solver grounded in Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) that does not rely on the propagation of chaos result. Our method constructs a pseudo MV-SDE using It\^o calculus, then quantifies the discrepancy between this equation and the original MV-SDE, with the error minimized through a loss function. This loss is controlled via an optimization algorithm, independent of the time step size, and we provide an error estimate for the loss function. The advantages of our approach are demonstrated through corresponding simulations.</description>

      <title>Wiener-type Criterion for the Removability of the Fundamental Singularity for the Heat Equation and its Consequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00920v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove the necessary and sufficient condition for the removability of the fundamental singularity, and equivalently for the unique solvability of the singular Dirichlet problem for the heat equation. In the measure-theoretical context the criterion determines whether the $h$-parabolic measure of the singularity point is null or positive. From the probabilistic point of view, the criterion presents an asymptotic law for conditional Brownian motion. In {\it U.G. Abdulla, J Math Phys, 65, 121503 (2024)} the Kolmogorov-Petrovsky-type test was established. Here we prove a new Wiener-type criterion for the "geometric" characterization of the removability of the fundamental singularity for arbitrary open sets in terms of the fine-topological thinness of the complementary set near the singularity point.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.01091v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a disease transmission model that considers both explicit and non-explicit factors. This approach is crucial for accurate prediction and control of infectious disease spread. In this paper, we extend the spread model from our previous works \cite{ban2021mathematical,ban2023randomspread, ban2023mathematical, ban2023spread} to a projected spread model that considers both hidden and explicit types. Additionally, we provide the spread rate for the projected spread model corresponding to the topological and random models. Furthermore, examples and numerical results are provided to illustrate the theory.</description>

      <title>The clock advance description of the Epidemic Type Aftershock Sequence (ETAS) model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01233v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this short paper we propose to extend the ETAS model to micro-seismic events. For that we interpret the triggered events in an ETAS model as individual local clock advances of an independent background process. The solution of the ETAS model thus becomes the sum of an infinite Markov chain of independent time adjusted background processses. This allows the incorporation of events at all scales. No artificial small magnitude cutoff is needed.</description>

Abstract: We consider stochastic differential equations (SDEs) driven by a fractional Brownian motion with a drift coefficient that is allowed to be arbitrarily close to criticality in a scaling sense. We develop a comprehensive solution theory that includes strong existence, path-by-path uniqueness, existence of a solution flow of diffeomorphisms, Malliavin differentiability and $\rho$-irregularity. As a consequence, we can also treat McKean-Vlasov, transport and continuity equations.</description>

      <title>Random Walks in Random Environments with Rare Anomalies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.00062v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study random walks in i.i.d. random environments on $\mathbb{Z}^d$ when there are two basic types of vertices, which we call "blue" and "red". Each color represents a different probability distribution on transition probability vectors. We introduce a method of studying these walks that compares the expected amount of time spent at a specific site on the event that the site is red with the expected amount of time spent there on the event that the site is blue. This method produces explicit bounds on the asymptotic velocity of the walk. We recover an early result of Kalikow, but with new bounds on the velocity. Next, we consider a "rare anomaly" model where the vast majority of sites are blue, and blue sites are uniformly elliptic, with some almost-sure bounds on the quenched drift. We show that if the red sites satisfy a certain uniform ellipticity assumption in two fixed, non-parallel directions, then even if red sites break the almost-sure bounds on the quenched drift, making red sites unlikely enough lets us obtain bounds on the asymptotic velocity of the walk arbitrarily close to the bounds on the quenced drift at blue sites. Significantly, the required proportion $p^*$ of blue sites to do this does not depend on the distribution of red sites, except through the uniform ellipticity assumption in two directions. Our proof is based on a coupling technique, where two walks run in environments that are the same everywhere except at one vertex. They decouple when they hit that vertex, and our proof is driven by bounds on how long it takes to recouple. We then demonstrate the importance of the i.i.d. assumption by providing a counterexample to the statement of the theorem with this assumption removed. We conclude with open questions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.01396v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we present some extensions of recent noncentral moderate deviation results in the literature. In the first part we generalize the results in \cite{BeghinMacciSPL2022} by considering a general L\'evy process $\{S(t):t\geq 0\}$ instead of a compound Poisson process. In the second part we assume that $\{S(t):t\geq 0\}$ has bounded variation and is not a subordinator; thus $\{S(t):t\geq 0\}$ can be seen as the difference of two independent non-null subordinators. In this way we generalize the results in \cite{LeeMacci} for Skellam processes.</description>

      <title>Large Deviations of the $\Phi^4_3$ Measure via Stochastic Quantisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.00975v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The $\Phi^4_3$ measure is one of the easiest non-trivial examples of a Euclidean quantum field theory (EQFT) whose rigorous construction in the 1970's has been one of the celebrated achievements of constructive quantum field theory. In recent years, progress in the field of singular stochastic PDEs, initiated by the theory of regularity structures, has allowed for a new construction of the $\Phi^4_3$ EQFT as the invariant measure of a previously ill-posed Langevin dynamics, a strategy originally proposed by Parisi and Wu ('81) under the name stochastic quantisation. We apply the same methodology to obtain a large deviation principle (LDP) for the family of periodic $\Phi^4_3$ measures at varying temperature. In addition, we show that the rate functional of the LDP and the $\Phi^4_3$ action functional coincide up to a constant. We wish to highlight that while our main result had previously been obtained by Barashkov (2022), the main focus of this work is on the approach through the stochastic quantisation equation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14321v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove the large deviation principle (LDP) for stochastic differential equations driven by stochastic integrals in one dimension. The result can be proved with a minimal use of rough path theory, and this implies the LDP for many class of rough volatility models, and it characterizes the asymptotic behavior of implied volatility. First, we introduce a new concept called $\alpha$-Uniformly Exponentially Tightness, and prove the LDP for stochastic integrals on H\"{o}lder spaces. Second, we apply this type of LDP to deduce the LDP for stochastic differential equations driven by stochastic integrals in one dimension. Finally, we derive the asymptotic behavior of the implied volatility as an application of main results.</description>

Abstract: We study stability under tensorization and projection-type operations of gradient-type estimates and other functional inequalities for Markov semigroups on metric spaces. Using transportation-type inequalities obtained by F. Baudoin and N. Eldredge in 2021, we prove that constants in the gradient estimates can be chosen to be independent of the dimension. Our results are applicable to hypoelliptic diffusions on sub-Riemannian manifolds and some hypocoercive diffusions. As a byproduct, we obtain dimension-independent reverse Poincar\'{e}, reverse logarithmic Sobolev, and gradient bounds for Lie groups with a transverse symmetry and for non-isotropic Heisenberg groups.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we obtain a precise estimate of the probability that the sparse binomial random graph contains a large number of vertices in a triangle. The estimate of log of this probability is correct up to second order, and enables us to propose an exponential random graph model based on the number of vertices in a triangle. Specifically, by tuning a single parameter, we can with high probability induce any given fraction of vertices in a triangle. Moreover, in the proposed exponential random graph model we derive the large deviation principle for the number of edges. As a byproduct, we propose a consistent estimator of the tuning parameter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17622v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we study the recurrence and transience of the $\mathbb{Z}^d$-valued branching random walk in random environment indexed by a critical Bienaym\'e-Galton-Watson tree, conditioned to survive. The environment is made either of random conductances or of random traps on each vertex. We show that when the offspring distribution is non degenerate with a finite third moment and the environment satisfies some suitable technical assumptions, then the process is recurrent up to dimension four, and transient otherwise. The proof is based on a truncated second moment method, which only requires to have good estimates on the quenched Green's function.</description>

      <title>Stochastic games of parental vaccination decision making and bounded rationality</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.05369v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Vaccination is an effective strategy to prevent the spread of diseases. However, hesitancy and rejection of vaccines, particularly in childhood immunizations, pose challenges to vaccination efforts. In that case, according to rational decision-making and classical utility theory, parents weigh the costs of vaccination against the costs of not vaccinating their children. Social norms influence these parental decision-making outcomes, deviating their decisions from rationality. Additionally, variability in values of utilities stemming from stochasticity in parents' perceptions over time can lead to further deviations from rationality. In this paper, we employ independent white noises to represent stochastic fluctuations in parental perceptions of utility functions of the decisions over time, as well as in the disease transmission rates. This approach leads to a system of stochastic differential equations of a susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) model coupled with a stochastic replicator equation. We explore the dynamics of these equations and identify new behaviors emerging from stochastic influences. Interestingly, incorporating stochasticity into the utility functions for vaccination and nonvaccination leads to a decision-making model that reflects the bounded rationality of humans. Noise, like social norms, is a two-sided sword that depends on the degree of bounded rationality of each group. We also perform a stochastic optimal control as a discount to the cost of vaccination to counteract bounded rationality.</description>

      <title>An H-theorem for a conditional McKean-Vlasov process related to interacting diffusions on regular trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07710v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the long-time behavior of the $\kappa$-Markov local-field equation ($\kappa$-MLFE), which is a conditional McKean-Vlasov equation associated with interacting diffusions on the $\kappa$-regular tree. Under suitable assumptions on the coefficients, we prove well-posedness of the $\kappa$-MLFE. We also establish an H-theorem by identifying an energy functional, referred to as the sparse free energy, whose derivative along the measure flow of the $\kappa$-MLFE is given by a nonnegative functional that can be viewed as a modified Fisher information. Moreover, we show that the zeros of the latter functional coincide with the set of stationary distributions of the $\kappa$-MLFE and are also marginals of splitting Gibbs measures on the $\kappa$-regular tree. Furthermore, we show that for a natural class of initial conditions, the corresponding measure flow converges to one of the stationary distributions, thus demonstrating that the sparse free energy acts as a global Lyapunov function. Under mild additional conditions, in the case $\kappa = 2$ we prove that the sparse free energy arises naturally as the renormalized limit of certain relative entropies. We exploit this characterization to prove a modified logarithmic Sobolev inequality and establish an exponential rate of convergence of the $2$-MLFE measure flow to its unique stationary distribution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17380v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish ergodic and mixing properties of stochastic 2D Navier-Stokes equations driven by a highly degenerate multiplicative Gaussian noise. The noise could appear in as few as four directions and the intensity of the noise depends on the solution. The case of additive Gaussian noise was treated in Hairer and Mattingly [\emph{Ann. of Math.}, 164(3):993--1032, 2006]. To obtain ergodic and mixing properties, we use Malliavin calculus to establish the asymptotically strong Feller property. The main difficulty lies in the proof of the "invertibility" of Malliavin matrix which is totally different from the additive case.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we obtain sharp modulus of continuity estimates for $\beta$-Dyson Brownian motions with $\beta\geq 2$. Our approach is based on Caffarelli's contraction theorem in optimal transport. We develop the same estimates for a large class of line ensembles, which can be viewed as log-concave perturbations of Brownian motions, including $\beta$-Dyson Brownian motions, the Airy line ensemble, the KPZ line ensemble, and the O'Connell-Yor line ensemble. Our estimates are uniform for all curves, and this allows us to address a conjecture in [Wu23b].</description>

Abstract: Consider the multivariate smoothing transform fixed-point equation: $\eta =$ law of $ \sum_{i=1}^N A_i Z_i$, where $N \geq 0$ is a random integer, $(A_i)_{i \geq 1}$ are $d \times d$ random nonnegative matrices, $(Z_i)_{i \geq 1}$ is a sequence of $\mathbb{R}_+^d$-valued random variables independent of $(N, A_1, A_2, \cdots)$, and all $Z_i$ have the same law $\eta$. For each fixed point $\eta$, under suitable conditions, we describe its support, establish its absolute continuity, and prove the existence of its harmonic moments.</description>

      <title>The Sigma-max System Induced from Randomness &amp; Fuzziness and its Application in Time Series Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.07722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2110.07722v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper managed to induce probability theory (sigma system) and possibility theory (max system) respectively from the clearly-defined randomness and fuzziness, while focusing the question why the key axiom of "maxitivity" is adopted for possibility measure. Such an objective is achieved by following three steps: a) the establishment of mathematical definitions of randomness and fuzziness; b) the development of intuitive definition of possibility as measure of fuzziness based on compatibility interpretation; c) the abstraction of the axiomatic definitions of probability/ possibility from their intuitive definitions, by taking advantage of properties of the well-defined randomness and fuzziness. We derived the conclusion that "max" is the only but un-strict disjunctive operator that is applicable across the fuzzy event space, and is an exact operator for extracting the value from the fuzzy sample space that leads to the largest possibility of one. Then a demonstration example of stock price prediction is presented, which confirms that max inference indeed exhibits distinctive performance, with an improvement up to 18.99%, over sigma inference for the investigated application. Our work provides a physical foundation for the axiomatic definition of possibility for the measure of fuzziness, which hopefully would facilitate wider adoption of possibility theory in practice.</description>

      <title>Phase transition of the 3-majority opinion dynamics with noisy interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.03543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2112.03543v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Communication noise is a common feature in several real-world scenarios where systems of agents need to communicate in order to pursue some collective task. In particular, many biologically inspired systems that try to achieve agreements on some opinion must implement resilient dynamics that are not strongly affected by noisy communications. In this work, we study the popular 3-Majority dynamics, an opinion dynamics which has been proved to be an efficient protocol for the majority consensus problem, in which we introduce a simple feature of uniform communication noise, following (d'Amore et al. 2020). We prove that in the fully connected communication network of n agents and in the binary opinion case, the process induced by the 3-Majority dynamics exhibits a phase transition. For a noise probability $p &lt; 1/3$, the dynamics reaches in logarithmic time an almost-consensus metastable phase which lasts for a polynomial number of rounds with high probability. Furthermore, departing from previous analyses, we further characterize this phase by showing that there exists an attractive equilibrium value $s_{\text{eq}} \in [n]$ for the bias of the system, i.e. the difference between the majority community size and the minority one. Moreover, the agreement opinion turns out to be the initial majority one if the bias towards it is of magnitude $\Omega(\sqrt{n\log n})$ in the initial configuration. If, instead, $p &gt; 1/3$, no form of consensus is possible, and any information regarding the initial majority opinion is lost in logarithmic time with high probability. Despite more communications per-round are allowed, the 3-Majority dynamics surprisingly turns out to be less resilient to noise than the Undecided-State dynamics (d'Amore et al. 2020), whose noise threshold value is $p = 1/2$.</description>

      <title>Degeneracy is OK: Logarithmic Regret for Network Revenue Management with Indiscrete Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.07996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.07996v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the classical Network Revenue Management (NRM) problem with accept/reject decisions and $T$ IID arrivals. We consider a distributional form where each arrival must fall under a finite number of possible categories, each with a deterministic resource consumption vector, but a random value distributed continuously over an interval. We develop an online algorithm that achieves $O(\log^2 T)$ regret under this model, with the only (necessary) assumption being that the probability densities are bounded away from 0. We derive a second result that achieves $O(\log T)$ regret under an additional assumption of second-order growth. To our knowledge, these are the first results achieving logarithmic-level regret in an NRM model with continuous values that do not require any kind of "non-degeneracy" assumptions. Our results are achieved via new techniques including a new method of bounding myopic regret, a "semi-fluid" relaxation of the offline allocation, and an improved bound on the "dual convergence".</description>

      <title>Biorthogonal polynomials related to quantum transport theory of disordered wires</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.03720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.03720v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the Plancherel-Rotach type asymptotics of the biorthogonal polynomials associated to the biorthogonal ensemble with the joint probability density function \begin{equation*}
  \frac{1}{C} \prod_{1 \leq i &lt; j \leq n} (\lambda_j -\lambda_i)(f(\lambda_j) - f(\lambda_i)) \prod^n_{j = 1} W^{(n)}_{\alpha}(\lambda_j) d\lambda_j, \end{equation*} where \begin{align*} f(x) = {}&amp; \sinh^2(\sqrt{x}), &amp; W^{(n)}_{\alpha}(x) = {}&amp; x^{\alpha} h(x) e^{-nV(x)}. \end{align*} In the special case that the potential function $V$ is linear, this biorthogonal ensemble arises in the quantum transport theory of disordered wires. We analyze the asymptotic problem via $2$-component vector-valued Riemann-Hilbert problems, and solve it under the one-cut regular with a hard edge condition. We use the asymptotics of biorthogonal polynomials to establish sine universality for the correlation kernel in the bulk, and provide a central limit theorem with a specific variance for holomorphic linear statistics.
  As an application of our theories, we establish the Ohm's law (1.12) and universal conductance fluctuation (1.13) for the disordered wire model, thereby rigorously confirming predictions from experimental physics [Washburn-Webb86].</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.11213v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive differential equations for multiplicative statistics of the Bessel determinantal point process depending on two parameters. In particular, we prove that such statistics are solutions to an integrable nonlinear partial differential equation describing isospectral deformations of a Sturm-Liouville equation. We also derive identities relating solutions to the integrable partial differential equation and to the Sturm-Liouville equation which imply an analogue for Painlev\'e V of Amir-Corwin-Quastel "integro-differential Painlev\'e II equation". This equation reduces, in a degenerate limit, to the system of coupled Painlev\'e V equations derived by Charlier and Doeraene for the generating function of the Bessel process, and to the Painlev\'e V equation derived by Tracy and Widom for the gap probability of the Bessel process. Finally, we study an initial value problem for the integrable partial differential equation. The approach is based on Its-Izergin-Korepin-Slavnov theory of integrable operators and their associated Riemann-Hilbert problems.</description>

      <title>Perfect Matching in Product Graphs and in their Random Subgraphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14020v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For $t \in \mathbb{N}$ and every $i\in[t]$, let $H_i$ be a $d_i$-regular connected graph, with $1&lt;|V(H_i)|\le C$ for some integer $C\ge 2$. Let $G=\square_{i=1}^tH_i$ be the Cartesian product of $H_1, \ldots, H_t$. We show that if $t\ge 5C\log_2C$ then $G$ contains a (nearly-)perfect matching.
  Then, considering the random graph process on $G$, we generalise the result of Bollob\'as on the binary hypercube $Q^t$, showing that with high probability, the hitting times for minimum degree one, connectivity, and the existence of a (nearly-)perfect matching in the $G$-random-process are the same. We develop several tools which may be of independent interest in a more general setting of the typical existence of a perfect matching under percolation.</description>

      <title>Quantum inverse scattering for the 20-vertex model up to Dynkin automorphism: crossing probabilities, 3D Poisson structure, triangular height functions, weak integrability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11066v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We initiate a novel application of the quantum-inverse scattering method for the 20-vertex model, building upon seminal work from Faddeev and Takhtajan on the study of Hamiltonian systems, with applications to crossing probabilities, 3D Poisson structure, triangular height functions, and integrability. In comparison to a previous work of the author in late $2023$ which characterized integrability of a Hamiltonian flow for the 6-vertex model from integrability of inhomogeneous limit shapes, formalized in a work of Keating, Reshetikhin and Sridhar, notions similar to those of integrability can be realized for the 20-vertex model by studying new classes of higher-dimensional L-operators. In comparison to two-dimensional L-operators expressed in terms of Pauli basis elements, three-dimensional L-operators provided by Boos and colleagues have algebraic, combinatorial, and geometric, qualities, all of which impact leading order approximations of correlations, products of L-operators, the transfer matrix, and the quantum monodromy matrix in finite volume. In comparison to the inhomogeneous 6-vertex model, the 20-vertex model does not enjoy as strong of an integrability property through the existence of suitable action-angle variables, which is of interest to further explore, possibly from information on limit shapes given solutions to the three-dimensional Euler-Lagrange equations.</description>

Abstract: We establish the analogue of Khintchine's theorem for all self-similar probability measures on the real line. When specified to the case of the Hausdorff measure on the middle-thirds Cantor set, the result is already new and provides an answer to an old question of Mahler. The proof consists in showing effective equidistribution in law of expanding upper-triangular random walks on $\text{SL}_{2}(\mathbb{R})/\text{SL}_{2}(\mathbb{Z})$, a result of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Phase Transitions via Complex Extensions of Markov Chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06857v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study algebraic properties of partition functions, particularly the location of zeros, through the lens of rapidly mixing Markov chains. The classical Lee-Yang program initiated the study of phase transitions via locating complex zeros of partition functions. Markov chains, besides serving as algorithms, have also been used to model physical processes tending to equilibrium. In many scenarios, rapid mixing of Markov chains coincides with the absence of phase transitions (complex zeros). Prior works have shown that the absence of phase transitions implies rapid mixing of Markov chains. We reveal a converse connection by lifting probabilistic tools for the analysis of Markov chains to study complex zeros of partition functions.
  Our motivating example is the independence polynomial on $k$-uniform hypergraphs, where the best-known zero-free regime has been significantly lagging behind the regime where we have rapidly mixing Markov chains for the underlying hypergraph independent sets. Specifically, the Glauber dynamics is known to mix rapidly on independent sets in a $k$-uniform hypergraph of maximum degree $\Delta$ provided that $\Delta \lesssim 2^{k/2}$. On the other hand, the best-known zero-freeness around the point $1$ of the independence polynomial on $k$-uniform hypergraphs requires $\Delta \le 5$, the same bound as on a graph.
  By introducing a complex extension of Markov chains, we lift an existing percolation argument to the complex plane, and show that if $\Delta \lesssim 2^{k/2}$, the Markov chain converges in a complex neighborhood, and the independence polynomial itself does not vanish in the same neighborhood. In the same regime, our result also implies central limit theorems for the size of a uniformly random independent set, and deterministic approximation algorithms for the number of hypergraph independent sets of size $k \le \alpha n$ for some constant $\alpha$.</description>
