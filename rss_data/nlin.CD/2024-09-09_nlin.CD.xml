      <title>Trends in recurrence analysis of dynamical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The last decade has witnessed a number of important and exciting developments that had been achieved for improving recurrence plot based data analysis and to widen its application potential. We will give a brief overview about important and innovative developments, such as computational improvements, alternative recurrence definitions (event-like, multiscale, heterogeneous, and spatio-temporal recurrences) and ideas for parameter selection, theoretical considerations of recurrence quantification measures, new recurrence quantifiers (e.g., for transition detection and causality detection), and correction schemes. New perspectives have recently been opened by combining recurrence plots with machine learning. We finally show open questions and perspectives for futures directions of methodical research.</description>

      <title>Network reconstruction may not mean dynamics prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04240v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With an increasing amount of observations on the dynamics of many complex systems, it is required to reveal the underlying mechanisms behind these complex dynamics, which is fundamentally important in many scientific fields such as climate, financial, ecological, and neural systems. The underlying mechanisms are commonly encoded into network structures, e.g., capturing how constituents interact with each other to produce emergent behavior. Here, we address whether a good network reconstruction suggests a good dynamics prediction. The answer is quite dependent on the nature of the supplied (observed) dynamics sequences measured on the complex system. When the dynamics are not chaotic, network reconstruction implies dynamics prediction. In contrast, even if a network can be well reconstructed from the chaotic time series (chaos means that many unstable dynamics states coexist), the prediction of the future dynamics can become impossible as at some future point the prediction error will be amplified. This is explained by using dynamical mean-field theory on a toy model of random recurrent neural networks.</description>

      <title>A class of 2 X 2 correlated random-matrix models with Brody spacing distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.01514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.01514v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A class of 2 X 2 random-matrix models is introduced for which the Brody distribution is the exact eigenvalue spacing distribution. The matrix elements consist of constrained sums of an exponential random variable raised to various powers that depend on the Brody parameter. The random matrices introduced here differ from those of the Gaussian Orthogonal Ensemble (GOE) in three important ways: the matrix elements are not independent and identically distributed (i.e., not IID) nor Gaussian-distributed, and the matrices are not necessarily real and/or symmetric. The first two features arise from dropping the classical independence assumption, and the third feature stems from dropping the quantum-mechanical conditions that are imposed in the construction of the GOE. In particular, the hermiticity condition, which in the present model, is a sufficient but not necessary condition for the eigenvalues to be real, is not imposed. Consequently, complex non-Hermitian 2 X 2 random matrices with real or complex eigenvalues can also have spacing distributions that are intermediate between those of the Poisson and Wigner classes. Numerical examples are provided for different types of random matrices, including complex-symmetric matrices with real or complex-conjugate eigenvalues.</description>
