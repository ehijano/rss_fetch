      <title>RAAGedy right-angled Coxeter groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give criteria for deciding whether or not a triangle-free simple graph is the presentation graph of a right-angled Coxeter group that is quasiisometric to some right-angled Artin group, and, if so, producing a presentation graph for such a right-angled Artin group.
  We introduce two new graph modification operations, cloning and unfolding, to go along with an existing operation called link doubling. These operations change the presentation graph but not the quasiisometry type of the resulting group. We give criteria on the graph that imply it can be transformed by these operations into a graph that is recognizable as presenting a right-angled Coxeter group commensurable to a right-angled Artin group.
  In the converse direction we derive coarse geometric obstructions to being quasiisometric to a right-angled Artin group, first by specializing existing results from the literature to this setting, then by developing new approaches using configurations of maximal product regions. In all cases we give sufficient graphical conditions that imply these geometric obstructions.
  We implemented our criteria on a computer and applied them to an enumeration of small graphs. Our methods completely answer the motiving question when the graph has at most 10 vertices.</description>

      <title>JSJ splittings for all Artin groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that an Artin group splits over infinite cyclic subgroups if and only if its defining graph has a separating vertex, and explicitly construct a JSJ decomposition over infinite cyclic subgroups for all Artin groups. This is then used to show that, if two Artin groups are isomorphic, then they have the same set of big chunks, that is, maximal subgraphs without separating vertices. We also deduce acylindrical hyperbolicity for the automorphism groups of many Artin groups, partially answering a question of Genevois in the case of Artin groups.</description>

      <title>Making Non-Negative Polynomials into Sums of Squares</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.16321v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate linear operators $A:\mathbb{R}[x_1,\dots,x_n]\to\mathbb{R}[x_1,\dots,x_n]$. We give explicit operators $A$ such that, for fixed $d\in\mathbb{N}_0$ and closed $K\subseteq\mathbb{R}^n$, $e^A\mathrm{Pos}(K)_{\leq 2d}\subseteq\sum\mathbb{R}[x_1,\dots,x_n]_{\leq d}^2$. We give an explicit operator $A$ such that $e^A\mathrm{Pos}(\mathbb{R}^n)\subseteq\sum\mathbb{R}[x_1,\dots,x_n]^2$. For $K\subseteq\mathbb{R}^n$, we give a condition such that $A$ exists with $e^A\mathrm{Pos}(K)\subseteq\sum\mathbb{R}[x_1,\dots,x_n]^2$. In the framework of regular Fr\'echet Lie groups and Lie algebras we investigate the linear operators $A$ such that $e^{tA}:\mathbb{R}[x_1,\dots,x_n]\to\mathbb{R}[x_1,\dots,x_n]$ is well-defined for all $t\in\mathbb{R}$. We give a three-line-proof of Stochel's Theorem.</description>

      <title>Enumeration of virtual quandles up to isomorphism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16536v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Virtual racks and virtual quandles are nonassociative algebraic structures based on the Reidemeister moves of virtual knots. In this note, we enumerate virtual dihedral quandles and several families of virtual permutation racks and virtual conjugation quandles up to isomorphism. We also classify virtual racks and virtual quandles up to order 8 using a computer search. These classifications are based on the conjugacy class structures of rack automorphism groups. In particular, we compute class numbers of holomorphs of finite cyclic groups, which may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Algebra of double cosets of a symmetric group by a smaller symmetric group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17069v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fix a natural $\alpha$. Let $n\ge \alpha$ be an integer. Consider the symmetric group $S_{\alpha+n}$ and its subgroup $S_n$. We consider the group algebra of $S_{\alpha+n}$ and its subalgebra $\mathbb{O}[\alpha;n]$ consisting of $S_n$-biinvariant functions, i.e., functions, which are constant on double cosets of $S_{\alpha+n}$ with respect to $S_n$. We obtain a simple description of $\mathbb{O}[\alpha;n]$ in terms of generators and relations. We also construct an interpolating family of algebras $\mathbb{O}[\alpha;n]$ depending on a complex parameter $n$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.17123v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We gather tools for proving the inductive McKay--Navarro (or Galois--McKay) condition for groups of Lie type and odd primes. We use this to establish a bijection in the case of quasisimple groups of Lie type A satisfying the equivariance properties needed for the condition. We also prove the inductive conditions for the subset of unipotent characters.</description>

      <title>Auxiliary free constructions for explicit embeddings of recursive groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.03030v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An auxiliary free construction $*_{i=1}^{r}(K_i, L_i, t_i)_M$ based on HNN-extensions and on generalized free product of groups with amalgamated subgroups is suggested, and some of its basic properties are displayed. The proposed construction is a generalization of a series of structures used by Higman for embeddings of recursive groups into finitely presented groups, and also for certain structures we recently applied in the research on embeddings of recursive groups. Usage of this technical tool substantially simplifies some embedding methods for recursive groups. A few technical results on specific subgroups in the suggested $*$-constructions, in the HNN-extensions of groups, and in free products of groups with amalgamated subgroup are proved. The obtained properties are applied to build infinitely generated benign subgroups inside free groups of small rank.</description>

      <title>All Finite (Anti)Hermitian Irreducible Representations of the de Sitter and Anti-de Sitter Lie Algebras and Their Lorentz Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19708v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Because of the importance of unitarity in quantum physics, work on the representations of the de Sitter group has focussed on the unitary case, which necessarily means infinite dimensional matrices for this non-compact group. Here we address the finite dimensional representations resulting from the requirement that the Lie algebra generators are either Hermitian or anti-Hermitian. The complete classification of all such irreducible representations is found and their matrix elements specified. These irreducible representations (irreps) are based on backbones defined as the homogeneous Lorentz sub-algebra and consisting of direct sums of the finite irreps of the homogeneous Lorentz algebra (HLA). All these irreps have been characterised by a diagrammatic depiction conveniently labelled by two positive integers m/n where m,n lie in (1,2,3,..) excepting only m=n=1. The two Casimir invariants have been given explicitly in terms of the two positive integers, m and n, equations (11.11a,b), and shown to reproduce the result familiar from the study of the infinite dimensional, unitary representations -C1=p(p+1)+(q+1)(q-2) and -C2=p(p+1)q(q-1) but with a reduced set of possible p,q values. There are 17 irreps with dimensions less than 105, having dimensions 4, 5, 10, 14, 16, 20, 30, 35(x2), 40, 55, 56, 64, 80, 81, 84 and 91. The corresponding irreps of the anti-de Sitter group follow immediately from the replacement of the 4-momentum operators V{\mu} by iV{\mu}.</description>

Abstract: We give a simple presentation of the pure cactus group $PJ_4$ of degree four. This presentation is obtained by considering an action of $PJ_4$ on the hyperbolic plane and constructing a Dirichlet polygon for the action. As a corollary, we provide a direct alternative proof that $PJ_4$ is isomorphic to the fundamental group of the connected sum of five real projective planes.</description>

      <title>On the Descriptive Complexity of Groups without Abelian Normal Subgroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.13725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.13725v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore the descriptive complexity theory of finite groups by examining the power of the second Ehrenfeucht--Fra\"iss\'e bijective pebble game in Hella's (Ann. Pure Appl. Log., 1989) hierarchy. This is a Spoiler--Duplicator game in which Spoiler can place up to two pebbles each round. While it trivially solves graph isomorphism, it may be nontrivial for finite groups, and other ternary relational structures. We first provide a novel generalization of Weisfeiler--Leman (WL) coloring, which we call 2-ary WL. We then show that 2-ary WL is equivalent to the second Ehrenfeucht--Fra\"iss\'e bijective pebble game in Hella's hierarchy.
  Our main result is that, in the pebble game characterization, only $O(1)$ pebbles and $O(1)$ rounds are sufficient to identify all groups without Abelian normal subgroups (a class of groups for which isomorphism testing is known to be in $\mathsf{P}$; Babai, Codenotti, &amp; Qiao, ICALP 2012). We actually show that $7$ pebbles and $7$ rounds suffice. In particular, we show that within the first few rounds, Spoiler can force Duplicator to select an isomorphism between two such groups at each subsequent round. By Hella's results (\emph{ibid.}), this is equivalent to saying that these groups are identified by formulas in first-order logic with generalized 2-ary quantifiers, using only $7$ variables and quantifier depth $7$.</description>

  group of a smooth complex algebraic variety. Moreover as an application of our result, we give a
  required condition of a lattice in a simply-connected nilpotent Lie group of dimension greater than or

      <title>Linear Geometry and Algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14060v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Linear Geometry studies geometric properties which can be expressed via the notion of a line. All information about lines is encoded in a ternary relation called a line relation. A set endowed with a line relation is called a liner. So, Linear Geometry studies liners. Imposing some additional axioms on a liner, we obtain some special classes of liners: regular, projective, affine, proaffine, etc. Linear Geometry includes Affine and Projective Geometries and is a part of Incidence Geometry. The aim of this book is to present a self-contained logical development of Linear Geometry, starting with some intuitive acceptable geometric axioms and ending with algebraic structures that necessarily arise from studying the structure of geometric objects that satisfy those simple and intuitive geometric axioms. We shall meet many quite exotic algebraic structures that arise this way: magmas, loops, ternary-ring, quasi-fields, alternative rings, procorps, profields, etc. We strongly prefer (synthetic) geometric proofs and use tools of analytic geometry only when no purely geometric proof is available. Liner Geometry has been developed by many great mathematicians since times of Antiquity (Thales, Euclides, Proclus, Pappus), through Renaissance (Descartes, Desargues), Early Modernity (Playfair, Gauss, Lobachevski, Bolyai, Poncelet, Steiner, M\"obius), Late Modernity Times (Steinitz, Klein, Hilbert, Moufang, Hessenberg, Jordan, Beltrami, Fano, Gallucci, Veblen, Wedderburn, Lenz, Barlotti) till our contempories (Hartshorne, Hall, Buekenhout, Gleason, Kantor, Doyen, Hubault, Dembowski, Klingenberg, Grundh\"ofer).</description>
