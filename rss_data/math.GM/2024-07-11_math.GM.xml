      <title>Euclidean Tours in Fairy Chess</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07903v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The present paper aims to extend the knight's tour problem for $k$-dimensional grids of the form $\{0,1\}^k$ to other fairy chess leapers. Accordingly, we constructively show the existence of closed tours in $2 \times 2 \times \cdots \times 2$ ($k$ times) chessboards concerning the wazir, the threeleaper, and the zebra, for all $k \geq 15$. Our result considers the three above-mentioned leapers and replicates for each of them the recent discovery of Euclidean knight's tours for the same set of $2 \times 2 \times \cdots \times 2$ grids, opening a new research path on the topic by studying different fairy chess leapers that perform jumps of fixed Euclidean length on given regular grids, visiting all their vertices exactly once before coming back to the starting one.</description>

      <title>Response Matrix Benchmark for the 1D Transport Equation with Matrix Scaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07905v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The linear 1D transport equation is likely the most solved transport equation in radiative transfer and neutron transport investigations. Nearly every method imaginable has been applied to establish solutions, including Laplace and Fourier transforms, singular eigenfunctions, solutions of singular integral equation, PN expansions, double PN expansions, Chebychev expansions, Lagrange polynomial expansions, numerical discrete ordinates with finite difference, analytical discrete ordinates, finite elements, solutions to integral equations, adding and doubling, invariant imbedding, solution of Ricatti equations and response matrix methods -- and probably more methods of which the authors are unaware. Of those listed, the response matrix solution to the discrete ordinates form of the 1D transport equation is arguably the simplest and most straightforward. Here, we propose another response of exponential solutions but to the first order equation enabled by matrix scaling.</description>

      <title>Alternative views on fuzzy numbers and their application to fuzzy differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07906v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider fuzzy valued functions from two parametric representations of $\alpha$-level sets. New concepts are introduced and compared with available notions. Following the two proposed approaches, we study fuzzy differential equations. Their relation with Zadeh's extension principle and the generalized Hukuhara derivative is discussed. Moreover, we prove existence and uniqueness theorems for fuzzy differential equations. Illustrative examples are given.</description>

      <title>Describing chaotic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07919v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we discuss the Lyapunov exponent definition of chaos and how it can be used to quantify the chaotic behavior of a system. We derive a way to practically calculate the Lyapunov exponent of a one-dimensional system and use it to analyze chaotic behavior of the logistic map, comparing the $r$-varying Lyapunov exponent to the map's bifurcation diagram. Then, we generalize the idea of the Lyapunov exponent to an $n$-dimensional system and explore the mathematical background behind the analytic calculation of the Lyapunov spectrum. We also outline a method to numerically calculate the maximal Lyapunov exponent using the periodic renormalization of a perturbation vector and a method to numerically calculate the entire Lyapunov spectrum using QR factorization. Finally, we apply both these methods to calculate the Lyapunov exponents of the H\'enon map, a multi-dimensional chaotic system.</description>

      <title>On e*$\theta$-regular and e*$\theta$-normal Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The purpose of this study is to introduce a new class of regular spaces called e*$\theta$-regular spaces which is a generalization of the class of $\beta\theta$-regular spaces. Also, we investigate some basic properties and several characterizations of e*$\theta$-regular and e*$\theta$-normal spaces. Moreover, some functions such as e*$\theta$-closed function, generalized e*$\theta$-closed function, generalized e*$\theta$-closed function have been defined and studied. Furthermore, we obtain some preservation theorems.</description>

      <title>Inverse application of the generalized Littlewood theorem concerning integrals of the logarithm of analytic functions: an easy method to establish equalities between different analytic functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09657v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, we have established and used the generalized Littlewood theorem concerning contour integrals of the logarithm of analytical function to obtain new criteria equivalent to the Riemann hypothesis. Later, the same theorem was applied to calculate certain infinite sums and study the properties of zeroes of a few analytical functions. In this Note, we discuss what, in a sense, are inverse applications of this theorem. We first prove an easy Lemma that if two meromorphic on the whole complex plane functions $f(z)$ and $g(z)$ have the same zeroes and poles, taking into account their orders, and have appropriate asymptotic for large $|z|$, then for some integer $n$, $d^n \ln(f(z)/dz^n = d^n\ln(g(z)/dz^n$. The use of this Lemma enables easy proofs of many identities between elliptic functions and their transformation rules. In particular, we show how for any complex number $a$, $\wp(z)-a$, where $\wp(z)$ is Weierstrass $\wp$-function, can be presented as a product and ratio of three elliptic $\theta_1$-functions of certain arguments. We also establish n-tuple rules for elliptic theta-functions and /rho_z(z) functions.</description>
