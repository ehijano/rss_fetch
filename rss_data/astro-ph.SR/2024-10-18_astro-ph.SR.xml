      <title>Chemical abundances of 20 barium stars from the OHP spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based on the high resolution and high signal-to-noise spectra, we derived the chemical abundances of 20 elements for 20 barium (Ba-) stars. For the first time, the detailed abundances of four sample stars, namely HD 92482, HD 150430, HD 151101 and HD 177304 have been analyzed. Additionally, Ba element abundance has been measured using high resolution spectra for the first time in six of the other 16 sample stars. Based on the [s/Fe] ratios, the Ba-unknown star HD 115927 can be classified as a strong Ba-star, while the Ba-likely star HD 160538 can be categorized into a mild Ba-star. Consequently, our sample comprises three strong and 17 mild Ba-stars. The light odd-Z metal elements and Fe-peak elements exhibit near-solar abundances. The [{\alpha}/Fe] ratios demonstrate decreasing trends with increasing metallicity. Moreover, the abundances of n-capture elements show significant enhancements in different degrees. Using a threshold of the signed distances to the solar r-process abundance pattern ds = 0.6, we find that all of our sample stars are normal Ba-stars, indicating that the enhancements of s-process elements should be attributed to material transfer from their companions. We compare the observed n-capture patterns of sample stars with the FRUITY models, and estimate the mass of the Thermally-Pulsing Asymptotic Giant Branch stars that previously contaminated the Ba-stars. The models with low masses can successfully explain the observations. From a kinematic point of view, we note that most of our sample stars are linked with the thin disk, while HD 130255 may be associated with the thick disk.</description>

      <title>A statistical study on the peak and fluence spectra of Solar Energetic Particles observed over 4 solar cycles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13186v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solar energetic particles (SEPs) are an important space radiation source, especially for the space weather environment in the inner heliosphere. The energy spectrum of SEP events is crucial both for evaluating their radiation effects and for understanding their acceleration process at the source region and their propagation mechanism. In this work, we investigate the properties of the SEP peak flux spectra and the fluence spectra and their potential formation mechanisms using statistical methods. We aim to advance our understanding of both SEPs' acceleration and propagation mechanisms. Employing the dataset of European Space Agency's Solar Energetic Particle Environment Modelling (SEPEM) program, we have obtained and fitted the peak-flux and fluence proton spectra of more than a hundred SEP events from 1974 to 2018. We analyzed the relationship among the solar activity, X-ray peak intensity of solar flares and the SEP spectral parameters. Based on the assumption that the initial spectrum of accelerated SEPs generally has a power-law distribution and also the diffusion coefficient has a power-law dependence on particle energy, we can assess both the source and propagation properties using the observed SEP event peak flux and fluence energy spectra. We confirm that SEPs' spectral properties are influenced by the solar source and the interplanetary conditions and their transportation process can be influenced by different phases of solar cycle. This study provides an observational perspective on the double power-law spectral characteristics of the SEP energy spectra, showing their correlation with the adiabatic cooling and diffusion processes during the particle propagation from the Sun to the observer. This contributes to a deeper understanding of the acceleration and propagation of SEP events, in particular the possible origins of the double-power law.</description>

      <title>Investigation on upstream ion events from L1 point observation: New Insights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Origin of energetic upstream ions propagating towards the Sun from the Earth's bow shock is not understood clearly. In this letter, relationship between solar wind suprathermal and upstream ions has been investigated by analyzing fluxes of H, 4He, and CNO obtained from multidirectional in-situ measurements at the first Lagrange point of the Sun-Earth system during 2012-2014. 49 upstream events have been selected based on flux enhancements of the upstream ions in comparison with the solar wind suprathermal ions. An energy cut-off at less than 300 keV is observed for the upstream events. This is attributed to the efficacy of the particle acceleration process near the bow shock. Interestingly, spectra of upstream ions soften systematically as compared to the spectra of their solar wind counterpart with decreasing mass of elements. The degree of spectral softening increases with decreasing mass-to-charge ratio of the species. Since during most of the events the interplanetary magnetic field was radial, we argue that cross-field diffusion of upstream ions gives rise to the modulation (spectral softening) of upstream ions, which is dependent on the mass-to-charge ratio of species. Our work indicates towards a systematic change in solar wind suprathermal ions after interaction with the bow shock.</description>

      <title>HI line observations of 290 evolved stars made with the Nancay Radio Telescope -- I. Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13725v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a compendium of HI 21-cm line observations of circumstellar envelopes (CSEs) of 290 evolved stars, mostly (~84%) on the asymptotic giant branch (AGB), made with the 100m-class, single-dish Nancay Radio Telescope. The observational and data reduction procedures were optimised for separating genuine CSE HI emission from surrounding Galactic line features. For most targets (254) the results have not been previously published. Clear detections were made of 34 objects, for 33 of which the total HI flux and the size of the CSE could be determined. Possible detections were made of 21 objects, and upper limits could be determined for 95 undetected targets, while for 140 objects confusion from Galactic HI emission along the line-of-sight precluded meaningful upper limits. The collective results of this survey can provide guidance on detectability of circumstellar HI gas for future mapping and imaging studies.</description>

      <title>On the crystallization onset in white dwarfs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13745v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermal evolution of the central region of a $0.9 \, M_\odot$ C/O white dwarf at the initial stage of the ion mixture crystallization is studied by numerically solving the heat equation on a fine spatial and temporal grid and by including a detailed treatment of the latent heat release. Formation of two spherical shells is observed. The outer one surrounds a region where crystallization has begun. The inner one bounds a fully solidified core which has exhausted its latent heat. The region between the shells is partially liquid and partially solid. It gradually emits the latent heat of crystallization and also it releases light elements (carbon) in the process of element redistribution, accompanying the mixture solidification. Assuming that all released light elements cross the outer shell, we have estimated their flux induced by the mixture crystallization. The resulting flux is not divergent and is much smaller than an estimate derived from the growth rate of the fully crystallized core.</description>

      <title>Abundances of iron-peak elements in 58 bulge spheroid stars from APOGEE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13751v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stars presently identified in the bulge spheroid are probably very old, and their abundances can be interpreted as due to the fast chemical enrichment of the early Galactic bulge. The abundances of the iron-peak elements are important tracers of nucleosynthesis processes, in particular oxygen burning, silicon burning, the weak s-process, and alpha-rich freeze-out. Aims. The aim of this work is to derive the abundances of V, Cr, Mn, Co, Ni, and Cu in 58 bulge spheroid stars and to compare them with the results of a previous analysis of data from APOGEE. We selected the best lines for V, Cr, Mn, Co, Ni, and Cu located within the H-band of the spectrum, identifying the most suitable ones for abundance determination, and discarding severe blends. Using the stellar physical parameters available for our sample from the DR17 release of the APOGEE project, we derived the individual abundances through spectrum synthesis. We then complemented these measurements with similar results from different bulge field and globular cluster stars, in order to define the trends of the individual elements and compare with the results of chemical-evolution models. We verify that the H-band has useful lines for the derivation of the elements V, Cr, Mn, Co, Ni, and Cu in moderately metal-poor stars. The resulting abundances indicate that: V, Cr, and Ni vary in lockstep with Fe; Co tends to vary in lockstep with Fe, but could be showing a slight decrease with decreasing metallicity; and Mn and Cu decrease with decreasing metallicity. These behaviours are well reproduced by chemical-evolution models except for Cu, which appears to drop faster than the models predict for moderate metallicities. Finally, abundance indicators combined with kinematical and dynamical criteria appear to show that our 58 sample stars are likely to have originated in situ.</description>

      <title>Failed supernova explosions increase the duration of star formation in globular clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12933v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context. The duration of star formation (SF) in globular clusters (GCs) is an essential aspect for understanding their formation. Contrary to previous presumptions that all stars above 8 M explode as core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe), recent evidence suggests a more complex scenario. Aims. We analyse iron spread observations from 55 GCs to estimate the number of CCSNe explosions before SF termination, thereby determining the SF duration. This work for the first time takes the possibility of failed CCSNe into account, when estimating the SF duration. Methods. Two scenarios are considered: one where all stars explode as CCSNe and another where only stars below 20 M lead to CCSNe, as most CCSN models predict that no failed CCSNe happen below 20 M . Results. This establishes a lower ($\approx$ 3.5 Myr) and an upper ($\approx$ 10.5 Myr) limit for the duration of SF. Extending the findings of our previous paper, this study indicates a significant difference in SF duration based on CCSN outcomes, with failed CCSNe extending SF by up to a factor of three. Additionally, a new code is introduced to compute the SF duration for a given CCSN model. Conclusions. The extended SF has important implications on GC formation, including enhanced pollution from stellar winds and increased binary star encounters. These results underscore the need for a refined understanding of CCSNe in estimating SF durations and the formation of multiple stellar populations in GCs.</description>

      <title>Origin of spectral bands in the Crab pulsar radio emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12992v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The model explaining the spectral "zebra" pattern of the high-frequency interpulse (HFIP) of the Crab pulsar radio emission is proposed. The observed emission bands are diffraction fringes in the spectral domain. The pulsar's own plasma-filled magnetosphere plays a role of a frequency-dependent "diffraction screen". The observed features such as the proportional band spacing, high polarization, constant position angle, and others are explained. The model allows one to perform "tomography" of the pulsar magnetosphere. Indeed, we have obtained the plasma density profile directly from observations, without assuming a particular magnetosphere. Our model is testable and several predictions are made. The two "high-frequency components" observed at the same frequencies as the HFIP are proposed to be related to HFIP.</description>

      <title>Wavelet analysis of low-frequency quasi-periodic oscillations in MAXI J1803$-$298 observed with Insight-HXMT and NICER</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13367v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With data observed by the Hard X-ray Modulation Telescope (\textit{Insight}-HXMT) and the Neutron star Interior Composition Explorer (\textit {NICER}), we study low-frequency quasi-periodic oscillations (LFQPOs) of the black hole candidate MAXI J1803$-$298 during the 2021 outburst. Based on hardness intensity diagram and difference of the QPOs properties, Type-C and Type-B QPOs are found in the low-hard state and soft intermediate state, respectively. After searching for and classifying QPOs in Fourier domains, we extract the QPO component and study it with wavelet analysis. The QPO and no-QPO time intervals are separated by the confidence level, so that the S-factor, which is defined as the ratio of the QPO time interval to the total length of good time interval, is calculated. We found S-factors decrease with QPOs frequency for Type-C QPOs but stay stable around zero for Type-B QPOs. The relation of S-factor of Type-C QPOs and photon energy, the correlation of S-factor and counts are also studied. Different correlation of S-factor and counts for different energy bands indicates different origins of QPOs in high energy and low energy bands, which may be due to a dual-corona scenario.</description>

      <title>A two-minute burst of highly polarised radio emission originating from low Galactic latitude</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12352v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Several sources of repeating coherent bursts of radio emission with periods of many minutes have now been reported in the literature. These "ultra-long period" (ULP) sources have no clear multi-wavelength counterparts and challenge canonical pulsar emission models, leading to debate regarding their nature. In this work we report the discovery of a bright, highly-polarised burst of radio emission at low Galactic latitude as part of a wide-field survey for transient and variable radio sources. ASKAP\,J175534.9$-$252749.1 does not appear to repeat, with only a single intense two-minute $\sim$200-mJy burst detected from 60~hours of observations. The burst morphology and polarisation properties are comparable to those of classical pulsars but the duration is more than one hundred times longer, analogous to ULPs. Combined with the existing ULP population, this suggests that these sources have a strong Galactic latitude dependence and hints at an unexplored population of transient and variable radio sources in the thin disk of the Milky Way. The resemblance of this burst with both ULPs and pulsars calls for a unified coherent emission model for objects with spin periods from milliseconds to tens of minutes. However, whether or not these are all neutron stars or have the same underlying power source remains open for debate.</description>

      <title>Evolution From Asymptotic Giant Branch to Pre-planetary Nebula: Whorled Patterns and Stellar Companions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11244v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bipolar or multipolar lobes in pre-planetary nebulae (pPNe) often exhibit intertwined outer whorled patterns, resulting from stellar wind matter accumulation during the asymptotic giant branch (AGB) phase. These structures are likely triggered by stellar or substellar companions. We regard that CW Leonis currently stands at a critical transition moment, providing a vivid illustration of the progression from an AGB star in a binary system to a pPN. We have found that CW Leonis has shown significant enhancements in its optical and near-infrared light curves over the past two decades, with the recent Hubble Space Telescope image finally revealing the long-awaited central star. Utilizing an eccentric-orbit binary model, we can reproduce the position-angle dependence of the expansion velocity in the whorled pattern around CW Leonis, suggesting a nearly face-on orbital inclination. Its contradiction to the features in the innermost circumstellar envelope, corresponding to a nearly edge-on inclination, may imply the presence of an additional companion. Our updated theoretical framework explores the complexity of the whorled pattern. Further identifying and monitoring phase-transition candidates at the tip of the AGB will provide valuable insights into the AGB-pPN transition and the role of companions in shaping the morphological evolution of these stellar objects.</description>

      <title>SN 2021adxl: A luminous nearby interacting supernova in an extremely low metallicity environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.13280v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: SN 2021adxl is a slowly evolving, luminous, Type IIn supernova with asymmetric emission line profiles, similar to the well-studied SN 2010jl. We present extensive optical, near-ultraviolet, and near-infrared photometry and spectroscopy covering ~1.5 years post discovery. SN 2021adxl occurred in an unusual environment, atop a vigorously star-forming region that is offset from its host galaxy core. The appearance of Ly-alpha, O II, as well as the compact core, would classify the host of SN 2021adxl as a Blueberry galaxy, analogous to the higher redshift Green Pea galaxies. Using several abundance indicators, we find a metallicity of the explosion environment of only 10% solar, the lowest reported metallicity for a Type IIn SN environment. SN 2021adxl reaches a peak magnitude of r ~ -20.2 mag and since discovery, SN 2021adxl has faded by only ~4 magnitudes in the r band with a cumulative radiated energy of ~1.5e50 erg over 18 months. SN 2021adxl shows strong signs of interaction with a complex circumstellar medium, seen by the detection of X-rays, revealed by the detection of coronal emission lines, and through multi-component hydrogen and helium profiles. In order to further understand this interaction, we model the H{\alpha} profile using a Monte-Carlo electron scattering code. The blueshifted high-velocity component is consistent with emission from a radially thin, spherical shell resulting in the broad emission components due to electron scattering. Using the velocity evolution of this emitting shell, we find that the SN ejecta collide with circumstellar material of at least 5 Msun, assuming a steady-state mass-loss rate of 4-6e-3 Msun per year for the first ~200 days of evolution. Continuing the observations of SN 2021adxl may reveal signatures of dust formation or an infrared excess, similar to that seen for SN 2010jl.</description>

Abstract: We present an analytic, quasi-local model for accretion discs threaded by net, vertical magnetic flux. In a simple slab geometry and ignoring stochastic mean-field dynamo effects, we calculate the large-scale field resulting from the balance between kinematic field amplification and turbulent diffusion. The ability of the disc to accumulate magnetic flux is sensitive to a single parameter dependent on the ratio of the vertical diffusion time to the Alfv\'en crossing time, and we show how the saturation levels of magnetorotational and other instabilities can govern disc structure and evolution. Under wide-ranging conditions, inflow is governed by large-scale magnetic stresses rather than internal viscous stress. We present models of such "magnetically boosted" discs and show that they lack a radiation pressure-dominated zone. Our model can account for "magnetically elevated" discs as well as instances of midplane outflow and field reversals with height that have been seen in some global simulations. Using the time-dependent features of our model, we find that the incorporation of global transport effects into disc structure can lead to steady or episodic "magnetically arrested discs" (MADs) that maximize the concentration of magnetic flux in their central regions.</description>
