      <title>Collisional stopping power of ions in warm dense matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08714v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A model for the collisional stopping of ions on free electrons in warm dense matter is developed and explored. It is based on plasma kinetic theory, but with modifications to address the warm dense matter regime. Specifically, it uses the Boltzmann-Uehling-Uhlenbeck kinetic equation to incorporate effects of Fermi degeneracy of electrons. The cross section is computed from quantum scattering of electrons and ions occuring via the potential of mean force derived from an average atom model, which incorporates effects of strong Coulomb correlations. Predictions from this model show comparable accuracy to results from time-dependent density functional theory calculations for deuterium near solid density and a temperature of several electronvolts, at a fraction of the computational cost. Further, the model captures the transition of a plasma from the classical limit to the degenerate limit, including qualitative behaviors of solid state theory.</description>

      <title>Enabling Integrated AI Control on DIII-D: A Control System Design with State-of-the-art Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the design and application of a general algorithm for Prediction And Control using MAchiNe learning (PACMAN) in DIII-D. Machine learing (ML)-based predictors and controllers have shown great promise in achieving regimes in which traditional controllers fail, such as tearing mode free scenarios, ELM-free scenarios and stable advanced tokamak conditions. The architecture presented here was deployed on DIII-D to facilitate the end-to-end implementation of advanced control experiments, from diagnostic processing to final actuation commands. This paper describes the detailed design of the algorithm and explains the motivation behind each design point. We also describe several successful ML control experiments in DIII-D using this algorithm, including a reinforcement learning controller targeting advanced non-inductive plasmas, a wide-pedestal quiescent H-mode ELM predictor, an Alfv\'en Eigenmode controller, a Model Predictive Control plasma profile controller and a state-machine Tearing Mode predictor-controller. There is also discussion on guiding principles for real-time machine learning controller design and implementation.</description>

      <title>Molecular Dynamics Simulations of Temperature Relaxation in Non-Neutral Plasmas Relevant to Antimatter Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08849v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An important process for antimatter experiments is the cooling of particles in a Penning-Malmberg trap to experimentally useful temperatures. A non-neutral plasma of one species (e.g. antiprotons) can be collisionally cooled on another colder species (e.g. electrons). Modeling temperature relaxation in these devices is challenging from a plasma physics perspective because the particles are strongly magnetized (the gyrofrequency exceeds the plasma frequency). Recently, a theoretical model was proposed to describe the temperature evolution in these conditions, predicting a multistep relaxation process where temperatures parallel to the magnetic field relax much faster than perpendicular to it. Here, this model is tested using molecular dynamics simulations. Two analysis methods are applied: one based on an imposed temperature difference, and the other based on a Green-Kubo relation. The results of the simulations support the theoretical predictions. This work extends previous studies of temperature anisotropy relaxation in one-component non-neutral plasmas to the two-component systems relevant to trapped antimatter experiments.</description>

      <title>A Fully Spin and Polarization Resolved Strong Field QED Algorithm for Particle-in-Cell Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08929v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern ultra-intense laser facilities can generate electromagnetic fields strong enough to accelerate particles to near-light speeds over micron-scale distances and also approach the QED critical field, resulting in highly nonlinear and relativistic quantum phenomena. For such conditions, ab-initio modeling techniques are required that capture the electromagnetic, relativistic particle, and quantum emission processes in the plasma. One such technique is particle-in-cell (PIC) simulation. In this paper, we describe the underlying theory for and development, validation, and verification of an extension to standard QED-PIC in the OSIRIS framework to include spin- and polarization-resolved QED processes central to next-generation laser-plasma experiments. This code can advance the current understanding of spin- and polarization-dependent QED phenomena in ultra-intense laser-plasma interactions.</description>

      <title>PIC analysis of spatiotemporal THz emission from radial and longitudinal wakefields via copropagating chirped lasers in magnetized rippled plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The excitation of radial and longitudinal wake-fields by two co-propagating chirped laser pulses in a rippled, magnetized plasma has been examined. This study aimed to clarify the spatiotemporal evolution of wake structures and assess their role in the generation of THz radiation. A Fourier-Bessel Particle-In-Cell (FBPIC) simulation framework, optimized for cylindrical geometries, has been employed to model the relativistic dynamics of plasma electrons under the combined influence of laser-induced ponderomotive forces and an external magnetic field. It has been shown that the beat frequency between the pulses modulates the ponderomotive force, driving nonlinear wake-field structures sustained by electron oscillations. Simulations performed with high spatial resolution have revealed that wake-field amplitude and coherence are strongly influenced by laser chirp, pulse duration, and plasma density. Distinct THz peaks have been identified in the Fourier-transformed spectra, with their amplitudes enhanced by resonant coupling between wake-field harmonics and the laser frequency modulation. Moreover, electron motion has been confined by the magnetic field, leading to improved energy gain and shaping of angular radiation patterns. These findings suggest that tailored laser and plasma configurations can be used to optimize energy transfer mechanisms, paving the way for more efficient wake-field usage and THz generation.</description>

      <title>3D PIC simulation and theoretical modeling of RF Laser pulse in magnetized plasma for the generation of multidimensional relativistic Wakefields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09079v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The present study, investigates the modulation of plasma wakefields in dense magnetized plasma driven by relativistic electron beams under transverse RF excitation. A self consistent theoretical framework, comprising the RF vector potential, Maxwells equations, and relativistic electron motion, is extended through full 3D electromagnetic particle in cell simulations. The results reveal systematic amplification and reshaping of wakefields under the combined action of external magnetic fields and RF drivers. Variations in the cyclotron to plasma frequency ratio dictate the radial positioning and gyromotion of plasma electrons, sharpening transverse confinement and stabilizing blowout structures. The RF amplitude introduces progressive modulation of radial excursions and transverse forces, enhancing wakefield symmetry and depth. Current density distributions confirm the nonlinear scaling with RF strength, evolving from weak perturbations into sharply structured ion channels. Scalar potentials and longitudinal fields exhibit pronounced sensitivity to pulse shape, polarization angle, frequency ratio, and driver density, each parameter producing distinct oscillatory features and confinement regimes. Plasma density sets the field strength and radial localization, while the modulation parameter governs the emergence of fine scale oscillatory bands, producing smooth to multiband transitions in longitudinal electric fields. Across all conditions, simulations confirm the reinforcement of ponderomotive force, resulting in controlled narrowing of electron sheaths, sharper scalar potential gradients, and extended acceleration zones.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamic PIC analysis of THz generation by two color laser in various plasma gases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09083v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present study, a theoretical and PIC numerical investigation of THz emission driven by two color femtosecond laser fields in gaseous plasmas is conducted. The model is formulated in cylindrical coordinates to capture the inherent radial symmetry of laser plasma interactions. Starting from a hydrodynamic description of plasma electrons coupled with Maxwells equations, the nonlinear photocurrent dynamics that underpin the emission process is derived. The results reveal that the asymmetry induced by the superposition of the fundamental and second-harmonic fields plays a central role in breaking inversion symmetry, thereby generating a net directional current that radiates in the THz regime. Systematic analysis demonstrates that gas composition, ionization fraction, and the intensity ratio of the two fields strongly influence both the spectral characteristics and efficiency of THz radiation.</description>

      <title>Gyrokinetic Simulations of a Low Recycling Scrape-off Layer without a Lithium Target</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09437v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low-recycling regimes are appealing because they entail a high edge temperature and low edge density which are good for core confinement. However, due to considerably enhanced heat flux, the exhaust problems become severe. In addition, in the low-recycling regime, the conventional fluid simulations may not capture the physics of the Scrape-Off Layer (SOL) plasma that lies in the long mean free path regime; kinetic calculations become necessary. In this paper, by performing both Kinetic and fluid simulations, we explore the feasibility of a low-recycling regime in the magnetic geometry of the Spherical Tokamak for Energy Production (STEP); kinetic effects come out to be crucial determinants of the SOL dynamics. The simulation results indicate that a high SOL temperature and low SOL density could be achieved even when the divertor target is not made of a low recycling material. This can be done by using a low recycling material as a wall material. This is an important step towards demonstrating the feasibility of a low-recycling scenario. Lithium, a commonly used low recycling material, tends to evaporate at high heat fluxes which counteracts the desired high temperature, low density regime, and materials that can handle high heat fluxes are generally high recycling. Comparisons of gyrokinetic and fluid simulation results indicate that one can take advantage of kinetic effects to address some of the issues associated with a low-recycling SOL. Specifically, kinetic simulations show better confinement of impurities to the divertor region and greater broadening of the heat flux width due to drifts when compared with fluid simulations. Impurity confinement would help prevent core contamination from sputtering, and a broader heat flux width would help reduce the peak heat load at the target in the absence of detachment.</description>

      <title>Restoring momentum conservation to magnetized quasilinear diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wave interactions with magnetized particles underly many plasma heating and current drive technologies. Typically, these interactions are modeled by bounce-averaging the quasilinear Kennel-Engelmann diffusion tensor over the particle orbit. However, as an object derived in a two-dimensional space, the Kennel-Engelmann tensor does not fully respect the conservation of four-momentum required by the action conservation theorem, since it neglects the absorption of perpendicular momentum. This defect leads to incorrect predictions for the wave-induced cross-field particle transport. Here, we show how this defect can easily be fixed, by extending the tensor from two to four dimensions and matching the form required by four-momentum conservation. The resulting extended tensor, when bounce-averaged, recovers the form of the diffusion paths required by action-angle Hamiltonian theory. Importantly, the extended tensor should be easily implementable in Fokker-Planck codes through a mild modification of the existing Kennel-Engelmann tensor.</description>

      <title>Conservation of magnetic-helicity fluctuations due to spatial decorrelation of fluxes in decaying MHD turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09543v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hosking &amp; Schekochihin (2021, Phys. Rev. X 11, 041005) have proposed that statistically isotropic decaying MHD turbulence without net magnetic helicity conserves the mean square fluctuation level of magnetic helicity in large volumes -- or, equivalently, the integral over space of the two-point correlation function of the magnetic-helicity density, denoted $I_H$. Formally, the conservation and gauge invariance of $I_H$ require the vanishing of certain boundary terms related to the strength of long-range spatial correlations. These boundary terms represent the ability (or otherwise) of the turbulence to organise fluxes over arbitrarily large distances to deplete or enhance fluctuations of magnetic helicity. In this work, we present a theory of these boundary terms, employing a methodology analogous to that of Batchelor &amp; Proudman (1956, Philos. Trans. R. Soc. A 248, 369) to determine the relevant asymptotic forms of correlation functions. We find that long-range correlations of sufficient strength to violate the conservation of $I_H$ cannot develop dynamically if the evolution equation for the magnetic vector potential is chosen to be local in space. Likewise, we find that such correlations cannot develop for a wide class of gauge choices that make this equation non-local (including the Coulomb gauge). Nonetheless, we also identify a class of non-local gauge choices for which correlations that are sufficiently strong to violate the conservation of $I_H$ do appear possible. We verify our theoretical predictions for the case of the Coulomb gauge with measurements of correlation functions in a high-resolution numerical simulation.</description>

      <title>Plasma rotation driven by lasers with zero angular momentum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12880v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a novel mechanism in which plasma electrons and ions optically acquire angular momentum during local pump depletion of an azimuthally polarized laser, despite the laser carrying none. Using theoretical considerations and multi-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations, we find that this process is enabled by a strong frequency downshift at the gradually eroding laser pulse front. We further show that the angular momentum gained by the plasma electrons is compensated by the ions and by the combined electromagnetic fields of the laser and nonlinear plasma wave. By varying key laser parameters such as phase, frequency, and polarization, we demonstrate that the transverse momentum of high-energy electrons can be effectively controlled.</description>
