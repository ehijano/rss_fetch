      <title>Reducing Noise Figure and Nonlinear Penalty in Distributed Raman Amplifier System Utilizing Low-noise Forward Pumping Technique</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17815v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we experimentally and theoretically show the improvement in noise characteristics in a distributed Raman amplifier (DRA) system for wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) transmission, utilizing our proposed pumping technique. We show that forward (Fwd) pumping is clearly superior to backward (Bwd) pumping in terms of noise figure (NF) defined by amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) noise and gain. We also show that bi-directional pumping is a more desirable configuration for NF improvement. However, it is known that Bwd pumping is preferable to Fwd pumping in suppressing signal quality degradation caused by nonlinear optical effects, especially the interaction between signal and pump light. To compare these advantages and disadvantages of Fwd pumping, we conducted WDM transmission experiments using a recirculating loop including DRA and erbium doped fiber amplifiers. We measured the Q-factors of 9-channel 131.6-GBaud polarization division multiplexed probabilistically shaped 32-quadrature amplitude modulation signals while changing the ratio of Fwd pumping to Bwd pumping in the DRA. By introducing the previously proposed low-noise Fwd pumping technique, a higher Q-factor could be achieved with a lower signal launch power, even when the total Raman gain remained constant. A Q-factor improvement of 0.4 dB and signal launch power reduction of more than 3.4 dB were simultaneously achieved. We also show that when Fwd pumping was performed with a conventional pump light source, the disadvantage of Fwd pumping was more noticeable than its advantage.</description>

      <title>High-efficiency, cryogenic-compatible grating couplers on an AlN-on-sapphire platform through bottom-side coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17941v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sapphire is a commonly used substrate for wide-bandgap III-nitride photonic materials. However, its relatively high refractive index results in low transmission efficiency in grating couplers. Here, we propose and demonstrate that the transmission efficiency can be significantly enhanced by bottom-side coupling. A metal reflector is deposited on the top side of the chip, and the fiber array is glued to the bottom side of the substrate. We experimentally achieve a transmission efficiency as high as 42% per coupler on an aluminum nitride (AlN) on sapphire platform at the telecom wavelength. In addition, the grating couplers show a robust performance at a cryogenic temperature as low as 3~K for both transverse-electric (TE) and transverse-magnetic (TM) modes. Our results can be useful to a wide range of sapphire-based applications that require low coupling loss and cryogenic operation.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast Coherent Dynamics of Microring Modulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17986v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Next-generation computing clusters require ultra-high-bandwidth optical interconnects to support large-scale artificial-intelligence applications. In this context, microring modulators (MRMs) emerge as a promising solution. Nevertheless, their potential is curtailed by inherent challenges, such as pronounced frequency chirp and dynamic non-linearity. Moreover, a comprehensive understanding of their coherent dynamics is still lacking, which further constrains their applicability and efficiency. Consequently, these constraints have confined their use to spectrally inefficient intensity-modulation direct-detection links. In this work, we present a thorough study of MRM coherent dynamics, unlocking phase as a new dimension for MRM-based high-speed data transmission in advanced modulation formats. We demonstrate that the phase and intensity modulations of MRMs exhibit distinct yet coupled dynamics, limiting their direct application in higher-order modulation formats. This challenge can be addressed by embedding a pair of MRMs within a Mach-Zehnder interferometer in a push-pull configuration, enabling a bistable phase response and unchirped amplitude modulation. Furthermore, we show that its amplitude frequency response exhibits a distinct dependency on frequency detuning compared to phase and intensity modulations of MRMs, without strong peaking near resonance. Harnessing the ultra-fast coherent dynamics, we designed and experimentally demonstrated an ultra-compact, ultra-wide-bandwidth in-phase/quadrature (I/Q) modulator on a silicon chip fabricated using a CMOS-compatible photonic process. Achieving a record on-chip shoreline bandwidth density exceeding 5Tb/s/mm, our device enabled coherent transmission for symbol rates up to 180Gbaud and a net bit rate surpassing 1Tb/s over an 80km span, with modulation energy consumption as low as 10.4fJ/bit.</description>

      <title>Lensless speckle reconstructive spectrometer via physics-aware neural network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The speckle field yielded by disordered media is extensively employed for spectral measurements. Existing speckle reconstructive spectrometers (RSs) implemented by neural networks primarily rely on supervised learning, which necessitates large-scale spectra-speckle pairs. However, beyond system stability requirements for prolonged data collection, generating diverse spectra with high resolution and finely labeling them is particularly difficult. A lack of variety in datasets hinders the generalization of neural networks to new spectrum types. Here we avoid this limitation by introducing PhyspeNet, an untrained spectrum reconstruction framework combining a convolutional neural network (CNN) with a physical model of a chaotic optical cavity. Without pre-training and prior knowledge about the spectrum under test, PhyspeNet requires only a single captured speckle for various multi-wavelength reconstruction tasks. Experimentally, we demonstrate a lens-free, snapshot RS system by leveraging the one-to-many mapping between spatial and spectrum domains in a random medium. Dual-wavelength peaks separated by 2 pm can be distinguished, and a maximum working bandwidth of 40 nm is achieved with high measurement accuracy. This approach establishes a new paradigm for neural network-based RS systems, entirely eliminating reliance on datasets while ensuring that computational results exhibit a high degree of generalizability and physical explainability.</description>

      <title>Observation of Thouless pumping of light in quasiperiodic photonic crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological transport is determined by global properties of physical media where it occurs and is characterized by quantized amounts of adiabatically transported quantities. Discovered for periodic potentials it was also explored in disordered and discrete quasi-periodic systems. Here we report on experimental observation of pumping of a light beam in a genuinely continuous incommensurate photorefractive quasi-crystal emulated by its periodic approximants. We observe a universal character of the transport which is determined by the ratio between periods of the constitutive sublattices, by the sliding angle between them, and by Chern numbers of the excited bands (in the time-coordinate space) of the approximant, for which pumping is adiabatic. This reveals that the properties of quasi-periodic systems determining the topological transport are tightly related to those of their periodic approximants and can be observed and studied in a large variety of physical systems. Our results suggest that the links between quasi periodic systems and their periodic approximants go beyond the pure mathematical relations: they manifest themselves in physical phenomena which can be explored experimentally.</description>

      <title>Observation of localization of light in photonic quasicrystals of diverse symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18253v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quasicrystals are ubiquitous in nature. Beyond crystalline solids, they can be created as optically induced or technologically fabricated structures in photonic and phononic systems, as potentials for cold atoms and Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs). On a parwith the unusual structural properties of quasicrystals, nowadays the problem of wave propagation in such two-dimensional structures attracts considerable attention, already in earlier studies it was predicted that the lowest electronic states in five-fold quasicrystals are localized. Later on localization of BECs in an eight-fold rotational symmetric quasicrystal optical lattices was observed. Direct observation of localization in purely linear photonic quasicrystals, therefore, remains elusive. Here, using sets of interfering plane waves, we create photonic two-dimensional quasicrystals with different rotational symmetries, not allowed in periodic crystallographic structures. We demonstrate experimentally that linear localization of light does occur even in clean linear quasicrystals for probe beams propagating both in the center and off-center regions of the quasicrystals. We found that light localization occurs above a critical depth of optically induced potential and that this critical depth rapidly decreases with the increase of the order of the discrete rotational symmetry of the quasicrystal. Our results clarify a long-standing problem of wave localization in linear quasicrystals and elucidate the conditions under which this phenomenon occurs. These findings pave the way for achieving wave localization in a wide variety of aperiodic systems obeying discrete symmetries, with possible applications in photonics, atomic physics, acoustics, and condensed matter.</description>

      <title>Detectorless 3D terahertz imaging: achieving subwavelength resolution with reflectance confocal interferometric microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18403v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Terahertz imaging holds great potential for non-destructive material inspection, but practical implementation has been limited by resolution constraints. In this study, we present a novel single-pixel THz imaging system based on a confocal microscope architecture, utilising a quantum cascade laser as both transmitter and phase-sensitive receiver. Our approach addresses these challenges by integrating laser feedback interferometry detection, achieving a two-fold improvement in lateral resolution compared to conventional reflectance confocal microscopy and a dramatic enhancement in axial resolution through precise interferometric phase measurements. This breakthrough provides lateral resolution near $\lambda/2$ and a depth of focus better than $\lambda/5$, significantly outperforming traditional confocal systems. The system can produce a 0.5 Mpixel image in under two minutes, surpassing both raster-scanning single-pixel and multipixel focal-plane array-based imagers. Coherent operation enables simultaneous amplitude and phase image acquisition, and a novel visualisation method links amplitude to image saturation and phase to hue, enhancing material characterisation. A 3D tomographic analysis of a silicon chip reveals subwavelength features, demonstrating the system's potential for high-resolution THz imaging and material analysis. This work sets a new benchmark for THz imaging, overcoming key challenges and opening up transformative possibilities for non-destructive material inspection and characterisation.</description>

      <title>Heterodyne coherent detection of the electric field temporal trace emitted by frequency-modulated comb lasers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18438v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Frequency-modulated (FM) combs are produced by mode-locked lasers in which the electric field has a linearly chirped frequency and nearly constant amplitude. This regime of operation occurs naturally in certain laser systems and constitutes a valuable alternative to generate spectra with equidistant modes. Here, we use a low-noise fs-pulse comb as the local oscillator and combine dual comb heterodyne detection with time domain analysis of the multi-heterodyne signal to reveal the temporal trace of both amplitude and phase quadratures of FM comb lasers' electric field. This technique is applied to both a dense and a harmonic mid-infrared free-running quantum cascade laser frequency comb and shows direct evidence of the FM behavior together with the high degree of coherence of these sources. Our results furnish a deeper insight on the origin of the FM combs and pave the way to further improvement and optimization of these devices.</description>

      <title>Efficient broadband antenna for a quantum emitter working at telecommunication wavelengths</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.18472v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Single photons are resources needed for developing quantum networks QN. They distribute quantum information services across commercial optical fiber links and are key ingredient in developing quantum repeaters architectures. Currently, the most robust quantum light sources are Quantum Dots made of III-V materials. They emit highly indistinguishable photons on-demand and with high efficiency. Established devices work at near-infrared wavelengths (NIR) and further research is needed to develop devices working in telecommunication wavelengths O- and S-bands. In this contribution, we propose and model a broadband optical antenna working in O-band. It exhibits high extraction efficiencies with small Purcell enhancement around 2. We also examine far field emission from these structures, ensuring Gaussian mode profile is observed.</description>

      <title>Inline-Amplification-Free Time Transfer Utilizing Waveform-Resolved Single-Photon Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18503v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-precision time transfer over a long haul of fiber plays a significant role in many fields. The core method, namely cascading relay nodes for the compensation of signal attenuation and dispersion, is however insufficient to deal with crucial point-to-point transfer scenarios, such as harsh environments with extremely deficient infrastructure and emergency conditions. In long-distance signal transmission without any inline amplifiers, the high loss of the optical fiber link becomes the primary limiting factor, and direct use of traditional photodetectors at the receiving end will bring about a significant drop in the stability of detected signals. Here we propose a waveform-resolved single photon detection technique and experimentally perform tomography on the weak transferred signal with an average photon number of just 0.617 per pulse. By adopting this technique, we achieve the time deviation of 95.68 ps and 192.58 ps at 200 km and 300 km respectively at an averaging time of 1 s, overcoming the technical lower bound induced by traditional photodetectors. This work lays the foundation for through-type time transfer with high precision in those significant inline-amplification-free scenarios.</description>

Abstract: Biofilms are resistant microbial cell aggregates that pose risks to health and food industries and produce environmental contamination. Accurate and efficient detection and prevention of biofilms are challenging and demand interdisciplinary approaches. This multidisciplinary research reports the application of a deep learning-based artificial intelligence (AI) model for detecting biofilms produced by Pseudomonas aeruginosa with high accuracy. Aptamer DNA templated silver nanocluster (Ag-NC) was used to prevent biofilm formation, which produced images of the planktonic states of the bacteria. Large-volume bright field images of bacterial biofilms were used to design the AI model. In particular, we used U-Net with ResNet encoder enhancement to segment biofilm images for AI analysis. Different degrees of biofilm structures can be efficiently detected using ResNet18 and ResNet34 backbones. The potential applications of this technique are also discussed.</description>

Abstract: Classical vector waves can possess dedicated spin angular momenta (SAM), which are \emph{perpendicular} to the propagation direction, as revealed by recent recognition of transverse SAM in electromagnetic (EM) fields. In this paper, we adopt the Hertz potential method to define structured vector fields and derive analytically the SAM of the wave fields in closed form. Our calculations not only confirm that transverse SAM may originate from the first-order spatial inhomogeneity of the momentum of EM waves, but also point out that for non-planar vector waves with near fields, an extraordinary spin appears as a distinct part of transverse spin. We further demonstrate that the proposed transverse spins appear universally in various structured propagating waves. This work renews the fundamental understanding of the decomposition of SAM for classical vector waves.</description>

      <title>Interpreting Purcell Enhancement of Non-Hermitian Metasurfaces with Spectral Parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05427v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Purcell effect describes the enhancement of the spontaneous emission rate of an emitter near a resonant structure. However, evaluating the Purcell factor quantitatively and empirically is difficult due to the difficulties in measuring the electromagnetic nearfield of an optical resonance for calculation of the exact effective modal volume, especially with non-Hermitian resonators. Therefore, we propose a new analytical approach to circumvent the need to measure the nearfield and predict the Purcell enhancement with spectral parameters, which can be directly measured in farfield or fitted from such spectral measurements. Our proposed model predicts the averaged Purcell enhancement by metasurfaces on a photoluminescent medium, and is verified with experimental measurements and numerical simulations of nanoparticle arrays coupled to a fluorescent thin film. The model directly analyzes the photoluminescence enhancement and extraction efficiency of metasurface, and can be generalized to work with arbitrarily-shaped photoluminescent medium that is coupled to a resonator. This discovery provides a practical and accessible way to understand the underlying mechanisms of photoluminescence enhancement and will facilitate optimization of metasurfaces for efficient extraction of the enhanced luminescence.</description>

Abstract: To find a suitable incubator for nonlinear crystal optics(NCO), we have revisited linear crystal optics(LCO). At the methodological level, three widely used plane wave bases are compared in terms of eigenanalysis in reciprocal space and light field propagation in real space. Inspired by complex ray tracing, we expand M.V. Berry's 2003 uniform plane wave model to non-uniform Fourier crystal optics(FCO) and ultimately derive the explicit form of its 3$\times$2 transition matrix, bridging the two major branches of crystal optics(CO) in reciprocal space, where either ray direction $\hat{k}$ or spatial frequency $\bar{k}_{\mathrm{\rho}}$ serves as the input variable. Using this model, we create the material-matrix tetrahedral compass(M-M TC) to conduct a detailed analysis of how the four fundamental characteristics of materials (linear/circular birefringence/dichroism) influence the eigensystems of the vector electric field in two-dimensional(2D) spatial frequency $\bar{k}_{\mathrm{\rho}}$ domain and its distribution in three-dimensional(3D) $\bar{r}$ space with a crystal-2f system. Along this journey, we have uncovered new territories in LCO in both real and reciprocal space, such as infinite singularities arranged in disk-, ring-, and crescent-like shapes, ``L shorelines'' resembling hearts, generalized haunting theorem, double conical refraction, and optical knots it induces. We also present our model's early applications in focal engineering and NCO.</description>

      <title>High-order alloharmonics produced by nonperiodic drivers</title>

Abstract: High-order harmonics are ubiquitous in nature and present in electromagnetic, acoustic, and gravitational waves. They are generated by periodic nonlinear processes or periodic high-frequency pulses. However, this periodicity is often inexact, such as that in chirped (frequency-swept) optical waveforms or interactions with nonstationary matter - for instance, reflection from accelerating mirrors. Spectra observed in such cases often contain complicated sets of harmonic-like fringes, uninterpretable or even misinterpretable via standard Fourier analysis. Here, we propose the concept of alloharmonics, i.e. spectral interference of harmonics with different orders, fully explaining the formation of these fringes (from Greek $\ddot{{\alpha}}{\lambda}{\lambda}{\omicron}{\varsigma}$: \'allos, "other"). Like atomic spectra, the complex alloharmonic spectra depend on several integer numbers and bear a unique imprint of the emission process, such as the driver period and its time derivatives, which the alloharmonic theory can decipher. We demonstrate laser-driven alloharmonics experimentally in the extreme ultraviolet spectral region and extract nonperiodicity parameters. We analyze previously published simulations of gravitational waves emitted by binary black hole mergers and demonstrate alloharmonics there. Further, we predict the presence of alloharmonics in the radio spectra of pulsars and in optical frequency combs, and propose their use for measurement of extremely small accelerations necessary for testing gravity theories. The alloharmonics phenomenon generalizes classical harmonics and is critical in attosecond physics, frequency comb generation, pulsar studies, and future gravitational wave spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>Probing levitodynamics with multi-stochastic forces and the simple applications on the dark matter detection in optical levitation experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.04202v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: If the terrestrial environment is permeated by dark matter, the levitation experiences damping forces and fluctuations attributed to dark matter. This paper investigates levitodynamics with multiple stochastic forces, including thermal drag, photon recoil, feedback, etc., assuming that all of these forces adhere to the fluctuation-dissipation theorem. The ratio of total damping to the stochastic damping coefficient distinguishes the levitodynamics from cases involving only one single stochastic force. The heating and cooling processes are formulated to determine the limits of temperature change. All sources of stochastic forces are comprehensively examined, revealing that dark matter collisions cannot be treated analogously to fluid dynamics. Additionally, a meticulous analysis is presented, elucidating the intricate relationship between the fundamental transfer cross-section and the macroscopic transfer cross-section. While the dark damping coefficient is suppressed by the mass of the levitated particle, scattering can be coherently enhanced based on the scale of the component microscopic particle, the atomic form factor, and the static structure factor. Hence, dark damping holds the potential to provide valuable insights into the detection of the macroscopic strength of fundamental particles. We propose experimental procedures for levitation and employ linear estimation to extract the dark damping coefficient. Utilizing current levitation results, we demonstrate that the fundamental transfer cross section of dark matter can be of the order $\sigma^{\rm D}_{T}\lsim {\cal O}(10^{-26})\rm cm^2$.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear semiclassical spectroscopy of ultrafast molecular polariton dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16630v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a theoretical framework that allows for the systematic and efficient description of the ultrafast nonlinear response of molecular polaritons, i.e., hybrid light-matter states, in the collective regime of large numbers of molecules $\mathcal N$ coupled to the cavity photon mode. Our approach is based on a semiclassical, mean-field evolution of the molecular Hamiltonian and the cavity field, which is complemented by a perturbative expansion of both light and matter counterparts in the input fields entering the cavity. In addition, expansion in terms of the pulse phases enables us to disentangle different excitation pathways in Liouville space, thereby distinguishing contributions to the nonlinear response. The formalism extends traditional free-space nonlinear spectroscopy by incorporating the feedback of matter onto the light field via the induced polarization. We demonstrate the utility of the framework by applying it to the calculation of pump-probe polariton spectra and show how, by storing the pulses, the cavity facilitates additional excitation pathways which are not possible in free space. Our method, which does not scale with $\mathcal N$, is broadly applicable and can be extended to a wide range of current experiments investigating the dynamical nonlinear response of hybrid light-matter states.</description>
