      <title>Solutions of differential equations in Freud-weighted Sobolev spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13672v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We lay some mathematically rigorous foundations for the resolution of differential equations with respect to semi-classical bases and topologies, namely Freud-Sobolev polynomials and spaces. In this quest, we uncover an elegant theory melding various topics in Numerical and Functional Analysis: Poincar\'e inequalities, Sobolev orthogonal polynomials, Painlev\'e equations and more. Brought together, these ingredients allow us to quantify the compactness of Sobolev embeddings on Freud-weighted spaces and finally resolve some differential equations in this topology. As an application, we rigorously and tightly enclose solutions of the Gross-Pitaevskii equation with sextic potential.</description>

      <title>Unique continuation for locally uniformly distributed measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13869v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note we show that the support of a locally $k$-uniform measure in $\mathbb R^{n+1}$ satisfies a kind of unique continuation property. As a consequence, we show that locally uniformly distributed measures satisfy a weaker unique continuation property. This continues work of Kirchheim and Preiss (Math. Scand. 2002) and David, Kenig and Toro (Comm. Pure Appl. Math. 2001) and lends additional evidence to the conjecture proposed by Kowalski and Preiss (J. Reine Angew. Math. 1987) that the support of a locally $n$-uniform measure in $\mathbb R^{n+1}$ is contained in the zero set of a quadratic polynomial.</description>

      <title>Algebraicity and integrality of solutions to differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13175v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We formulate a conjecture classifying algebraic solutions to (possibly non-linear) algebraic differential equations, in terms of the primes appearing in the denominators of the coefficients of their Taylor expansion at a non-singular point. For linear differential equations, this conjecture is a strengthening of the Grothendieck-Katz $p$-curvature conjecture. We prove the conjecture for many differential equations and initial conditions of algebro-geometric interest. For linear differential equations, we prove it for Picard-Fuchs equations at initial conditions corresponding to cycle classes, among other cases. For non-linear differential equations, we prove it for isomonodromy differential equations, such as the Painlev\'e VI equation and Schlesinger system, at initial conditions corresponding to Picard-Fuchs equations. We draw a number of algebro-geometric consequences from the proofs.</description>

      <title>Completeness and additive property for submeasures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13615v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given an extended real-valued submeasure $\nu$ defined on a field of subsets $\Sigma$ of a given set, we provide necessary and sufficient conditions for which the pseudometric $d_\nu$ defined by $d_{\nu}(A,B):=\min\{1,\nu(A\bigtriangleup B)\}$ for all $A,B \in \Sigma$ is complete. As an application, we show that if $\varphi: \mathcal{P}(\omega)\to [0,\infty]$ is a lower semicontinuous submeasure and $\nu(A):=\lim_n \varphi(A\setminus \{0, 1, \ldots, n-1\})$ for all $A\subseteq \omega$, then $d_\nu$ is complete. This includes the case of all weighted upper densities, fixing a gap in a proof by Just and Krawczyk in [Trans.~Amer.~Math.~Soc.~\textbf{285} (1984), 803--816]. In contrast, we prove that if $\nu$ is the upper Banach density (or an upper density greater than or equal to the latter) then $d_\nu$ is not complete.</description>

      <title>Projecting dynamical systems via a support bound</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13680v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For a polynomial dynamical system, we study the problem of computing the minimal differential equation satisfied by a chosen coordinate (in other words, projecting the system on the coordinate). This problem can be viewed as a special case of the general elimination problem for systems of differential equations and appears in applications to modeling and control.
  We give a bound for the Newton polytope of such minimal equation and show that our bound is sharp in "more than half of the cases". We further use this bound to design an algorithm for computing the minimal equation following the evaluation-interpolation paradigm. We demonstrate that our implementation of the algorithm can tackle problems which are out of reach for the state-of-the-art software for differential elimination.</description>

      <title>On the $L^q$ dimension of stationary measures for M\"{o}bius iterated function systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13729v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the $L^q$ dimension $D(\nu,q)\ (q&gt;1)$ of stationary measures $\nu$ for M\"{o}bius iterated function systems on $\mathbb{R}$ satisfying the strongly Diophantine condition, and try the extension of Shmerkin's result \cite[Theorem 6.6]{Shm19}. As the result, we show that there is the dichotomy: the $L^q$ spectrum $\tau(\nu,q)=(q-1)D(\nu,q)$ is equal to the desired value $\min\{\widetilde{\tau}(\nu,q),q-1\}$ for any $q&gt;1$, where $\widetilde{\tau}(\nu,q)$ is the zero of the canonical pressure function, or there exist $q_0&gt;1$ and $0&lt;\alpha&lt;1$ such that $\tau(\nu,q)=\min\{\widetilde{\tau}(\nu,q),q-1\}$ for $1&lt;q&lt;q_0$ and $\tau(\nu,q)=\alpha q$ for $q\geq q_0$. In addition, we give examples of M\"{o}bius iterated function systems which show the latter case by giving an affirmative answer to Solomyak's question \cite[Question 2]{Sol24}.</description>

      <title>On Iverson's law of similarity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.07670v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Iverson (2006) proposed the law of similarity \[ \xi_{s}(\lambda x)= \gamma(\lambda, s)\xi_{\eta(\lambda, s)}(x) \] for the sensitivity functions $\xi_{s}\, (s\in S)$. Compared to the former models, the generality of this one lies in that here $\gamma$ and $\eta$ can also depend on the variables $\lambda$ and $s$. In the literature, this model (or its special cases) is usually considered together with a given psychophysical representation (e.g. Fechnerian, subtractive, or affine). Our goal, however, is to study at first Iverson's law of similarity on its own. At first we show that if certain mild assumptions are fulfilled, then $\xi$ can be written in a rather simple form containing only one-variable functions. The obtained form proves to be very useful when we assume some kind of representation.
  Motivated by Hsu and Iverson (2016), in the second part of the third section we study the above model assuming that the mapping $\eta$ is multiplicatively translational. First, we show how these mappings can be characterized. Later on we turn to the examination of the so-called power law. According to our results, the corresponding function $\xi$ then does not have a Fechnerian representation, but it do have a subtractive representation. As an application of the results of the subsection, we close the paper with the study of the shift invariance property.</description>

      <title>Almost periodicity and boundary values of Dirichlet series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03522v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We employ almost periodicity to establish analogues of the Hardy--Stein identity and the Littlewood--Paley formula for Hardy spaces of Dirichlet series. A construction of Saksman and Seip shows that the limits in this Littlewood--Paley formula cannot be interchanged. We apply this construction to show that the limits in the definition of the mean counting function for Dirichlet series cannot be interchanged. These are essentially statements about the two different kinds of boundary values that we associate with Dirichlet series that converge to a bounded analytic function in a half-plane. The treatment of the mean counting function also involves an investigation of the zero sets and Blaschke products of such Dirichlet series.</description>

      <title>Dimension of Diophantine approximation and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12826v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we construct a new family of sets via Diophantine approximation, in which the classical examples are endpoints.
  Our first application is on their Hausdorff dimension. We show a recent result of Ren and Wang, known sharp on orthogonal projections in the plane, is also sharp on $A+cB$, $c\in C$, thus completely settle this ABC sum-product problem. Higher dimensional examples are also discussed.
  In addition to Hausdorff dimension, we also consider Fourier dimension. In particular, now for every $0\leq t\leq s\leq 1$ we have an explicit construction in $\mathbb{R}$ of Hausdorff dimension $s$ and Fourier dimension $t$, together with a measure $\mu$ that captures both dimensions.
  In the end we give new sharpness examples for the Mockenhaupt-Mitsis-Bak-Seeger Fourier restriction theorem. In particular, to deal with the non-geometric case we construct measures of "Hausdorff dimension" $a$ and Fourier dimension $b$, even if $a&lt;b$. This clarifies some difference between sets and measures.</description>

      <title>The multilinear fractional sparse operator theory I: pointwise domination and weighted estimate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.21121v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: How to establish some specific quantitative weighted estimates for the generalized commutator of multilinear fractional singular integral operator $\mathcal{T}_{\eta}^{{\bf b}}$ is the focus of this paper, which is defined by $$\mathcal{T}_{\eta}^{{\bf b}}(\vec{f})(x):= \mathcal{T}_{\eta}\left((b_1(x) - b_1)^{\beta_1}f_1,\ldots,(b_m(x) - b_m)^{\beta_m}f_m\right)(x),$$ where $\mathcal{T}_{\eta}$ is a multilinear fractional singular integral operator, ${\bf b}:=({b_1}, \cdots ,{b_m})$ is a set of symbol functions, and $({\beta_1}, \cdots ,{\beta_m}) \in {\mathbb{N}_0^m}$.
  Pointwise dominating the aforementioned commutator leads us to consider a class of higher order multi-symbol multilinear fractional sparse operator ${\mathcal A}_{\eta ,\mathcal{S},\tau}^\mathbf{b,k,t}$ to achieve this long-cherished wish. Therefore, it suffices to construct its quantitative weighted estimates, which firstly include the characterization of several types of multilinear weighted conditions $A_{\vec p,q}^*$, $W_{\vec p,q}^\infty$, and $H_{\vec p,q}^\infty$. Within the scope of this work, Bloom type estimate for first order multi-symbol multilinear fractional sparse operator is established herein. Moreover, we derive two distinct Bloom type estimates for higher order multi-symbol multilinear fractional sparse operator by using "maximal weight method" and "iterated weight method" respectively, which not only refines some of Lerner's methods but greatly enhances the generality of our conclusions. Endpoint quantitative estimates for multilinear fractional singular integral operators and their first order commutators are also obtained as the last main result. It is also worthy of highlighting that some important multilinear fractional operators are applicable to our results as applications.</description>
