      <title>Investigation of discontinuous Galerkin methods in adjoint gradient-based aerodynamic shape optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18963v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work develops a robust and efficient framework of the adjoint gradient-based aerodynamic shape optimization (ASO) using high-order discontinuous Galerkin methods (DGMs) as the CFD solver. The adjoint-enabled gradients based on different CFD solvers or solution representations are derived in detail, and the potential advantage of DG representations is discovered that the adjoint gradient computed by the DGMs contains a modification term which implies information of higher-order moments of the solution as compared with finite volume methods (FVMs). A number of numerical cases are tested for investigating the impact of different CFD solvers (including DGMs and FVMs) on the evaluation of the adjoint-enabled gradients. The numerical results demonstrate that the DGMs can provide more precise adjoint gradients even on a coarse mesh as compared with the FVMs under coequal computational costs, and extend the capability to explore the design space, further leading to acquiring the aerodynamic shapes with more superior aerodynamic performance.</description>

      <title>The Variable Time-stepping DLN-Ensemble Algorithms for Incompressible Navier-Stokes Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19101v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the report, we propose a family of variable time-stepping ensemble algorithms for solving multiple incompressible Navier-Stokes equations (NSE) at one pass. The one-leg, two-step methods designed by Dahlquist, Liniger, and Nevanlinna (henceforth the DLN method) are non-linearly stable and second-order accurate under arbitrary time grids. We design the family of variable time-stepping DLN-Ensemble algorithms for multiple systems of NSE and prove that its numerical solutions are stable and second-order accurate in velocity under moderate time-step restrictions. Meanwhile, the family of algorithms can be equivalently implemented by a simple refactorization process: adding time filters on the backward Euler ensemble algorithm. In practice, we raise one time adaptive mechanism (based on the local truncation error criterion) for the family of DLN-Ensemble algorithms to balance accuracy and computational costs. Several numerical tests are to support the main conclusions of the report. The constant step test confirms the second-order convergence and time efficiency. The variable step test verifies the stability of the numerical solutions and the time efficiency of the adaptive mechanism.</description>

      <title>A Novel Gaussian filter-based Pressure Correction Technique with Super Compact Scheme for Unsteady 3D Incompressible, Viscous Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work deals with a novel Gaussian filter-based pressure correction technique with a super compact higher order finite difference scheme for solving unsteady three-dimensional (3D) incompressible, viscous flows. This pressure correction technique offers significant advantages in terms of optimizing computational time by taking minimum iterations to reach the required accuracy, making it highly efficient and cost-effective. Pressure fields often exhibit highly nonlinear behavior, and employing the Gaussian filter can help to enhance their reliability by reducing noise and uncertainties. On the other hand, the super compact scheme uses minimum grid points to produce second-order accuracy in time and fourth-order accuracy in space variables. The main focus of this study is to enhance the accuracy and efficiency and minimize the computational cost of solving complex fluid flow problems. The super compact scheme utilizes 19 grid points at the known time level (i.e., $n^{th}$ time level) and only seven grid points from the unknown time level (i.e., $n + 1$ time level). By employing the above strategies, it becomes possible to notably decrease computational expenses while maintaining the accuracy of the computational scheme for solving complex fluid flow problems. We have implemented our methodology across three distinct scenarios: the 3D Burger's equation having analytical solution, and two variations of the lid-driven cavity problem. The outcomes of our numerical simulations exhibit a remarkable concordance, aligning exceptionally well with both the analytical benchmarks and previously validated numerical findings for the cavity problems.</description>

      <title>Regularity Analysis and High-Order Time Stepping Scheme for Quasilinear Subdiffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19146v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate a quasilinear subdiffusion model which involves a fractional derivative of order $\alpha \in (0,1)$ in time and a nonlinear diffusion coefficient. First, using smoothing properties of solution operators for linear subdiffusion and a perturbation argument, we prove several pointwise-in-time regularity estimates that are useful for numerical analysis. Then we develop a high-order time stepping scheme for solving quasilinear subdiffusion, based on convolution quadrature generated by second-order backward differentiation formula with correction at the first step. Further, we establish that the convergence order of the scheme is $O(\tau^{1+\alpha-\epsilon})$ without imposing any additional assumption on the regularity of the solution. The analysis relies on refined Sobolev regularity of the nonlinear perturbation remainder and smoothing properties of discrete solution operators. Several numerical experiments in two space dimensions show the sharpness of the error estimate.</description>

      <title>The jump filter in the discontinuous Galerkin method for hyperbolic conservation laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When simulating hyperbolic conservation laws with discontinuous solutions, high-order linear numerical schemes often produce undesirable spurious oscillations. In this paper, we propose a jump filter within the discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method to mitigate these oscillations. This filter operates locally based on jump information at cell interfaces, targeting high-order polynomial modes within each cell. Besides its localized nature, our proposed filter preserves key attributes of the DG method, including conservation, $L^2$ stability, and high-order accuracy. We also explore its compatibility with other damping techniques, and demonstrate its seamless integration into a hybrid limiter. In scenarios featuring strong shock waves, this hybrid approach, incorporating this jump filter as the low-order limiter, effectively suppresses numerical oscillations while exhibiting low numerical dissipation. Additionally, the proposed jump filter maintains the compactness of the DG scheme, which greatly aids in efficient parallel computing. Moreover, it boasts an impressively low computational cost, given that no characteristic decomposition is required and all computations are confined to physical space. Numerical experiments validate the effectiveness and performance of our proposed scheme, confirming its accuracy and shock-capturing capabilities.</description>

      <title>Permuted preconditioning for extended saddle point problem arising from Neumann boundary control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, a new block preconditioner is proposed for the saddle point problem arising from the Neumann boundary control problem. In order to deal with the singularity of the stiffness matrix, the saddle point problem is first extended to a new one by a regularization of the pure Neumann problem. Then after row permutations of the extended saddle point problem, a new block triangular preconditioner is constructed based on an approximation of the Schur complement. We analyze the eigenvalue properties of the preconditioned matrix and provide eigenvalue bounds. Numerical results illustrate the efficiency of the proposed preconditioning method.</description>

      <title>Reflective block Kaczmarz algorithms for least squares</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In [Steinerberger, Q. Appl. Math., 79:3, 419-429, 2021] and [Shao, SIAM J. Matrix Anal. Appl. 44(1), 212-239, 2023], two new types of Kaczmarz algorithms, which share some similarities, for consistent linear systems were proposed. These two algorithms not only compete with many previous Kaczmarz algorithms but, more importantly, reveal some interesting new geometric properties of solutions to linear systems that are not obvious from the standard viewpoint of the Kaczmarz algorithm. In this paper, we comprehensively study these two algorithms. First, we theoretically analyse the algorithms given in [Steinerberger, Q. Appl. Math., 79:3, 419-429, 2021] for solving least squares. Second, we extend the two algorithms to block versions and provide their theoretical convergence rates. Our numerical experiments also verify the efficiency of these algorithms. Third, as a theoretical complement, we address some key questions left unanswered in [Shao, SIAM J. Matrix Anal. Appl. 44(1), 212-239, 2023].</description>

      <title>Isovolumetric Energy Minimization for Ball-Shaped Volume-Preserving Parameterizations of 3-Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19272v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A volume-preserving parameterization is a bijective mapping that maps a 3-manifold onto a specified canonical domain that preserves the local volume. This paper formulates the computation of ball-shaped volume-preserving parameterizations as an isovolumetric energy minimization (IEM) problem with the boundary points constrained on a unit sphere. In addition, we develop a new preconditioned nonlinear conjugate gradient algorithm for solving the IEM problem with guaranteed theoretical convergence and significantly improved accuracy and computational efficiency compared to other state-of-the-art algorithms. Applications to solid shape registration and deformation are presented to highlight the usefulness of the proposed algorithm.</description>

      <title>Numerical Analysis for a Hyperbolic PDE-Constrained Optimization Problem in Acoustic Full Waveform Inversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19273v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores a fully discrete approximation for a nonlinear hyperbolic PDE-constrained optimization problem (P) with applications in acoustic full waveform inversion. The optimization problem is primarily complicated by the hyperbolic character and the second-order bilinear structure in the governing wave equation. While the control parameter is discretized using the piecewise constant elements, the state discretization is realized through an auxiliary first-order system along with the leapfrog time-stepping method and continuous piecewise linear elements. The resulting fully discrete minimization problem ($\text{P}_h$) is shown to be well-defined. Furthermore, building upon a suitable CFL-condition, we prove stability and uniform convergence of the state discretization. Our final result is the strong convergence result for ($\text{P}_h$) in the following sense: Given a local minimizer $\overline \nu$ of (P) satisfying a reasonable growth condition, there exists a sequence of local minimizers of ($\text{P}_h$) converging strongly towards $\overline \nu$.</description>

      <title>Convergence of Random Batch Method with replacement for interacting particle systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19315v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Random Batch Method (RBM) proposed in [Jin et al. J Comput Phys, 2020] is an efficient algorithm for simulating interacting particle systems. In this paper, we investigate the Random Batch Method with replacement (RBM-r), which is the same as the kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) method for the pairwise interacting particle system of size $N$. In the RBM-r algorithm, one randomly picks a small batch of size $p \ll N$, and only the particles in the picked batch interact among each other within the batch for a short time, where the weak interaction (of strength $\frac{1}{N-1}$) in the original system is replaced by a strong interaction (of strength $\frac{1}{p-1}$). Then one repeats this pick-interact process. This KMC algorithm dramatically reduces the computational cost from $O(N^2)$ to $O(pN)$ per time step, and provides an unbiased approximation of the original force/velocity field of the interacting particle system. In this paper, We give a rigorous proof of this approximation with an explicit convergence rate. An improved rate is also obtained when there is no diffusion in the system. Notably, the techniques in our analysis can potentially be applied to study KMC for other systems, including the stochastic Ising spin system.</description>

Abstract: We present a novel solution method for It\^o stochastic differential equations (SDEs). We subdivide the time interval into sub-intervals, then we use the quadratic polynomials for the approximation between two successive intervals. The main properties of the stochastic numerical methods, e.g. convergence, consistency, and stability are analyzed.

      <description>arXiv:2407.19382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: On meshes with the maximum angle condition violated, the
  standard conforming, nonconforming, and discontinuous Galerkin finite elements
  do not converge to the true solution when the mesh size goes to zero.
  It is shown that one type of weak Galerkin finite element method converges
  on triangular and tetrahedral meshes violating the maximum angle condition,
  i.e., on arbitrary meshes.
  Numerical tests confirm the theory.</description>

      <title>Multilevel Tau preconditioners for symmetrized multilevel Toeplitz systems with applications to solving space fractional diffusion equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we develop a novel preconditioned method for solving space-fractional diffusion equations, which both accounts for and improves upon an ideal preconditioner pioneered in [J. Pestana. Preconditioners for symmetrized Toeplitz and multilevel Toeplitz matrices. SIAM Journal on Matrix Analysis and Applications, 40(3):870-887, 2019]. Following standard discretization on the equation, the resultant linear system is a non-symmetric, multilevel Toeplitz system. Through a simple symmetrization strategy, we transform the original linear system into a symmetric multilevel Hankel system. Subsequently, we propose a symmetric positive definite multilevel Tau preconditioner for the symmetrized system, which can be efficiently implemented using discrete sine transforms. Theoretically, we demonstrate that mesh-independent convergence can be achieved when employing the minimal residual method. In particular, we prove that the eigenvalues of the preconditioned matrix are bounded within disjoint intervals containing $\pm 1$, without any outliers. Numerical examples are provided to critically discuss the results, showcase the spectral distribution, and support the efficacy of our preconditioning strategy.</description>

      <title>Weak maximum principle of finite element methods for parabolic equations in polygonal domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19437v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The weak maximum principle of finite element methods for parabolic equations is proved for both semi-discretization in space and fully discrete methods with $k$-step backward differentiation formulae for $k = 1,... ,6$, on a two-dimensional general polygonal domain or a three-dimensional convex polyhedral domain. The semi-discrete result is established via a dyadic decomposition argument and local energy estimates in which the nonsmoothness of the domain can be handled. The fully discrete result for multistep backward differentiation formulae is proved by utilizing the solution representation via the discrete Laplace transform and the resolvent estimates, which are inspired by the analysis of convolutional quadrature for parabolic and fractional-order partial differential equations.</description>

      <title>Weighted hyperbolic cross polynomial approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19442v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study linear polynomial approximation of functions in weighted Sobolev spaces $W^r_{p,w}(\mathbb{R}^d)$ of mixed smoothness $r \in \mathbb{N}$, and their optimality in terms of Kolmogorov and linear $n$-widths of the unit ball $\boldsymbol{W}^r_{p,w}(\mathbb{R}^d)$ in these spaces. The approximation error is measured by the norm of the weighted Lebesgue space $L_{q,w}(\mathbb{R}^d)$. The weight $w$ is a tensor-product Freud weight. For $1\le p,q \le \infty$ and $d=1$, we prove that the polynomial approximation by de la Vall\'ee Poussin sums of the orthonormal polynomial expansion of functions with respect to the weight $w^2$, is asymptotically optimal in terms of relevant linear $n$-widths $\lambda_n\big(\boldsymbol{W}^r_{p,w}(\mathbb{R}, L_{q,w}(\mathbb{R})\big)$ and Kolmogorov $n$-widths $d_n\big(\boldsymbol{W}^r_{p,w}(\mathbb{R}), L_{q,w}(\mathbb{R})\big)$ for $1\le q \le p &lt;\infty$. For $1\le p,q \le \infty$ and $d\ge 2$, we construct linear methods of hyperbolic cross polynomial approximation based on tensor product of successive differences of dyadic-scaled de la Vall\'ee Poussin sums, which are counterparts of hyperbolic cross trigonometric linear polynomial approximation, and give some upper bounds of the error of these approximations for various pair $p,q$ with $1 \le p, q \le \infty$. For some particular weights $w$ and $d \ge 2$, we prove the right convergence rate of $\lambda_n\big(\boldsymbol{W}^r_{2,w}(\mathbb{R}^d), L_{2,w}(\mathbb{R}^d)\big)$ and $d_n\big(\boldsymbol{W}^r_{2,w}(\mathbb{R}^d), L_{2,w}(\mathbb{R}^d)\big)$ which is performed by a constructive hyperbolic cross polynomial approximation.</description>

      <title>From Obstacle Problems to Neural Insights: Feed Forward Neural Network Modeling of Ice Thickness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we integrate the established obstacle problem formulation from ice sheet modeling with cutting-edge deep learning methodologies to enhance ice thickness predictions, specifically targeting the Greenland ice sheet. By harmonizing the mathematical structure with an energy minimization framework tailored for neural network approximations, our method's efficacy is confirmed through both 1D and 2D numerical simulations. Utilizing the NSIDC-0092 dataset for Greenland and incorporating bedrock topography for model pre-training, we register notable advances in prediction accuracy. Our research underscores the potent combination of traditional mathematical models and advanced computational techniques in delivering precise ice thickness estimations.</description>

      <title>Oscillation-free numerical schemes for Biot's model and their iterative coupling solution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we present a new stabilization method aimed at removing spurious oscillations in the pressure approximation of Biot's model for poroelasticity with low permeabilities and/or small time steps. We consider different finite-element discretizations and illustrate how not only does such a stabilized scheme provide numerical solutions that are free of non-physical oscillations, but it also allows one to iterate the fluid and mechanics problems in a fashion similar to the well-known fixed-stress split method. The resulting solution method is convergent without the necessity for additional terms to stabilize the iteration. Finally, we present numerical results illustrating the robust behavior of both the stabilization and iterative solver with respect to the physical and discretization parameters of the model.</description>

      <title>Data-driven Discovery of Delay Differential Equations with Discrete Delays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19640v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (SINDy) framework is a robust method for identifying governing equations, successfully applied to ordinary, partial, and stochastic differential equations. In this work we extend SINDy to identify delay differential equations by using an augmented library that includes delayed samples and Bayesian optimization. To identify a possibly unknown delay we minimize the reconstruction error over a set of candidates. The resulting methodology improves the overall performance by remarkably reducing the number of calls to SINDy with respect to a brute force approach. We also address a multivariate setting to identify multiple unknown delays and (non-multiplicative) parameters. Several numerical tests on delay differential equations with different long-term behavior, number of variables, delays, and parameters support the use of Bayesian optimization highlighting both the efficacy of the proposed methodology and its computational advantages. As a consequence, the class of discoverable models is significantly expanded.</description>

      <title>Non-iterative complex variable solution on sequential shallow tunnelling in gravitational geomaterial with reasonable far-field displacement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19645v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sequential excavation is common in shallow tunnel engineering, especially for large-span tunnels. However, existing complex variable solutions can not handle sequential shallow tunnelling effectively. This paper proposes a new complex variable solution on sequential shallow tunnelling in gravitational geomaterial with reasonable far-field displacement in a non-iterative manner by incorporating a bidirectional stepwise conformal mapping combining Charge Simulation Method and Complex Dipole Simulation Method. The non-iterative manner ensures that the mechanical models of sequential excavation stages share similar mathematical formation with non-successive mixed boundary conditions, which are respectively transformed into corresponding homogenerous Riemann-Hilbert problems, which are solved to obtain stress and displacement fields of sequential shallow tunnelling. The proposed solution is subsequently validated by sufficient comparisons with equivalent finite element solution with good agreements. The comparisons also suggest that the proposed solution should be more accurate than the finite element one. A parametric investigation is finally conducted to illustrate possible practical applications of the proposed solution with several engineering recommendations. Additionally, the theoretical improvements and defects of the proposed solution are discussed for objectivity.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19707v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This research introduces an extended application of neural networks for solving nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs). A neural network, combined with a pseudo-arclength continuation, is proposed to construct bifurcation diagrams from parameterized nonlinear PDEs. Additionally, a neural network approach is also presented for solving eigenvalue problems to analyze solution linear stability, focusing on identifying the largest eigenvalue. The effectiveness of the proposed neural network is examined through experiments on the Bratu equation and the Burgers equation. Results from a finite difference method are also presented as comparison. Varying numbers of grid points are employed in each case to assess the behavior and accuracy of both the neural network and the finite difference method. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed neural network produces better solutions, generates more accurate bifurcation diagrams, has reasonable computational times, and proves effective for linear stability analysis.</description>

      <title>Greedy Adaptive Local Recovery of Functions in Sobolev Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19864v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There are many ways to upsample functions from multivariate scattered data locally, using only a few neighbouring data points of the evaluation point. The position and number of the actually used data points is not trivial, and many cases like Moving Least Squares require point selections that guarantee local recovery of polynomials up to a specified order. This paper suggests a kernel-based greedy local algorithm for point selection that has no such constraints. It realizes the optimal $L_\infty$ convergence rates in Sobolev spaces using the minimal number of points necessary for that purpose. On the downside, it does not care for smoothness, relying on fast $L_\infty$ convergence to a smooth function. The algorithm ignores near-duplicate points automatically and works for quite irregularly distributed point sets by proper selection of points. Its computational complexity is constant for each evaluation point, being dependent only on the Sobolev space parameters. Various numerical examples are provided. As a byproduct, it turns out that the well-known instability of global kernel-based interpolation in the standard basis of kernel translates arises already locally, independent of global kernel matrices and small separation distances.</description>

Abstract: In a recent work [Manucci, Unger, ArXiv e-print 2404.10511, 2024], the authors propose using two generalized Lyapunov equations (GLEs) to derive a balancing-based model order reduction~(MOR) method for a general class of switched differential-algebraic equations (DAEs). This work explains why these GLEs provide solutions suitable for MOR by showing that the image set of the solutions of the two GLEs always encloses the reachable and observable set of a suitably defined switched system with the same input to output map of the switched DAE system.</description>

      <title>GsPINN: A novel fast Green kernel solver based on symmetric Physics-Informed neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ever since deep learning was introduced in the calculation of partial differential equation (PDE), there has been a lot of interests on real time response of system where the kernel function plays an important role. As a popular tool in recent years, physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) was proposed to perform a mesh-free, semi-supervised learning with high flexibility. This paper explores the integration of Lie symmetry groups with deep learning techniques to enhance the numerical solutions of fundamental solution in PDE. We propose a novel approach that combines the strengths of PINN and Lie group theory to address the computational inefficiencies in traditional methods. By incorporating the linearized symmetric condition (LSC) derived from Lie symmetries into PINNs, we introduce a new type of residual loss with lower order of derivative needed to calculate. This integration allows for significant reductions in computational costs and improvements in solution precision. Numerical simulation shows that our method can achieve up to a 50\% reduction in training time while maintaining good accuracy. Additionally, we provide a general theoretical framework to identify invariant infinitesimal generators for arbitrary Cauchy problems. This unsupervised algorithm does not require prior numerical solutions, making it both practical and efficient for various applications. Our contributions demonstrate the potential of combining symmetry analysis with deep learning to advance the field of scientific machine learning.</description>

      <title>Learning-based geometric shape optimization of the Dirichlet energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19064v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we explore the numerical solution of geometric shape optimization problems using neural network-based approaches. This involves minimizing a numerical criterion that includes solving a partial differential equation with respect to a domain, often under geometric constraints like constant volume. Our goal is to develop a proof of concept using a flexible and parallelizable methodology to tackle these problems. We focus on a prototypal problem: minimizing the so-called Dirichlet energy with respect to the domain under a volume constraint, involving a Poisson equation in $\mathbb R^2$. We use physics-informed neural networks (PINN) to approximate the Poisson equation's solution on a given domain and represent the shape through a neural network that approximates a volume-preserving transformation from an initial shape to an optimal one. These processes are combined in a single optimization algorithm that minimizes the Dirichlet energy. One of the significant advantages of this approach is its parallelizable nature, which makes it easy to handle the addition of parameters. Additionally, it does not rely on shape derivative or adjoint calculations. Our approach is tested on Dirichlet and Robin boundary conditions, parametric right-hand sides, and extended to Bernoulli-type free boundary problems. The source code for solving the shape optimization problem is open-source and freely available.</description>

      <title>A New Higher-Order Super Compact Finite Difference Scheme to Study Three-Dimensional Non-Newtonian Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19100v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work introduces a new higher-order accurate super compact (HOSC) finite difference scheme for solving complex unsteady three-dimensional (3D) non-Newtonian fluid flow problems. As per the author's knowledge, the proposed scheme is the first ever developed finite difference scheme to solve three-dimensional non-Newtonian flow problem. Not only that, the proposed method is fourth-order accurate in space variables and second-order accurate in time. Also, the proposed scheme utilizes only seven directly adjacent grid points, at the $(n+1)^{th}$ time level, around which the finite difference discretization is made. The governing equations are solved using a time-marching methodology, and pressure is calculated using a pressure-correction strategy based on the modified artificial compressibility method. Using the power-law viscosity model, we tackle the benchmark problem of a 3D lid-driven cavity, systematically analyzing the varied rheological behavior of shear-thinning ($n=0.5$), shear-thickening $(n=1.5)$, and Newtonian $(n=1.0)$ fluids across different Reynolds numbers $(Re= 1, 50, 100, 200)$. Both Newtonian and non-Newtonian results are carefully investigated in terms of streamlines, velocity variation, pressure distributions, and viscosity contours, and the computed results are validated with the existing benchmark results. The findings demonstrate excellent agreement with the existing results. This extensive analysis, using the new HOSC scheme, not only increases our understanding of non-Newtonian fluid behavior but also provides a robust foundation for future research and practical applications.</description>

      <title>On a generalization of Watson's trigonometric sum, some of its properties and its relationship to Dowker's sum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19223v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we study two finite trigonometric sums $\sum a_l\csc\big(\pi l/n\big)\,,$ where $a_l$ are equal either to $\cos(2\pi l \nu/n)$ or to $(-1)^{l+1}$, and where the summation index $l$ and the discrete parameter $\nu$ both run through $1$ to $n-1$ (marginally, cases $a_l=\ln\csc\big(\pi l/n\big)$ and $a_l=\Psi\big(l/n\big)$ also appear in the paper). These sums occur in various problems in mathematics, physics and engineering, and play an important part in some number-theoretic problems. Formally, the first of these sums is also the so-called Dowker sum of order one half. In the paper, we obtain several integral and series representations for the above-mentioned sums, investigate their properties, derive their complete asymptotical expansions and deduce very accurate upper and lower bounds for them (both bounds are asymptotically vanishing). In addition, we obtain a useful approximate formula containing only three terms, which is also very accurate and can be particularly appreciated in applications. Both trigonometric sums appear to be closely related with the digamma function and with the square of the Bernoulli numbers. Finally, we also derive several advanced summation formulae for the gamma and the digamma functions, in which the first on these sums, as well as the product of a sequence of cosecants $\,\prod\big(\csc(\pi l/n)\big)^{\csc(\pi l/n)}$, play an important role.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19916v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a methodology to learn surrogate models of steady state fluid dynamics simulations on meshed domains, based on Implicit Neural Representations (INRs). The proposed models can be applied directly to unstructured domains for different flow conditions, handle non-parametric 3D geometric variations, and generalize to unseen shapes at test time. The coordinate-based formulation naturally leads to robustness with respect to discretization, allowing an excellent trade-off between computational cost (memory footprint and training time) and accuracy. The method is demonstrated on two industrially relevant applications: a RANS dataset of the two-dimensional compressible flow over a transonic airfoil and a dataset of the surface pressure distribution over 3D wings, including shape, inflow condition, and control surface deflection variations. On the considered test cases, our approach achieves a more than three times lower test error and significantly improves generalization error on unseen geometries compared to state-of-the-art Graph Neural Network architectures. Remarkably, the method can perform inference five order of magnitude faster than the high fidelity solver on the RANS transonic airfoil dataset.

      <title>Accelerated Primal-Dual Proximal Gradient Splitting Methods for Convex-Concave Saddle-Point Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20195v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, based a novel primal-dual dynamical model with adaptive scaling parameters and Bregman divergences, we propose new accelerated primal-dual proximal gradient splitting methods for solving bilinear saddle-point problems with provable optimal nonergodic convergence rates. For the first, using the spectral analysis, we show that a naive extension of acceleration model for unconstrained optimization problems to a quadratic game is unstable. Motivated by this, we present an accelerated primal-dual hybrid gradient (APDHG) flow which combines acceleration with careful velocity correction. To work with non-Euclidean distances, we also equip our APDHG model with general Bregman divergences and prove the exponential decay of a Lyapunov function. Then, new primal-dual splitting methods are developed based on proper semi-implicit Euler schemes of the continuous model, and the theoretical convergence rates are nonergodic and optimal with respect to the matrix norms,\, Lipschitz constants and convexity parameters. Thanks to the primal and dual scaling parameters, both the algorithm designing and convergence analysis cover automatically the convex and (partially) strongly convex objectives. Moreover, the use of Bregman divergences not only unifies the standard Euclidean distances and general cases in an elegant way, but also makes our methods more flexible and adaptive to problem-dependent metrics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2210.13900v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we propose a new numerical scheme for physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) that enables precise and inexpensive solution for partial differential equations (PDEs) in case of arbitrary geometries while strictly enforcing Dirichlet boundary conditions. The proposed approach combines admissible NURBS parametrizations required to define the physical domain and the Dirichlet boundary conditions with a PINN solver. The fundamental boundary conditions are automatically satisfied in this novel Deep NURBS framework. We verified our new approach using two-dimensional elliptic PDEs when considering arbitrary geometries, including non-Lipschitz domains. Compared to the classical PINN solver, the Deep NURBS estimator has a remarkably high convergence rate for all the studied problems. Moreover, a desirable accuracy was realized for most of the studied PDEs using only one hidden layer of neural networks. This novel approach is considered to pave the way for more effective solutions for high-dimensional problems by allowing for more realistic physics-informed statistical learning to solve PDE-based variational problems.</description>

      <title>An Approximation Theory Framework for Measure-Transport Sampling Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.13965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.13965v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article presents a general approximation-theoretic framework to analyze measure transport algorithms for probabilistic modeling. A primary motivating application for such algorithms is sampling -- a central task in statistical inference and generative modeling. We provide a priori error estimates in the continuum limit, i.e., when the measures (or their densities) are given, but when the transport map is discretized or approximated using a finite-dimensional function space. Our analysis relies on the regularity theory of transport maps and on classical approximation theory for high-dimensional functions. A third element of our analysis, which is of independent interest, is the development of new stability estimates that relate the distance between two maps to the distance~(or divergence) between the pushforward measures they define. We present a series of applications of our framework, where quantitative convergence rates are obtained for practical problems using Wasserstein metrics, maximum mean discrepancy, and Kullback--Leibler divergence. Specialized rates for approximations of the popular triangular Kn{\"o}the-Rosenblatt maps are obtained, followed by numerical experiments that demonstrate and extend our theory.</description>

      <title>A monotone $Q^1$ finite element method for anisotropic elliptic equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.16274v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct a monotone continuous $Q^1$ finite element method on the uniform mesh for the anisotropic diffusion problem with a diagonally dominant diffusion coefficient matrix. The monotonicity implies the discrete maximum principle. Convergence of the new scheme is rigorously proven. On quadrilateral meshes, the matrix coefficient conditions translate into specific mesh constraints.</description>

      <title>Multivariate rational approximation of functions with curves of singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13202</link>

Abstract: Functions with singularities are notoriously difficult to approximate with conventional approximation schemes. In computational applications, they are often resolved with low-order piecewise polynomials, multilevel schemes, or other types of grading strategies. Rational functions are an exception to this rule: for univariate functions with point singularities, such as branch points, rational approximations exist with root-exponential convergence in the rational degree. This is typically enabled by the clustering of poles near the singularity. Both the theory and computational practice of rational functions for function approximation have focused on the univariate case, with extensions to two dimensions via identification with the complex plane. Multivariate rational functions, i.e., quotients of polynomials of several variables, are relatively unexplored in comparison. Yet, apart from a steep increase in theoretical complexity, they also offer a wealth of opportunities. A first observation is that singularities of multivariate rational functions may be continuous curves of poles, rather than isolated ones. By generalizing the clustering of poles from points to curves, we explore constructions of multivariate rational approximations to functions with curves of singularities.</description>

      <title>Importance sampling for rare event tracking within the ensemble Kalman filtering framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12793v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we employ importance sampling (IS) techniques to track a small over-threshold probability of a running maximum associated with the solution of a stochastic differential equation (SDE) within the framework of ensemble Kalman filtering (EnKF). Between two observation times of the EnKF, we propose to use IS with respect to the initial condition of the SDE, IS with respect to the Wiener process via a stochastic optimal control formulation, and combined IS with respect to both initial condition and Wiener process. Both IS strategies require the approximation of the solution of Kolmogorov Backward equation (KBE) with boundary conditions. In multidimensional settings, we employ a Markovian projection dimension reduction technique to obtain an approximation of the solution of the KBE by just solving a one dimensional PDE. The proposed ideas are tested on three illustrative examples: Double Well SDE, Langevin dynamics and noisy Charney-deVore model, and showcase a significant variance reduction compared to the standard Monte Carlo method and another sampling-based IS technique, namely, multilevel cross entropy.</description>

      <title>On Phase Unwrapping via Digital Wavefront Sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15419v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we derive a new class of methods for the classic 2D phase unwrapping problem of recovering a phase function from its wrapped form. For this, we consider the wrapped phase as a wavefront aberration in an optical system, and use reconstruction methods for (digital) wavefront sensors for its recovery. The key idea is that mathematically, common wavefront sensors are insensitive to whether an incoming wavefront is wrapped or not. However, typical reconstructors for these sensors are optimized to compute smooth wavefronts. Thus, digitally "propagating" a wrapped phase through such a sensor and then applying one of these reconstructors results in a smooth unwrapped phase. First, we show how this principle can be applied to derive phase unwrapping algorithms based on digital Shack-Hartmann and Fourier-type wavefront sensors. Then, we numerically test our approach on an unwrapping problem appearing in a free-space optical communications project currently under development, and compare the results to those obtained with other state-of-the-art algorithms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17652v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a monotone, two-scale discretization for a class of integrodifferential operators of order $2s$, $s \in (0,1)$. We apply it to develop numerical schemes, and derive pointwise convergence rates, for linear and obstacle problems governed by such operators. As applications of the monotonicity, we provide error estimates for free boundaries and a convergent numerical scheme for a concave fully nonlinear, nonlocal, problem.</description>

      <title>Quasi-Framelets: Robust Graph Neural Networks via Adaptive Framelet Convolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.04728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2201.04728v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper aims to provide a novel design of a multiscale framelet convolution for spectral graph neural networks (GNNs). While current spectral methods excel in various graph learning tasks, they often lack the flexibility to adapt to noisy, incomplete, or perturbed graph signals, making them fragile in such conditions. Our newly proposed framelet convolution addresses these limitations by decomposing graph data into low-pass and high-pass spectra through a finely-tuned multiscale approach. Our approach directly designs filtering functions within the spectral domain, allowing for precise control over the spectral components. The proposed design excels in filtering out unwanted spectral information and significantly reduces the adverse effects of noisy graph signals. Our approach not only enhances the robustness of GNNs but also preserves crucial graph features and structures. Through extensive experiments on diverse, real-world graph datasets, we demonstrate that our framelet convolution achieves superior performance in node classification tasks. It exhibits remarkable resilience to noisy data and adversarial attacks, highlighting its potential as a robust solution for real-world graph applications. This advancement opens new avenues for more adaptive and reliable spectral GNN architectures.</description>

      <title>Ensemble Kalman Filters with Resampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.08751v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Filtering is concerned with online estimation of the state of a dynamical system from partial and noisy observations. In applications where the state of the system is high dimensional, ensemble Kalman filters are often the method of choice. These algorithms rely on an ensemble of interacting particles to sequentially estimate the state as new observations become available. Despite the practical success of ensemble Kalman filters, theoretical understanding is hindered by the intricate dependence structure of the interacting particles. This paper investigates ensemble Kalman filters that incorporate an additional resampling step to break the dependency between particles. The new algorithm is amenable to a theoretical analysis that extends and improves upon those available for filters without resampling, while also performing well in numerical examples.</description>

      <title>Computing an Aircraft's Gliding Range and Minimal Return Altitude in Presence of Obstacles and Wind</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18056v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the event of a total loss of thrust, a pilot must identify a reachable landing site and subsequently execute a forced landing. To do so, they must estimate which region on the ground can be reached safely in gliding flight. We call this the gliding reachable region (GRR). To compute the GRR, we employ an optimal control formulation aiming to reach a point in space while minimizing altitude loss. A simplified model of the aircraft's dynamics is used, where the effect of turns is neglected. The resulting equations are discretized on a grid and solved numerically. Our algorithm for computing the GRR is fast enough to run in real time during flight, it accounts for ground obstacles and wind, and for each point in the GRR it outputs the path to reach it with minimal loss of altitude.
  A related problem is estimating the minimal altitude an aircraft needs in order to glide to a given airfield in the presence of obstacles. This information enables pilots to plan routes that always have an airport within gliding distance. We formalize this problem using an optimal control formulation based on the same aircraft dynamics model. The resulting equations are solved with a second algorithm that outputs the minimal re-entry altitude and the paths to reach the airfield from any position while avoiding obstacles.
  The algorithms we develop are based on the Ordered Upwind Method and the Fast Marching Method.</description>
