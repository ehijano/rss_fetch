      <title>Spherically symmetric Earth models yield no net electron spin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08050v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Terrestrial experiments that use electrons in Earth as a spin-polarized source have been demonstrated to provide strong bounds on exotic long-range spin-spin and spin-velocity interactions. These bounds constrain the coupling strength of many proposed ultralight bosonic dark-matter candidates. Recently, it was pointed out that a monopole-dipole coupling between the Sun and the spin-polarized electrons of Earth would result in a modification of the precession of the perihelion of Earth. Using an estimate for the net spin-polarization of Earth and experimental bounds on Earth's perihelion precession, interesting constraints were placed on the magnitude of this monopole-dipole coupling. Here we investigate the spin associated with Earth's electrons. We find that there are about $6 \times 10^{41}$ spin-polarized electrons in the mantle and crust of Earth oriented anti-parallel to their local magnetic field. However, when integrated over any spherically-symmetric Earth model, we find that the vector sum of these spins is zero. In order to establish a lower bound on the magnitude of the net spin along Earth's rotation axis we have investigated three of the largest breakdowns of Earth's spherical symmetry: the large low shear-velocity provinces of the mantle, the crustal composition, and the oblate spheroid of Earth. From these investigations we conclude that there are at least $5 \times 10^{38}$ spin-polarized electrons aligned anti-parallel to Earth's rotation axis. This analysis suggests that the bounds on the monopole-dipole coupling that were extracted from Earth's perihelion precession need to be relaxed by a factor of about 2000.</description>

      <title>The 33311 Left-Right Bilepton Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08078v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss extension of the electroweak gauge group to $SU(3)_L \times SU(3)_R \times U(1)_{XL} \times U(1)_{XR}$. This adds new leptons to the familiar 331-model. The explanation for three light quark-lepton families remains but new particles are introduced which have no TeV scale upper limit on their masses.</description>

      <title>Atomic Dark Matter, Interacting Dark Radiation, and the Hubble Tension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new class of interacting dark sector models that can address the Hubble tension. Interacting dark radiation (DR) has previously been put forward as a solution to the problem, but this proposal is disfavored by the high-$\ell$ cosmic microwave background (CMB) data. We modify this basic framework by introducing a subcomponent of dark matter (DM) that interacts strongly with the DR, so that together they constitute a tightly coupled fluid at early times. We show that if this subcomponent decouples from the interacting DR during the CMB epoch, the $\ell$ modes of the CMB that entered the horizon before decoupling are impacted differently from those that entered after, allowing a solution to the problem. We present a model that realizes this framework, which we dub "New Atomic Dark Matter", or nuADaM, in which the interacting dark matter (iDM) subcomponent is composed of dark atoms, and dark "neutrinos" with long-range interactions contribute to the DR, hence the name of the model. This iDM subcomponent is acoustic at early times but decouples from the DR following dark recombination. In contrast to conventional atomic dark matter (ADM) models, the dark photon is part of a richer DR sector, which ensures that it continues to be self-interacting even after recombination. We show that this model admits a fit to the available cosmological data that is significantly better than both $\Lambda$CDM and conventional ADM.</description>

      <title>A precision evaluation of the $\eta$- and $\eta'$-pole contributions to hadronic light-by-light scattering in the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Next to the $\pi^0$ pole, $\eta$ and $\eta'$ intermediate states give rise to the leading singularities of the hadronic light-by-light tensor, resulting in sizable contributions to the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon $a_\mu$. The strength of the poles is determined by the respective transition form factors (TFFs) to two (virtual) photons. We present a calculation of these TFFs that implements a number of low- and high-energy constraints, including the $\eta^{(\prime)}\to\gamma\gamma$ decay widths, $\eta^{(\prime)}\to\pi^+\pi^-\gamma$ spectra, chiral symmetry for the $\eta^{(\prime)}\to2(\pi^+\pi^-)$ amplitudes, vector-meson couplings, and asymptotic limits. Crucially, we investigate the role of the leading left-hand singularity generated by the exchange of the $a_2$ tensor meson, yielding, for the first time, an estimate of the associated factorization-breaking corrections. Our final results, $a_\mu^{\eta\text{-pole}}=14.7(9)\times 10^{-11}$ and $a_\mu^{\eta'\text{-pole}}=13.5(7)\times 10^{-11}$, conclude a dedicated effort to evaluate the pseudoscalar-pole contributions to hadronic light-by-light scattering using dispersion relations, amounting to a combined $a_\mu^{\text{PS-poles}}=91.2^{+2.9}_{-2.4}\times 10^{-11}$.</description>

      <title>CPon Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08101v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a class of supersymmetric models where the strong CP problem is solved through spontaneous CP violation, carried out by a complex scalar field that determines the Yukawa couplings of the theory. Assuming that one real component of this field - the CPon - is light, we examine the conditions under which it provides a viable Dark Matter candidate. The CPon couplings to fermions are largely determined by the field-dependent Yukawa interactions, and induce couplings to gauge bosons at 1-loop that are suppressed by a special sum rule. All couplings are suppressed by an undetermined UV scale, which needs to exceed $10^{12}$ GeV in order to satisfy constraints on excessive stellar cooling and rare Kaon decays. The CPon mass is limited from below by 5th force experiments and from above by X-ray telescopes looking for CPon decays to photons, leaving a range roughly between 10 meV and 1 MeV. Everywhere in the allowed parameter space the CPon can saturate the observed Dark Matter abundance through an appropriate balance of misalignment and freeze-in production from heavy SM fermions.</description>

      <title>An MCMC analysis to probe trilinear RPV SUSY scenarios and possible LHC signatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we probe the trilinear R-parity violating (RPV) supersymmetric (SUSY) scenarios with specific non-zero interactions in the light of neutrino oscillation, Higgs, and flavor observables. We attempt to fit the set of observables using a state-of-the-art Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) set-up and study its impact on the model parameter space. Our main objective is to constrain the trilinear couplings individually, along with some other SUSY parameters relevant to the observables. We present the constrained parameter regions in the form of marginalized posterior distributions on different two-dimensional parameter planes. We perform our analyses with two different scenarios characterized by our choices for the lightest SUSY particle (LSP), bino, and stop. Our results indicate that the lepton number violating trilinear couplings $\lambda_{i33}$ ($i$=1,2) and $\lambda_{j33}^{\prime}$ ($j$=1,2,3) can be at most of the order of $10^{-4}$ or even smaller while $\tan\beta$ is restricted to below 15 even when $3\sigma$ allowed regions are considered. We further comment on the possible LHC signatures of these LSPs focusing on and around the best-fit regions.</description>

      <title>Impact of background field localization on vacuum polarization effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We aim at insights about how localization of the background field impacts nonlinear quantum vacuum signatures probed by photons in purely magnetic, electric and crossed fields. The starting point of our study are the one-loop results for the Heisenberg-Euler effective Lagrangian and the photon polarization tensor in quantum electrodynamics (QED) evaluated in a uniform constant electromagnetic field. As is well known and often employed, especially in the weak-field limit, within certain restrictions these results also allow for the reliable analysis of vacuum polarization effects in slowly varying background fields. Here, our main interest is in manifestly non-perturbative effects. To this end, we make use of the fact that for the particular case of background field inhomogeneities of Lorentzian shape with $0\leq d\leq3$ inhomogeneous directions analytical insights are possible. We study the scaling of conventional nonlinear QED signatures, such as probe-photon polarization flip and probe-photon induced electron-positron pair production, with relevant parameters. Special attention is put on the $d$ dependence of the considered effects.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the notion of nuclear parton-to-pion fragmentation functions at next-to-leading order accuracy as an effective description of hadroproduction in nuclear environments such as in semi-inclusive lepton-nucleus deep-inelastic scattering and in single inclusive proton-nucleus collisions. We assess their viability in the face of very precise data collected for the latter at the CERN-LHC over the past decade as well as recent measurements of the former carried out by the CLAS experiment at JLab.</description>

      <title>Spin dynamics with realistic hydrodynamic background for relativistic heavy-ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08223v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The equations of perfect spin hydrodynamics are solved for the first time using a realistic (3+1)-dimensional hydrodynamic background, calibrated to reproduce a comprehensive set of hadronic observables, including rapidity distributions, transverse momentum spectra, and elliptic flow coefficients for Au+Au collisions at the beam energy of $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}} = 200$ GeV. The spin dynamics is governed by the conservation of the spin tensor, describing spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ particles, with particle mass in the spin tensor treated as an effective parameter. We investigate several scenarios, varying both the effective mass and the initial evolution time for the spin polarization tensor. The model predictions are then compared with experimental measurements of global and longitudinal spin polarization of Lambda hyperons. Our results indicate that a successful description of the data requires a delayed initial evolution time for the perfect spin hydrodynamics of about 4 fm/$c$ (in contrast to the standard initial time of 1 fm/$c$ used for the hydrodynamic background). This delay marks a transition from the phase where spin-orbit interaction is significant to the regime where spin-conserving processes dominate. Our findings suggest that the spin-orbit dissipative interaction plays a significant role only in the very early stages of the system's evolution.</description>

      <title>Collisional Approach for Open Neutrino Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08330v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a collisional framework for neutrino propagation within open quantum systems, termed the \emph{Collisional Approach for Open Neutrino Systems} (CAONS). A Born-Markov equation is derived, linking decoherence, dissipation, decay rates, and scattering cross sections. Perturbation theory is not required and the resultant master equation is applied to visible and invisible neutrino decays and propagation through a stationary medium. Comparing with previous studies on neutrino decoherence, we show that current bounds on decoherence parameters can significantly tighten constraints on neutrino couplings with dark-matter. Lastly, we establish connections between CAONS and non-Hermitian Hamiltonian approaches.</description>

      <title>Hypernuclei production with a modified coalescence model in BUU transport calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, the usual momentum- and coordinate-space distance criteria for creating nuclear clusters in transport simulations are addressed by using a dynamical, covariant description in an off-shell Boltzmann-Uehling-Uhlenbeck transport approach. The free parameter of this clustering scheme is the cluster formation time, which is fitted through the FOPI data of low energy charged cluster multiplicities in Au+Au collisions at 150 A MeV and 400 A MeV incident energies. The coalescence model is used to estimate the yields of the 3H(Lambda), 5H(2Lambda), 6He(2Lambda) single and double strange hypernuclei in central Au+Au collisions between 2, and 20 A GeV incident energies, giving comparable results to estimations from other methods.</description>

      <title>Translating current ALP photon coupling strength bounds to the Randall-Sundrum model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we look at the current bounds on the coupling strength of axion-like particles (ALPs) with two photons in the context of the Randall-Sundrum (RS) model. We relate the coupling strength to the compactification radius that governs the size of the extra dimension in the RS warped geometry model and show how the current bounds on the ALP can be used to derive appropriate constraints on the size of the extra fifth dimension in the RS model. We show that the resulting constraints fail to resolve the gauge hierarchy problem for light/ultralight ALPs and require a massive ALP of at least $m_{a} \gtrsim 0.1$ [GeV] to be relevant in the context of the hierarchy problem when the gauge field is in the bulk.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08429v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: $\Theta^+$ is a putative light pentaquark state of positive parity with minimal quark content $(uudd\bar{s})$. It naturally emerges in chiral models for baryons, but experimental evidence is uncertain. We review the theoretical foundations of chiral models and their phenomenological applications to exotic states. In particular, we discuss in detail the pentaquark widths with special emphasis on the cancellations occurring in the decay operator. We also discuss some experiments, mainly those whose positive evidence of ${\mit\Theta}^+$ persists to this day. This review is dedicated to Dmitry Diakonov, Victor Petrov, and Maxim Polyakov and their contribution to the ${\mit\Theta}^+$ story.</description>

Abstract: We study the upper limit on dark matter mass in the context of the inert double model. We derive analytic expression for the upper bound as a function of the mass squared differences between dark matter and other new particles. We find that the upper limit varies between 20$-$80 TeV depending on the mass squared splitting.</description>

      <title>The time evolution of light nuclei cumulants and ratios with a first-order phase transition in the UrQMD transport model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08444v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The UrQMD model with a density dependent equation of state, including a first-order phase transition, is used to study the time dependence of baryon number and proton number susceptibilities up to third order in heavy ion reactions of $E_{\mathrm{lab}}=2-3 A$ GeV. A significant deviation from the Gaussian fluctuations of the baryon number fluctuation in coordinate space is observed. The proton number fluctuations are always suppressed as they constitute only a small fraction of the total baryon number during the dense phase of the collision. It is found that the only measurable, but small, signal would be an enhancement of the third order (or higher) proton cumulant in a finite rapidity window $\Delta y$ that is larger than one unit of rapidity. In addition, it is found that the coordinate fluctuations will lead to an enhancement of cluster production due to the correlations in coordinate space. However, this enhancement is small and mainly occurs during the dense part of the collision before the system actually freezes out.</description>

      <title>Revisiting $B\to K^*\pi$ and $B\to K\rho$ decays using the modified perturbative QCD approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08454v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit $B\to K^*\pi$ and $B\to K\rho$ decay processes using the modified perturbative QCD approach, which is developed based on the perturbative QCD approach with a few improvements. A critical infrared cutoff scale $\mu_c$ is introduced to separate hard and soft contributions in the decay process. Hard contributions with scale $\mu$ larger than $\mu_c$ are calculated with perturbative QCD, and soft contributions with $\mu&lt;\mu_c$ are described in terms of soft transition and production form factors. In addition, color-octet contributions are considered phenomenologically. The branching fractions and $CP$ violations of $B\to K^*\pi$, $K\rho$ decays are calculated. With appropriate parameter inputs, the theoretical results can be in good agreement with experimental data.</description>

      <title>More Scalings from Cosmic Strings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08455v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze all individual cosmic strings of various lengths in a large ensemble of the global cosmic string networks in the post-inflationary scenario, obtained from numerical simulations on a discrete lattice with $N^3 = 4096^3$. A strong evidence for a logarithmically growing spectral index of the string power spectrum during the evolution is newly reported as our main result. The logarithmic scaling is checked against two different approaches for generating initial random field configurations, namely fat-string type and thermal phase transition. We derive the analytic relation between two power spectra of cosmic strings and axions which should be valid under some assumptions, and the validity of those assumptions is discussed. We argue that our analytic result strongly supports the correlated spectra of cosmic strings and axions. Additionally, we initiate the statistical analysis of the causal dynamics of the cosmic strings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Numerical wave functions (WFs), root mean square (RMS) radii, $E1$ and $M1$ radiative transitions, and branching ratios of $S, P, D$ and $F$ states of toponium mesons ($t\overline{t}$) are calculated using a non-relativistic quark potential model (NRQPM). Shooting method is used to solve the radial Schrodinger equation to find the radial wave functions which are used in the calculation of properties of mesons.

      <title>Nonlinear Breit-Wheeler pair production using polarized photons from inverse Compton scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Observing multiphoton electron-positron pair production (the nonlinear Breit-Wheeler process) requires high-energy $\gamma$ rays to interact with strong electromagnetic fields. In order for these observations to be as precise as possible, the $\gamma$ rays would ideally be both mono-energetic and highly polarized. Here we perform Monte Carlo simulations of an experimental configuration that accomplishes this in two stages. First, a multi-GeV electron beam interacts with a moderately intense laser pulse to produce a bright, highly polarized beam of $\gamma$ rays by inverse Compton scattering. Second, after removing the primary electrons, these $\gamma$ rays collide with another, more intense, laser pulse in order to produce pairs. We show that it is possible to measure the $\gamma$-ray polarization dependence of the nonlinear Breit-Wheeler process in near-term experiments, using a 100-TW class laser and currently available electron beams. Furthermore, it would also be possible to observe harmonic structure and the perturbative-to-nonperturbative transition if such a laser were colocated with a future linear collider.</description>

      <title>Evolution of Effective Temperature, Kinetic Freeze-out Temperature and transverse flow velocity in pp Collision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08655v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article focuses on the study of strange hadrons at 0.2 TeV centre of mass energy, recorded by STAR at RHIC, and at 0.9 TeV, 5.02 TeV and 7 TeV, recorded by CMS at LHC, in pp collision in the rapidity range from 0 to 2. The transverse momentum distributions of these strange particles have been processed using two statistical models, the Tsallis and the modified Hagedorn model. Both models fit the experimental data well. We extracted different freezeout parameters from the fit procedure using the abovementioned functions. We found that with increasing the collision energy, the effective temperature (T), in the case of the Tsallis model, and kinetic/thermal freeze-out temperature (T0) and transverse flow velocity, in the case of the modified Hagedorn model, increase because of greater energy transfer among the participants at higher colliding energies. Both T and T0 are observed to increase with the increase in the rest masses of the outgoing particles revealing the multi-freeze-out scenario. Furthermore, the multiplicity parameter (N0) decreases with the increase in the particle mass, confirming the mass differential freeze-out scenario. An inverse relationship between the non-extensivity parameter (q) and the masses of the produced particles has been noticed. Similarly, an inverse correlation between q and T has been found. For lighter particles, smaller T and greater q mean that they decouple from the system later and attain equilibrium slowly compared to heavier ones. In addition, a positive correlation between transverse flow velocity and T0 is noticed, which agrees with the literature.</description>

      <title>Search for the $\gamma Z$ decay mode of heavy photophobic axion-like particles at the LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We assume the coupling of Axion-like particle (ALP) to diphoton $g_{a\gamma\gamma} \sim 0$ and accomplish detailed analyses for the $\gamma Z$ decay mode of such heavy photophobic ALPs at the high luminosity-Large Hadron Collider (HL-LHC). ALPs are produced with two jets via both the $s$-channel vector boson exchange and vector boson fusion processes, with the signal process $pp \to jj\, a (\to \gamma\, Z (\to \ell^+ \ell^-)\, ) $ for $\ell = e, \mu$. Signal and background events are simulated at the detector-level. Preselection criteria target events with one photon, two oppositely charged electrons or muons, and two non-$b$-tagged jets. The ALP mass is reconstructed, and kinematic observables are input into a machine learning-based multivariate analysis for optimal background rejection. Discover sensitivities on the ALP's coupling to di-$W$ boson, $g_{aWW}$, are presented in the mass range from 100 to 4000 GeV at center-of-mass energy $\sqrt{s} = 14$ TeV and integrated luminosity $\mathcal{L} =$ 3 ab$^{-1}$ and 140 fb$^{-1}$. Sensitivities on the production cross section $\sigma (pp \to jj\, a)$ times the branching ratio Br$(a \to \gamma Z)$ are also presented.</description>

      <title>Systematic analysis of the pp collisions at LHC energies with Tsallis function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08669v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work focuses on the study of identified hadrons and strange hadrons, recorded by CMS, and light nuclei and their anti-nuclei, recorded by ALICE, at 0.9 TeV, 2.76 TeV, 7 TeV and 13 TeV centre of mass energies in pp collision at mid rapidities. The transverse momentum distributions of these particles are analyzed using the Tsallis model, which fits the experimental data very well. Several important parameters for studying the characteristics of the medium produced during such collisions are extracted. The effective temperature (T) increases monotonically with increasing particle mass and also with increasing collision energy. The non-extensivity parameter (q) decreases with the mass of the particle. For heavier particles, greater T and smaller q mean that they decouple early from the system and attain equilibrium quickly compared to lighter ones. Furthermore, with an increase in collision energy, the multiplicity parameter N0 increases.</description>

      <title>Chiral Gravitational Wave Background from Audible Axion via Nieh-Yan Term</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Axions and axion-like particles can be probed through gravitational waves indirectly, often referred to as "audible axions". The usual concept of audible axion relies on the coupling between the axions and the gauge fields. Here we consider an axion-like mechanism with coupling to the Nieh-Yan term. This interaction leads to the direct and efficient production of gravitational waves during the radiation-dominated era, originating from the tachyonic instability of the gravitational perturbations with the Nieh-Yan term. We calculate the energy spectral density of the chiral gravitational wave background and the comoving energy density of axion-like fields. Based on the numerical results, we explore the parameter space of axion masses and decay constants for detectable gravitational wave signals, either in pulsar timing arrays or space-based gravitational wave detections.</description>

      <title>Leveraging intermediate resonances to probe CP violation at colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08714v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the phenomenological implications of interference between tree-level contributions to three-body final states in $2\to 3$ scattering. We propose a new CP-violating observable in this scattering which probes the different virtualities of intermediate resonances, in the presence of Standard Model~(SM) and new physics contributions to these processes. Analytically, we demonstrate the efficacy of this observable in probing interference between SM charged-current decays and effective left-handed vector interactions, and in a toy model featuring a scalar leptoquark, $S_1 \sim (3, 1, -1/3)$. Numerically, we apply this formalism to studying the decay $pp\to b \tau\nu$ over the full kinematic region of final-state phase space. In contrast to existing probes of new physics at colliders, this study demonstrates a use for an intermediate region of energies, where new physics is not light enough to produced on shell, but not heavy enough to be integrated out and treated with effective-theory formalism. Furthermore, we perform a proof-of-principle analysis to demonstrate how this new search can be complementary to the traditional high-transverse momentum searches. In light of the large amount of data to be collected at the high-luminosity LHC, this study paves the way to further spectroscopic studies to probe CP-violation in $2\to 3$ processes at the LHC and at future colliders.</description>

      <title>Perturbative Unitarity Violation in Radiative Capture Transitions to Dark Matter Bound States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08737v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the formation of bound states of non-relativistic dark matter particles subject to long-range interactions through radiative capture. The initial scattering and final bound states are described by Coulomb potentials with different strengths, as relevant for non-abelian gauge interactions or theories featuring charged scalars. For bound states with generic quantum numbers $n$ and $\ell$, we provide closed-form expressions for the bound-state formation (BSF) cross sections of monopole, dipole and quadrupole transitions, and of arbitrary multipole order when $\ell=n-1$. This allows us to investigate in detail a strong enhancement of BSF that occurs for initial states in a repulsive potential. For $\ell=n-1\gg 1$, we show that the BSF cross section for each single bound state violates the perturbative unitarity bound in the vicinity of a certain critical initial velocity, and provide an interpretation in terms of a smooth matching of classical trajectories. When summing the BSF cross section over all possible bound states in the final state, this leads to a unitarity violation below a certain velocity, but within the validity range of the weakly coupled non-relativistic description. We identify an effectively strong interaction as the origin of this unitarity violation, which is caused by an "anomalously" large overlap of scattering and bound-state wave functions in Coulomb potentials of different strength.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08802v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the rare decay channels of the $Z$ boson: $Z \to \text{two}\ \textrm{jets} + \gamma$ and $Z \to \text{two}\ \textrm{jets} +2\, \gamma$. To obtain the widths and distributions for these processes, we compute the effect of NLO QCD corrections to the processes $Z \to q {\bar q}+ \gamma$ and $Z \to q {\bar q} +2\, \gamma$. We find that these corrections reduce the widths of these processes by about $6.03\%$ and $12.39\%$, respectively. The reduction in the partial widths is larger at the jet level. These NLO-improved decay observables may be tested in future runs of the LHC or at future $e^{+}e^{-}$ colliders.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08068v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A core-corona decomposition of compact (neutron) star models is compared to recent NICER data of masses and radii. It is in particular interesting to capture the outlier XTE~J1814-338. Instead of integrating the TOV equations from the center to surface, we follow here another pathway by accommodating all uncertainties of the equation(s) of state (EoS) at supra-nuclear density or/and an unknown dark matter admixture in a parameterization of the core by its radius $r_x$, the included mass $m_x$ and the pressure $p_x$ at $r_x$. The corona, which may be dubbed also envelope or halo or outer crust, is assumed to be of standard-model matter where the EoS is supposed to be faithfully known.</description>

Abstract: We explore a wider theoretical framework that has quantum field theory built-in, taking the fact that quantum mechanics is reconstructed from quantum field theory as a hint. We formulate a quantum theory with an embedded structure by introducing functional operators, and we find that it could describe the level II multiverse. Topics related to a beginning of the universe such as inflation, the third quantization and the landscape are discussed in our formulation.</description>

      <title>Inflationary constraints on the moduli-dependent species scale in modular invariant theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08467v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that a broad class of modular inflation models predicts the emergence of new physics within an energy range of approximately $10^{15}\, \mathrm{GeV}$ to $10^{17} \, \mathrm{GeV}$. This prediction arises by comparing the moduli-dependent species scale with observational constraints on inflation. Specifically, we illustrate this within the context of $SL(2, \mathbb{Z})$-modular inflation models by re-expressing inflationary observables in terms of the species scale. We further discuss the implications of this approach for generic Calabi-Yau threefolds, showing that this reformulation allows us to directly constrain the fundamental parameters related to the geometry of extra dimensions, specifically the second Chern numbers.</description>

Abstract: In astrophysical environments such as core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) and binary neutron star mergers (BNSMs), neutrinos potentially experience substantial flavor mixing due to the refractive effects of neutrino self-interactions. Determining the survival probability of neutrinos in asymptotic states is paramount to incorporating flavor conversions' effects in the theoretical modeling of CCSN and BNSM. Some phenomenological schemes have shown good performance in approximating asymptotic states of fast neutrino-flavor conversions (FFCs), known as one of the collective neutrino oscillation modes induced by neutrino self-interactions. However, a recent study showed that they would yield qualitatively different asymptotic states of FFC if the neutrino number is forced to evolve. It is not yet fully understood why the canonical phenomenological models fail to predict asymptotic states. In this paper, we perform detailed investigations through numerical simulations and then provide an intuitive explanation with a quasi-homogeneous analysis. Based on the analysis, we propose a new phenomenological model, in which the quasi-steady evolution of FFCs is analytically determined. The model also allows us to express the convolution term of spatial wave number as a concise form, which corresponds to useful information on analyses for the non-linear feedback from small-scale flavor conversions to large-scale ones. Our model yields excellent agreement with numerical simulations, which lends support to our interpretation.</description>

      <title>Higher partial waves in femtoscopy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08541v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Femtoscopy is recently gaining more attention as a new approach complementary to scattering experiments for constraining hadron-hadron interactions. We discuss the effect of higher partial waves on the two-particle correlation function, which has been neglected in traditional formulae used in the femtoscopy analyses. We consider the partial-wave expansion of the wave function in the Koonin-Pratt formula to give the correction to the correlation function by a sum of the contributions from each partial wave. We also generalize the Lednicky-Lyuboshitz formula, which was originally derived for the s-wave interaction, for higher partial waves. We find a compact representation of the generalized Lednicky-Lyuboshitz formula given by the backward scattering amplitude $f(\theta = \pi)$ and the Fourier-Laplace transform of the relative source function, which gives an insight into the structure of the Lednicky-Lyuboshitz formula and its relation to the optical theorem. We numerically demonstrate the significance of higher partial waves with resonances using the square potential well. Also, the generalized Lednicky-Lyuboshitz formula turned out to be broken for higher partial waves, which suggests the importance of the centrifugal force for the higher partial waves.</description>

      <title>Constraining Axion-Like Particles from observations of AGN B2 2234+28A and 3C 454.3</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08577v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Axion-photon oscillation effect provides a possible explanation for the presence of very-high-energy (VHE) $\gamma$-ray signals from distant sources. In this work, we propose a model-dependent method to select possible sources that may give sufficient constraints on the axion parameters. We investigate such effect in the spectra of active galactic nuclei (AGN) B2 2234+28A and 3C 454.3 based on data obtained from Fermi Large Area Telescope (Fermi-LAT) and MAGIC U.L. We utilize the Markov Chain Monte Carlo method to fit the axion parameters, yielding a result of $g_{a\gamma}=3.05^{+0.51}_{-0.31} \times 10^{-11}$ GeV$^{-1}$ for the axion-photon coupling strength and $m_{a}=5.25^{+2.35}_{-2.65} \times 10^{-8} $ eV for the axion mass. We also perform 95\% confidence level (CL) constraints to set an upper limit for $g_{a\gamma}$.</description>

      <title>Revisiting holographic dark energy after DESI 2024</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08639v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: New insights from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) 2024 baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) data, in conjunction with cosmic microwave background (CMB) and Type Ia supernova (SN) data, suggest that dark energy may not be a cosmological constant. In this work, we investigate the cosmological implications of holographic dark energy (HDE) and interacting holographic dark energy (IHDE) models, utilizing CMB, DESI BAO, and SN data. By considering the combined DESI BAO and SN data, we determine that in the IHDE model, the parameter $c &gt; 1$ and the dark-energy equation of state $w$ does not cross $-1$ at the $1\sigma$ confidence level, whereas in the HDE model, it marginally falls below this threshold. Upon incorporating CMB data, we observe that in the HDE model, the parameter $c &lt; 1$ and $w$ crosses $-1$ at a level beyond $10\sigma$. Conversely, for the IHDE model, the likelihood of $w$ crossing $-1$ is considerably diminished, implying that the introduction of interaction within the HDE model could potentially resolve or mitigate the cosmic big rip conundrum. Furthermore, our analysis reveals that the HDE and IHDE models are statistically as viable as the $\Lambda$CDM model when assessing Bayesian evidence with DESI BAO data combined with SN data. However, when CMB data are added, the HDE and IHDE models are significantly less favored compared to the $\Lambda$CDM model. Our findings advocate for further exploration of the HDE and IHDE models using forthcoming, more precise late-universe observations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08710v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this contribution, we extend the discussion about the calculation of the bulk viscosity of quark matter in the normal phase due to electroweak processes and its effect on the damping of baryon density oscillations that might occur in the coalescence of two compact stars. Employing the EoSs from the MIT bag model and perturbative quantum chromodynamics (pQCD) up to $\mathcal{O}(\alpha_s)$, we analyze our results varying densities in the range of temperatures from 0 to 10 MeV for frequencies around 1 kHz. Our estimates show that bulk viscous effects might play a relevant role during the postmerger stage if the system reaches a deconfined quark matter phase.</description>

      <title>Strange and charm quark contributions to the muon anomalous magnetic moment in lattice QCD with twisted-mass fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08852v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a lattice calculation of the Hadronic Vacuum Polarization (HVP) contribution of the strange and charm quarks to the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon in isospin symmetric QCD. We employ the gauge configurations generated by the Extended Twisted Mass Collaboration (ETMC) with $N_f = 2 + 1 + 1$ flavors of Wilson-clover twisted-mass quarks at five lattice spacings and at values of the quark mass parameters that are close and/or include the isospin symmetric QCD point of interest. After computing the small corrections necessary to precisely match this point, and carrying out an extrapolation to the continuum limit based on the data at lattice spacings $a \simeq 0.049, 0.057, 0.068, 0.080$~fm and spatial lattice sizes up to $L \simeq 7.6$~fm, we obtain $a_\mu^{\rm HVP}(s) = (53.57 \pm 0.63) \times 10^{-10}$ and $a_\mu^{\rm HVP}(c) = (14.56 \pm 0.13) \times 10^{-10}$, for the quark-connected strange and charm contributions, respectively. Our findings agree well with the corresponding results by other lattice groups.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08873v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the anisotropies in the spectrum of gravitational waves induced by scalar modes after the end of inflation in canonical, single-field models are completely determined by the tilt of the scalar and tensor power spectra. The latter contains information about anisotropies produced due to the propagation of the tensor modes in an inhomogeneous Universe, whereas the former represents the anisotropies generated at the time of production and arise only when non-Gaussian corrections to the angular power spectrum are considered. Our proof takes into account all scalar interactions in the cubic inflaton Lagrangian.</description>

      <title>New CP Phase and Exact Oscillation Probabilities of Dirac Neutrino derived from Relativistic Equation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2101.03555v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a new formulation for deriving neutrino oscillation probabilities relativistically, based not on the Schr\"odinger equation but on the Dirac equation. In the context of two generations, we calculate the oscillation probabilities precisely in a scenario where only the Dirac mass term is present. Our analysis reveals the emergence of two new features in the oscillation probabilities derived from the Dirac equation. The first feature is that the oscillation probabilities depend on the absolute value of the neutrino mass. While it has generally been assumed that oscillation probabilities depend solely on mass squared differences, we show that they also depend on the absolute mass. The second feature is the emergence of a new CP phase. If interactions exist that can distinguish the flavors of right-handed neutrinos in physics beyond the Standard Model, we could potentially observe this new CP phase even in the two-generation model. We discuss the feasibility of detecting the contributions of these features through neutrino oscillations at atomic scales. In contrast, these effects are negligible in conventional short- and long-baseline experiments, and no contradictions arise with previous findings.</description>

Abstract: In the case of two-generation Majorana neutrinos, we derive the oscillation probabilities for $\nu \leftrightarrow \nu$, $\nu^c \leftrightarrow \nu^c$, and $\nu \leftrightarrow \nu^c$ within a unified framework using a relativistic equation. We demonstrate that the Majorana phase arises not from lepton number violation but from chirality change. Additionally, we verify the conservation of unitarity. Notably, we find that the oscillation probabilities for $\nu \leftrightarrow \nu^c$ derived in this paper differ significantly from previous results, particularly in the absence of zero-distance effects and direct CP violation.</description>

      <title>Pileup density estimate independent on jet multiplicity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.08383v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The hard-scatter processes in hadronic collisions are often largely contaminated with soft background coming from pileup in proton-proton collisions, or underlying event in heavy-ion collisions. There are multiple methods to remove the effect of pileup for jets. Two such methods, Area Subtraction and Constituent Subtraction, use the pileup density as the main ingredient to estimate the magnitude of pileup contribution on an event-by-event basis. The state-of-the-art approaches to estimating pileup density are sensitive to the number of hard-scatter jets in the event. This paper presents a new pileup-density estimation method that minimizes the sensitivity on the presence of hard-scatter jets in the event. Using a detector-level simulation, we provide a comparison of the new method with the state-of-the-art estimation methods. We observe a significantly lower bias for the estimated pileup density when using the new method. We conclude that the new method has the potential to significantly improve pileup mitigation in proton-proton collisions or the underlying event subtraction in heavy-ion collisions.</description>

      <title>A closer look at dark matter production in exponential growth scenarios</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.09801v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate a recently proposed non-thermal mechanism for dark matter production, in which a small initial dark matter ($\chi$) number density undergoes exponential growth through scatterings with bath particles ($\phi$) in the early universe ($\chi \phi \to \chi \chi$). The process ends when the scattering rate becomes Boltzmann suppressed. The analysis, in literature, is performed on the simplifying assumption of the dark matter phase space tracing the equilibrium distribution of either standard model or a hidden sector bath. Owing to the non-thermal nature of the production mechanism, this assumption may not necessarily hold. In this work, we test the validity of this assumption by numerically solving the unintegrated Boltzmann equation for the dark matter distribution. Our results, independent of the initial conditions, show that after exponential growth ceases, the dark matter distribution exhibits equilibrium-like behaviour at low comoving momentum, especially for higher couplings. While full kinetic equilibrium-like behaviour is not reached across all momentum modes, the scaled equilibrium approximation provides reasonable estimates for the dark matter abundance. For more accurate results, however, the full unintegrated Boltzmann equation must be solved.</description>

Abstract: We review the two-zero mass matrix textures approach for Dirac neutrinos with the most recent global fit in the oscillation parameters. We found that three of the 15 possible textures are compatible with current experimental data, while the remaining two-zero textures are ruled out. Two textures are consistent with the neutrino masses' normal hierarchy and are CP-conserving. At the same time, the other one is compatible with both mass orderings and allows for CP violation. We also present the correlations between the oscillation parameters for the allowed two-zero textures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.13157v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that a phase transition may take place in the early Universe at a temperature $T_*$ via a Standard Model singlet scalar field which happens to couple to right handed neutrinos (RHN) resulting a temperature dependent mass for them that finally relaxes to a constant value after electroweak phase transition (EWPT). As a result, a requisite amount of lepton asymmetry can be produced at a temperature close to $T_*$ satisfying the observed baryon asymmetry of the Universe via sphaleron process even when the zero temperature masses of the RHNs fall in sub GeV regime providing a testable scenario for leptogenesis. Interestingly, the framework is also capable of predicting a primordial lepton asymmetry (generated at a temperature below the EWPT), as hinted by helium abundance measuring experiments, bearing a correlation with early phase of leptogenesis.</description>

Abstract: This work investigates hot quark matter under the thermodynamic conditions characteristic of a binary neutron star (BNS) merger remnants. We use the density-dependent quark mass model (DDQM) to access the microscopic nuclear equation of state (EoS). The strange quark matter (SQM) is studied at finite temperature and entropy in the presence of electrons and muons and their neutrinos to simulate the BNS merger conditions. We observe that as the entropy of the SQM increases, the merger remnant becomes more massive, and increases in size whereas the neutrino population also increases. In the fixed temperature case, on the other hand, we observe that the entropy spreads from the surface towards the center of the remnant. We determine the particle distribution in the remnants' core, the remnant's structure, the temperature profile, sound velocity, and the polytropic index and discuss their effects. The strange quark (SQ) remnants satisfy the $2\,{\rm M_\odot}$ mass constraint associated with neutron stars (NS).</description>

      <title>Identification of the $G(3900)$ as the P-wave $D\bar{D}^*/\bar{D}D^*$ resonance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01727v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The BESIII Collaboration recently performed a precise measurement of the $e^+e^-\rightarrow D\bar{D}$ Born cross sections, and confirmed the $G(3900)$ structure reported by BaBar and Belle with high significance. We identify the $G(3900)$ as the first P-wave $\DDbar$ molecular resonance. The experimental and theoretical identification of the P-wave dimeson state holds paramount importance in enhancing our comprehension of the non-perturbative QCD and few-body physics. Its existence is firmly established in a unified meson-exchange model which simultaneously depicts the features of the $\chi_{c1}(3872)$, $Z_c(3900)$ and $T_{cc}(3875)$. This scenario can be directly examined in the $e^+e^-\rightarrow D\bar{D}^*/\bar{D}D^*$ cross section by seeing whether a resonance exists at the threshold. The credibility of the investigations is also ensured by the fact that the P-wave interaction dominantly arises from the well-known long-range pion exchange. Additionally, thanks to the centrifugal barrier, it is easier to form resonances in P-wave than in S-wave. We extensively calculate all systems up to P-wave with various quantum numbers and predict a dense population of the $\DDbar$ and $\DD$ states, where the S-wave $\DDbar$ state with $I^G (J^{PC})=0^- (1^{+-})$, P-wave $\DDbar$ state with $I^G(J^{PC})=0^+(0^{-+})$, and P-wave $\DD$ state with $I(J^P)=0(0^-)$ are more likely to be observed in experiments.</description>

      <title>Momentum shift and on-shell constructible massive amplitudes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15538v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct tree-level amplitude for massive particles using on-shell recursion relations based on two classes of momentum shifts: an all-line transverse shift that deforms momentum by its transverse polarization vector, and a massive BCFW-type shift. We illustrate that these shifts allow us to correctly calculate four-point and five-point amplitudes in massive QED, without an ambiguity associated with the contact terms that may arise from a simple ''gluing'' of lower-point on-shell amplitudes. We discuss various aspects and applicability of the two shifts, including the large-z behavior and complexity scaling. We show that there exists a ''good'' all-line transverse shift for all possible little group configurations of the external particles, which can be extended to a broader class of theories with massive particles such as massive QCD and theories with massive spin-1 particles. The massive BCFW-type shift enjoys more simplicity, but a ''good'' shift does not exist for all the spin states due to the specific choice of spin axis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.04208v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compute the spin-orbit correlations of quarks and gluons at small-$x$ and show that the helicity and the orbital angular momentum of individual partons are strongly anti-aligned even in unpolarized or spinless hadrons and nuclei. Combined with the fact that gluons in the Color Glass Condensate are linearly polarized, our finding indicates that the helicity and the orbital angular momentum of single gluons are maximally entangled in a quantum mechanical sense.</description>

      <title>Majoron-Driven Leptogenesis in Gauged $U(1)_{L_{\mu}-L_{\tau}}$ Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10283v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a novel leptogenesis scenario in the gauged $U(1)_{L_{\mu}-L_{\tau}}$ model. Achieving successful leptogenesis in the $U(1)_{L_{\mu}-L_{\tau}}$ symmetric phase is challenging due to the absence of a CP phase, caused by restriction from the gauge symmetry. To overcome this issue, we introduce an additional global symmetry, $U(1)_{B-L}$, and a scalar field $\Phi$ responsible for breaking this symmetry. Through the kinetic misalignment mechanism, the majoron field associated with $U(1)_{B-L}$ symmetry breaking has a kinetic motion in the early universe. Subsequently, time-dependent majoron field background induces the background CP phase dynamically, leading to successful leptogenesis in the $U(1)_{L_{\mu}-L_{\tau}}$ symmetric phase. Furthermore, majoron itself serves as a dark matter candidate in this scenario. As one of the phenomenological applications, we consider the model that can also explain the muon $g-2$ anomaly.</description>

      <title>Azimuthal spin asymmetries in pion-polarized proton induced Drell-Yan process at COMPASS using holographic light-front QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10623v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compute all the leading-twist azimuthal spin asymmetries in the pion-proton induced Drell-Yan process. These spin asymmetries arise from convolutions of the leading-twist transverse-momentum-dependent parton distributions (TMDs) of both the incoming pion and the target proton. We employ the holographic light-front pion wave functions for the pion TMDs, while for the proton TMDs, we utilize a light-front quark-diquark model constructed by the soft-wall AdS/QCD. The gluon rescattering is crucial to predict nonzero time-reversal odd TMDs. We study the utility of a nonperturbative SU$(3)$ gluon rescattering kernel, which extends beyond the typical assumption of perturbative U$(1)$ gluons. Subsequently, we employ Collins-Soper scale evolution at Next-to-Leading Logarithmic precision for the TMDs evolution. Our predictions for the spin asymmetries are consistent with the available experimental data from COMPASS and other phenomenological studies. We also present the cross section for the pion-nucleus induced Drell-Yan process with the obtained pion TMDs supplemented by the TMDs of the target nucleus.</description>

      <title>NNLL-fast 2.0: Coloured Sparticle Production at the LHC Run 3 with $\sqrt{S}$ = 13.6 TeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18837v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report on updated precision predictions for total cross sections of coloured supersymmetric particle production at the LHC with a centre-of-mass energy of $\sqrt S$ = 13.6 TeV, computed with the modern PDF4LHC21 set. The cross sections are calculated at an approximated NNLO accuracy in QCD and contain corrections from the threshold resummation of soft-gluon emission up to NNLL accuracy as well as Coulomb-gluon contributions including bound-state terms. The corrections are found to increase the cross sections and reduce the theoretical uncertainty as compared to the best available fixed-order calculations. These predictions constitute the state-of-the-art calculations and update the existing results for $\sqrt S$ = 13 TeV. We make our new results publicly available in the version 2.0 update to the code package NNLL-fast.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous Leptogenesis with sub-GeV Axion Like Particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07003v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A derivative coupling of an axion like particle (ALP) with a B-L current may lead to the baryon asymmetry of the universe via spontaneous leptogenesis provided a lepton number breaking interaction prevails in thermal equilibrium. Conventionally, such scenario works only for heavy ALPs and high reheating temperature due to the fact that the same lepton number breaking contribution is tied up with neutrino mass generation also. In this work, we propose inert Higgs doublet assisted lepton number violating operator to relieve such tension so as to generate lepton asymmetry (of freeze-in/out type) with a much lower reheating temperature that can accommodate light (sub-GeV) ALPs sensitive to current and future ALP searches.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.18642v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cosmic-ray antimatter, particularly low-energy antideuterons, serves as a sensitive probe of dark matter annihilating in our Galaxy. We study this smoking-gun signature and explore its complementarity with indirect dark matter searches using cosmic-ray antiprotons. To this end, we develop the neural network emulator $\overline{\text{D}}$arkRayNet, enabling a fast prediction of propagated antideuteron energy spectra for a wide range of annihilation channels and their combinations. We revisit the Monte Carlo simulation of antideuteron coalescence and cosmic-ray propagation, allowing us to explore the uncertainties of both processes. In particular, we take into account uncertainties from the $\Lambda_b$ production rate and consider two distinctly different propagation models. Requiring consistency with cosmic-ray antiproton limits, we find that AMS-02 shows sensitivity to a few windows of dark matter masses only, most prominently below 20 GeV. This region can be probed independently by the upcoming GAPS experiment. The program package $\overline{\text{D}}$arkRayNet is available on GitHub.</description>

      <title>Momentum shift and on-shell recursion relation for electroweak theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14587v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the All-Line Transverse (ALT) shift which we developed for on-shell recursion of amplitudes for particles of any mass. We discuss the validity of the shift for general theories of spin $\leq$ 1, and illustrate the connection between Ward identity and constructibility for massive spin-1 amplitude under the ALT shift. We apply the shift to the electroweak theory, and various four-point scattering amplitudes among electroweak gauge bosons and fermions are constructed. We show explicitly that the four-point gauge boson contact terms in massive electroweak theory automatically arise after recursive construction, independent of UV completion, and they automatically cancel the terms growing as (energy)$^4$ at high energy. We explore UV completion of the electroweak theory that cancels the remaining (energy)$^2$ terms and impose unitarity requirements to constrain additional couplings. The ALT shift framework allows consistent treatment in dealing with contact term ambiguities for renormalizable massive and massless theories, which we show can be useful in studying real-world amplitudes with massive spinors.</description>

      <title>Z_5 two-component dark matter in the Type-II seesaw mechanism</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15116v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the Z5 two-component dark matter model within the framework of the Type-II seesaw mechanism. Due to the new annihilation processes related to triplets, the light component cannot necessarily be dominant in the dark matter relic density, which is different from the Z5 two-component dark matter model in the SM. The model is considered to explain the excess of electron-positron flux measured by the AMS-02 Collaborations in this work, which is encouraged by the decay of the triplets arising from dark matter annihilations in the Galactic halo. We discuss the cases of the light and heavy components determining dark matter density within a viable parameter space satisfying relic density and direct detection constraints, and by fitting the antiproton spectrum observed in the PAMELA and AMS experiments, we find that the parameter space is flexible and the electron-positron flux excess can be obtained in both cases with the mass of two dark matter particles being larger than that of the triplets'.</description>

      <title>X650-&gt;ZZ/WW/H125H95/A450Z -- scalar, tensor or both ?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12178v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: At ICHEP 2024 CMS has published RUN2 results for X650-&gt;ZZ-&gt;4leptons and reached the conclusion that there is no evidence for a scalar resonance H650 decaying into ZZ, as was also concluded by ATLAS using an MVA analysis optimised for a scalar particle. Since this resonance is indicated into ZZ in a Cut Based Analysis and into three other modes: WW, H95H125 and A450Z, the present paper is an attempt to understand these apparent contradictions. Our conclusion, to be confirmed by ATLAS and CMS experiments, is that strict selections for the reaction H650-&gt;ZZ mode seem inadequate, cutting as much into the signal than into the background, therefore reducing its statistical significance. A possible interpretation of this behaviour is that these selections are inefficient for a tensor particle produced by VBF and decaying into ZZ with an angular distributions similar to the Drell Yan background. If true, our description of the various findings in term of the Georgi Machacek model needs to be deeply revised, which is attempted in the present note. A scenario with T650 as a tensor resonance is presented which naturally accommodates WW/ZZ and H95H125 decays, while we suggest that A420Z could come from a H650 resonance degenerate in mass with T650. We propose a scheme in which scalar resonances are accommodated in three doublets, T650 in an isosinglet, T450++, T375+ and T400 belong to an isofiveplet.</description>

      <title>The Gravitational Form Factors of Hadrons from CFT in Momentum Space and the Dilaton in Perturbative QCD</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05609v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze the hard scattering amplitude of the gravitational form factors (GFFs) of hadrons at one-loop, in relation to their conformal field theory (CFT) description, within the framework of QCD factorization for hard exclusive processes at large momentum transfers. These form factors play an essential role in studying the quark and gluon angular momentum of the hadrons due to their relation to the Mellin moments of the Deeply Virtual Compton Scattering (DVCS) invariant amplitudes. Our analysis is performed using a diffeomorphism invariant approach, applying the formalism of the gravitational effective action and conformal symmetry in momentum space for the discussion of the quark and gluon contributions. The interpolating correlator in the hard scattering of any GFF is the non-Abelian $TJJ$ (stress-energy/gluon/gluon) 3-point function at $O(\alpha_s^2)$, revealing an effective dilaton interaction in the $t$-channel due to the trace anomaly, in the form of a massless anomaly pole in the QCD hard scattering, constrained by a sum rule on its spectral density. We investigate the role of quarks, gauge-fixing and ghost contributions in the reconstruction of the hard scattering amplitude mediated by this interaction, performed in terms of its transverse traceless, longitudinal, and trace decomposition, as identified from CFT in momentum space ($CFT_p$). We present a convenient parameterization of the hard scattering amplitude relevant for future experimental investigations of the DVCS/GFF amplitudes at the Electron-Ion Collider at BNL.</description>

Abstract: The Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE) is a leading experiment in neutrino physics which is presently under construction. DUNE aims to measure the yet unknown parameters in the three flavor oscillation case which includes discovery of leptonic CP violation, determination of the neutrino mass hierarchy and measuring the octant of $\theta_{23}$. Additionally, the ancillary goals of DUNE include probing the subdominant effects induced by possible physics beyond the Standard Model (BSM). One such new physics scenario is the possible presence of Large Extra Dimension (LED) which can naturally give rise to tiny neutrino masses. LED impacts neutrino oscillation through two new parameters, - namely the lightest Dirac mass $m_{0}$ and the radius of the extra dimension $R_{\text{ED}}$ ($&lt; 2$ $\mu$m). At the DUNE baseline of 1300 km, the probability seems to be modified more at the higher energy ($\gtrsim 4-5$ GeV) in presence of LED. In this work, we attempt to constrain the parameter space of $m_{0}$ and $R_{\text{ED}}$ by performing a statistical analysis of neutrino data simulated at DUNE far detector (FD). We illustrate how a combination of the standard low energy (LE) neutrino beam and a medium energy (ME) neutrino beam can take advantage of the relatively large impact of LED at higher energy and improve the constraints. In the analysis we also show the role of the individual oscillation channels ($\nu_{\mu} \to \nu_{e}, \nu_{\mu} \to \nu_{\mu}, \nu_{\mu} \to \nu_{\tau}$), as well as the two neutrino mass hierarchies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.00940v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by recently observed anomalies in the flavour sector, we analyse the potential of measurements of top quarks at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) to provide complementary constraints on interactions that shape low-energy precision investigations in the $B$ sector. The measurement of top quark properties, such as the top width and the abundant top pair production channels, are already reaching the percent level at this relatively early stage of the LHC phenomenology program. A focused analysis of four-fermion interactions, employing effective field theory without flavour structure assumptions and incorporating renormalization group evolution effects, bridges $B$ meson scale phenomena with key top quark measurements. We demonstrate that the LHC is increasingly competitive with, and complementary to, flavour physics constraints. Our results, which include a first comprehensive analysis of non-leptonic B decays in this context, suggest that the LHC's top physics program could serve as a valuable, complementary tool in the search for physics beyond the Standard Model within the flavour sector.</description>

      <title>Cosmological foundations revisited with Pantheon+</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.01438v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We reanalyse the Pantheon+ supernova catalogue to compare a cosmology with non-FLRW evolution, the timescape cosmology, with the standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. To this end, we analyse the Pantheon+ for a geometric comparison between the two models. We construct a covariance matrix to be as independent of cosmology as possible, including independence from the FLRW geometry and peculiar velocity with respect to FLRW average evolution. This framework goes far beyond most other definitions of model independence. We introduce new statistics to refine Type Ia supernova (SNe Ia) light-curve analysis. In addition to conventional galaxy correlation functions used to define the scale of statistical homogeneity we introduce empirical statistics which enables refined analysis of the distribution biases of SNe Ia light-curve parameters $\beta c$ and $\alpha x_1$. For lower redshifts, the Bayesian analysis highlights important features attributable to the increased number of low-redshift supernovae, the artefacts of model-dependent light-curve fitting and the cosmic structure through which we observe supernovae. This indicates the need for cosmology-independent data reduction to conduct a stronger investigation of the emergence of statistical homogeneity and to compare alternative cosmologies in light of recent challenges to the standard model. Dark energy is generally invoked as a place-holder for new physics. For the first time, we find evidence that the timescape cosmology may provide a better overall fit than $\Lambda$CDM and that its phenomenology may help disentangle other astrophysical puzzles. Our from-first-principles reanalysis of Pantheon+ supports future deeper studies between the interplay of matter and nonlinear spacetime geometry in a data-driven setting.</description>

Abstract: In our quest to understand the generation of cosmological perturbations, we face two serious obstacles: we do not have direct information about the environment experienced by primordial perturbations during inflation, and our observables are practically limited to correlators of massless fields, heavier fields and derivatives decaying exponentially in the number of e-foldings. The flexible and general framework of open systems has been developed precisely to face similar challenges. Building on previous work, we develop a Schwinger-Keldysh path integral description for an open effective field theory of inflation, describing the possibly dissipative and non-unitary evolution of the Goldstone boson of time translations interacting with an unspecified environment, under the key assumption of locality in space and time. Working in the decoupling limit, we study the linear and interacting theory in de Sitter and derive predictions for the power spectrum and bispectrum that depend on a finite number of effective couplings organised in a derivative expansion. The smoking gun of interactions with the environment is an enhanced but finite bispectrum close to the folded kinematical limit. We demonstrate the generality of our approach by matching our open effective theory to an explicit model. Our construction provides a standard model to simultaneously study phenomenological predictions as well as quantum information aspects of the inflationary dynamics.</description>

      <title>Chiral Separation Effect from Holographic QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07617v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze the chiral separation effect (CSE) in QCD by using the gauge/gravity duality. In QCD, this effect arises from a combination of chiral anomalies and the axial $U(1)$ anomaly. Due to the axial gluon anomaly, the value of the CSE conductivity is not determined by the anomalies of QCD but receives radiative corrections, which leads to nontrivial dependence on temperature and density. To analyze this dependence, we use different variants of V-QCD, a complex holographic model, carefully fitted to QCD data. We find our results for the anomalous CSE conductivity at small chemical potential and nonzero temperature to be in good qualitative agreement with recent results from lattice QCD simulations. We furthermore give predictions for the behavior of the conductivity at finite (vectorial and axial) chemical potentials.</description>

      <title>Primordial acoustic turbulence: three-dimensional simulations and gravitational wave predictions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05826v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gravitational waves (GWs) generated by a first-order phase transition at the electroweak scale are detectable by future space-based detectors like LISA. The lifetime of the resulting shock waves plays an important role in determining the intensity of the generated GWs. We have simulated decaying primordial acoustic turbulence in three dimensions and make a prediction for the universal shape of the energy spectrum by using its self-similar decay properties and the shape of individual shock waves. The shape for the spectrum is used to determine the time dependence of the fluid kinetic energy and the energy containing length scale at late times. The inertial range power law is found to be close to the classically predicted $k^{-2}$ and approaches it with increasing Reynolds number. The resulting model for the velocity spectrum and its decay in time is combined with the sound shell model assumptions about the correlations of the velocity field to compute the GW power spectrum for flows that decay in less than the Hubble time. The decay is found to bring about a convergence in the spectral amplitude and the peak power law that leads to a power law shallower than the $k^9$ of the stationary case.</description>

      <title>Cosmic topology. Part IIIa. Microwave background parity violation without parity-violating microphysics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09400v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The standard cosmological model, which assumes statistical isotropy and parity invariance, predicts the absence of correlations between even-parity and odd-parity observables of the cosmic microwave background (CMB). Contrary to these predictions, large-angle CMB temperature anomalies generically involve correlations between even-$\ell$ and odd-$\ell$ angular power spectrum $C_\ell$, while recent analyses of CMB polarization have revealed non-zero equal-$\ell$ $EB$ correlations. These findings challenge the conventional understanding, suggesting deviations from statistical isotropy, violations of parity, or both. Cosmic topology, which involves changing only the boundary conditions of space relative to standard cosmology, offers a compelling framework to potentially account for such parity-violating observations. Topology inherently breaks statistical isotropy, and can also break homogeneity and parity, providing a natural paradigm for explaining observations of parity-breaking observables without the need to add parity violation to the underlying microphysics. Our investigation delves into the harmonic space implications of topology for CMB correlations, using as an illustrative example $EB$ correlations generated by tensor perturbations under both parity-preserving and parity-violating scenarios. Consequently, these findings not only challenge the foundational assumptions of the standard cosmological model but also open new avenues for exploring the topological structure of the Universe through CMB observations.</description>

      <title>Effects of primordial fluctuations on relic neutrino simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14582v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: After decoupling, relic neutrinos traverse the evolving gravitational imhomogeneities along their trajectories. Once they turn non-relativistic, this results in a significant amplification of the anisotropies in the cosmic neutrino background (C$\nu$B). Past studies have reconstructed the phase-space distribution of relic neutrinos from the local distribution of matter (accounting for the Milky Way halo and the surrounding large-scale structures), but have neglected the C$\nu$B anisotropies in the initial conditions of neutrino trajectories. Using our previously developed N-1-body simulation framework, we show that including these primordial fluctuations in the initial conditions can be important, as it produces similar effects on the abundance and anisotropies of the C$\nu$B as the inclusion of large-scale structures beyond the Milky Way halo. Interpretability of data from future C$\nu$B observatories like PTOLEMY therefore depends on correctly modelling these effects.</description>

      <title>Calibrating Bayesian Generative Machine Learning for Bayesiamplification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00838v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, combinations of generative and Bayesian machine learning have been introduced in particle physics for both fast detector simulation and inference tasks. These neural networks aim to quantify the uncertainty on the generated distribution originating from limited training statistics. The interpretation of a distribution-wide uncertainty however remains ill-defined. We show a clear scheme for quantifying the calibration of Bayesian generative machine learning models. For a Continuous Normalizing Flow applied to a low-dimensional toy example, we evaluate the calibration of Bayesian uncertainties from either a mean-field Gaussian weight posterior, or Monte Carlo sampling network weights, to gauge their behaviour on unsteady distribution edges. Well calibrated uncertainties can then be used to roughly estimate the number of uncorrelated truth samples that are equivalent to the generated sample and clearly indicate data amplification for smooth features of the distribution.</description>

      <title>Limits on planetary-mass primordial black holes from the OGLE high-cadence survey of the Magellanic Clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06251v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Observations of the Galactic bulge revealed an excess of short-timescale gravitational microlensing events that are generally attributed to a large population of free-floating or wide-orbit exoplanets. However, in recent years, some authors suggested that planetary-mass primordial black holes (PBHs) comprising a substantial fraction (1%-10%) of the dark matter in the Milky Way may be responsible for these events. If that was the case, a large number of short-timescale microlensing events should also be seen toward the Magellanic Clouds. Here, we report the results of a high-cadence survey of the Magellanic Clouds carried out from 2022 October through 2024 May as part of the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment. We observed almost 35 million source stars located in the central regions of the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds and found only one long-timescale microlensing event candidate. No short-timescale events were detected despite high sensitivity to such events. That allows us to infer the strongest available limits on the frequency of planetary-mass PBHs in dark matter. We find that PBHs and other compact objects with masses from $1.4 \times 10^{-8}\,M_{\odot}$ (half of the Moon mass) to $0.013\,M_{\odot}$ (planet/brown dwarf boundary) may comprise at most 1% of dark matter. That rules out the PBH origin hypothesis for the short-timescale events detected toward the Galactic bulge and indicates they are caused by the population of free-floating or wide-orbit planets.</description>

      <title>Quantum-annealing-inspired algorithms for multijet clustering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.14233v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Jet clustering or reconstruction is a crucial component at high energy colliders, a procedure to identify sprays of collimated particles originating from the fragmentation and hadronization of quarks and gluons. It is a complicated combinatorial optimization problem and requires intensive computing resources. In this study, we formulate jet reconstruction as a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) problem and introduce novel quantum-annealing-inspired algorithms for clustering multiple jets in electron-positron collision events. One of these quantum-annealing-inspired algorithms, ballistic simulated bifurcation, overcomes problems previously observed in multijet clustering with quantum-annealing approaches. We find that both the distance defined in the QUBO matrix and the prediction power of the QUBO solvers have crucial impacts on the multijet clustering performance. This study opens up a new approach to globally reconstructing multijet beyond dijet in one go, in contrast to the traditional iterative method.</description>
