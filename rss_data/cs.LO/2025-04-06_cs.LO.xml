      <title>First-Order Modal Logic via Logical Categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02985v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend the logical categories framework to first order modal logic. In our modal categories, modal operators are applied directly to subobjects and interact with the background factorization system. We prove a Joyal-style representation theorem into relational structures formalizing a `counterpart' notion. We investigate saturation conditions related to definability questions and we enrich our framework with quotients and disjoint sums, thus leading to the notion of a modal (quasi) pretopos. We finally show how to build syntactic categories out of first order modal theories.</description>

      <title>Fuzzy Implicative Rules: A Unified Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03000v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rule mining algorithms are one of the fundamental techniques in data mining for disclosing significant patterns in terms of linguistic rules expressed in natural language. In this paper, we revisit the concept of fuzzy implicative rule to provide a solid theoretical framework for any fuzzy rule mining algorithm interested in capturing patterns in terms of logical conditionals rather than the co-occurrence of antecedent and consequent. In particular, we study which properties should satisfy the fuzzy operators to ensure a coherent behavior of different quality measures. As a consequence of this study, we introduce a new property of fuzzy implication functions related to a monotone behavior of the generalized modus ponens for which we provide different valid solutions. Also, we prove that our modeling generalizes others if an adequate choice of the fuzzy implication function is made, so it can be seen as an unifying framework. Further, we provide an open-source implementation in Python for mining fuzzy implicative associative rules. We test the applicability and relevance of our framework for different real datasets and fuzzy operators.</description>

      <title>Linear Decomposition of the Majority Boolean Function using the Ones on Smaller Variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03262v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A long-investigated problem in circuit complexity theory is to decompose an $n$-input or $n$-variable Majority Boolean function (call it $M_n$) using $k$-input ones ($M_k$), $k &lt; n$, where the objective is to achieve the decomposition using fewest $M_k$'s. An $\mathcal{O}(n)$ decomposition for $M_n$ has been proposed recently with $k=3$. However, for an arbitrary value of $k$, no such construction exists even though there are several works reporting continual improvement of lower bounds, finally achieving an optimal lower bound $\Omega(\frac{n}{k}\log k)$ as provided by Lecomte et. al., in CCC '22. In this direction, here we propose two decomposition procedures for $M_n$, utilizing counter trees and restricted partition functions, respectively. The construction technique based on counter tree requires $\mathcal{O}(n)$ such many $M_k$ functions, hence presenting a construction closest to the optimal lower bound, reported so far. The decomposition technique using restricted partition functions present a novel link between Majority Boolean function construction and elementary number theory. These decomposition techniques close a gap in circuit complexity studies and are also useful for leveraging emerging computing technologies.</description>

      <title>On the consistency of stronger lower bounds for NEXP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03320v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It was recently shown by Atserias, Buss and Mueller that the standard complexity-theoretic conjecture NEXP not in P / poly is consistent with the relatively strong bounded arithmetic theory V^0_2, which can prove a substantial part of complexity theory. We observe that their approach can be extended to show that the stronger conjectures NEXP not in EXP / poly and NEXP not in coNEXP are consistent with a stronger theory, which includes every true universal number-sort sentence.</description>

      <title>Complete First-Order Game Logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03495v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: First-order game logic GL and the first-order modal mu-calculus Lmu are proved to be equiexpressive and equivalent, thereby fully aligning their expressive and deductive power. That is, there is a semantics-preserving translation from GL to Lmu, and vice versa. And both translations are provability-preserving, while equivalence with there-and-back-again roundtrip translations are provable in both calculi. This is to be contrasted with the propositional case, where game logic is strictly less expressive than the modal mu-calculus (without adding sabotage games).
  The extensions with differential equations, differential game logic (dGL) and differential modal mu-calculus are also proved equiexpressive and equivalent. Moreover, as the continuous dynamics are definable by fixpoints or via games, ODEs can be axiomatized completely. Rational gameplay provably collapses the games into single-player games to yield a strong arithmetical completeness theorem for dGL with rational-time ODEs.</description>

      <title>A framework for computing upper bounds in passive learning settings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03517v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The task of inferring logical formulas from examples has garnered significant attention as a means to assist engineers in creating formal specifications used in the design, synthesis, and verification of computing systems. Among various approaches, enumeration algorithms have emerged as some of the most effective techniques for this task. These algorithms employ advanced strategies to systematically enumerate candidate formulas while minimizing redundancies by avoiding the generation of syntactically different but semantically equivalent formulas. However, a notable drawback is that these algorithms typically do not provide guarantees of termination, which poses challenges for their use in real-world applications.
  This paper develops an abstract framework to bound the size of possible solutions for a logic inference task, thereby providing a termination guarantee for enumeration algorithms through the introduction of a sufficient stopping criterion. The proposed framework is designed with flexibility in mind and is applicable to a broad spectrum of practically relevant logical formalisms, including Modal Logic, Linear Temporal Logic, Computation Tree Logic, Alternating-time Temporal Logic, and even selected inference task for finite automata. In addition, our approach enabled us to develop a new class of algorithms that enumerate over the semantics of formulas rather than their syntactic representations, offering new possibilities for reducing redundancy.</description>

      <title>Undefinability of Approximation of 2-to-2 Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03523v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent work by Atserias and Dawar (J. Log. Comp 2019) and Tucker-Foltz (LMCS 2024) has established undefinability results in fixed-point logic with counting (FPC) corresponding to many classical complexity results from the hardness of approximation. In this line of work, NP-hardness results are turned into unconditional FPC undefinability results. We extend this work by showing the FPC undefinability of any constant factor approximation of weighted 2-to-2 games, based on the NP-hardness results of Khot, Minzer and Safra. Our result shows that the completely satisfiable 2-to-2 games are not FPC-separable from those that are not epsilon-satisfiable, for arbitrarily small epsilon. The perfect completeness of our inseparability is an improvement on the complexity result, as the NP-hardness of such a separation is still only conjectured. This perfect completeness enables us to show the FPC undefinability of other problems whose NP-hardness is conjectured. In particular, we are able to show that no FPC formula can separate the 3-colourable graphs from those that are not t-colourable, for any constant t.</description>

      <title>Distributionally Robust Predictive Runtime Verification under Spatio-Temporal Logic Specifications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02964v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cyber-physical systems designed in simulators, often consisting of multiple interacting agents, behave differently in the real-world. We would like to verify these systems during runtime when they are deployed. Thus, we propose robust predictive runtime verification (RPRV) algorithms for: (1) general stochastic CPS under signal temporal logic (STL) tasks, and (2) stochastic multi-agent systems (MAS) under spatio-temporal logic tasks. The RPRV problem presents the following challenges: (1) there may not be sufficient data on the behavior of the deployed CPS, (2) predictive models based on design phase system trajectories may encounter distribution shift during real-world deployment, and (3) the algorithms need to scale to the complexity of MAS and be applicable to spatio-temporal logic tasks. To address these challenges, we assume knowledge of an upper bound on the statistical distance (in terms of an f-divergence) between the trajectory distributions of the system at deployment and design time. We are motivated by our prior work [1, 2] where we proposed an accurate and an interpretable RPRV algorithm for general CPS, which we here extend to the MAS setting and spatio-temporal logic tasks. Specifically, we use a learned predictive model to estimate the system behavior at runtime and robust conformal prediction to obtain probabilistic guarantees by accounting for distribution shifts. Building on [1], we perform robust conformal prediction over the robust semantics of spatio-temporal reach and escape logic (STREL) to obtain centralized RPRV algorithms for MAS. We empirically validate our results in a drone swarm simulator, where we show the scalability of our RPRV algorithms to MAS and analyze the impact of different trajectory predictors on the verification result. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first statistically valid algorithms for MAS under distribution shift.</description>

      <title>Verification of Autonomous Neural Car Control with KeYmaera X</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03272v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article presents a formal model and formal safety proofs for the ABZ'25 case study in differential dynamic logic (dL). The case study considers an autonomous car driving on a highway avoiding collisions with neighbouring cars. Using KeYmaera X's dL implementation, we prove absence of collision on an infinite time horizon which ensures that safety is preserved independently of trip length. The safety guarantees hold for time-varying reaction time and brake force. Our dL model considers the single lane scenario with cars ahead or behind. We demonstrate that dL with its tools is a rigorous foundation for runtime monitoring, shielding, and neural network verification. Doing so sheds light on inconsistencies between the provided specification and simulation environment highway-env of the ABZ'25 study. We attempt to fix these inconsistencies and uncover numerous counterexamples which also indicate issues in the provided reinforcement learning environment.</description>

      <title>Realizing the totally unordered structure of ordinals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03532v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present tools for analysing ordinals in realizability models of classical set theory built using Krivine's technique for realizability. This method uses a conservative extension of $ZF$ known as $ZF_{\varepsilon}$, where two membership relations co-exist, the usual one denoted $\in$ and a stricter one denoted $\varepsilon$ that does not satisfy the axiom of extensionality; accordingly we have two equality relations, the extensional one $\simeq$ and the strict identity $=$ referring to sets that satisfy the same formulas. We define recursive names using an operator that we call reish, and we show that the class of recursive names for ordinals coincides extensionally with the class of ordinals of realizability models. We show that reish$(\omega)$ is extensionally equal to omega in any realizability model, thus recursive names provide a useful tool for computing $\omega$ in realizability models. We show that on the contrary $\varepsilon$-totally ordered sets do not form a proper class and therefore cannot be used to fully represent the ordinals in realizability models. Finally we present some tools for preserving cardinals in realizability models, including an analogue for realizability algebras of the forcing property known as the $\kappa$-chain condition.</description>

      <title>An ecumenical view of proof-theoretic semantics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.03656v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Debates concerning philosophical grounds for the validity of classical and intuitionistic logics often have the very nature of logical proofs as one of the main points of controversy. The intuitionist advocates for a strict notion of constructive proof, while the classical logician advocates for a notion which allows non-construtive proofs through reductio ad absurdum. A great deal of controversy still subsists to this day on the matter, as there is no agreement between disputants on the precise standing of non-constructive methods.
  Two very distinct approaches to logic are currently providing interesting contributions to this debate. The first, oftentimes called logical ecumenism, aims to provide a unified framework in which two "rival" logics may peacefully coexist, thus providing some sort of neutral ground for the contestants. The second, proof-theoretic semantics, aims not only to elucidate the meaning of a logical proof, but also to provide means for its use as a basic concept of semantic analysis. Logical ecumenism thus provides a medium in which meaningful interactions may occur between classical and intuitionistic logic, whilst proof-theoretic semantics provides a way of clarifying what is at stake when one accepts or denies reductio ad absurdum as a meaningful proof method.
  In this paper we show how to coherently combine both approaches by providing not only a medium in which classical and intuitionistic logics may coexist, but also one in which classical and intuitionistic notions of proof may coexist.</description>

      <title>A Characterization of Basic Feasible Functionals Through Higher-Order Rewriting and Tuple Interpretations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.12385v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The class of type-two basic feasible functionals ($\mathtt{BFF}_2$) is the analogue of $\mathtt{FP}$ (polynomial time functions) for type-2 functionals, that is, functionals that can take (first-order) functions as arguments. $\mathtt{BFF}_2$ can be defined through Oracle Turing machines with running time bounded by second-order polynomials. On the other hand, higher-order term rewriting provides an elegant formalism for expressing higher-order computation. We address the problem of characterizing $\mathtt{BFF}_2$ by higher-order term rewriting. Various kinds of interpretations for first-order term rewriting have been introduced in the literature for proving termination and characterizing first-order complexity classes. In this paper, we consider a recently introduced notion of cost-size interpretations for higher-order term rewriting and see second order rewriting as ways of computing type-2 functionals. We then prove that the class of functionals represented by higher-order terms admitting polynomially bounded cost-size interpretations exactly corresponds to $\mathtt{BFF}_2$.</description>

      <title>Constructibility, computational complexity and P versus NP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16843v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A decision problem called the IPL problem is defined, and it is argued for the validity of an associated thesis called the IPL thesis. This thesis states that for some instances of the IPL problem, while an algorithm for verifying correct solutions to the problem in polynomial time is explicitly constructible, the IPL problem itself is algorithmically unsolvable in the sense that no explicitly constructed algorithm can be verified as solving the problem. Thus the IPL thesis implies that under a constructive interpretation of algorithmic complexity classes, which is arguably their only meaningful interpretation, NP is not contained in any complexity class consisting of algorithmically solvable problems. In particular, the thesis implies a solution to the P versus NP problem: P is not equal to NP. It also implies that NP is not contained in EXPTIME, seemingly contradicting a well known result. However, classical proofs of the opposite result for EXPTIME tacitly use an assumption concerning constructibility which, assuming the IPL thesis, does not hold for the IPL problem under a constructive interpretation of NP.</description>

      <title>Reasoning Around Paradox with Grounded Deduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08243v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: How can we reason around logical paradoxes without falling into them? This paper introduces grounded deduction or GD, a Kripke-inspired approach to first-order logic and arithmetic that is neither classical nor intuitionistic, but nevertheless appears both pragmatically usable and intuitively justifiable. GD permits the direct expression of unrestricted recursive definitions -- including paradoxical ones such as 'L := not L' -- while adding dynamic typing premises to certain inference rules so that such paradoxes do not lead to inconsistency. This paper constitutes a preliminary development and investigation of grounded deduction, to be extended with further elaboration and deeper analysis of its intriguing properties.</description>
