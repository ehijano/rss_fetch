      <title>Generation of Streaming Beam-Plasma Instability in Variable Lunar Plasma around Moon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19671v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-stream instability (TSI) is studied analytically in the lunar plasma environment. The electrons in the solar wind constitute the electron-beam and the lunar electron plasma constitutes the background plasma with which the electron-beam interacts to trigger the TSI. The lunar plasma is considered to have a variable proportion of the energetic (hot) electrons, 1% to 25% of the total lunar electrons, along with the bulk thermal (cold) population. The analysis shows that the presence of energetic electrons in the lunar plasma environment modify the TSI dispersion relation and can have a significant impact on the triggering of TSI and are capable of triggering nonlinear phenomena by making the lunar plasma system unstable.</description>

      <title>Predictive power-sharing scaling law in double-null L-mode plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The physical mechanisms regulating the power sharing at the outer targets of L-mode double-null (DN) configurations are investigated using nonlinear, flux-driven, three-dimensional two-fluid simulations. Scans of parameters that regulate the turbulent level, such as the plasma resistivity and the magnetic imbalance, reveal that the power asymmetry in DN configurations is determined by the combined effects of diamagnetic drift, turbulence, and geometrical factor. Leveraging these observations, an analytical theory-based scaling law for the power-sharing asymmetry is derived and compared with nonlinear simulations. These comparisons indicate that the scaling law effectively captures the trends observed in simulations. Validation with experimental data from TCV DN discharges demonstrates agreement of the scaling law with the experimental results.</description>

      <title>Oblique Instability of Quasi-Parallel Whistler Waves in the Presence of Cold and Warm Electron Populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19818v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Whistler waves propagating nearly parallel to the ambient magnetic field experience a nonlinear instability that generates oblique electrostatic waves, including whistlers near the resonance cone that resemble oblique chorus in the Earth's magnetosphere. Focusing on the generation of oblique whistlers, earlier analysis of the instability is extended to the case where low-energy background plasma consists of both a "cold" population with energy ~ eV and a "warm" electron component with energy ~100 eV. This is motivated by observations in the Earth's magnetosphere where oblique chorus waves were shown to interact resonantly with the warm electrons. The main results are: i) the instability producing oblique whistlers is sensitive to the shape of the electron distribution at low energies. In the whistler range of frequencies, two distinct peaks in the growth rate are typically present: one at low wavenumbers associated with the warm population and one at high wavenumbers associated with the cold population; ii) the instability producing oblique whistler waves persists in cases where the temperature of the cold population is relatively high, including cases where cold population is absent and only the warm population is included; iii) particle-in-cell simulations show that the instability leads to heating of the background plasma and formation of characteristic resonant plateau and beam features in the electron distribution. The plateau/beam features have been previously detected in spacecraft observations of oblique chorus waves. However, they were attributed to external sources and were proposed to be the mechanism generating oblique chorus. In the present scenario, the causality link is reversed: the instability generating oblique whistler waves is shown to be a possible mechanism to generate the plateau/beam features.</description>

      <title>High-order finite-volume integration schemes for subsonic magnetohydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.09856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.09856v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an efficient dimension-by-dimension finite-volume method which solves the adiabatic magnetohydrodynamics equations at high discretization order, using the constrained-transport approach on Cartesian grids. Results are presented up to tenth order of accuracy. This method requires only one reconstructed value per face for each computational cell. A passage through high-order point values leads to a modest growth of computational cost with increasing discretization order. At a given resolution, these high-order schemes present significantly less numerical dissipation than commonly employed lower-order approaches. Thus, results of comparable accuracy are achievable at a substantially coarser resolution, yielding overall performance gains. We also present a way to include physical dissipative terms: viscosity, magnetic diffusivity and cooling functions, respecting the finite-volume and constrained-transport frameworks.</description>

      <title>All-optical source size and emittance measurements of laser-accelerated electron beams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.08314v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Novel schemes for generating ultra-low emittance electron beams have been developed in past years and promise compact particle sources with excellent beam quality suitable for future high-energy physics experiments and free-electron lasers. Recent theoretical work has proposed a laser-based method capable of resolving emittances in the sub 0.1 mm mrad regime, by modulating the electron phase-space ponderomotively. Here we present a first experimental demonstration of this scheme using a laser wakefield accelerator. The observed emittance and source size is consistent with published values. We also show calculations demonstrating that tight bounds on the upper limit for emittance and source size can be derived from the 'laser-grating' method even in the presence of low signal to noise and uncertainty in laser-grating parameters.</description>
