      <title>Topological Relics of Infrared QED in the Rayleigh-Jeans Regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14928v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit infrared Quantum Electrodynamics (QED) by reformulating the dressing of charged states in terms of a functional Berry connection. In this framework, the electron--photon cloud acquires a topological character, leading to a modification of the Rayleigh-Jeans limit of blackbody radiation. The deviation is controlled by a dimensionless parameter $\epsilon$, estimated as $\epsilon \simeq (1.7$--$2.3)\times 10^{-3}$ in the $80$-$110~\mathrm{GHz}$ range, corresponding to a fractional shift of $\sim 0.2\%$. This effect lies within the sensitivity of current high-precision radiometry and, being system-independent, should be observable both in laboratory blackbody spectra and in the cosmic microwave background.</description>

      <title>Equivalence between the pair correlation functions of primes and of spins in a two-dimensional Ising model with randomly distributed competing interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we prove the equivalence between the pair correlation functions of primes, and of spins in a two-dimensional (2D) Ising model with a mixture of ferromagnetic and randomly distributed competing interactions. At first, we prove that the correlation function between a pair of spins in a distance l within the 2D Ising model is larger than zero at whole temperature region. Second, we prove that the pair correlation function of spins in the model is equivalent to the pair correlation function of its energy levels. Third, we prove that the energy-energy correlation function of the model is equivalent to the pair correlation function of nontrivial zeros of the Dirichlet function (including the Riemann zeta function). Fourth, we prove that the pair correlation function between the nontrivial zeros of the Dirichlet function is equivalent to the correlation function between a pair of primes p and p+q for every even q. In a conclusion, we have proven that the pair correlation function of primes p and p+q for every even q is larger than zero.</description>

      <title>Topological Regularization of 1 Loop and 2 Loop Gravitational Corrections in the Higgs Fermion Sector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13183v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work presents topological regularization (TR), a geometric framework for controlling ultraviolet divergences in gravitational loop corrections to the Higgs fermion sector. The method embeds flat spacetime into a compact four dimensional manifold, introducing a curvature induced high energy cutoff that preserves both Lorentz invariance and causality. The regulator is determined by the manifold's Euler characteristic, ensuring power law suppression of short distance modes without breaking spacetime symmetries. Applied to one and two loop processes, TR yields finite corrections to fermion self energies, Yukawa couplings, and curvature dependent operators, with leading contributions set entirely by topological properties. Beyond its role as a regulator, TR naturally encodes a duality between ultraviolet and infrared scales and admits a thermal interpretation linked to the Unruh effect. While the framework is universal in principle, its current implementation relies on a spherical embedding and has been tested only in the soft graviton limit. The predicted signals are highly suppressed, posing experimental challenges, yet TR offers a symmetry preserving path toward probing Planck-scale physics within effective field theory.</description>
