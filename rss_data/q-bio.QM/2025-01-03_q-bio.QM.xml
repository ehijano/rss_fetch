      <title>Relation-Aware Equivariant Graph Networks for Epitope-Unknown Antibody Design and Specificity Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Antibodies are Y-shaped proteins that protect the host by binding to specific antigens, and their binding is mainly determined by the Complementary Determining Regions (CDRs) in the antibody. Despite the great progress made in CDR design, existing computational methods still encounter several challenges: 1) poor capability of modeling complex CDRs with long sequences due to insufficient contextual information; 2) conditioned on pre-given antigenic epitopes and their static interaction with the target antibody; 3) neglect of specificity during antibody optimization leads to non-specific antibodies. In this paper, we take into account a variety of node features, edge features, and edge relations to include more contextual and geometric information. We propose a novel Relation-Aware Antibody Design (RAAD) framework, which dynamically models antigen-antibody interactions for co-designing the sequences and structures of antigen-specific CDRs. Furthermore, we propose a new evaluation metric to better measure antibody specificity and develop a contrasting specificity-enhancing constraint to optimize the specificity of antibodies. Extensive experiments have demonstrated the superior capability of RAAD in terms of antibody modeling, generation, and optimization across different CDR types, sequence lengths, pre-training strategies, and input contexts.</description>

      <title>Quality of life and perceived care of patients in advanced chronic kidney disease consultations: a cross-sectional descriptive study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Objetive: In the care of renal patients, prioritising their quality of life and nursing care is essential. Research links patients' perceptions of care quality to improved outcomes such as safety, clinical efficacy, treatment adherence, and preventive practices. This study aimed to evaluate the quality of life and care perception in these patients and explore potential associations between these dimensions. Material and methods: A cross-sectional descriptive study was conducted with 43 patients attending an advanced CKD clinic. Quality of life was assessed using the KDQOL-36 questionnaire, while the IECPAX questionnaire measured perceived care quality. Sociodemographic and clinical data were collected from patient records. Participants completed the questionnaires during routine visits, with scores analysed to identify associations between variables. Results: The study included 60% men (n=28) and 32% women (n=15), with a mean age of 78 years . Among participants, 45% were diabetic, 79% hypertensive, and 58% took more than five medications daily. Mean scores were 78.76 for KDQOL-36 and 5.54 for IECPAX. Significant differences were found in the physical role domain between men and women (p=0.01) and for individuals over 65 years (p=0.04). Higher IECPAX scores were associated with taking more than five medications (p=0.05). However, no correlation was observed between KDQOL-36 and IECPAX scores. Conclusions: The findings suggest that quality of life and perceived care quality are independent in advanced CKD patients. While this study provides insights, larger multicentre studies are needed to validate these results. These findings highlight the importance of addressing both aspects separately to improve outcomes in this population.</description>

      <title>A Systematic Computational Framework for Practical Identifiability Analysis in Mathematical Models arising from biology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Practical identifiability is a critical concern in data-driven modeling of mathematical systems. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for practical identifiability analysis to evaluate parameter identifiability in mathematical models of biological systems. Starting with a rigorous mathematical definition of practical identifiability, we demonstrate its equivalence to the invertibility of the Fisher Information Matrix. Our framework establishes the relationship between practical identifiability and coordinate identifiability, introducing a novel metric that simplifies and accelerates the evaluation of parameter identifiability compared to the profile likelihood method. Additionally, we introduce new regularization terms to address non-identifiable parameters, enabling uncertainty quantification and improving model reliability. To guide experimental design, we present an optimal data collection algorithm that ensures all model parameters are practically identifiable. Applications to Hill functions, neural networks, and dynamic biological models demonstrate the feasibility and efficiency of the proposed computational framework in uncovering critical biological processes and identifying key observable variables.</description>

      <title>How Honeybees Perceive and Traverse Apertures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00646v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ability to fly through openings in vegetation allows insects like bees to access otherwise unreachable food sources. The specific visual strategies employed by flying insects during aperture negotiation tasks remain unknown. In this study, we investigated the visual and geometric parameters of apertures that influence honeybee flight. We recorded honeybees flying through apertures with varying shapes and sizes using high-speed cameras to examine their spatial distribution patterns and trajectories during passage. Our results reveal that the flight of bees was, on average, along the bilateral center of the edges of the aperture irrespective of the size. When apertures were smaller, bees tended to also fly closer to the vertical center. However, for larger apertures, they traverse at lower vertical positions (closer to the bottom edge). The behaviors suggest that honeybees modulate their flight trajectories in response to spatial constraints, adjusting trajectory relative to aperture dimensions. When entering at off-center horizontal positions, bees tended to access the vertical center of the aperture, indicating altitude selection influenced by the curvature of the edge below. This behavior suggests an acute awareness of the vertical and horizontal spatial constraints and a preference for maintaining a curvature-dependent altitude that optimizes safe passage. Our analysis reveals that honeybees modulate speed and altitude above the ventral edge passing beneath them, maintaining a median ventral optic flow of 778 deg/s. This relationship suggests a control mechanism where bees rely on visual information in a narrow ventrally directed field to navigate safely through confined spaces.</description>

      <title>Accurate RNA 3D structure prediction using a language model-based deep learning approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.01586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.01586v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate prediction of RNA three-dimensional (3D) structure remains an unsolved challenge. Determining RNA 3D structures is crucial for understanding their functions and informing RNA-targeting drug development and synthetic biology design. The structural flexibility of RNA, which leads to scarcity of experimentally determined data, complicates computational prediction efforts. Here, we present RhoFold+, an RNA language model-based deep learning method that accurately predicts 3D structures of single-chain RNAs from sequences. By integrating an RNA language model pre-trained on ~23.7 million RNA sequences and leveraging techniques to address data scarcity, RhoFold+ offers a fully automated end-to-end pipeline for RNA 3D structure prediction. Retrospective evaluations on RNA-Puzzles and CASP15 natural RNA targets demonstrate RhoFold+'s superiority over existing methods, including human expert groups. Its efficacy and generalizability are further validated through cross-family and cross-type assessments, as well as time-censored benchmarks. Additionally, RhoFold+ predicts RNA secondary structures and inter-helical angles, providing empirically verifiable features that broaden its applicability to RNA structure and function studies.</description>

      <title>Portable-CELLxGENE: standalone executables of CELLxGENE for easy installation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11844v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Biologists who want to analyse their single-cell transcriptomics dataset must install and use specialist software via the command line. This is often impractical for non-bioinformaticians. Whilst the popular CELLxGENE software provides an intuitive graphical interface to facilitate analysis outside the command line, its server-side installation and execution remain complex. A version that is easier to install and run would allow non-bioinformaticians to take advantage of this valuable tool without needing to use the command line. Portable-CELLxGENE is a standalone distribution of CELLxGENE that can be installed via a graphical interface. It contains an easy-to-use extension of the CELLxGENE-Gateway Python package to allow the analysis of multiple datasets.
  Availability and implementation: Versions of Portable-CELLxGENE for Windows and MacOS, along with its source code, are available at github.com/george-hall-ucl/portable-cellxgene. It is licensed under the GNU General Public License v3.</description>

      <title>IVIM-Morph: Motion-compensated quantitative Intra-voxel Incoherent Motion (IVIM) analysis for functional fetal lung maturity assessment from diffusion-weighted MRI data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.07126v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantitative analysis of pseudo-diffusion in diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DWI) data shows potential for assessing fetal lung maturation and generating valuable imaging biomarkers. Yet, the clinical utility of DWI data is hindered by unavoidable fetal motion during acquisition. We present IVIM-morph, a self-supervised deep neural network model for motion-corrected quantitative analysis of DWI data using the Intra-voxel Incoherent Motion (IVIM) model. IVIM-morph combines two sub-networks, a registration sub-network, and an IVIM model fitting sub-network, enabling simultaneous estimation of IVIM model parameters and motion. To promote physically plausible image registration, we introduce a biophysically informed loss function that effectively balances registration and model-fitting quality. We validated the efficacy of IVIM-morph by establishing a correlation between the predicted IVIM model parameters of the lung and gestational age (GA) using fetal DWI data of 39 subjects. IVIM-morph exhibited a notably improved correlation with gestational age (GA) when performing in-vivo quantitative analysis of fetal lung DWI data during the canalicular phase. IVIM-morph shows potential in developing valuable biomarkers for non-invasive assessment of fetal lung maturity with DWI data. Moreover, its adaptability opens the door to potential applications in other clinical contexts where motion compensation is essential for quantitative DWI analysis. The IVIM-morph code is readily available at: https://github.com/TechnionComputationalMRILab/qDWI-Morph.</description>

      <title>Using pretrained graph neural networks with token mixers as geometric featurizers for conformational dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19838v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Identifying informative low-dimensional features that characterize dynamics in molecular simulations remains a challenge, often requiring extensive manual tuning and system-specific knowledge. Here, we introduce geom2vec, in which pretrained graph neural networks (GNNs) are used as universal geometric featurizers. By pretraining equivariant GNNs on a large dataset of molecular conformations with a self-supervised denoising objective, we obtain transferable structural representations that are useful for learning conformational dynamics without further fine-tuning. We show how the learned GNN representations can capture interpretable relationships between structural units (tokens) by combining them with expressive token mixers. Importantly, decoupling training the GNNs from training for downstream tasks enables analysis of larger molecular graphs (such as small proteins at all-atom resolution) with limited computational resources. In these ways, geom2vec eliminates the need for manual feature selection and increases the robustness of simulation analyses.</description>

      <title>An evolutionary game theory approach to modeling behavioral interaction in disclosing infection begins with an outbreak: COVID-19 as an example</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17996v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The global impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the livelihoods of people worldwide prompted the implementation of a range of preventive measures at local, national, and international levels. Early in the outbreak, before the vaccine became accessible, voluntary quarantine and social isolation emerged as crucial strategies to curb the spread of infection. In this research, we present a game-theoretic model to elucidate the voluntary disclosure of exposure to infected individuals within communities. By employing a fractional derivative approach to illustrate disease propagation within the compartmental model, we determine the minimum level of voluntary disclosure required to disrupt the chain of transmission and allow the epidemic to fade. Our findings suggest that higher transmission rates and increased perceived severity of infection change the externality of disclosing infected exposure, thereby contributing to a rise in the proportion of individuals opting for quarantine and reducing disease incidence. We estimate behavioral parameters and transmission rates by fitting the model to hospitalized cases in Chile, South America. Results from our paper underscore the potential for public health authorities to influence and regulate voluntary disclosure of infection during emerging outbreaks through effective risk communication, emphasizing the severity of the disease, and providing accurate information about hospital capacity to the public.</description>
