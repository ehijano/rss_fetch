      <title>SSM2Mel: State Space Model to Reconstruct Mel Spectrogram from the EEG</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Decoding speech from brain signals is a challenging research problem that holds significant importance for studying speech processing in the brain. Although breakthroughs have been made in reconstructing the mel spectrograms of audio stimuli perceived by subjects at the word or letter level using noninvasive electroencephalography (EEG), there is still a critical gap in precisely reconstructing continuous speech features, especially at the minute level. To address this issue, this paper proposes a State Space Model (SSM) to reconstruct the mel spectrogram of continuous speech from EEG, named SSM2Mel. This model introduces a novel Mamba module to effectively model the long sequence of EEG signals for imagined speech. In the SSM2Mel model, the S4-UNet structure is used to enhance the extraction of local features of EEG signals, and the Embedding Strength Modulator (ESM) module is used to incorporate subject-specific information. Experimental results show that our model achieves a Pearson correlation of 0.069 on the SparrKULee dataset, which is a 38% improvement over the previous baseline.</description>

      <title>Automated Detection of Epileptic Spikes and Seizures Incorporating a Novel Spatial Clustering Prior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10404v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A Magnetoencephalography (MEG) time-series recording consists of multi-channel signals collected by superconducting sensors, with each signal's intensity reflecting magnetic field changes over time at the sensor location. Automating epileptic MEG spike detection significantly reduces manual assessment time and effort, yielding substantial clinical benefits. Existing research addresses MEG spike detection by encoding neural network inputs with signals from all channel within a time segment, followed by classification. However, these methods overlook simultaneous spiking occurred from nearby sensors. We introduce a simple yet effective paradigm that first clusters MEG channels based on their sensor's spatial position. Next, a novel convolutional input module is designed to integrate the spatial clustering and temporal changes of the signals. This module is fed into a custom MEEG-ResNet3D developed by the authors, which learns to extract relevant features and classify the input as a spike clip or not. Our method achieves an F1 score of 94.73% on a large real-world MEG dataset Sanbo-CMR collected from two centers, outperforming state-of-the-art approaches by 1.85%. Moreover, it demonstrates efficacy and stability in the Electroencephalographic (EEG) seizure detection task, yielding an improved weighted F1 score of 1.4% compared to current state-of-the-art techniques evaluated on TUSZ, whch is the largest EEG seizure dataset.</description>

      <title>Stochastic resonance in Schmitt trigger and its application towards weak signal detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10405v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study explores stochastic resonance (SR) in a Schmitt trigger circuit and its application to weak signal detection. SR, a phenomenon where noise synchronizes with weak signals to enhance detectability, was demonstrated using a custom-designed bi-stable Schmitt trigger system. The circuit's bi-stability was validated through hysteresis curve analysis, confirming its suitability for SR studies. Experimental results revealed SR behavior by analyzing signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) responses to noise amplitude variations. Detection experiments were conducted to determine frequency and amplitude of damping sinusoidal pulses. Frequency detection proved effective, albeit with limitations at low frequencies, while amplitude detection faced challenges due to mathematical complexities. Nonetheless, the study highlights SR's potential for weak signal detection, with proposed enhancements to improve detection accuracy. This work underscores the adaptability of classical SR principles to practical detection systems and suggests future applications in advanced detection technologies, including quantum systems.</description>

      <title>RadDet: A Wideband Dataset for Real-Time Radar Spectrum Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Real-time detection of radar signals in a wideband radio frequency spectrum is a critical situational assessment function in electronic warfare. Compute-efficient detection models have shown great promise in recent years, providing an opportunity to tackle the spectrum detection problem. However, progress in radar spectrum detection is limited by the scarcity of publicly available wideband radar signal datasets accompanied by corresponding annotations. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel and challenging dataset for radar detection (RadDet), comprising a large corpus of radar signals occupying a wideband spectrum across diverse radar density environments and signal-to-noise ratios (SNR). RadDet contains 40,000 frames, each generated from 1 million in-phase and quadrature (I/Q) samples across a 500 MHz frequency band. RadDet includes 11 classes of radar samples across 6 different SNR settings, 2 radar density environments, and 3 different time-frequency resolutions, with corresponding time-frequency and class annotations. We evaluate the performance of various state-of-the-art real-time detection models on RadDet and a modified radar classification dataset from NIST (NIST-CBRS) to establish a novel benchmark for wideband radar spectrum detection.</description>

      <title>Perception-Guided EEG Analysis: A Deep Learning Approach Inspired by Level of Detail (LOD) Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10428v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Objective: This study explores a novel deep learning approach for EEG analysis and perceptual state guidance, inspired by Level of Detail (LOD) theory. The goal is to improve perceptual state identification accuracy and advance personalized psychological therapy. Methods: Portable EEG devices and music rhythm signals were used for data collection. LOD theory was applied to dynamically adjust EEG signal processing, extracting core perceptual features. A Unity-based software system integrated EEG data with audio materials. The deep learning model combined a CNN for feature extraction and classification, and a DQN for reinforcement learning to optimize rhythm adjustments. Results: The CNN achieved 94.05% accuracy in perceptual state classification. The DQN guided subjects to target states with a 92.45% success rate, averaging 13.2 rhythm cycles. However, only 50% of users reported psychological alignment with the target state, indicating room for improvement. Discussion: The results validate the potential of LOD-based EEG biofeedback. Limitations include dataset source, label subjectivity, and reward function optimization. Future work will expand to diverse subjects, incorporate varied musical elements, and refine reward functions for better generalization and personalization.</description>

      <title>Universal Discrete Filtering with Lookahead or Delay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the universal discrete filtering problem, where an input sequence generated by an unknown source passes through a discrete memoryless channel, and the goal is to estimate its components based on the output sequence with limited lookahead or delay. We propose and establish the universality of a family of schemes for this setting. These schemes are induced by universal Sequential Probability Assignments (SPAs), and inherit their computational properties. We show that the schemes induced by LZ78 are practically implementable and well-suited for scenarios with limited computational resources and latency constraints. In passing, we use some of the intermediate results to obtain upper and lower bounds that appear to be new, in the purely Bayesian setting, on the optimal filtering performance in terms, respectively, of the mutual information between the noise-free and noisy sequence, and the entropy of the noise-free sequence causally conditioned on the noisy one.</description>

      <title>Efficient Transmission of Radiomaps via Physics-Enhanced Semantic Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10654v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Enriching information of spectrum coverage, radiomap plays an important role in many wireless communication applications, such as resource allocation and network optimization. To enable real-time, distributed spectrum management, particularly in the scenarios with unstable and dynamic environments, the efficient transmission of spectrum coverage information for radiomaps from edge devices to the central server emerges as a critical problem. In this work, we propose an innovative physics-enhanced semantic communication framework tailored for efficient radiomap transmission based on generative learning models. Specifically, instead of bit-wise message passing, we only transmit the key "semantics" in radiomaps characterized by the radio propagation behavior and surrounding environments, where semantic compression schemes are utilized to reduce the communication overhead. Incorporating the novel concepts of Radio Depth Maps, the radiomaps are reconstructed from the delivered semantic information backboned on the conditional generative adversarial networks. Our framework is further extended to facilitate its implementation in the scenarios of multi-user edge computing, by integrating with federated learning for collaborative model training while preserving the data privacy. Experimental results show that our approach achieves high accuracy in radio coverage information recovery at ultra-high bandwidth efficiency, which has great potentials in many wireless-generated data transmission applications.</description>

      <title>Channel Estimation and Beamforming Design for MF-RIS-Aided Communication Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10657v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this letter, we study the beamforming design for channel estimation of multi-functional reconfigurable intelligent surface (MF-RIS)-aided multi-user communications that supports simultaneous signal reflection, refraction, and amplification. A least square (LS) based channel estimator is proposed for MF-RIS by considering both the coupled MF-RIS beams and the introduced thermal noise. With the discrete fourier transform (DFT)-matrix, the MF-RIS beamforming design problem is simplified under the proposed LS channel estimator. The optimal MF-RIS beamforming design that achieves the Cram\'er-Rao lower bound (CRLB) of channel estimator is obtained with the proposed alternating optimization algorithm. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed beamforming design in reducing the impact of thermal noise.</description>

      <title>Predictive Target-to-User Association in Complex Scenarios via Hybrid-Field ISAC Signaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10676v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel and robust target-to-user (T2U) association framework to support reliable vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) networks that potentially operate within the hybrid field (near-field and far-field). To address the challenges posed by complex vehicle maneuvers and user association ambiguity, an interacting multiple-model filtering scheme is developed, which combines coordinated turn and constant velocity models for predictive beamforming. Building upon this foundation, a lightweight association scheme leverages user-specific integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) signaling while employing probabilistic data association to manage clutter measurements in dense traffic. Numerical results validate that the proposed framework significantly outperforms conventional methods in terms of both tracking accuracy and association reliability.</description>

      <title>Low-Complexity Iterative Precoding Design for Near-field Multiuser Systems With Spatial Non-Stationarity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10689v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extremely large antenna arrays (ELAA) are regarded as a promising technology for supporting sixth-generation (6G) networks. However, the large number of antennas significantly increases the computational complexity in precoding design, even for linearly regularized zero-forcing (RZF) precoding. To address this issue, a series of low-complexity iterative precoding are investigated. The main idea of these methods is to avoid matrix inversion of RZF precoding. Specifically, RZF precoding is equivalent to a system of linear equations that can be solved by fast iterative algorithms, such as random Kaczmarz (RK) algorithm. Yet, the performance of RK-based precoding algorithm is limited by the energy distributions of multiple users, which restricts its application in ELAA-assisted systems. To accelerate the RK-based precoding, we introduce the greedy random Kaczmarz (GRK)-based precoding by using the greedy criterion-based selection strategy. To further reduce the complexity of the GRK-based precoding, we propose a visibility region (VR)-based orthogonal GRK (VR-OGRK) precoding that leverages near-field spatial non-stationarity, which is characterized by the concept of VR. Next, by utilizing the information from multiple hyperplanes in each iteration, we extend the GRK-based precoding to the aggregation hyperplane Kaczmarz (AHK)-based pecoding algorithm, which further enhances the convergence rate. Building upon the AHK algorithm, we propose a VR-based orthogonal AHK (VR-OAHK) precoding to further reduce the computational complexity. Furthermore, the proposed iterative precoding algorithms are proven to converge to RZF globally at an exponential rate. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithms achieve faster convergence and lower computational complexity than benchmark algorithms, and yield very similar performance to the RZF precoding.</description>

      <title>Learning to reconstruct signals with inexact sensing operator via knowledge distillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10794v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In computational optical imaging and wireless communications, signals are acquired through linear coded and noisy projections, which are recovered through computational algorithms. Deep model-based approaches, i.e., neural networks incorporating the sensing operators, are the state-of-the-art for signal recovery. However, these methods require exact knowledge of the sensing operator, which is often unavailable in practice, leading to performance degradation. Consequently, we propose a new recovery paradigm based on knowledge distillation. A teacher model, trained with full or almost exact knowledge of a synthetic sensing operator, guides a student model with an inexact real sensing operator. The teacher is interpreted as a relaxation of the student since it solves a problem with fewer constraints, which can guide the student to achieve higher performance. We demonstrate the improvement of signal reconstruction in computational optical imaging for single-pixel imaging with miscalibrated coded apertures systems and multiple-input multiple-output symbols detection with inexact channel matrix.</description>

      <title>Mathematical model of parameters relevance in adaptive level-crossing sampling for electrocardiogram signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Digital acquisition of bio-signals has been mostly dominated by uniform time sampling following the Nyquist theorem. However, in recent years, new approaches have emerged, focused on sampling a signal only when certain events happen. Currently, the most prominent of these approaches is Level Crossing (LC) sampling. Conventional level crossing analog-to-digital converters (LC-ADC) are often designed to make use of statically defined and uniformly spaced levels. However, a different positioning of the levels, optimized for bio-signals monitoring, can potentially lead to better performing solutions. In this work, we compare multiple LC-level definitions, including statically defined (uniform and logarithmic) configurations and optimization-driven designs (randomized and Bayesian optimization), assessing their ability to maintain signal fidelity while minimizing the sampling rate. In this paper, we analyze the performance of these different methodologies, which is evaluated using the root mean square error (RMSE), the sampling reduction factor (SRF) -- a metric evaluating the sampling compression ratio -- , and error per event metrics to gauge the trade-offs between signal fidelity and data compression. Our findings reveal that optimization-driven LC-sampling, particularly those using Bayesian methods, achieve a lower RMSE without substantially impacting the error per event compared to static configurations, but at the cost of an increase in the sampling rate.</description>

      <title>Generalized Spatial Modulation Aided Affine Frequency Division Multiplexing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10865v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generalized spatial modulation-aided affine frequency division multiplexing (GSM-AFDM) is conceived for reliable multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communications over doubly selective channels. We commence by proposing several low-complexity detectors for large-scale GSM-AFDM systems. Specifically, we introduce the linear minimum mean square error (LMMSE) equalizer-based maximum likelihood detector (LMMSE-MLD). By exploiting the GSM properties, we then derive the LMMSE-based transmit-antenna activation pattern (TAP) check-based log-likelihood ratio detector (LMMSE-TC-LLRD). In addition, we propose a pair of new detectors, namely the greedy residual check detector (GRCD) and the reduced space check detector (RSCD). We also derive a bit error rate (BER) upper-bound by considering the MLD. Our simulation results demonstrate that 1) the BER upper bound derived is tight for moderate to high signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs), 2) the proposed GSM-AFDM achieves lower BER than its conventional counterparts, and 3) the conceived detectors strike a compelling trade-off between the BER and complexity.</description>

      <title>A Novel Hybrid Precoder With Low-Resolution Phase Shifters and Fronthaul Capacity Limitation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10878v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In massive MIMO systems, fully digital precoding offers high performance but has significant implementation complexity and energy consumption, particularly at millimeter frequencies and beyond. Hybrid analog-digital architectures provide a practical alternative by reducing the number of radio frequency (RF) chains while retaining performance in spatially sparse multipath scenarios. However, most hybrid precoder designs assume ideal, infinite-resolution analog phase shifters, which are impractical in real-world scenarios. Another practical constraint is the limited fronthaul capacity between the baseband processor and array, implying that each entry of the digital precoder must be picked from a finite set of quantization labels. To minimize the sum rate degradation caused by quantized analog and digital precoders, we propose novel designs inspired by the sphere decoding (SD) algorithm. We demonstrate numerically that our proposed designs outperform traditional methods, ensuring minimal sum rate loss in hybrid precoding systems with low-resolution phase shifters and limited fronthaul capacity.</description>

      <title>Synesthesia of Machines (SoM)-Aided FDD Precoding with Sensing Heterogeneity: A Vertical Federated Learning Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10941v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High complexity in precoding design for frequency division duplex systems necessitates streamlined solutions. Guided by Synesthesia of Machines (SoM), this paper introduces a heterogeneous multi-vehicle, multi-modal sensing aided precoding scheme within a vertical federated learning (VFL) framework, which significantly minimizes pilot sequence length while optimizing the system's sum rate. We address the challenges posed by local data heterogeneity due to varying on-board sensor configurations through a meticulously designed VFL training procedure. To extract valuable channel features from multi-modal sensing, we employ three distinct data preprocessing methods that convert raw data into informative representations relevant for precoding. Additionally, we propose an online training strategy based on VFL framework, enabling the scheme to adapt dynamically to fluctuations in user numbers. Numerical results indicate that our approach, utilizing short pilot sequences, closely approximates the performance of traditional optimization methods with perfect channel state information.</description>

      <title>Ambient Backscatter Communication in LTE Uplink Sounding Reference Signal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10952v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ambient Internet of Things (AIoT), recently standardized by the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP), demands a low-power wide-area communication solution that operates several orders of magnitude below the power requirements of existing 3GPP specifications. Ambient backscatter communication (AmBC) is considered as a competitive potential technique by harvesting energy from the ambient RF signal. This paper considers a symbiotic AmBC into Long Term Evolution (LTE) cellular system uplink. Leveraging by LTE uplink channel estimation ability, AIoT conveys its own message to Base Station (BS) by modulating backscatter path. We explore the detector design, analyze the error performance of the proposed scheme, provide exact expression and its Guassian approximation for the error probability. We corroborate the receiver error performance by Monte Carlo simulation. Analysis of communication range reveals AmBC achieves a reasonable BER of order of magnitude $10^{-2}$ within four times wavelength reading distance. In addition, a AmBC prototype in LTE uplink confirms the its feasibility. The over-the-air experiment results validate theoretical analysis. Hence, the proposed AmBC approach enables AIoT deployment with minimal changes to the LTE system.</description>

      <title>Few-shot Human Motion Recognition through Multi-Aspect mmWave FMCW Radar Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11028v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radar human motion recognition methods based on deep learning models has been a heated spot of remote sensing in recent years, yet the existing methods are mostly radial-oriented. In practical application, the test data could be multi-aspect and the sample number of each motion could be very limited, causing model overfitting and reduced recognition accuracy. This paper proposed channel-DN4, a multi-aspect few-shot human motion recognition method. First, local descriptors are introduced for a precise classification metric. Moreover, episodic training strategy was adopted to reduce model overfitting. To utilize the invariant sematic information in multi-aspect conditions, we considered channel attention after the embedding network to obtain precise implicit high-dimensional representation of sematic information. We tested the performance of channel-DN4 and methods for comparison on measured mmWave FMCW radar data. The proposed channel-DN4 produced competitive and convincing results, reaching the highest 87.533% recognition accuracy in 3-way 10-shot condition while other methods suffer from overfitting.

      <title>Design and Prototyping of Filtering Active STAR-RIS with Adjustable Power Splitting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11062v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RISs) have emerged as a transformative technology for next-generation wireless communication systems, offering unprecedented control over electromagnetic wave propagation. In particular, Simultaneously Transmitting and Reflecting RISs (STAR-RISs) have garnered significant attention due to their full-space coverage. This paper presents an active STAR-RIS, which enables independent control of both transmission and reflection phases and features out-of-band harmonic suppression. Unlike the traditional passive RIS, the proposed design integrates active amplification to overcome the inherent passive losses, significantly enhancing signal strength and system performance. Additionally, the system supports dynamic power allocation between transmission and reflection modes, providing greater flexibility to meet diverse communication demands in complex propagation environments. The versatility of the design is further validated by extending the Radar Cross Section (RCS)-based path loss model to the STAR-RIS. This design improves efficiency, flexibility, and adaptability, offering a promising solution for future wireless communication systems, particularly in scenarios requiring simultaneous control of transmission and reflection signals.</description>

      <title>Channel Sounding Using Multiplicative Arrays Based on Successive Interference Cancellation Principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11093v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultra-massive multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO) systems have been seen as the key radio technology for the advancement of wireless communication systems, due to its capability to better utilize the spatial dimension of the propagation channels. Channel sounding is essential for developing accurate and realistic channel models for the massive MIMO systems. However, channel sounding with large-scale antenna systems has faced significant challenges in practice. The real antenna array based (RAA) sounder suffers from high complexity and cost, while virtual antenna array (VAA) solutions are known for its long measurement time. Notably, these issues will become more pronounced as the antenna array configuration gets larger for future radio systems. In this paper, we propose the concept of multiplicative array (MA) for channel sounding applications to achieve large antenna aperture size with reduced number of required antenna elements. The unique characteristics of the MA are exploited for wideband spatial channel sounding purposes, supported by both one-path and multi-path numerical simulations. To address the fake paths and distortion in the angle delay profile issues inherent for MA in multipath channel sounding, a novel channel parameter estimation algorithm for MA based on successive interference cancellation (SIC) principle is proposed. Both numerical simulations and experimental validation results are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed SIC algorithm for the MA. This research contributes significantly to the channel sounding and characterization of massive MIMO systems for future applications.</description>

      <title>Ultrasonic monitoring of carbonation in Portland cements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chemical reactions resulting from the ingress of carbonates into the cement matrix modify the properties of its pore solution, as well as its pore distribution and size. These changes lead to corrosion of the steel in reinforced concrete. The nature of conventional testing for the estimation of carbonation in cement-based materials is time-consuming and destructive. This paper presents a set of non-destructive ultrasound-based indexes, obtained solely from non-linear and linear analyses of ultrasonic signals, for measuring the carbonation of Portland cement pastes. Class 30RS cement pastes with three water/cement ratios by weight (0.4, 0.5, and 0.6) were considered. Carbonation was carried out for 120 days with a constant CO2 level of 4% by volume under controlled temperature and humidity, considering a unidirectional carbonation, parallel to the longitudinal axis of the samples. The level of carbonation was validated by FTIR measurements. From these analyses, different indexes with high correlation were obtained, estimated only from the ultrasonic signals and as a function of the days of exposure to carbonation, as well as of the percentage of carbonation. Further study is required for the evaluation of the reliability of these promising indexes for the determination of carbonation in cement-based materials.</description>

      <title>Optimum Power-Subcarrier Allocation and Time-Sharing in Multicarrier NOMA Uplink</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Currently used resource allocation methods for uplink multicarrier non-orthogonal multiple access (MC-NOMA) systems have multiple shortcomings. Current approaches either allocate the same power across all subcarriers to a user, or use heuristic-based near-far, strong channel-weak channel user grouping to assign the decoding order for successive interference cancellation (SIC). This paper proposes a novel optimal power-subcarrier allocation for uplink MC-NOMA. This new allocation achieves the optimal power-subcarrier allocation as well as the optimal SIC decoding order. Furthermore, the proposed method includes a time-sharing algorithm that dynamically alters the decoding orders of the participating users to achieve the required data rates, even in cases where any single decoding order fails to do so. Extensive experimental evaluations show that the new method achieves higher sum data rates and lower power consumption compared to current NOMA methods.</description>

      <title>Energy Consumption Reduction for UAV Trajectory Training : A Transfer Learning Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The advent of 6G technology demands flexible, scalable wireless architectures to support ultra-low latency, high connectivity, and high device density. The Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) framework, with its open interfaces and virtualized functions, provides a promising foundation for such architectures. However, traditional fixed base stations alone are not sufficient to fully capitalize on the benefits of O-RAN due to their limited flexibility in responding to dynamic network demands. The integration of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) as mobile RUs within the O-RAN architecture offers a solution by leveraging the flexibility of drones to dynamically extend coverage. However, UAV operating in diverse environments requires frequent retraining, leading to significant energy waste. We proposed transfer learning based on Dueling Double Deep Q network (DDQN) with multi-step learning, which significantly reduces the training time and energy consumption required for UAVs to adapt to new environments. We designed simulation environments and conducted ray tracing experiments using Wireless InSite with real-world map data. In the two simulated environments, training energy consumption was reduced by 30.52% and 58.51%, respectively. Furthermore, tests on real-world maps of Ottawa and Rosslyn showed energy reductions of 44.85% and 36.97%, respectively.</description>

      <title>The Expected Peak-to-Average Power Ratio of White Gaussian Noise in Sampled I/Q Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11261v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the fundamental endeavors in radio frequency (RF) metrology is to measure the power of signals, where a common aim is to estimate the peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR), which quantifies the ratio of the maximum (peak) to the mean value. For a finite number of discrete-time samples of baseband in-phase and quadrature (I/Q) white Gaussian noise (WGN) that are independent and identically distributed with zero mean, we derive a closed-form, exact formula for mean PAPR that is well-approximated by the natural logarithm of the number of samples plus Euler's constant. Additionally, we give related theoretical results for the mean crest factor. After comparing our main result to previously published approximate formulas, we examine how violations of the WGN assumptions in sampled I/Q data result in deviations from the expected value of PAPR. Finally, utilizing a measured RF I/Q acquisition, we illustrate how our formula for mean PAPR can be applied to spectral analysis with spectrograms to verify when measured RF emissions are WGN in a given frequency band.</description>

      <title>Optimum Power Allocation for Low Rank Wi-Fi Channels: A Comparison with Deep RL Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11266v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Upcoming Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR) systems require high data rates ($\geq$ 500 Mbps) and low power consumption for seamless experience. With an increasing number of subscribing users, the total number of antennas across all transmitting users far exceeds the number of antennas at the access point (AP). This results in a low rank wireless channel, presenting a bottleneck for uplink communication systems. The current uplink systems that use orthogonal multiple access (OMA) and the proposed non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA), fail to achieve the required data rates / power consumption under predominantly low rank channel scenarios. This paper introduces an optimal power sub carrier allocation algorithm for multi-carrier NOMA, named minPMAC, and an associated time-sharing algorithm that adaptively changes successive interference cancellation decoding orders to maximize sum data rates in these low rank channels. This Lagrangian based optimization technique, although globally optimum, is prohibitive in terms of runtime, proving inefficient for real-time scenarios. Hence, we propose a novel near-optimal deep reinforcement learning-based energy sum optimization (DRL-minPMAC) which achieves real-time efficiency. Extensive experimental evaluations show that minPMAC achieves 28\% and 39\% higher data rates than NOMA and OMA baselines. Furthermore, the proposed DRL-minPMAC runs ~5 times faster than minPMAC and achieves 83\% of the global optimum data rates in real time</description>

      <title>SIG-SDP: Sparse Interference Graph-Aided Semidefinite Programming for Large-Scale Wireless Time-Sensitive Networking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11307v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wireless time-sensitive networking (WTSN) is essential for Industrial Internet of Things. We address the problem of minimizing time slots needed for WTSN transmissions while ensuring reliability subject to interference constraints -- an NP-hard task. Existing semidefinite programming (SDP) methods can relax and solve the problem but suffer from high polynomial complexity. We propose a sparse interference graph-aided SDP (SIG-SDP) framework that exploits the interference's sparsity arising from attenuated signals between distant user pairs. First, the framework utilizes the sparsity to establish the upper and lower bounds of the minimum number of slots and uses binary search to locate the minimum within the bounds. Here, for each searched slot number, the framework optimizes a positive semidefinite (PSD) matrix indicating how likely user pairs share the same slot, and the constraint feasibility with the optimized PSD matrix further refines the slot search range. Second, the framework designs a matrix multiplicative weights (MMW) algorithm that accelerates the optimization, achieved by only sparsely adjusting interfering user pairs' elements in the PSD matrix while skipping the non-interfering pairs. We also design an online architecture to deploy the framework to adjust slot assignments based on real-time interference measurements. Simulations show that the SIG-SDP framework converges in near-linear complexity and is highly scalable to large networks. The framework minimizes the number of slots with up to 10 times faster computation and up to 100 times lower packet loss rates than compared methods. The online architecture demonstrates how the algorithm complexity impacts dynamic networks' performance.</description>

      <title>Practical Modulo Sampling: Mitigating High-Frequency Components</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11330v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recovering signals within limited dynamic range (DR) constraints remains a central challenge for analog-to-digital converters (ADCs). To prevent data loss, an ADCs DR typically must exceed that of the input signal. Modulo sampling has recently gained attention as a promising approach for addressing DR limitations across various signal classes. However, existing methods often rely on ideal ADCs capable of capturing the high frequencies introduced by the modulo operator, which is impractical in real-world hardware applications. This paper introduces an innovative hardware-based sampling approach that addresses these high-frequency components using an analog mixer followed by a Low-Pass Filter (LPF). This allows the use of realistic ADCs, which do not need to handle frequencies beyond the intended sampling rate. Our method eliminates the requirement for high-specification ADCs and demonstrates that the resulting samples are equivalent to those from an ideal high-spec ADC. Consequently, any existing modulo recovery algorithm can be applied effectively. We present a practical hardware prototype of this approach, validated through both simulations and hardware recovery experiments. Using a recovery method designed to handle quantization noise, we show that our approach effectively manages high-frequency artifacts, enabling reliable modulo recovery with realistic ADCs. These findings confirm that our hardware solution not only outperforms conventional methods in high-precision settings but also demonstrates significant real-world applicability.</description>

      <title>Sparse Incremental Aggregation in Satellite Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11385v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies Federated Learning (FL) in low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite constellations, where satellites are connected via intra-orbit inter-satellite links (ISLs) to their neighboring satellites. During the FL training process, satellites in each orbit forward gradients from nearby satellites, which are eventually transferred to the parameter server (PS). To enhance the efficiency of the FL training process, satellites apply in-network aggregation, referred to as incremental aggregation. In this work, the gradient sparsification methods from [1] are applied to satellite scenarios to improve bandwidth efficiency during incremental aggregation. The numerical results highlight an increase of over 4 x in bandwidth efficiency as the number of satellites in the orbital plane increases.</description>

Abstract: This paper presents a comparative analysis of long-term evolution advanced (LTE-A) and fifth-generation new radio (5G-NR), focusing on the effects of Transient Electromagnetic Interference (EMI) caused by catenary-pantograph contact in a railway environment. We developed a software-defined radio (SDR)-based prototype for the performance evaluation of LTE-A and 5G-NR links in the presence of transient interference. The results show that both links experience considerable degradation due to interference at different center frequencies. Performance degradation is proportional to the gain of interference. The measurement results show that both links experience considerable performance degradation in the presence of transient EM interference.</description>

      <title>Optimized Beamforming for Joint Bistatic Positioning and Monostatic Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the performance tradeoff between \textit{bistatic positioning (BP)} and \textit{monostatic sensing (MS)} in a multi-input multi-output orthogonal frequency division multiplexing scenario. We derive the Cram\'er-Rao bounds (CRBs) for BP at the user equipment and MS at the base station. To balance these objectives, we propose a multi-objective optimization framework that optimizes beamformers using a weighted-sum CRB approach, ensuring the weak Pareto boundary. We also introduce two mismatch-minimizing approaches, targeting beamformer mismatch and variance matrix mismatch, and solve them distinctly. Numerical results demonstrate the performance tradeoff between BP and MS, revealing significant gains with the proposed methods and highlighting the advantages of minimizing the weighted-sum mismatch of variance matrices.</description>

      <title>Integrate-and-Fire from a Mathematical and Signal Processing Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrate-and-Fire (IF) is an idealized model of the spike-triggering mechanism of a biological neuron. It is used to realize the bio-inspired event-based principle of information processing in neuromorphic computing. We show that IF is closely related to the concept of Send-on-Delta (SOD) as used in threshold-based sampling. It turns out that the IF model can be adjusted in a way that SOD can be understood as differential version of IF. As a result, we gain insight into the underlying metric structure based on the Alexiewicz norm with consequences for clarifying the underlying signal space including bounded integrable signals with superpositions of finitely many Dirac impulses, the identification of a maximum sparsity property, error bounds for signal reconstruction and a characterization in terms of sparse regularization.</description>

      <title>Efficient Multi-Source Localization in Near-Field Using only Angular Domain MUSIC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The localization of multiple signal sources using sensor arrays has been a long-standing research challenge. While numerous solutions have been developed, signal space methods like MUSIC and ESPRIT have gained widespread popularity. As sensor arrays grow in size, sources are frequently located in the near-field region. The standard MUSIC algorithm can be adapted to locate these sources by performing a 3D search over both the distance and the angles of arrival (AOA), including azimuth and elevation, though this comes with significant computational complexity. To address this, a modified version of MUSIC has been developed to decouple the AoA and distance, enabling sequential estimation of these parameters and reducing computational demands. However, this approach suffers from reduced accuracy. To maintain the accuracy of MUSIC while minimizing complexity, this paper proposes a novel method that exploits angular variation across the array aperture, eliminating the need for a grid search over distance. The proposed method divides the large aperture into smaller sections, with each focusing on estimating the angles of arrival. These angles are then triangulated to localize the sources in the near-field of the large aperture. Numerical simulations show that this approach not only surpasses the Modified MUSIC algorithm in terms of mean absolute error but also achieves accuracy comparable to standard MUSIC, all while greatly reducing computational complexity-370 times in our simulation scenario.</description>

      <title>Joint Optimization of Geometric and Probabilistic Constellation Shaping for OFDM-ISAC Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11583v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 6G communications systems are expected to integrate radar-like sensing capabilities enabling novel use cases. However, integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) introduces a trade-off between communications and sensing performance because the optimal constellations for each task differ. In this paper, we compare geometric, probabilistic and joint constellation shaping for orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM)-ISAC systems using an autoencoder (AE) framework. We first derive the constellation-dependent detection probability and propose a novel loss function to include the sensing performance in the AE framework. Our simulation results demonstrate that constellation shaping enables a dynamic trade-off between communications and sensing. Depending on whether sensing or communications performance is prioritized, geometric or probabilistic constellation shaping is preferred. Joint constellation shaping combines the advantages of geometric and probabilistic shaping, significantly outperforming legacy modulation formats.</description>

      <title>Integrated Long-range Sensing and Communications in Multi Target Scenarios using CP-OFDM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11591v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 6G communication systems promise to deliver sensing capabilities by utilizing the orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) communication signal for sensing. However, the cyclic prefix inherent in OFDM systems limits the sensing range, necessitating compensation techniques to detect small, distant targets like drones. In this paper, we show that state-of-the-art coherent compensation methods fail in scenarios involving multiple targets, resulting in an increased noise floor in the radar image. Our contributions include a novel multi target coherent compensation algorithm and a generalized signal-to-interference-and-noise ratio for multiple targets to evaluate the performance. Our algorithm achieves the same detection performance at long distances requiring only 3.6% of the radio resources compared to classical OFDM radar processing. This enables resource efficient sensing at long distances in multi target scenarios with legacy communications-only networks.</description>

      <title>Optimal User and Target Scheduling, User-Target Pairing, and Low-Resolution Phase-Only Beamforming for ISAC Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the joint user and target scheduling, user-target pairing, and low-resolution phase-only beamforming design for integrated sensing and communications (ISAC). Scheduling determines which users and targets are served, while pairing specifies which users and targets are grouped into pairs. Additionally, the beamformers are designed using few-bit constant-modulus phase shifts. This resource allocation problem is a nonconvex mixed-integer nonlinear program (MINLP) and challenging to solve. To address it, we propose an exact mixed-integer linear program (MILP) reformulation, which leads to a globally optimal solution. Our results demonstrate the superiority of an optimal joint design compared to heuristic stage-wise approaches, which are highly sensitive to scenario characteristics.</description>

      <title>Faster-Than-Nyquist Equalization with Convolutional Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Faster-than-Nyquist (FTN) signaling aims at improving the spectral efficiency of wireless communication systems by exceeding the boundaries set by the Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem. 50 years after its first introduction in the scientific literature, wireless communications have significantly changed, but spectral efficiency remains one of the key challenges. To adopt FTN signaling, inter-symbol interference (ISI) patterns need to be equalized at the receiver. Motivated by the pattern recognition capabilities of convolutional neural networks with skip connections, we propose such deep learning architecture for ISI equalization and symbol demodulation in FTN receivers. We investigate the performance of the proposed model considering quadrature phase shift keying modulation and low density parity check coding, and compare it to a set of benchmarks, including frequency-domain equalization, a quadratic-programming-based receiver, and an equalization scheme based on a deep neural network. We show that our receiver outperforms any benchmark, achieving error rates comparable to those in additive white Gaussian noise channel, and higher effective throughput, thanks to the increased spectral efficiency of FTN signaling. With a compression factor of 60% and code rate 3/4, the proposed model achieves a peak effective throughput of 2.5 Mbps at just 10dB of energy per bit over noise power spectral density ratio, with other receivers being limited by error floors due to the strong inter-symbol interference. To promote reproducibility in deep learning for wireless communications, our code is open source at the repository provided in the references.</description>

      <title>CDMA/OTFS Sensing Outperforms Pure OTFS at the Same Communication Throughput</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11646v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There is a dearth of publications on the subject of spreading-aided Orthogonal Time Frequency Space (OTFS) solutions, especially for Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC), even though Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) assisted multi-user OTFS (CDMA/OTFS) exhibits tangible benefits. Hence, this work characterises both the communication Bit Error Rate (BER) and sensing Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) performance of CDMA/OTFS, and contrasts them to pure OTFS. Three CDMA/OTFS configurations are considered: Delay Code Division Multiple Access OTFS (Dl-CDMA/OTFS), Doppler Code Division Multiple Access OTFS (Dp-CDMA/OTFS), and Delay Doppler Code Division Multiple Access OTFS (DD-CDMA/OTFS), which harness direct sequence spreading along the delay axis, Doppler axis, and DD domains respectively. For each configuration, the performance of Gold, Hadamard, and Zadoff-Chu sequences is investigated. The results demonstrate that Zadoff-Chu Dl-CDMA/OTFS and DD-CDMA/OTFS consistently outperform pure OTFS sensing, whilst maintaining a similar communication performance at the same throughput. The extra modulation complexity of CDMA/OTFS is similar to that of other OTFS multi-user methodologies, but the demodulation complexity of CDMA/OTFS is lower than that of some other OTFS multi-user methodologies. CDMA/OTFS sensing can also consistently outperform OTFS sensing whilst not requiring any additional complexity for target parameter estimation. Therefore, CDMA/OTFS is an appealing candidate for implementing multi-user OTFS ISAC.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11687v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel approach to enhance the performance of UAV-enabled integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems. By integrating uniform planar arrays (UPAs) and modeling the UAV as a rigid body using $SE(3)$, the study addresses key challenges in existing ISAC frameworks, such as rigid-body dynamics and trajectory design. We propose a target tracking scheme based on extended Kalman filtering (EKF) in $SE(3)$ and trajectory optimization from a control signal design perspective, leveraging the conditional Posterior Cramer-Rao bound (CPCRB) to optimize performance. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in improving target tracking and trajectory optimization for a UAV-enabled MIMO-OFDM ISAC system.</description>

      <title>Estimating Rural Path Loss with ITU-R P.1812-7 : Impact of Geospatial Inputs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11708v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate radio wave propagation modeling is essential for effective spectrum management by regulators and network deployment by operators. This paper investigates the ITU-R P.1812-7 (P.1812) propagation model's reliance on geospatial inputs, particularly clutter information, to improve path loss estimation, with an emphasis on rural geographic regions. The research evaluates the impact of geospatial elevation and land cover datasets, including Global Forest Canopy Height (GFCH), European Space Agency WorldCover, and Natural Resources Canada LandCover, on P.1812 propagation model prediction accuracy. Results highlight the trade-offs between dataset resolution, geospatial data availability, and representative clutter height assignments. Simulations reveal that high-resolution data do not always yield better results and that global datasets such as the GFCH provide a robust alternative when high-resolution data are unavailable or out-of-date. This study provides a set of guidelines for geospatial dataset integration to enhance P.1812's rural path loss predictions.</description>

      <title>Efficient Bearing Sensor Data Compression via an Asymmetrical Autoencoder with a Lifting Wavelet Transform Layer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11737v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bearing data compression is vital to manage the large volumes of data generated during condition monitoring. In this paper, a novel asymmetrical autoencoder with a lifting wavelet transform (LWT) layer is developed to compress bearing sensor data. The encoder part of the network consists of a convolutional layer followed by a wavelet filterbank layer. Specifically, a dual-channel convolutional block with diverse convolutional kernel sizes and varying processing depths is integrated into the wavelet filterbank layer to enable comprehensive feature extraction from the wavelet domain. Additionally, the adaptive hard-thresholding nonlinearity is applied to remove redundant components while denoising the primary wavelet coefficients. On the decoder side, inverse LWT, along with multiple linear layers and activation functions, is employed to reconstruct the original signals. Furthermore, to enhance compression efficiency, a sparsity constraint is introduced during training to impose sparsity on the latent representations. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves superior data compression performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>Generative AI-enabled Blockage Prediction for Robust Dual-Band mmWave Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11763v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In mmWave wireless networks, signal blockages present a significant challenge due to the susceptibility to environmental moving obstructions. Recently, the availability of visual data has been leveraged to enhance blockage prediction accuracy in mmWave networks. In this work, we propose a Vision Transformer (ViT)-based approach for visual-aided blockage prediction that intelligently switches between mmWave and Sub-6 GHz frequencies to maximize network throughput and maintain reliable connectivity. Given the computational demands of processing visual data, we implement our solution within a hierarchical fog-cloud computing architecture, where fog nodes collaborate with cloud servers to efficiently manage computational tasks. This structure incorporates a generative AI-based compression technique that significantly reduces the volume of visual data transmitted between fog nodes and cloud centers. Our proposed method is tested with the real-world DeepSense 6G dataset, and according to the simulation results, it achieves a blockage prediction accuracy of 92.78% while reducing bandwidth usage by 70.31%.</description>

      <title>Keypoint Detection Empowered Near-Field User Localization and Channel Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11844v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the near-field region of an extremely large-scale multiple-input multiple-output (XL MIMO) system, channel reconstruction is typically addressed through sparse parameter estimation based on compressed sensing (CS) algorithms after converting the received pilot signals into the transformed domain. However, the exhaustive search on the codebook in CS algorithms consumes significant computational resources and running time, particularly when a large number of antennas are equipped at the base station (BS). To overcome this challenge, we propose a novel scheme to replace the high-cost exhaustive search procedure. We visualize the sparse channel matrix in the transformed domain as a channel image and design the channel keypoint detection network (CKNet) to locate the user and scatterers in high speed. Subsequently, we use a small-scale newtonized orthogonal matching pursuit (NOMP) based refiner to further enhance the precision. Our method is applicable to both the Cartesian domain and the Polar domain. Additionally, to deal with scenarios with a flexible number of propagation paths, we further design FlexibleCKNet to predict both locations and confidence scores. Our experimental results validate that the CKNet and FlexibleCKNet-empowered channel reconstruction scheme can significantly reduce the computational complexity while maintaining high accuracy in both user and scatterer localization and channel reconstruction tasks.</description>

      <title>Wideband Pulse Generation for Underwater Applications Using Parametric Array</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11974v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigated wideband pulse generation for underwater acoustic applications using a parametric array. We fabricated a transducer consisting of a 3 mm thick 75 mm-by-75 mm square-shaped PZT ceramic plate, which is matched to water media at the radiating face and terminated by a very low impedance at the back. All measurements were made in a large test tank. We transmitted square-root amplitude modulated pulses centered around 855 kHz primary frequency. We showed that phase-sensitive generation of in-phase and out-of-phase bursts suitable for coded transmission using a parametric array is possible. We generated very short duration bursts, as short as half-cycle, at a 10-80 kHz difference frequency range. The definition of the bursts is excellent, e.g., with a normalized cross-correlation of 0.92 with an ideal 2-cycle square burst, for both in-phase and out-of-phase pulses.</description>

      <title>A note on the sample complexity of multi-target detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11980v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work studies the sample complexity of the multi-target detection (MTD) problem, which involves recovering a signal from a noisy measurement containing multiple instances of a target signal in unknown locations, each transformed by a random group element. This problem is primarily motivated by single-particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM), a groundbreaking technology for determining the structures of biological molecules. We establish upper and lower bounds for various MTD models in the high-noise regime as a function of the group, the distribution over the group, and the arrangement of signal occurrences within the measurement. The lower bounds are established through a reduction to the related multi-reference alignment problem, while the upper bounds are derived from explicit recovery algorithms utilizing autocorrelation analysis. These findings provide fundamental insights into estimation limits in noisy environments and lay the groundwork for extending this analysis to more complex applications, such as cryo-EM.</description>

Abstract: We propose a generalization of the iterative closest point (ICP) algorithm for point set registration, in which the registration functions are non-rigid and follow the large deformation diffeomorphic metric mapping (LDDMM) framework. The algorithm is formulated as a well-posed probabilistic inference, and requires to solve a novel variation of LDDMM landmark registration with an additional term involving the Jacobian of the mapping. The algorithm can easily be generalized to construct a diffeomorphic, statistical atlas of multiple point sets. The method is successfully validated on a first set of synthetic data.</description>

      <title>Data-Aided Regularization of Direct-Estimate Combiner in Distributed MIMO Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12092v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores the data-aided regularization of the direct-estimate combiner in the uplink of a distributed multiple-input multiple-output system. The network-wide combiner can be computed directly from the pilot signal received at each access point, eliminating the need for explicit channel estimation. However, the sample covariance matrix of the received pilot signal that is used in its computation may significantly deviate from the actual covariance matrix when the number of pilot symbols is limited. To address this, we apply a regularization to the sample covariance matrix using a shrinkage coefficient based on the received data signal. Initially, the shrinkage coefficient is determined by minimizing the difference between the sample covariance matrices obtained from the received pilot and data signals. Given the limitations of this approach in interference-limited scenarios, the shrinkage coefficient is iteratively optimized using the sample mean squared error of the hard-decision symbols, which is more closely related to the actual system's performance, e.g., the symbol error rate (SER). Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed regularization of the direct-estimate combiner significantly enhances the SER, particularly when the number of pilot symbols is limited.</description>

      <title>A Comprehensive Metric for Resilience Evaluation of Power Distribution Systems under Cyber Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12094v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Power distribution systems (PDS) serve as the backbone of our modern society, ensuring electricity reaches homes, businesses, and critical infrastructure. However, the increasing digitization and interconnectivity of these systems have exposed them to cyber threats. This study presents a comprehensive approach to evaluate and enhance the resilience of PDS under cyber attacks using the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) and complex network parameters. By systematically assessing vulnerabilities and computing resilience once critical CVSS thresholds are reached, this work identifies key resilience metrics including the critical loads service requirements. The proposed methodology improves system resilience through strategic tie-line switching, which is validated on the modified IEEE 33-bus system. Four case studies are conducted, illustrating the performance of the proposed methodology under various cyber attack scenarios. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach in quantifying and enhancing resilience, offering a valuable tool for PDS operators to mitigate risks and ensure continuous service delivery to critical loads during the exploitation of cyber threats.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning Based Probe Skew Correction for High-frequency BH Loop Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Experimental characterization of magnetic components has grown to be increasingly important to understand and model their behaviours in high-frequency PWM converters. The BH loop measurement is the only available approach to separate the core loss as an electrical method, which, however, is suspective to the probe phase skew. As an alternative to the regular de-skew approaches based on hardware, this work proposes a novel machine-learning-based method to identify and correct the probe skew, which builds on the newly discovered correlation between the skew and the shape/trajectory of the measured BH loop. A special technique is proposed to artificially generate the skewed images from measured waveforms as augmented training sets. A machine learning pipeline is developed with the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to treat the problem as an image-based prediction task. The trained model has demonstrated a high accuracy in identifying the skew value from a BH loop unseen by the model, which enables the compensation of the skew to yield the corrected core loss value and BH loop.</description>

      <title>Heuristic Deep Reinforcement Learning for Phase Shift Optimization in RIS-assisted Secure Satellite Communication Systems with RSMA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel heuristic deep reinforcement learning (HDRL) framework designed to optimize reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) phase shifts in secure satellite communication systems utilizing rate splitting multiple access (RSMA). The proposed HDRL approach addresses the challenges of large action spaces inherent in deep reinforcement learning by integrating heuristic algorithms, thus improving exploration efficiency and leading to faster convergence toward optimal solutions. We validate the effectiveness of HDRL through comprehensive simulations, demonstrating its superiority over traditional algorithms, including random phase shift, greedy algorithm, exhaustive search, and Deep Q-Network (DQN), in terms of secure sum rate and computational efficiency. Additionally, we compare the performance of RSMA with non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA), highlighting that RSMA, particularly when implemented with an increased number of RIS elements, significantly enhances secure communication performance. The results indicate that HDRL is a powerful tool for improving the security and reliability of RSMA satellite communication systems, offering a practical balance between performance and computational demands.</description>

      <title>Sum Rate Enhancement using Machine Learning for Semi-Self Sensing Hybrid RIS-Enabled ISAC in THz Bands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel semi-self sensing hybrid reconfigurable intelligent surface (SS-HRIS) in terahertz (THz) bands, where the RIS is equipped with reflecting elements divided between passive and active elements in addition to sensing elements. SS-HRIS along with integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) can help to mitigate the multipath attenuation that is abundant in THz bands. In our proposed scheme, sensors are configured at the SS-HRIS to receive the radar echo signal from a target. A joint base station (BS) beamforming and HRIS precoding matrix optimization problem is proposed to maximize the sum rate of communication users while maintaining satisfactory sensing performance measured by the Cramer-Rao bound (CRB) for estimating the direction of angles of arrival (AoA) of the echo signal and thermal noise at the target. The CRB expression is first derived and the sum rate maximization problem is formulated subject to communication and sensing performance constraints. To solve the complex non-convex optimization problem, deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG)-based deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm is proposed, where the reward function, the action space and the state space are modeled. Simulation results show that the proposed DDPG-based DRL algorithm converges well and achieves better performance than several baselines, such as the soft actor-critic (SAC), proximal policy optimization (PPO), greedy algorithm and random BS beamforming and HRIS precoding matrix schemes. Moreover, it demonstrates that adopting HRIS significantly enhances the achievable sum rate compared to passive RIS and random BS beamforming and HRIS precoding matrix schemes.</description>

      <title>Logarithmic Positional Partition Interval Encoding</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.11236v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One requirement of maintaining digital information is storage. With the latest advances in the digital world, new emerging media types have required even more storage space to be kept than before. In fact, in many cases it is required to have larger amounts of storage to keep up with protocols that support more types of information at the same time. In contrast, compression algorithms have been integrated to facilitate the transfer of larger data. Numerical representations are construed as embodiments of information. However, this correct association of a sequence could feasibly be inverted to signify an elongated series of numerals. In this work, a novel mathematical paradigm was introduced to engineer a methodology reliant on iterative logarithmic transformations, finely tuned to numeric sequences. Through this fledgling approach, an intricate interplay of polymorphic numeric manipulations was conducted. By applying repeated logarithmic operations, the data were condensed into a minuscule representation. Approximately thirteen times surpassed the compression method, ZIP. Such extreme compaction, achieved through iterative reduction of expansive integers until they manifested as single-digit entities, conferred a novel sense of informational embodiment. Instead of relegating data to classical discrete encodings, this method transformed them into a quasi-continuous, logarithmically. By contrast, this introduced approach revealed that morphing data into deeply compressed numerical substrata beyond conventional boundaries was feasible. A holistic perspective emerges, validating that numeric data can be recalibrated into ephemeral sequences of logarithmic impressions. It was not merely a matter of reducing digits, but of reinterpreting data through a resolute numeric vantage.</description>

      <title>Energy-Constrained Information Storage on Memristive Devices in the Presence of Resistive Drift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10376v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we examine the problem of information storage on memristors affected by resistive drift noise under energy constraints. We introduce a novel, fundamental trade-off between the information lifetime of memristive states and the energy that must be expended to bring the device into a particular state. We then treat the storage problem as one of communication over a noisy, energy-constrained channel, and propose a joint source-channel coding (JSCC) approach to storing images in an analogue fashion. To design an encoding scheme for natural images and to model the memristive channel, we make use of data-driven techniques from the field of deep learning for communications, namely deep joint source-channel coding (DeepJSCC), employing a generative model of resistive drift as a computationally tractable differentiable channel model for end-to-end optimisation. We introduce a modified version of generalised divisive normalisation (GDN), a biologically inspired form of normalisation, that we call conditional GDN (cGDN), allowing for conditioning on continuous channel characteristics, including the initial resistive state and the delay between storage and reading. Our results show that the delay-conditioned network is able to learn an energy-aware coding scheme that achieves a higher and more balanced reconstruction quality across a range of storage delays.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.10393v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the advancement of quantum computing technologies, recent years have seen increasing efforts to identify cryptographic methods resistant to quantum attacks and to establish post-quantum cryptography (PQC) approaches. Among these, hash-based digital signature algorithms (DSAs) are a notable category of PQC. Hash functions are not only utilized in digital signatures but are also widely applied in pseudorandom number generators (PRNGs). Building on the foundation of hash-based DSAs, this study proposes a modified approach that introduces a DSA based on PRNGs, suitable for one-time signature (OTS) applications. The study explores the security of the proposed PRNG-based OTS algorithm and validates its feasibility through experiments comparing various parameter configurations. These experiments examine key length, signature length, key generation time, signature generation time, and signature verification time under different parameter settings.</description>

      <title>DFingerNet: Noise-Adaptive Speech Enhancement for Hearing Aids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10525v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The \textbf{DeepFilterNet} (\textbf{DFN}) architecture was recently proposed as a deep learning model suited for hearing aid devices. Despite its competitive performance on numerous benchmarks, it still follows a `one-size-fits-all' approach, which aims to train a single, monolithic architecture that generalises across different noises and environments. However, its limited size and computation budget can hamper its generalisability. Recent work has shown that in-context adaptation can improve performance by conditioning the denoising process on additional information extracted from background recordings to mitigate this. These recordings can be offloaded outside the hearing aid, thus improving performance while adding minimal computational overhead. We introduce these principles to the \textbf{DFN} model, thus proposing the \textbf{DFingerNet} (\textbf{DFiN}) model, which shows superior performance on various benchmarks inspired by the DNS Challenge.</description>

      <title>Prompt-Enabled Large AI Models for CSI Feedback</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.10629v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a promising tool for channel state information (CSI) feedback. While recent research primarily focuses on improving feedback accuracy through novel architectures, the underlying mechanisms of AI-based CSI feedback remain unclear. This study investigates these mechanisms by analyzing performance across diverse datasets and reveals that superior feedback performance stems from the strong fitting capabilities of AI models and their ability to leverage environmental knowledge. Building on these findings, we propose a prompt-enabled large AI model (LAM) for CSI feedback. The LAM employs powerful transformer blocks and is trained on extensive datasets from various scenarios. To further enhance reconstruction quality, the channel distribution -- represented as the mean of channel magnitude in the angular domain -- is incorporated as a prompt within the decoder. Simulation results confirm that the proposed prompt-enabled LAM significantly improves feedback accuracy and generalization performance while reducing data collection requirements in new scenarios.</description>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success across a wide range of tasks, particularly in natural language processing and computer vision. This success naturally raises an intriguing yet unexplored question: Can LLMs be harnessed to tackle channel state information (CSI) compression and feedback in massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems? Efficient CSI feedback is a critical challenge in next-generation wireless communication. In this paper, we pioneer the use of LLMs for CSI compression, introducing a novel framework that leverages the powerful denoising capabilities of LLMs -- capable of error correction in language tasks -- to enhance CSI reconstruction performance. To effectively adapt LLMs to CSI data, we design customized pre-processing, embedding, and post-processing modules tailored to the unique characteristics of wireless signals. Extensive numerical results demonstrate the promising potential of LLMs in CSI feedback, opening up possibilities for this research direction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.10670v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the problem of computing capacity-cost (C-C) functions for continuous channels. Motivated by the Kullback-Leibler divergence (KLD) proximal reformulation of the classical Blahut-Arimoto (BA) algorithm, the Wasserstein distance is introduced to the proximal term for the continuous case, resulting in an iterative algorithm related to the Wasserstein gradient descent. Practical implementation involves moving particles along the negative gradient direction of the objective function's first variation in the Wasserstein space and approximating integrals by the importance sampling (IS) technique. Such formulation is also applied to the rate-distortion (R-D) function for continuous source spaces and thus provides a unified computation framework for both problems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.10694v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates an innovative movable antenna (MA)-enhanced multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system designed to enhance communication performance. We aim to maximize the energy efficiency (EE) under statistical channel state information (S-CSI) through a joint optimization of the transmit covariance matrix and the antenna position vectors (APVs). To solve the stochastic problem, we consider the large number of antennas scenario and resort to deterministic equivalent (DE) technology to reformulate the system EE w.r.t. the transmit variables, i.e., the transmit covariance matrix and APV, and the receive variables, i.e., the receive APV, respectively. Then, we propose an alternative optimization (AO) algorithm to update the transmit variables and the receive variables to maximize the system EE, respectively. Our numerical results reveal that, the proposed MA-enhanced system can significantly improve EE compared to several benchmark schemes and the optimal performance can be achieved with a finite size of movement regions for MAs.</description>

Abstract: In this letter, we investigate a dynamic reconfigurable distributed antenna and reflection surface (RDARS)-driven secure communication system, where the working mode of the RDARS can be flexibly configured. We aim to maximize the secrecy rate by jointly designing the active beamforming vectors, reflection coefficients, and the channel-aware mode selection matrix. To address the non-convex binary and cardinality constraints introduced by dynamic mode selection, we propose an efficient alternating optimization (AO) framework that employs penalty-based fractional programming (FP) and successive convex approximation (SCA) transformations. Simulation results demonstrate the potential of RDARS in enhancing the secrecy rate and show its superiority compared to existing reflection surface-based schemes.</description>

Abstract: Flexible-antenna systems, such as fluid antennas and movable antennas, have been recognized as key enabling technologies for sixth-generation (6G) wireless networks, as they can intelligently reconfigure the effective channel gains of the users and hence significantly improve their data transmission capabilities. However, existing flexible-antenna systems have been designed to combat small-scale fading in non-line-of-sight (NLoS) conditions. As a result, they lack the ability to establish line-of-sight links, which are typically 100 times stronger than NLoS links. In addition, existing flexible-antenna systems have limited flexibility, where adding/removing an antenna is not straightforward. This article introduces an innovative flexible-antenna system called pinching antennas, which are realized by applying small dielectric particles to waveguides. We first describe the basics of pinching-antenna systems and their ability to provide strong LoS links by deploying pinching antennas close to the users as well as their capability to scale up/down the antenna system. We then focus on communication scenarios with different numbers of waveguides and pinching antennas, where innovative approaches to implement multiple-input multiple-output and non-orthogonal multiple access are discussed. In addition, promising 6G-related applications of pinching antennas, including integrated sensing and communication and next-generation multiple access, are presented. Finally, important directions for future research, such as waveguide deployment and channel estimation, are highlighted.</description>

      <title>A Novel Precoder for Peak-to-Average Power Ratio Reduction in OTFS Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10791v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the issue of high peak-to-average-power ratio (PAPR) of Orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) modulated signals. This paper proposes a low-complexity novel iterative PAPR reduction method which achieves a PAPR reduction of roughly 5 dB when compared to a OTFS modulated signal without any PAPR compensation. Simulations reveal that the PAPR achieved by the proposed method is significantly better than that achieved by other state-of-art methods. Simulations also reveal that the error rate performance of OTFS based systems with the proposed PAPR reduction is similar to that achieved with the other state-of-art methods.</description>

      <title>Achievable DoF Bounds for Cache-Aided Asymmetric MIMO Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10854v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Integrating coded caching (CC) into multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communications can significantly enhance the achievable degrees of freedom (DoF) in wireless networks. This paper investigates a practical cache-aided asymmetric MIMO configuration with cache ratio $\gamma$, where a server equipped with $L$ transmit antennas communicates with $K$ users, each having $G_k$ receive antennas. We propose three content-aware MIMO-CC strategies: the \emph{min-G} scheme, which treats the system as symmetric by assuming all users have the same number of antennas, equal to the smallest among them; the \emph{Grouping} scheme, which maximizes spatial multiplexing gain separately within each user subset at the cost of some global caching gain; and the \emph{Phantom} scheme, which dynamically redistributes spatial resources using virtual or "phantom" antenna users, bridging the performance gains of the min-G and Grouping schemes. These strategies jointly optimize the number of users, $\Omega$, and the parallel streams decoded by each user, $\beta_k$, ensuring linear decodability for all target users. Analytical and numerical results confirm that the proposed schemes achieve significant DoF improvements across various system configurations, demonstrating the potential of content-aware MIMO-CC strategies for enhancing wireless network performance.</description>

      <title>RIS Deployment Optimization with Iterative Detection and Decoding in Multiuser Multiple-Antenna Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10875v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work investigates a Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS)-assisted uplink system employing iterative detection and decoding (IDD) techniques. We analyze the impact of tuning system parameter tuning for several deployment configurations, including the number of users, access point (AP) antennas, and RIS elements on the IDD performance. Analytical results for both active and passive RIS in a single-input single-output (SISO) scenario demonstrate how deployment choices affect system performance. Numerical simulations confirm the robustness of the RIS-assisted IDD system to variations in these parameters, showing performance gains in certain configurations. Moreover, the findings indicate that the insights derived from SISO analysis extend to multiuser MIMO IDD systems.</description>

      <title>OpenEarthMap-SAR: A Benchmark Synthetic Aperture Radar Dataset for Global High-Resolution Land Cover Mapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10891v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-resolution land cover mapping plays a crucial role in addressing a wide range of global challenges, including urban planning, environmental monitoring, disaster response, and sustainable development. However, creating accurate, large-scale land cover datasets remains a significant challenge due to the inherent complexities of geospatial data, such as diverse terrain, varying sensor modalities, and atmospheric conditions. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery, with its ability to penetrate clouds and capture data in all-weather, day-and-night conditions, offers unique advantages for land cover mapping. Despite these strengths, the lack of benchmark datasets tailored for SAR imagery has limited the development of robust models specifically designed for this data modality. To bridge this gap and facilitate advancements in SAR-based geospatial analysis, we introduce OpenEarthMap-SAR, a benchmark SAR dataset, for global high-resolution land cover mapping. OpenEarthMap-SAR consists of 1.5 million segments of 5033 aerial and satellite images with the size of 1024$\times$1024 pixels, covering 35 regions from Japan, France, and the USA, with partially manually annotated and fully pseudo 8-class land cover labels at a ground sampling distance of 0.15--0.5 m. We evaluated the performance of state-of-the-art methods for semantic segmentation and present challenging problem settings suitable for further technical development. The dataset also serves the official dataset for IEEE GRSS Data Fusion Contest Track I. The dataset has been made publicly available at https://zenodo.org/records/14622048.</description>

      <title>Federated Deep Reinforcement Learning for Energy Efficient Multi-Functional RIS-Assisted Low-Earth Orbit Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11079v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, a novel network architecture that deploys the multi-functional reconfigurable intelligent surface (MF-RIS) in low-Earth orbit (LEO) is proposed. Unlike traditional RIS with only signal reflection capability, the MF-RIS can reflect, refract, and amplify signals, as well as harvest energy from wireless signals. Given the high energy demands in shadow regions where solar energy is unavailable, MF-RIS is deployed in LEO to enhance signal coverage and improve energy efficiency (EE). To address this, we formulate a long-term EE optimization problem by determining the optimal parameters for MF-RIS configurations, including amplification and phase-shifts, energy harvesting ratios, and LEO transmit beamforming. To address the complex non-convex and non-linear problem, a federated learning enhanced multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient (FEMAD) scheme is designed. Multi-agent DDPG of each agent can provide the optimal action policy from its interaction to environments, whereas federated learning enables the hidden information exchange among multi-agents. In numerical results, we can observe significant EE improvements compared to the other benchmarks, including centralized deep reinforcement learning as well as distributed multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG). Additionally, the proposed LEO-MF-RIS architecture has demonstrated its effectiveness, achieving the highest EE performance compared to the scenarios of fixed/no energy harvesting in MF-RIS, traditional reflection-only RIS, and deployment without RISs/MF-RISs.</description>

      <title>DeepEyeNet: Adaptive Genetic Bayesian Algorithm Based Hybrid ConvNeXtTiny Framework For Multi-Feature Glaucoma Eye Diagnosis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11168v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Glaucoma is a leading cause of irreversible blindness worldwide, emphasizing the critical need for early detection and intervention. In this paper, we present DeepEyeNet, a novel and comprehensive framework for automated glaucoma detection using retinal fundus images. Our approach integrates advanced image standardization through dynamic thresholding, precise optic disc and cup segmentation via a U-Net model, and comprehensive feature extraction encompassing anatomical and texture-based features. We employ a customized ConvNeXtTiny based Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) classifier, optimized using our Adaptive Genetic Bayesian Optimization (AGBO) algorithm. This proposed AGBO algorithm balances exploration and exploitation in hyperparameter tuning, leading to significant performance improvements. Experimental results on the EyePACS-AIROGS-light-V2 dataset demonstrate that DeepEyeNet achieves a high classification accuracy of 95.84%, which was possible due to the effective optimization provided by the novel AGBO algorithm, outperforming existing methods. The integration of sophisticated image processing techniques, deep learning, and optimized hyperparameter tuning through our proposed AGBO algorithm positions DeepEyeNet as a promising tool for early glaucoma detection in clinical settings.</description>

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive system model for goodput maximization with quantized feedback in Ultra-Reliable Low-Latency Communication (URLLC), focusing on dynamic channel conditions and feedback schemes. The study investigates a communication system, where the receiver provides quantized channel state information to the transmitter. The system adapts its feedback scheme based on reinforcement learning, aiming to maximize goodput while accommodating varying channel statistics. We introduce a novel Rician-$K$ factor estimation technique to enable the communication system to optimize the feedback scheme. This dynamic approach increases the overall performance, making it well-suited for practical URLLC applications where channel statistics vary over time.</description>

      <title>Successive Interference Cancellation-aided Diffusion Models for Joint Channel Estimation and Data Detection in Low Rank Channel Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11229v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel joint channel-estimation and source-detection algorithm using successive interference cancellation (SIC)-aided generative score-based diffusion models. Prior work in this area focuses on massive MIMO scenarios, which are typically characterized by full-rank channels, and fail in low-rank channel scenarios. The proposed algorithm outperforms existing methods in joint source-channel estimation, especially in low-rank scenarios where the number of users exceeds the number of antennas at the access point (AP). The proposed score-based iterative diffusion process estimates the gradient of the prior distribution on partial channels, and recursively updates the estimated channel parts as well as the source. Extensive simulation results show that the proposed method outperforms the baseline methods in terms of normalized mean squared error (NMSE) and symbol error rate (SER) in both full-rank and low-rank channel scenarios, while having a more dominant effect in the latter, at various signal-to-noise ratios (SNR).</description>

      <title>Physics-Informed Machine Learning for Efficient Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11323v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) is a two-dimensional periodic structure integrated with a large number of reflective elements, which can manipulate electromagnetic waves in a digital way, offering great potentials for wireless communication and radar detection applications. However, conventional RIS designs highly rely on extensive full-wave EM simulations that are extremely time-consuming. To address this challenge, we propose a machine-learning-assisted approach for efficient RIS design. An accurate and fast model to predict the reflection coefficient of RIS element is developed by combining a multi-layer perceptron neural network (MLP) and a dual-port network, which can significantly reduce tedious EM simulations in the network training. A RIS has been practically designed based on the proposed method. To verify the proposed method, the RIS has also been fabricated and measured. The experimental results are in good agreement with the simulation results, which validates the efficacy of the proposed method in RIS design.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, an automatic labelling process is presented for automotive datasets, leveraging on complementary information from LiDAR and camera. The generated labels are then used as ground truth with the corresponding 4D radar data as inputs to a proposed semantic segmentation network, to associate a class label to each spatial voxel. Promising results are shown by applying both approaches to the publicly shared RaDelft dataset, with the proposed network achieving over 65% of the LiDAR detection performance, improving 13.2% in vehicle detection probability, and reducing 0.54 m in terms of Chamfer distance, compared to variants inspired from the literature.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised Learning in Echo State Networks for Input Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11409v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conventional echo state networks (ESNs) require supervised learning to train the readout layer, using the desired outputs as training data. In this study, we focus on input reconstruction (IR), which refers to training the readout layer to reproduce the input time series in its output. We reformulate the learning algorithm of the ESN readout layer to perform IR using unsupervised learning (UL). By conducting theoretical analysis and numerical experiments, we demonstrate that IR in ESNs can be effectively implemented under realistic conditions without explicitly using the desired outputs as training data; in this way, UL is enabled. Furthermore, we demonstrate that applications relying on IR, such as dynamical system replication and noise filtering, can be reformulated within the UL framework. Our findings establish a theoretically sound and universally applicable IR formulation, along with its related tasks in ESNs. This work paves the way for novel predictions and highlights unresolved theoretical challenges in ESNs, particularly in the context of time-series processing methods and computational models of the brain.</description>

      <title>Orbit-Aware Split Learning: Optimizing LEO Satellite Networks for Distributed Online Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11410v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel split learning architecture designed to exploit the cyclical movement of Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites in non-terrestrial networks (NTNs). Although existing research focuses on offloading tasks to the NTN infrastructure, these approaches overlook the dynamic movement patterns of LEO satellites that can be used to efficiently distribute the learning task. In this work, we analyze how LEO satellites, from the perspective of ground terminals, can participate in a time-window-based model training. By splitting the model between a LEO and a ground terminal, the computational burden on the satellite segment is reduced, while each LEO satellite offloads the partially trained model to the next satellite in the constellation. This cyclical training process allows larger and more energy-intensive models to be deployed and trained across multiple LEO satellites, despite their limited energy resources. We formulate an optimization problem that manages radio and processing resources, ensuring the entire data is processed during each satellite pass while minimizing the energy consumption. Our results demonstrate that this approach offers a more scalable and energy-efficient way to train complex models, enhancing the capabilities of LEO satellite constellations in the context of Artificial Intelligence-driven applications.</description>

      <title>Harnessing Rydberg Atomic Receivers: From Quantum Physics to Wireless Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11842v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The intrinsic integration of Rydberg atomic receivers into wireless communication systems is proposed, by harnessing the principles of quantum physics in wireless communications. More particularly, we conceive a pair of Rydberg atomic receivers, one incorporates a local oscillator (LO), referred to as an LO-dressed receiver, while the other operates without an LO and is termed an LO-free receiver. The appropriate wireless model is developed for each configuration, elaborating on the receiver's responses to the radio frequency (RF) signal, on the potential noise sources, and on the system performance. Next, we investigate the association distortion effects that might occur, specifically demonstrating the boundaries of linear dynamic regions, which provides critical insights into its practical implementations in wireless systems. Extensive simulation results are provided for characterizing the performance of wireless systems, harnessing this pair of Rydberg atomic receivers. Our results demonstrate that they deliver complementary benefits: LO-free systems excel in proximity operations, while LO-dressed systems are eminently suitable for long-distance sensing at extremely low power levels. More specifically, LO-dressed systems achieve a significant signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) gain of approximately 44 dB over conventional RF receivers, exhibiting an effective coverage range extension over conventional RF receivers by a factor of 150. Furthermore, LO-dressed systems support higher-order quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) at reduced symbol error rates (SER) compared to conventional RF receivers, hence significantly enhancing wireless communication performance.</description>

      <title>Phase Transitions in Phase-Only Compressed Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11905v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The goal of phase-only compressed sensing is to recover a structured signal $\mathbf{x}$ from the phases $\mathbf{z} = {\rm sign}(\mathbf{\Phi}\mathbf{x})$ under some complex-valued sensing matrix $\mathbf{\Phi}$. Exact reconstruction of the signal's direction is possible: we can reformulate it as a linear compressed sensing problem and use basis pursuit (i.e., constrained norm minimization). For $\mathbf{\Phi}$ with i.i.d. complex-valued Gaussian entries, this paper shows that the phase transition is approximately located at the statistical dimension of the descent cone of a signal-dependent norm. Leveraging this insight, we derive asymptotically precise formulas for the phase transition locations in phase-only sensing of both sparse signals and low-rank matrices. Our results prove that the minimum number of measurements required for exact recovery is smaller for phase-only measurements than for traditional linear compressed sensing. For instance, in recovering a 1-sparse signal with sufficiently large dimension, phase-only compressed sensing requires approximately 68% of the measurements needed for linear compressed sensing. This result disproves earlier conjecture suggesting that the two phase transitions coincide. Our proof hinges on the Gaussian min-max theorem and the key observation that, up to a signal-dependent orthogonal transformation, the sensing matrix in the reformulated problem behaves as a nearly Gaussian matrix.</description>

      <title>Goal-oriented Transmission Scheduling: Structure-guided DRL with a Unified Dual On-policy and Off-policy Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11921v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Goal-oriented communications prioritize application-driven objectives over data accuracy, enabling intelligent next-generation wireless systems. Efficient scheduling in multi-device, multi-channel systems poses significant challenges due to high-dimensional state and action spaces. We address these challenges by deriving key structural properties of the optimal solution to the goal-oriented scheduling problem, incorporating Age of Information (AoI) and channel states. Specifically, we establish the monotonicity of the optimal state value function (a measure of long-term system performance) w.r.t. channel states and prove its asymptotic convexity w.r.t. AoI states. Additionally, we derive the monotonicity of the optimal policy w.r.t. channel states, advancing the theoretical framework for optimal scheduling. Leveraging these insights, we propose the structure-guided unified dual on-off policy DRL (SUDO-DRL), a hybrid algorithm that combines the stability of on-policy training with the sample efficiency of off-policy methods. Through a novel structural property evaluation framework, SUDO-DRL enables effective and scalable training, addressing the complexities of large-scale systems. Numerical results show SUDO-DRL improves system performance by up to 45% and reduces convergence time by 40% compared to state-of-the-art methods. It also effectively handles scheduling in much larger systems, where off-policy DRL fails and on-policy benchmarks exhibit significant performance loss, demonstrating its scalability and efficacy in goal-oriented communications.</description>

      <title>Multi-Modal Variable-Rate CSI Reconstruction for FDD Massive MIMO Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11926v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In frequency division duplex (FDD) systems, acquiring channel state information (CSI) at the base station (BS) traditionally relies on limited feedback from mobile terminals (MTs). However, the accuracy of channel reconstruction from feedback CSI is inherently constrained by the rate-distortion trade-off. To overcome this limitation, we propose a multi-modal channel reconstruction framework that leverages auxiliary data, such as RGB images or uplink CSI, collected at the BS. By integrating contextual information from these modalities, the framework mitigates CSI distortions caused by noise, compression, and quantization. At its core, the framework utilizes an autoencoder network capable of generating variable-length CSI, tailored for rate-adaptive multi-modal channel reconstruction. By augmenting the foundational autoencoder network using a transfer learning-based multi-modal fusion strategy, we enable accurate channel reconstruction in both single-modal and multi-modal scenarios. To train and evaluate the network under diverse and realistic wireless conditions, we construct a synthetic dataset that pairs wireless channel data with sensor data through 3D modeling and ray tracing. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves near-optimal beamforming gains in 5G New Radio (5G NR)-compliant scenarios, highlighting the potential of sensor data integration to improve CSI reconstruction accuracy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.12113v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Normals with unknown parameters (NUP) can be used to convert nontrivial model-based estimation problems into iterations of linear least-squares or Gaussian estimation problems. In this paper, we extend this approach by augmenting factor graphs with convex-dual variables and pertinent NUP representations. In particular, in a state space setting, we propose a new iterative forward-backward algorithm that is dual to a recently proposed backward-forward algorithm.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2106.02352v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The global effort toward renewable energy and the electrification of energy-intensive sectors have significantly increased the demand for electricity, making energy efficiency a critical focus. Non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM) enables detailed analyses of household electricity usage by disaggregating the total power consumption into individual appliance-level data. In this paper, we propose COLD (Concurrent Loads Disaggregator), a transformer-based model specifically designed to address the challenges of disaggregating high-frequency data with multiple simultaneously working devices. COLD supports up to 42 devices and accurately handles scenarios with up to 11 concurrent loads, achieving 95% load identification accuracy and 82% disaggregation performance on the test data. In addition, we introduce a new fully labeled high-frequency NILM dataset for load disaggregation derived from the UK-DALE 16 kHz dataset. Finally, we analyze the decline in NILM model performance as the number of concurrent loads increases.</description>

      <title>An RRAM-Based Implementation of a Template Matching Circuit for Low-Power Analogue Classification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.02651v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances in machine learning and neuro-inspired systems enabled the increased interest in efficient pattern recognition at the edge. A wide variety of applications, such as near-sensor classification, require fast and low-power approaches for pattern matching through the use of associative memories and their more well-known implementation, Content Addressable Memories (CAMs). Towards addressing the need for low-power classification, this work showcases an RRAM-based analogue CAM (ACAM) intended for template matching applications, providing a low-power reconfigurable classification engine for the extreme edge. The circuit uses a low component count at 6T2R2M, comparable with the most compact existing cells of this type. In this work, we demonstrate a hardware prototype, built with commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) components for the MOSFET-based circuits, that implements rows of 6T2R2M employing TiOx-based RRAM devices developed in-house, showcasing competitive matching window configurability and definition. Furthermore, through simulations, we validate the performance of the proposed circuit by using a commercially available 180nm technology and in-house RRAM data-driven model to assess the energy dissipation, exhibiting 60 pJ per classification event.</description>

      <title>Beyond Diagonal Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces in Wideband OFDM Communications: Circuit-Based Modeling and Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07297v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work investigates the modeling and optimization of beyond diagonal reconfigurable intelligent surface (BD-RIS), which generalizes conventional RIS with diagonal phase shift matrices and provides additional flexibility for manipulating wireless channels, in wideband communication systems. Specifically, we start from the signal modeling of the BD-RIS-aided orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) system, which bridges the time-domain and frequency-domain channels, and explicitly shows the frequency dependence of the BD-RIS response. We next characterize the frequency dependence of the BD-RIS response based on circuit models. Benefiting from the admittance parameter analysis, we model individually each tunable admittance component of BD-RIS and derive an approximated linear expression with respect to the frequency of the transmit signals. With the proposed signal model for the BD-RIS-aided OFDM system and the frequency-dependent BD-RIS model, we propose algorithms to optimize the BD-RIS and the power allocation at the transmitter to maximize the average rate for a BD-RIS-aided OFDM system. Finally, simulation results show that BD-RIS outperforms conventional RIS in the OFDM system. More importantly, the impact of wideband modeling of BD-RIS on the system performance becomes more significant as the circuit complexity of BD-RIS architectures increases.</description>

      <title>Stationary and Sparse Denoising Approach for Corticomuscular Causality Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16692v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Objective: Cortico-muscular communication patterns are instrumental in understanding movement control. Estimating significant causal relationships between motor cortex electroencephalogram (EEG) and surface electromyogram (sEMG) from concurrently active muscles presents a formidable challenge since the relevant processes underlying muscle control are typically weak in comparison to measurement noise and background activities. Methodology: In this paper, a novel framework is proposed to simultaneously estimate the order of the autoregressive model of cortico-muscular interactions along with the parameters while enforcing stationarity condition in a convex program to ensure global optimality. The proposed method is further extended to a non-convex program to account for the presence of measurement noise in the recorded signals by introducing a wavelet sparsity assumption on the excitation noise in the model. Results: The proposed methodology is validated using both simulated data and neurophysiological signals. In case of simulated data, the performance of the proposed methods has been compared with the benchmark approaches in terms of order identification, computational efficiency, and goodness of fit in relation to various noise levels. In case of physiological signals our proposed methods are compared against the state-of-the-art approaches in terms of the ability to detect Granger causality. Significance: The proposed methods are shown to be effective in handling stationarity and measurement noise assumptions, revealing significant causal interactions from brain to muscles and vice versa.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16901v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we address the challenge of reconstructing the complete 12-lead ECG signal from its incomplete parts. We focus on two main scenarios: (i) reconstructing missing signal segments within an ECG lead and (ii) recovering entire leads from signal in another unique lead. Two emerging clinical applications emphasize the relevance of our work. The first is the increasing need to digitize paper-stored ECGs for utilization in AI-based applications, often limited to digital 12 lead 10s ECGs. The second is the widespread use of wearable devices that record ECGs but typically capture only one or a few leads. In both cases, a non-negligible amount of information is lost or not recorded. Our approach aims to recover this missing signal. We propose ECGrecover, a U-Net neural network model trained on a novel composite objective function to address the reconstruction problem. This function incorporates both spatial and temporal features of the ECG by combining the distance in amplitude and sycnhronization through time between the reconstructed and the real digital signals. We used real-life ECG datasets and through comprehensive assessments compared ECGrecover with three state-of-the-art methods based on generative adversarial networks (EKGAN, Pix2Pix) as well as the CopyPaste strategy. The results demonstrated that ECGrecover consistently outperformed state-of-the-art methods in standard distortion metrics as well as in preserving critical ECG characteristics, particularly the P, QRS, and T wave coordinates.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Receiver Design for Massive MIMO-OFDM with Low-Resolution ADCs and Oversampling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04408v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Low-resolution analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) and hybrid beamforming have emerged as efficient solutions to reduce power consumption with satisfactory spectral efficiency (SE) in massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. In this paper, we investigate the performance of a hybrid receiver in massive MIMO orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) uplink systems with low-resolution ADCs and oversampling. Considering both the temporal and spatial correlation of the quantization distortion (QD), we derive a closed-form approximation of the frequency-domain QD covariance matrix, which facilitates the evaluation of the system's SE. Then we jointly design the analog and digital combiners of the hybrid receiver to maximize the SE. The formulated problem is challenging due to the constant-modulus constraint of the analog combiner and its coupling with the digital one. To overcome these challenges, we transform the objective function into an equivalent but more tractable form and then iteratively update the analog and digital combiners. Numerical simulations verify the superiority of the proposed algorithm over the considered benchmarks and show the resilience of the hybrid receiver to beam squint with low-resolution ADCs. Furthermore, the proposed hybrid receiver design with oversampling can achieve significantly higher energy efficiency compared with the fully digital one.</description>

      <title>Rydberg Atomic Quantum Receivers for Classical Wireless Communication and Sensing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.14501v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Rydberg atomic quantum receivers (RAQR) are emerging quantum precision sensing platforms designed for receiving radio frequency (RF) signals. It relies on creation of Rydberg atoms from normal atoms by exciting one or more electrons to a very high energy level, thereby making the atom sensitive to RF signals. RAQRs realize RF-to-optical conversions based on light-atom interactions relying on the so called electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) and Aulter-Townes splitting (ATS), so that the desired RF signal can be read out optically. The large dipole moments of Rydberg atoms associated with rich choices of Rydberg states and various modulation schemes facilitate an ultra-high sensitivity ($\sim$ nV/cm/$\sqrt{\text{Hz}}$) and an ultra-broadband tunability (direct-current to Terahertz). RAQRs also exhibit compelling scalability and lend themselves to the construction of innovative, compact receivers. Initial experimental studies have demonstrated their capabilities in classical wireless communications and sensing. To fully harness their potential in a wide variety of applications, we commence by outlining the underlying fundamentals of Rydberg atoms, followed by the principles and schemes of RAQRs. Then, we overview the state-of-the-art studies from both physics and communication societies. Furthermore, we conceive Rydberg atomic quantum single-input single-output (RAQ-SISO) and multiple-input multiple-output (RAQ-MIMO) schemes for facilitating the integration of RAQRs with classical wireless systems. Finally, we conclude with a set of potent research directions.</description>

      <title>Location and Map-Assisted Wideband Phase and Time Calibration Between Distributed Antennas</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23120v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Distributed massive multiple-input multiple-output networks utilize a large number of distributed access points (APs) to serve multiple user equipments (UEs), offering significant potential for both communication and localization. However, these networks require frequent phase and time calibration between distributed antennas due to oscillator phase drifts, crucial for reciprocity-based coherent beamforming and accurate localization. While this calibration is typically performed through bi-directional measurements between antennas, it can be simplified to unidirectional measurement under perfect knowledge of antenna locations. This paper extends a recent phase calibration narrowband line-of-sight (LoS) model to a phase and time calibration wideband orthogonal frequency division multiplexing model, including both LoS and reflection paths and allowing for joint phase and time calibrations. We explore different scenarios, considering whether or not prior knowledge of antenna locations and the map is available. For each case, we introduce a practical maximum likelihood estimator and conduct Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) analyses to benchmark performance. Simulations validate our estimators against the CRLB in these scenarios.</description>

      <title>Clutter-Aware Target Detection for ISAC in a Millimeter-Wave Cell-Free Massive MIMO System</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08759v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the performance of an integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system within a cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system. Each access point (AP) operates in the millimeter-wave (mmWave) frequency band. The APs jointly serve the user equipments (UEs) in the downlink while simultaneously detecting a target through dedicated sensing beams, which are directed toward a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS). Although the AP-RIS, RIS-target, and AP-target channels have both line-of-sight (LoS) and non-line-of-sight (NLoS) parts, it is assumed only knowledge of the LoS paths is available. A key contribution of this study is the consideration of clutter, which degrades the target detection if not handled. We propose an algorithm to alternatively optimize the transmit power allocation and the RIS phase-shift matrix, maximizing the target signal-to-clutter-plus-noise ratio (SCNR) while ensuring a minimum signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) for the UEs. Numerical results demonstrate that exploiting clutter subspace significantly enhances detection probability, particularly at high clutter-to-noise ratios, and reveal that an increased number of transmit side clusters impair detection performance. Finally, we highlight the performance gains achieved using a dedicated sensing stream.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Detection of On-Orbit Jamming for Securing GEO Satellite Links</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16588v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces a scenario where a maneuverable satellite in geostationary orbit (GEO) conducts on-orbit attacks, targeting communication between a GEO satellite and a ground station, with the ability to switch between stationary and time-variant jamming modes. We propose a machine learning-based detection approach, employing the random forest algorithm with principal component analysis (PCA) to enhance detection accuracy in the stationary model. At the same time, an adaptive threshold-based technique is implemented for the time-variant model to detect dynamic jamming events effectively. Our methodology emphasizes the need for the use of orbital dynamics in integrating physical constraints from satellite dynamics to improve model robustness and detection accuracy. Simulation results highlight the effectiveness of PCA in enhancing the performance of the stationary model, while the adaptive thresholding method achieves high accuracy in detecting jamming in the time-variant scenario.

      <title>Performance of Near-Field XL-MIMO Systems with Sparse UPAs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09234v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates a downlink near-field extremely large-scale multiple-input multiple-output (XL-MIMO) communication system with sparse uniform planar arrays (UPAs). Based on the Green's function-based channel model, the paper focuses on the power distribution of the arrived signal near the focused point of the transmit sparse UPA. In the vicinity of the focused point, along the x-axis and z-axis directions, closed-form expressions for the power distributions are derived. Based on that, expressions for the width and length of the main lobe are obtained in closed form, both of which decrease as the antenna spacing increases. Furthermore, the paper introduces a crucial constraint on system parameters, under which effective degrees-of-freedom (EDoF) of XL-MIMO systems with sparse UPAs can be precisely estimated. Then, the paper proposes an algorithm to obtain a closed-form expression, which can estimate EDoF with high accuracy and low computational complexity. The numerical results verifies the correctness of the main results of this paper. Furthermore, the numerical results reveals the improvement in the performance of XL-MIMO systems with the use of sparse UPAs.</description>

      <title>A Novel Modulation Scheme Based on the Kramers--Kronig Relations for Optical IM/DD Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09992v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The ever-growing demand for higher data rates in optical communication systems necessitates the development of advanced modulation formats capable of significantly enhancing system performance. In this work, we propose a novel modulation format derived from the Kramers--Kronig relations. This scheme effectively reduces the complexity of digital filtering and alleviates the demands on the digital-to-analog converter, offering a practical solution for high speed optical communication. The proposed modulation format was rigorously validated through experimental investigations using an optical wireless link. The results demonstrate a notable improvement in bit error rate (BER) performance and receiver sensitivity compared to PAM-4 and CAP-16 modulation schemes, with enhancements of 0.6 dB and 1.5 dB in receiver sensitivity, respectively. These improvements enable higher data transmission rates, positioning the Kramers--Kronig relations-based modulation format as a promising alternative to existing modulation techniques. Its potential to enhance the efficiency and capacity of optical communication systems is clearly evident. Future work will focus on extending its application to more complex scenarios, such as high-speed underwater optical communication systems, where advanced modulation formats are critical for overcoming bandwidth limitations.</description>

      <title>SimPSI: A Simple Strategy to Preserve Spectral Information in Time Series Data Augmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.05790v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Data augmentation is a crucial component in training neural networks to overcome the limitation imposed by data size, and several techniques have been studied for time series. Although these techniques are effective in certain tasks, they have yet to be generalized to time series benchmarks. We find that current data augmentation techniques ruin the core information contained within the frequency domain. To address this issue, we propose a simple strategy to preserve spectral information (SimPSI) in time series data augmentation. SimPSI preserves the spectral information by mixing the original and augmented input spectrum weighted by a preservation map, which indicates the importance score of each frequency. Specifically, our experimental contributions are to build three distinct preservation maps: magnitude spectrum, saliency map, and spectrum-preservative map. We apply SimPSI to various time series data augmentations and evaluate its effectiveness across a wide range of time series benchmarks. Our experimental results support that SimPSI considerably enhances the performance of time series data augmentations by preserving core spectral information.

      <title>The Blind Normalized Stein Variational Gradient Descent-Based Detection for Intelligent Random Access in Cellular IoT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18846v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The lack of an efficient preamble detection algorithm remains a challenge for solving preamble collision problems in intelligent random access (RA) in the cellular Internet of Things (IoT). To address this problem, we present an early preamble detection scheme based on a maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) model at the first step of the grant-based RA procedure. A novel blind normalized Stein variational gradient descent (SVGD)-based detector is proposed to obtain an approximate solution to the MLE model. First, by exploring the relationship between the Hadamard transform and wavelet packet transform, a new modified Hadamard transform (MHT) is developed to separate high-frequency components from signals using the second-order derivative filter. Next, to eliminate noise and mitigate the vanishing gradients problem in the SVGD-based detectors, the block MHT layer is designed based on the MHT, scaling layer, soft-thresholding layer, inverse MHT and sparsity penalty. Then, the blind normalized SVGD algorithm is derived to perform preamble detection without prior knowledge of noise power and the number of active IoT devices. The experimental results show the proposed block MHT layer outperforms other transform-based methods in terms of computation costs and denoising performance. Furthermore, with the assistance of the block MHT layer, the proposed blind normalized SVGD algorithm achieves a higher preamble detection accuracy and throughput than other state-of-the-art detection methods.</description>

      <title>Elements Allocation for Joint Active and Passive IRS Aided Wireless Communications: A Rate-Maximization Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06880v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Unlike previous works that focused solely on passive intelligent reflecting surface (PIRS) or active IRS (AIRS), a novel joint AIRS and PIRS architecture has been developed to flexibly utilize their combined advantages in mitigating multiplicative path loss cost-effectively. In this paper, we consider the AIRS-PIRS jointly aided wireless point-to-point communication system with two different deployment schemes in three-dimensional (3D) space. To balance the trade-off between the square-order beamforming gain of PIRS and the unique power amplification gain of AIRS, we optimize the elements allocation and beamforming design of the two IRSs under various practical constraints from a rate-maximization perspective. Moreover, we derive a series of element-related closed-form analytical expressions and compare the performance of the two schemes. Our analysis shows that in both schemes, PIRS should be allocated more elements than AIRS, and the received signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) increases asymptotically with the cube of the number of reflecting elements, when the distance between AIRS and PIRS is sufficiently large. Last, simulation results validate our analysis and indicate that both schemes can achieve superior rate performance over various benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Frame Codes for the Block-Erasure Channel -- Extended Version</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01172v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Analog codes add redundancy by expanding the dimension using real/complex-valued operations. Frame theory provides a mathematical basis for constructing such codes, with diverse applications in non-orthogonal code-division multiple access (NOMA-CDMA), distributed computation, multiple description source coding, space-time coding (STC), and more. The channel model corresponding to these applications is a combination of noise and erasures. Recent analyses showed a useful connection between spectral random-matrix theory and large equiangular tight frames (ETFs) under random uniform erasures. In this work we generalize this model to a channel where the erasures come in blocks. This particularly fits NOMA-CDMA with multiple transmit antennas for each user and STC with known spatial grouping. We present a method to adjust ETF codes to suit block erasures, and find minimum intra-block-correlation frames which outperform ETFs in this setting.</description>

      <title>Robust Fixed-Filter Sound Zone Control with Audio-Based Position Tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07935v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Performance of sound zone control (SZC) systems deployed in practical scenarios are highly sensitive to the location of the listener(s) and can degrade significantly when listener(s) are moving. This paper presents a robust SZC system that adapts to dynamic changes such as moving listeners and varying zone locations using a dictionary-based approach. The proposed system continuously monitors the environment and updates the fixed control filters by tracking the listener position using audio signals only. To test the effectiveness of the proposed SZC method, simulation studies are carried out using practically measured impulse responses. These studies show that SZC, when incorporated with the proposed audio-only position tracking scheme, achieves optimal performance when all listener positions are available in the dictionary. Moreover, even when not all listener positions are included in the dictionary, the method still provides good performance improvement compared to a traditional fixed filter SZC scheme.</description>

      <title>Goal-Oriented Status Updating for Real-time Remote Inference over Networks with Two-Way~Delay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08706v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a setting where an intelligent model (e.g., a pre-trained neural network) predicts the real-time value of a target signal using data samples transmitted from a remote source according to a scheduling policy. The scheduler decides on i) the age of the samples to be sent, ii) when to send them, and iii) the length of each packet (i.e., the number of samples contained in each packet). The dependence of inference quality on the Age of Information (AoI) for a given packet length is modeled by a general relationship. Previous work assumed i.i.d. transmission delays with immediate feedback or were restricted to the case where inference performance degrades as the input data ages. Our formulation, in addition to capturing non-monotone age dependence, also covers Markovian delay on both forward and feedback links. We model this as an infinite-horizon average-cost Semi-Markov Decision Process. We obtain a closed-form solution that decides on (i) and (ii) for any constant packet length. The solution for when to send is an index-based threshold policy, where the index function is expressed in terms of the delay state and AoI at the receiver. The age of the packet selected is a function of the delay state. We separately optimize the value of the constant length. We also develop an index-based threshold policy for the variable length case, which allows a complexity reduction. In simulation results, we observe that our goal-oriented scheduler drops inference error down to one sixth with respect to age-based scheduling of unit-length packets.</description>

      <title>Structured Tensor Decomposition Based Channel Estimation and Double Refinements for Active RIS Empowered Broadband Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16420v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Channel parameter recovery is critical for the next-generation reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-empowered communications and sensing. Tensor-based mechanisms are particularly effective, inherently capturing the multi-dimensional nature of wireless channels. However, existing studies assume either a line-of-sight (LOS) scenario or a blocked TX-RX channel. This paper solves a novel problem: tensor-based channel parameter estimation for active RIS-aided multiple-antenna broadband connections in fully multipath environments with the TX-RX link. System settings are customized to construct a fifth-order canonical polyadic (CP) signal tensor that matches the five-dimensional channel. Four tensor factors contain redundant columns, rendering the classical Kruskal's condition for decomposition uniqueness unsatisfied. The fifth-order Vandermonde structured CP decomposition (VSCPD) is developed to address this challenge, making the tensor factorization problem solvable using only linear algebra and offering a relaxed general uniqueness condition. With VSCPD as a perfect decoupling scheme, a sequential triple-stage channel estimation algorithm is proposed based on one-dimensional parameter estimation. The first stage enables multipath identification and algebraic coarse estimation. The following two stages offer optional successive refinements at the cost of increased complexity. The closed-form Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) is derived to assess the estimation performance. Herein, the noise covariance matrix depends on multipath parameters in our active-RIS scenario. Numerical results are provided to verify the effectiveness of proposed algorithms under various evaluation metrics. Our results also show that active RIS can significantly improve channel estimation performance compared to passive RIS.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.03162v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Decentralized learning strategies allow a collection of agents to learn efficiently from local data sets without the need for central aggregation or orchestration. Current decentralized learning paradigms typically rely on an averaging mechanism to encourage agreement in the parameter space. We argue that in the context of deep neural networks, which are often over-parameterized, encouraging consensus of the neural network outputs, as opposed to their parameters can be more appropriate. This motivates the development of a new decentralized learning algorithm, termed DRT diffusion, based on deep relative trust (DRT), a recently introduced similarity measure for neural networks. We provide convergence analysis for the proposed strategy, and numerically establish its benefit to generalization, especially with sparse topologies, in an image classification task.</description>

      <title>Distilling Calibration via Conformalized Credal Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06066v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deploying artificial intelligence (AI) models on edge devices involves a delicate balance between meeting stringent complexity constraints, such as limited memory and energy resources, and ensuring reliable performance in sensitive decision-making tasks. One way to enhance reliability is through uncertainty quantification via Bayesian inference. This approach, however, typically necessitates maintaining and running multiple models in an ensemble, which may exceed the computational limits of edge devices. This paper introduces a low-complexity methodology to address this challenge by distilling calibration information from a more complex model. In an offline phase, predictive probabilities generated by a high-complexity cloud-based model are leveraged to determine a threshold based on the typical divergence between the cloud and edge models. At run time, this threshold is used to construct credal sets -- ranges of predictive probabilities that are guaranteed, with a user-selected confidence level, to include the predictions of the cloud model. The credal sets are obtained through thresholding of a divergence measure in the simplex of predictive probabilities. Experiments on visual and language tasks demonstrate that the proposed approach, termed Conformalized Distillation for Credal Inference (CD-CI), significantly improves calibration performance compared to low-complexity Bayesian methods, such as Laplace approximation, making it a practical and efficient solution for edge AI deployments.</description>

      <title>Intra-day Solar and Power Forecast for Optimization of Intraday Market Participation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.09551v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The prediction of solar irradiance enhances reliability in photovoltaic (PV) solar plant generation and grid integration. In Colombia, PV plants face penalties if energy production deviates beyond governmental thresholds from intraday market offers. This research employs Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Bidirectional-LSTM (Bi-LSTM) models, utilizing meteorological data from a PV plant in El Paso, Cesar, Colombia, to predict solar irradiance with a 6-hour horizon and 10-minute resolution. While Bi-LSTM showed superior performance, the LSTM model achieved comparable results with significantly reduced training time (6 hours versus 18 hours), making it computationally advantageous. The LSTM predictions were averaged to create an hourly resolution model, evaluated using Mean Absolute Error, Root-Mean-Square Error, Normalized Root-Mean-Square Error, and Mean Absolute Percentage Error metrics. Comparison with the Global Forecast System (GFS) revealed similar performance, with both models effectively capturing daily solar irradiance patterns. The forecast model integrates with an Object-Oriented power production model, enabling accurate energy offers in the intraday market while minimizing penalty costs.</description>
