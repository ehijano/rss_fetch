      <title>Orbital decay candidates reconsidered: WASP-4 b is not decaying and Kepler-1658 b is not a planet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05229v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The fate of hot Jupiters is thought to be engulfment by their host stars, the outcome of tidal orbital decay. Transit timing has revealed a few systems with apparently shrinking orbital periods, but such signals can be mimicked by light travel-time effects (LTTE) of a distant companion. Combining transit timings with precise radial-velocity data, including new data, we reassessed three reported cases of orbital decay: WASP-4, WASP-12, and Kepler-1658. For WASP-4, the period change is best explained by LTTE due to a 10-Jupiter-mass companion at 4 AU, with no need to invoke orbital decay. For WASP-12, in contrast, the data firmly exclude LTTE and confirm genuine orbital decay. For Kepler-1658, spectroscopic and photometric anomalies reveal the "planet" to be an eclipsing K/M binary bound to the F-type primary, with LTTE explaining the observed period change. Thus, among the known hot Jupiters, only WASP-12 b currently shows compelling evidence for orbital decay.</description>

      <title>The First Dedicated Survey of Atmospheric Escape from Planets Orbiting F Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05240v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hydrodynamic escape can strip the envelopes of close-in exoplanets, but most observations of atmospheric mass loss to date have been confined to planets orbiting K and M dwarfs. A growing body of detections of atmospheric escape from planets orbiting early-type stars indicates that they may have significantly stronger and more extended outflows than planets orbiting cooler stars. However, it is unclear whether this limited sample of planets is representative of all gas giants orbiting early-type stars. Motivated by this question, we initiated the first dedicated survey of atmospheric escape from gas giants orbiting F stars in order to understand how their distinct radiation environments shape planetary outflows. We observed ten transits of six planets in an ultra-narrowband filter centered on the metastable helium line using Palomar/WIRC. We report strong ($&gt;3\sigma$) detections of atmospheric escape for WASP-12~b and WASP-180~A~b, tentative ($&gt;2\sigma$) detections for WASP-93~b and HAT-P-8~b, and non-detections for WASP-103~b and KELT-7~b. We fit these measurements with a 1D Parker wind model to derive corresponding mass-loss rates, and combine our results with literature measurements to obtain an updated picture of mass loss from planets orbiting early-type stars. Our results indicate that the observed variation in mass-loss rates can be explained by a combination of Roche filling factor and XUV luminosity, and disfavors NUV-driven escape models.</description>

      <title>Water solubility in silicate melts: The effects of melt composition under reducing conditions and implications for nebular ingassing on rocky planets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05281v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rocky planet atmospheres form and evolve through interactions between the planet's surface and interior. If a growing rocky planet acquires enough mass prior to the dissipation of the nebular gas disk, it can gravitationally capture a `primary' atmosphere dominated by H2. At the same time, these young, rocky bodies are likely to have partial or global magma oceans as a result of the heat from accretion, core formation and radioactive decay of short-lived major element isotopes. During this magma ocean stage, the dissolution of volatile, life-essential elements, such as hydrogen in the form of water or H2, into the magma is critical in determining the extent to which a rocky planet can maintain these elements over time. However, our ability to quantify the amount of hydrogen dissolved in the magma oceans of rocky planets is limited by the lack of experimental constraints on H-bearing species' solubilities at relevant pressure and temperature conditions, including those expected for the early Earth. Here we experimentally determine the solubility of water in silicate melts of various compositions in the Ca-Mg-Al-Si-Fe-O system at a total pressure of 1 bar and temperatures from 1673-1823 K, synthesized in a H2-CO2 gas-mixing furnace. We use Bayesian parameter estimation to derive a robust water solubility law that includes the effects of melt composition and temperature. Using this solubility law, we estimate that ~100 ppm of hydrogen can dissolve into a 1 MEarth planet with a surface pressure of ~300 bars set by accretion of solar-like nebular gas. For rocky planets in general, ingassing of a primary atmosphere may be an important source and initial storage mechanism for hydrogen-bearing species in a planet's interior, provided it grew to a sufficient mass within the lifetime of the solar nebula.</description>

      <title>Infall Explains the Disk Kinematics of AB Aur Without Gravitational Instability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Late-stage infall onto protoplanetary disks can produce large scale spiral arms. In this paper we used 3D smoothed particle hydrodynamics and radiative transfer simulations to study the kinematic perturbations induced in disks by infalling material. We found that deviations from Keplerian rotation are predominantly in the radial and vertical velocity components, spatially correlated with spiral arms in the gas surface density. The infall produces observable wiggles in the channel maps, analogous to those produce by the gravitational instability (GI), along with large-scale arcs and filaments. GI induced spiral arms produce radial velocity perturbations that point towards the center of the spiral arm owing to their higher self-gravity. We found a similar signature from infall-induced spiral arms, despite not including self-gravity in our simulation. Our study suggests that recent evidence of GI in the kinematics of the disk around AB Aur may instead be due to the observed infall, without the need for invoking GI.</description>

      <title>Line shapes of the Na/K resonance line profiles perturbed by H2 at extreme density</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05763v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Collision broadening by molecular hydrogen of sodium and potassium is one of the major broadening mechanisms in the atmospheres of brown dwarf stars and exoplanets at an effective temperature of about 1000K. The accurate computation of line profiles from collision broadening at high density requires use of a Fourier transform of the autocorrelation function inside the model atmosphere code. We strongly warn that use of Lorentzian profiles at a high perturber density neglects radiation during close collisions and may lead to erroneous conclusions.</description>

      <title>Physical Characterization of Asteroid (16583) Oersted Combining Stellar Occultation and Photometric Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05843v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report a successful observation of a stellar occultation by asteroid (16583) Oersted, enabling a detailed physical characterization of its shape, spin state, and surface properties. Our goal is to determine the physical parameters of Oersted by combining multi-chord occultation timing, sparse optical photometry, and thermal infrared observations. Such asteroids (size$\sim$20 km) are rarely modeled in this detail due to observational limitations, making Oersted a valuable case study. We applied convex lightcurve inversion to sparse photometric data to derive an initial shape and spin state. This model was then refined and scaled using non-convex shape modeling with the ADAM algorithm, incorporating constraints from the occultation chord profile. Thermophysical modeling based on WISE thermal infrared fluxes was used to determine the asteroid's effective diameter, geometric albedo, and thermal inertia. The non-convex shape model reveals localized surface concavities and provides a size estimate consistent with radiometric measurements. The derived thermal inertia is typical for asteroids of comparable size. This work demonstrates the effectiveness of combining stellar occultations, photometry, and thermal infrared data for asteroid modeling and highlights the valuable contributions of citizen scientists, who played a key role in capturing the occultation and constraining the asteroid's profile.</description>

      <title>Flow Regimes in Hot Jupiter Atmospheres: Insights from Anelastic Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05964v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hot Jupiters are Jupiter-sized exoplanets with close-in orbits, characterized by extreme day-night temperature contrasts due to synchronous rotation. These planets offer unique observational opportunities through transit photometry, transmission spectroscopy, and infrared (IR) phase curve analysis, which reveal information about heat redistribution and atmospheric dynamics.
  Complementary to common generalized circulation models (GCMs), we introduce a more comprehensive approach using the anelastic fluid equations that fully capture the three-dimensional nature of the emerging non-linear flows. We identify various non-linear flow regimes and analyze the heat distribution when irradiation and thermal advection reach equilibrium.
  Eastward zonal winds can reach velocities comparable to the planetary rotation (up to several kilometers per second), while slower radial flows, though less prominent, contribute significantly to heat advection and can cause both eastward and westward hotspot shifts. The efficiency of day-to-night heat redistribution and the positioning of brightness maxima are shown to depend strongly on pressure and the interplay of advective and radiative processes.
  These findings improve our understanding of the diversity observed in the IR phase curves and suggest a non-magnetic mechanism for retrograde hotspot shifts. By extending the scope of traditional GCM models, our work demonstrates the usefulness of anelastic models in capturing the complex, multidimensional dynamics of irradiated exoplanetary atmospheres.</description>

      <title>The Influence of Central Body Tides on Catastrophic Disruptions of Close-in Planetary Satellites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We model the outcomes of catastrophic disruptions on small, gravity-dominated natural satellites, accounting for the tidal potential of the central body, which is neglected in classical disruption scaling laws. We introduce the concept of $Q^\star_\text{TD}$, the specific energy required to disperse half of the total mass involved in a collision, accounting for the tidal potential of a central body. We derive a simple scaling relation for $Q^\star_\text{TD}$ and demonstrate that for close-in planetary or asteroidal satellites, the tides from the central body can significantly reduce their catastrophic disruption threshold. We show that many satellites in the Solar System are in such a regime, where their disruption threshold should be much lower than that predicted by classical scaling laws which neglect tidal effects. Some notable examples include Mars' Phobos, Jupiter's Metis and Adrastea, Saturn's ring moons, Uranus' Ophelia, and Neptune's Naiad and Thalassa, among others. We argue that traditional impact scaling laws should be modified to account for tides when modeling the formation and evolution of these close-in satellites. Our derivation for $Q^\star_\text{TD}$ can easily be used in existing $N$-body and collisional evolution codes.</description>

      <title>On the Possibility of Melting Water Ice during the Recent Past of Mars. Application to the Formation of Gullies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The formation of gullies on Mars has often been attributed to the melting of (sub)surface water ice. However, melting-based hypotheses generally overlook key processes: (1) sublimation cooling by latent heat absorption, (2) the non-stability of ice where melting conditions can be reached, and (3) the particular microclimates of gullied slopes. Using state-of-the-art climate simulations, we reassess ice melting scenarios over the past four million years (obliquity $\le$35\textdegree)), beyond the estimated period of gully formation. We find that surface melting is impossible anywhere due to sublimation cooling, while (quasi-) stable subsurface ice is typically too deep to reach melting temperatures. We propose an alternative mechanism in which seasonal CO$_2$ frost sublimation destabilizes the regolith and brings the underlying water ice close to the surface, allowing rapid heating. Even under these optimal conditions, melting requires unrealistic assumptions. The only remaining possibility is solar absorption in dusty ice, though its occurrence remains uncertain.</description>

      <title>JWST-TST DREAMS: The Nightside Emission and Chemistry of WASP-17b</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Theoretical studies have suggested using planetary infrared excess (PIE) to detect and characterize the thermal emission of transiting and non-transiting exoplanets, however the PIE technique requires empirical validation. Here we apply the PIE technique to a combination of JWST NIRSpec G395H transit and eclipse measurements of WASP-17b, a hot Jupiter orbiting an F-type star, obtained consecutively (0.5 phase or 1.8 days apart) as part of the JWST-TST program to perform Deep Reconnaissance of Exoplanet Atmospheres through Multi-instrument Spectroscopy (DREAMS). Using the in-eclipse measured stellar spectrum to circumvent the need for ultra-precise stellar models, we extract the first JWST nightside emission spectrum of WASP-17b using only transit and eclipse data thereby performing a controlled test of the PIE technique. From the WASP-17b nightside spectrum, we measure a nightside equilibrium temperature of $1005 \pm 256$ K and find tentative evidence for nightside SO2 absorption ($\ln B = 1.45$, $2.3\sigma$). In context with the dayside, the temperature of the nightside is consistent with (1) previous eclipse mapping findings that suggest relatively inefficient day-night heat transport, and (2) a non-zero bond albedo of $0.42^{+0.06}_{-0.10}$. SO2 on the nightside, if confirmed, would represent the first direct evidence for transport-induced chemistry, matching previous model predictions, and opening a new door into the 3D nature of giant exoplanets. Our results suggest that PIE is feasible with JWST/NIRSpec for two epochs separated in time by significantly less than the rotation period of the host star.</description>

      <title>Wavefront Error Recovery and Companion Identification with the James Webb Space Telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05308v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The James Webb Space Telescope is orders of magnitude more sensitive than any other facility across the near to mid-infrared wavelengths. Many approved programs take advantage of its highly stable point spread function (PSF) to directly detect faint companions using diverse high-contrast imaging (HCI) techniques. However, periodic re-phasing of the Optical Telescope Element (OTE) is required due to slow thermal drifts distorting to the primary mirror backplane along with stochastic tilt events on individual mirror segments. Many programs utilize observations of a reference star to remove the stellar contribution within an image which can typically take half of the total allocated time. We present a high-contrast imaging technique for the NIRISS instrument that uses the measured wavefront error (WFE) from a phase calibration observation (performed roughly every 48 hours) as prior information in a Bayesian analysis with nested sampling. This technique estimates the WFE of a given observation and simultaneously searches for faint companions, without using a reference star. We estimate the wavefront error for both full aperture and aperture masking interferometry (AMI) imaging modes using three low order Zernike coefficients per mirror segment, using the Hexike basis, to generate synthetic PSFs and compare to simulations. We compare our technique to traditional interferometric analysis in realistic NIRISS F430M simulations both relative to the photon noise limit, and through recovering an injected companion with $\Delta$F430M= 8 mag at 0.2''. With future testing, this technique may save significant amounts of observing time given the results of our current implementation on NIRISS simulations.</description>

      <title>An interferometric mid-infrared study of the eruptive star binary Z CMa with MATISSE/VLTI. I. Imaging the protoplanetary disks during the 2023 outburst</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05818v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The mid-infrared (MIR) emitting regions of the individual protoplanetary disks in the binary system Z CMa are resolved by MATISSE/VLTI. The observations were obtained during a serendipitous large outburst of the HBe star that lasted more than 100 days, while the FUor companion is presumed to be in quiescence. The size of the MIR-emitting disk region of the more massive HBe star increases toward longer wavelengths from $&lt;14$ mas at 3.5$\mu m$ to $\ll 50$ mas at 11.5$\mu m$ . The lack of substructures in the HBe disk might suggest that it is a continuous disk; however, this could be due to observational constraints. We also note a radial variation of the silicate absorption feature over the disk, where the optical depth increases inwards of $&lt;$40~au radii. This contradicts the scenario of a carved, dusty cocoon surrounding the HBe star. In the case of the less massive FUor companion, the MIR-emitting region is much smaller with an angular size $\leq$15 mas (or else a physical radius $&lt;9$ au) in all bands, suggesting a compact disk. Both disks are aligned within uncertainties, and their orientation agrees with that of the known jets. Furthermore, MATISSE data place the binary's separation at $117.88 \pm 0.73$ mas and a position angle of $139.16^o\,\pm\,0.29^o$ east of north. Our estimates for the orbital elements gave an eccentric orbit ($e\sim0.17$) with a moderate inclination ($i\sim 66$\degr). The derived total mass is $M_{\rm total} = 16.4^{+2.1}_{-2.3}$ M$_\odot$, while the period is approximately 950 years. Our MATISSE imaging of the Herbig disk during outburst indicates a temperature gradient for the disk, while imaging of the FUor companion's disk corroborates previous studies showing that FUor disks are rather compact in the MIR. We cannot infer any misalignment between the MATISSE results and earlier ALMA/JVLA data, nor can we infer any influence from the alleged flyby event.</description>

Abstract: The existence of a deficit of brown dwarfs (BDs) in close orbit around main-sequence stars is one of the most intriguing questions in stellar physics. This so-called BD desert may result from the transition between two different dominant formation processes occurring for different mass regimes. While the BD mass derived from radial-velocity measurements helps confirm the nature of the analyzed objects, the BD radius obtained from transits is important to better constrain the BD age, as BDs are believed to contract with age. Such objects with well-constrained parameters, although in small number, are of prime interest for deeper investigations of BD structure and chemical composition. The present document aims at presenting the first results of a search for BD transits among a sample of approximately 3300 host star candidates observed by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite during Cycle 6.</description>

      <title>Testing the Origin of Hot Jupiters with Atmospheric Surveys</title>

Abstract: In spite of their long detection history, the origin of hot Jupiters remains to be resolved. While multiple dynamical evidence suggests high-eccentricity migration is most likely, conflicts remain when considering hot Jupiters as a population in the context of warm and cold Jupiters. Here, we turn to atmospheric signatures as an alternative mean to test the origin theory of hot Jupiters, focusing on population level trends that arise from post-formation pollution, motivated by the upcoming Ariel space mission whose goal is to deliver a uniform sample of exoplanet atmospheric constraints. We experiment with post-formation pollution by planetesimal accretion, pebble accretion, and disk-induced migration and find that an observable signature of post-formation pollution is only possible under pebble accretion in metal-heavy disks. If most hot Jupiters arrive at their present orbit by high-eccentricity migration while warm Jupiters emerge largely in situ, we expect the atmospheric water abundance of hot Jupiters to be significantly elevated compared to warm Jupiters. We report on the detectability of such signatures and further provide suggestions for future comparative atmospheric characterization between hot Jupiters and wide-orbit directly imaged planets to elucidate the properties of the dust substructures in protoplanetary disks.</description>
