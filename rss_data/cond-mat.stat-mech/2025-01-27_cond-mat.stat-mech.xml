      <title>Field Theory of Birhythmicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14192v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-equilibrium dynamics are present in many aspects of our lives, ranging from microscopic physical systems to the functioning of the brain. What characterizes stochastic models of non-equilibrium processes is the breaking of the fluctuation-dissipation relations as well as the existence of non-static stable states, or phases. A prototypical example is a dynamical phase characterized by a limit cycle - the order parameter of finite magnitude rotating or oscillating at a fixed frequency. Consequently, birhythmicity, where two stable limit cycles coexist, is a natural extension of the simpler single limit cycle phase. Both the abundance of real systems exhibiting such states as well as their relevance for building our understanding of non-equilibrium phases and phase transitions are strong motivations to build and study models of such behavior. Field theoretic tools can be used to provide insights into either phase and the transition between them. In this work we explore a simple linear model of the single limit cycle phase with phase-amplitude coupling. We demonstrate how such non-equilibrium coupling affects the fluctuation spectrum of the theory. We then extend this model to include a continuous transition to a two-cycle phase. We give various results, such as an appearance of a critical exceptional point, the destruction of the transition, enhancement of noise for the phase and the presence of KPZ dynamics. Finally, we qualitatively demonstrate these results with numerics and discuss future directions.</description>

      <title>Out-of-time-order correlator computation based on discrete truncated Wigner approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14221v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a method based on the discrete truncated Wigner approximation (DTWA) for computing out-of-time-order correlators. This method is applied to long-range interacting quantum spin systems where the interactions decay as a power law with distance. As a demonstration, we use a squared commutator of local operators and its higher-order extensions that describe quantum information scrambling under Hamilton dynamics. Our results reveal that the DTWA method accurately reproduces the exact dynamics of the average spreading of quantum information (i.e., the squared commutator) across all time regimes in strongly long-range interacting systems. We also identify limitations in the DTWA method when capturing dynamics in weakly long-range interacting systems and the fastest spreading of quantum information. This work provides a new technique to study scrambling dynamics in long-range interacting quantum spin systems.</description>

      <title>Microscopic study of 3D Potts phase transition via Fuzzy Sphere Regularization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14320v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Potts model describes interacting spins with $Q$ different components, which is a direct generalization of the Ising model ($Q=2$). Compared to the existing exact solutions in 2D, the phase transitions and critical phenomena in the 3D Potts model have been less explored. Here, we systematically investigate a quantum $(2+1)$-D Potts model with $Q=3$ using a fuzzy sphere regularization scheme. We first construct a microscopic model capable of achieving a magnetic phase transition that separates a spin $S_3$ permutationally symmetric paramagnet and a spontaneous symmetry-breaking ferromagnet. Importantly, the energy spectrum at the phase transition point exhibits an approximately conformal symmetry, implying that an underlying conformal field theory may govern this transition. Moreover, when tuning along the phase transition line in the mapped phase diagram, we find that the dimension of the subleading $S_3$ singlet operator flows and drifts around the critical value $\sim 3$, which is believed to be crucial for understanding this phase transition, although determining its precise value remains challenging due to the limitations of our finite-size calculations. These findings suggest a discontinuous transition in the 3D 3-state Potts model, characterized by pseudo-critical behavior, which we argue results from a nearby multicritical or complex fixed point.</description>

      <title>Lower bound of entropy production at short time scales for noise-driven stochastic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The second law of thermodynamics governs that nonequilibrium systems evolve towards states of higher entropy over time. However, it does not specify the rate of this evolution and the role of fluctuations that impact the system's dynamics. Entropy production quantifies how far a system is driven away from equilibrium and provides a measure of irreversibility. In stochastic systems, entropy production becomes essential for understanding the approach to nonequilibrium states. While macroscopic observations provide valuable insights, they often overlook the local behaviors of the system, governed by fluctuations. In this study, we focus on measuring the lower bound of entropy production at short time scales for generalized stochastic systems by calculating the Kullback-Leibler divergence (KLD) between the probability density functions of forward and backward trajectories. By analysing the entropy production across sliding time scales, we uncover patterns that reveal distinctions between local, small-scale dynamics and the global, macroscopic behavior, offering deeper insights into the system's departure from equilibrium. We also analysed the effects of switching to different types of noise or fluctuations and found that the observations at larger time scales provide no distinction between the different forms of noise while at short time scales, the distinction is significant.</description>

      <title>Exact generalized Bethe eigenstates of the non-integrable alternating Heisenberg chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14017v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Exact solutions of quantum lattice models serve as useful guides for interpreting physical phenomena in condensed matter systems. Prominent examples of integrability appear in one dimension, including the Heisenberg chain, where the Bethe ansatz method has been widely successful. Recent work has noted that certain non-integrable models harbor quantum many-body scar states, which form a superspin of regular states hidden in an otherwise chaotic spectrum. Here we consider one of the simplest examples of a non-integrable model, the alternating ferromagnetic-antiferromagnetic (bond-staggered) Heisenberg chain, a close cousin of the spin-1 Haldane chain and a spin analog of the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model, and show the presence of exponentially many zero-energy states. We highlight features of the alternating chain that allow treatment with the Bethe ansatz (with important modifications) and surprisingly for a non-integrable system, we find simple compact expressions for zero-energy eigenfunctions for a few magnons including solutions with fractionalized particle momentum. We discuss a general numerical recipe to diagnose the existence of such generalized Bethe ansatz (GBA) states and also provide exact analytic expressions for the entanglement of such states. We conclude by conjecturing a picture of magnon pairing which may generalize to multiple magnons. Our work opens the avenue to describe certain eigenstates of partially integrable systems using the GBA.</description>

      <title>Exact quantum many-body scars tunable from volume to area law</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.14024v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Teleportation of quantum information over long distances requires robust entanglement on the macroscopic scale. The construction of a manifold of highly energetic eigenstates with tunable long-range entanglement can provide a new medium for information transmission. We construct polynomially many exact zero-energy eigenstates in an exponentially degenerate manifold for a class of non-integrable spin-1/2 Hamiltonians with two-body interactions. A symmetric superposition of the triplet basis of antipodal spin pairs provides a rich manifold for the construction of states with extensive, logarithmic, and short-range entanglement by tuning the distribution of triplet states. We show the volume-law entangled states despite being in the middle of the spectrum host non-thermal expectation values of local observables. Certain quasiparticle excitations in this manifold converge to be exact quantum many-body scars in the thermodynamic limit. This framework has a natural extension to higher dimensions, where entangled states controlled by lattice geometry and internal symmetries can result in new classes of correlated out-of-equilibrium quantum matter. Our results provide a new avenue for entanglement control and a novel method of quantum state construction.</description>

The aim of the paper is to demonstrate that the DML may correctly model the thermodiffusion, in particular getting formal expressions for positive and negative Soret coefficient, and another unexpected mechano-thermal effect recently discovered in liquids submitted to shear strain, for which the first-ever theoretical interpretation is provided.</description>

      <title>Open reaction-diffusion systems: bridging probabilistic theory and simulations across scales</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07119v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reaction-diffusion processes are the foundational model for a diverse range of complex systems, ranging from biochemical reactions to social agent-based phenomena. The underlying dynamics of these systems occur at the individual particle/agent level, and in realistic applications, they often display interaction with their environment through energy or material exchange with a reservoir. This requires intricate mathematical considerations, especially in the case of material exchange since the varying number of particles/agents results in ``on-the-fly'' modification of the system dimension. In this work, we first overview the probabilistic description of reaction-diffusion processes at the particle level, which readily handles varying number of particles. We then extend this model to consistently incorporate interactions with macroscopic material reservoirs. Based on the resulting expressions, we bridge the probabilistic description with macroscopic concentration-based descriptions for linear and nonlinear reaction-diffusion systems, as well as for an archetypal open reaction-diffusion system. Using these mathematical bridges across scales, we finally develop numerical schemes for open reaction-diffusion systems, which we implement in two illustrative examples. This work establishes a methodological workflow to bridge particle-based probabilistic descriptions with macroscopic concentration-based descriptions of reaction-diffusion in open settings, laying the foundations for a multiscale theoretical framework upon which to construct theory and simulation schemes that are consistent across scales.</description>

      <title>Relaxation behavior near the first-order phase transition line</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18909v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using the Metropolis algorithm, we simulate the relaxation process of the three-dimensional kinetic Ising model. Starting from a random initial configuration, we first present the average equilibration time across the entire phase boundary. It is observed that the average equilibration time increases significantly as the temperature decreases far from the critical temperature $T_{\rm c}$. The average equilibration time along the first-order phase transition (1st-PT) line exhibits an ultra-slow relaxation. We also investigate the dynamic scaling behavior with system sizes, and find that dynamic scaling holds not only near $T_{\rm c}$, but also at $T\ll T_{\rm c}$. The dynamic exponent at $T\ll T_{\rm c}$ is larger than that near $T_{\rm c}$. Additionally, we analyze the dynamic scaling of the average autocorrelation time and find that it depends on system size only near $T_{\rm c}$, while it becomes size-independent both above and below $T_{\rm c}$. The extremely slow relaxation dynamics observed near the 1st-PT is attributed to the complex structure of the free energy.</description>

      <title>Particle exchange statistics beyond fermions and bosons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.05203v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is commonly believed that there are only two types of particle exchange statistics in quantum mechanics, fermions and bosons, with the exception of anyons in two dimension. In principle, a second exception known as parastatistics, which extends outside of two dimensions, has been considered but was believed to be physically equivalent to fermions and bosons. In this paper we show that nontrivial parastatistics inequivalent to either fermions or bosons can exist in physical systems. These new types of identical particles obey generalized exclusion principles, leading to exotic free-particle thermodynamics distinct from any system of free fermions and bosons. We formulate our theory by developing a second quantization of paraparticles, which naturally includes exactly solvable non-interacting theories, and incorporates physical constraints such as locality. We then construct a family of exactly solvable quantum spin models in one and two dimensions where free paraparticles emerge as quasiparticle excitations, and their exchange statistics can be physically observed and is notably distinct from fermions and bosons. This demonstrates the possibility of a new type of quasiparticle in condensed matter systems, and, more speculatively, the potential for previously unconsidered types of elementary particles.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10074v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the optimal control of switching on a coupling term between two quantum many-body systems. Specifically, we (i) quantify the energetic cost of establishing a weak junction between two quantum spin-$1/2$ chains in finite time $\tau$ and (ii) identify the energetically optimal protocol to realize it. For linear driving protocols, we find that for long times the excess (irreversible) work scales as $\tau^{-\eta}$, where $\eta=1, 2$ or a nonuniversal number depending on the phase of the chains. Interestingly, increasing a $J_z$ anisotropy in the chains suppresses the excess work thus promoting quasi-adiabaticity. The general optimal control problem is solved, employing a Chebyshev ansatz. We find that the optimal control protocol is intimately sensitive to the chain phases.</description>

      <title>Long-time divergences in the nonlinear response of gapped one-dimensional many-particle systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.06167v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider one dimensional many-particle systems that exhibit kinematically protected single-particle excitations over their ground states. We show that momentum and time-resolved 4-point functions of operators that create such excitations diverge linearly in particular time differences. This behaviour can be understood by means of a simple semiclassical analysis based on the kinematics and scattering of wave packets of quasiparticles. We verify that our wave packet analysis correctly predicts the long-time limit of the four-point function in the transverse field Ising model through a form factor expansion. We present evidence in favour of the same behaviour in integrable quantum field theories. In addition, we extend our discussion to experimental protocols where two times of the four-point function coincide, e.g. 2D coherent spectroscopy and pump-probe experiments. Finally, focusing on the Ising model, we discuss subleading corrections that grow as the square root of time differences. We show that the subleading corrections can be correctly accounted for by the same semiclassical analysis, but also taking into account wave packet spreading.</description>

      <title>Gross-Neveu-Yukawa SO(2) and SO(3) tensorial criticality</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16842v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the relativistic SO(2)- and SO(3)-invariant Gross-Neveu-Yukawa field theories for real, rank-two, symmetric, traceless tensor order parameters coupled to $N_{\text{f}}$ flavors of two-component Dirac fermions. These field theories arise as an effective description of fractionalized spin-orbital liquids. The two theories are the simplest and special cases of the more general class of field theories with SO($N$) symmetric tensor order parameter coupled to Dirac fermions, in which the symmetry is low enough to allow only one, and not the usual two quartic self-interaction terms. Using two-loop renormalization group near the upper critical dimension, we demonstrate that the theory exhibits a new critical fixed point for $N=3$ and the concomitant continuous phase transition for any value of $N_{\text{f}}$. For $N=2$ the theory is equivalent to the chiral XY model. We discuss the crucial role of the symmetry-allowed sextic self-interactions in the selection of the ground state configuration in the case of SO(3). The universal quantities such as the the anomalous dimensions of order parameters and fermions, the correlation length exponent, and the mass gap ratio between order parameter and fermion masses are computed up to $\epsilon^{2}$ order.</description>
