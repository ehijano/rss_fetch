      <title>Space-time reversible graph rewriting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03296v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the mathematical tradition, reversibility requires that the evolution of a dynamical system be a bijective function. In the context of graph rewriting, however, the evolution is not even a function, because it is not even deterministic -- as the rewrite rules get applied at non-deterministically chosen locations. Physics, by contrast, suggests a more flexible understanding of reversibility in space-time, whereby any two closeby snapshots (aka `space-like cuts'), must mutually determine each other. We build upon the recently developed framework of space-time deterministic graph rewriting, in order to formalise this notion of space-time reversibility, and henceforth study reversible graph rewriting. We establish sufficient, local conditions on the rewrite rules so that they be space-time reversible. We provide an example featuring time dilation, in the spirit of general relativity.</description>

      <title>Vector Trifference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04079v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a geometric generalization of trifference, a concept introduced by Elias in 1988 in the study of zero-error channel capacity. In the discrete setting, a code C \subseteq {0,1,2}^n is trifferent if for any three distinct codewords x, y, z in C, there exists a coordinate i in [n] where x_i, y_i, z_i are all distinct. Determining the maximum size of such codes remains a central open problem; the classical upper bound |C| \leq 2 * (3/2)^n, proved via a simple pruning argument, has resisted significant improvement.
  Motivated by the search for new techniques, and in line with vectorial extensions of other classical combinatorial notions, we introduce the concept of vector trifferent codes. Consider C \subseteq (S^2)^n, where the alphabet is the unit sphere S^2 = { v in R^3 : ||v|| = 1 }. We say C is vector trifferent if for any three distinct x, y, z in C, there is an index i where the vectors x_i, y_i, z_i are mutually orthogonal. A direct reduction of the vectorial problem to the discrete setting appears infeasible, making it difficult to replicate Elias's pruning argument. Nevertheless, we develop a new method to establish the upper bound |C| \leq (sqrt(2) + o(1)) * (3/2)^n.
  Interestingly, our approach, when adapted back to the discrete setting, yields a polynomial improvement to Elias's bound: |C| \lesssim n^(-1/4) * (3/2)^n. This improvement arises from a technique that parallels, but is not identical to, a recent method of the authors, though it still falls short of the sharper n^(-2/5) factor obtained there. We also generalize the concept of vector trifferent codes to richer alphabets and prove a vectorial version of the Fredman-Komlos theorem (1984) for general k-separating codes.</description>

      <title>Maximum Biclique for Star 1,2,3 -free and Bounded Bimodularwidth Twin-free Bipartite Graphs $\star$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04621v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There are three usual definitions of a maximum bipartite clique (biclique) in a bipartite graph\,: either maximizing the number of vertices, or of edges, or finding a maximum balanced biclique. The first problem can be solved in polynomial time, the last ones are NP-complete. Here we show how these three problems may be efficiently solved for two classes of bipartite graphs: Star123-free twin-free graphs, and bounded bimodularwidth twin-free graphs, a class that may be defined using bimodular decomposition. Our computation requires O(n^2) time and requires a decomposition is provided, which takes respectively O(n + m) and O(mn^3) time.</description>

      <title>Discrete scalar curvature as a weighted sum of Ollivier-Ricci curvatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04936v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the relationship between discrete analogues of Ricci and scalar curvature that are defined for point clouds and graphs. In the discrete setting, Ricci curvature is replaced by Ollivier-Ricci curvature. Scalar curvature can be computed as the trace of Ricci curvature for a Riemannian manifold; this motivates a new definition of a scalar version of Ollivier-Ricci curvature. We show that our definition converges to scalar curvature for nearest neighbor graphs obtained by sampling from a manifold. We also prove some new results about the convergence of Ollivier-Ricci curvature to Ricci curvature.</description>

      <title>Note on the Number of Almost Ordinary Triangles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03445v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a set of $n$ points in the plane, not all on a line. According to the Gallai-Sylvester
  theorem, $X$ always spans an \emph{ordinary line}, i.e., one that passes through precisely 2
  elements of $X$. Given an integer $c\ge 2,$ a \emph{line} spanned by $X$ is called
  \emph{$c$-ordinary} if it passes through at most $c$ points of $X$. A \emph{triangle} spanned by 3
  noncollinear points of $X$ is called \emph{$c$-ordinary} if all 3 lines determined by its sides
  are \emph{$c$-ordinary}. Motivated by a question of Erd\H os, Fulek \emph{et al.}~\cite{FMN+17}
  proved that there exists an absolute constant $c &gt; 2$ such that if $X$ cannot be covered by 2
  lines, then it determines at least one $c$-ordinary triangle. Moreover, the number of such
  triangles grows at least linearly in $n$. They raised the question whether the true growth rate of
  this function is superlinear.
  We prove that if $X$ cannot be covered by 2 lines, and no line passes through more than $n-t(n)$
  points of $X$, for some function $t(n)\rightarrow\infty,$ then the number of $17$-ordinary
  triangles spanned by $X$ is at least constant times $n \cdot t(n)$, i.e., superlinear in $n$. We also
  show that the assumption $t(n)\rightarrow\infty$ is necessary. If we further assume that no line
  passes through more than $n/2-t(n)$ points of $X$, then the number of $17$-ordinary triangles
  grows superquadratically in $n$. This statement does not hold if $t(n)$ is bounded. We close this
  paper with some algorithmic results. In particular, we provide a $O(n^{2.372})$ time algorithm for
  counting all $c$-ordinary triangles in an $n$-element point set, for any $c&lt;n$.</description>

      <title>On the Modular Chromatic Index of Random Hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04334v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $k,r \geq 2$ be two integers. We consider the problem of partitioning the hyperedge set of an $r$-uniform hypergraph $H$ into the minimum number $\chi_k'(H)$ of edge-disjoint subhypergraphs in which every vertex has either degree $0$ or degree congruent to $1$ modulo $k$. For a random hypergraph $H$ drawn from the binomial model $\mathbf{H}(n,p,r)$, with edge probability $p \in (C\log(n)/n,1)$ for a large enough constant $C&gt;0$ independent of $n$ and satisfying $n^{r-1}p(1-p)\to\infty$ as $n\to\infty$, we show that asymptotically almost surely $\chi_k'(H) = k$ if $n$ is divisible by $\gcd(k,r)$, and $\max(k,r) \le \chi_k'(H) \le k+r+1$ otherwise. A key ingredient in our approach is a sufficient condition ensuring the existence of a $k$-factor, a $k$-regular spanning subhypergraph, within subhypergraphs of a random hypergraph from $\mathbf{H}(n,p,r)$, a result that may be of independent interest. Our main result extends a theorem of Botler, Colucci, and Kohayakawa (2023), who proved an analogous statement for graphs, and provides a partial answer to a question posed by Goetze, Klute, Knauer, Parada, Pe\~na, and Ueckerdt (2025) regarding whether $\chi_2'(H)$ can be bounded by a constant for every hypergraph $H$.</description>

      <title>Distinct Distances on Pfaffian Curves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.04337v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We generalize Pach and de Zeeuw's bound for distinct distances between points on two curves, from algebraic curves to Pfaffian curves. Pfaffian curves include those that can be defined by any combination of elementary functions, including exponential and logarithmic functions, rational and irrational powers, trigonometric functions and their inverses, integration, and more. The bound remains $\Omega(\min\{m^{3/4}n^{3/4},m^2,n^2\})$, as obtained from the proximity technique of Solymosi and Zahl.</description>

      <title>Improved Lower Bounds on Multiflow-Multicut Gaps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06576v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a set of source-sink pairs, the maximum multiflow problem asks for the maximum total amount of flow that can be feasibly routed between them. The minimum multicut, a dual problem to multiflow, seeks the minimum-cost set of edges whose removal disconnects all the source-sink pairs. It is easy to see that the value of the minimum multicut is at least that of the maximum multiflow, and their ratio is called the multiflow-multicut gap. The classical max-flow min-cut theorem states that when there is only one source-sink pair, the gap is exactly one. However, in general, it is well known that this gap can be arbitrarily large. In this paper, we study this gap for classes of planar graphs and establish improved lower bound results. In particular, we show that this gap is at least $\frac{20}{9}$ for the class of planar graphs, improving upon the decades-old lower bound of 2. More importantly, we develop new techniques for proving such a lower bound, which may be useful in other settings as well.</description>

      <title>Approximation schemes for capacity vehicle routing problems: A survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.01826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.01826v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Finding the shortest travelling tour of vehicles with capacity k from the depot to the customers is called the Capacity vehicle routing problem (CVRP). CVRP plays an essential position in logistics systems, and it is the most intensively studied problem in combinatorial optimization. In complexity, CVRP with k $\ge$ 3 is an NP-hard problem, and it is APX-hard as well. We already knew that it could not be approximated in metric space. Moreover, it is the first problem resisting Arora's famous approximation framework. So, whether there is, a polynomial-time (1+$\epsilon$)-approximation for the Euclidean CVRP for any $\epsilon&gt;0$ is still an open problem. This paper will summarize the research progress from history to up-to-date developments. The survey will be updated periodically.</description>

      <title>Highly Connected Steiner Subgraph -- Parameterized Algorithms and Applications to Hitting Set Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.02708v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a simple connected undirected graph G = (V, E), a set X \subseteq V(G), and integers k and p, STEINER SUBGRAPH EXTENSION problem asks if there exists a set S \supseteq X with at most k vertices such that G[S] is p-edge-connected. This is a natural generalization of a well-studied problem STEINER TREE (set p=1 and X as the set of all terminals). In this paper, we initiate the study of STEINER SUBGRAPH EXTENSION from the perspective of parameterized complexity and give a fixed-parameter algorithm parameterized by k and p on graphs of bounded degeneracy. In case we remove the assumption of the input graph being bounded degenerate, then the STEINER SUBGRAPH EXTENSION problem becomes W[1]-hard. Besides being an independent advance on the parameterized complexity of network design problems, our result has natural applications. In particular, we use our result to obtain singly exponential-time FPT algorithms for several vertex deletion problem studied in the literature, where the goal is to delete a smallest set of vertices such that (i) the resulting graph belongs to a specific hereditary graph class, and (ii) the deleted set of vertices induces a p-edge-connected subgraph of the input graph.</description>

      <title>Finding d-Cuts in Graphs of Bounded Diameter, Graphs of Bounded Radius and H-Free Graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11389v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The d-Cut problem is to decide if a graph has an edge cut such that each vertex has at most d neighbours at the opposite side of the cut. If $d=1$, we obtain the intensively studied Matching Cut problem. The d-Cut problem has been studied as well, but a systematic study for special graph classes was lacking. We initiate such a study and consider classes of bounded diameter, bounded radius and $H$-free graphs. We prove that for all $d\geq 2$, d-Cut is polynomial-time solvable for graphs of diameter 2, $(P_3+P_4)$-free graphs and $P_5$-free graphs. These results extend known results for $d=1$. However, we also prove several NP-hardness results for d-Cut that contrast known polynomial-time results for $d=1$. Our results lead to full dichotomies for bounded diameter and bounded radius and to almost-complete dichotomies for H-free graphs.</description>

      <title>Extending Stable and Popular Matching Algorithms from Bipartite to Arbitrary Instances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16173v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider stable and popular matching problems in arbitrary graphs, which are referred to as stable roommates instances. We extend the 3/2-approximation algorithm for the maximum size weakly stable matching problem to the roommates case, which solves a more than 20 year old open question of Irving and Manlove about the approximability of maximum size weakly stable matchings in roommates instances with ties [Irving and Manlove 2002] and has nice applications for the problem of matching residents to hospitals in the presence of couples. We also extend the algorithm that finds a maximum size popular matching in bipartite graphs in the case of strict preferences and the algorithm to find a popular matching among maximum weight matchings. While previous attempts to extend the idea of promoting the agents or duplicating the edges from bipartite instances to arbitrary ones failed, these results show that with the help of a simple observation, we can indeed bridge the gap and extend these algorithms</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Bounds and Online Algorithms for Average-Case Matrix Discrepancy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23915v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the matrix discrepancy problem in the average-case setting. Given a sequence of $m \times m$ symmetric matrices $A_1,\ldots,A_n$, its discrepancy is defined as the minimal spectral norm over all signed sums $\sum_{i=1}^n x_iA_i$ with $x_1,\ldots,x_n \in \{\pm1\}$. Our contributions are twofold. First, we study the asymptotic discrepancy of random matrices. When the matrices belong to the Gaussian orthogonal ensemble, we provide a sharp characterization of the asymptotic discrepancy and show that the limiting distribution is concentrated around $\Theta(\sqrt{nm}4^{-(1 + o(1))n/m^2})$, under the assumption $m^2 \ll n/\log{n}$. We observe that the trivial bound $O(\sqrt{nm})$ cannot be improved when $n \ll m^2$ and show that this phenomenon occurs for a broad class of random matrices. In the case $n = \Omega(m^2)$, we provide a matching upper bound. Second, we analyse the matrix hyperbolic cosine algorithm, an online algorithm for matrix discrepancy minimization due to Zouzias (2011), in the average-case setting. We show that the algorithm achieves with high probability a discrepancy of $O(m\log{m})$ for a broad class of random matrices, including Wigner matrices with entries satisfying a hypercontractive inequality and Gaussian Wishart matrices.</description>

      <title>Efficient Sparsification of Simplicial Complexes via Local Densities of States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07558v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Simplicial complexes (SCs) have become a popular abstraction for analyzing complex data using tools from topological data analysis or topological signal processing. However, the analysis of many real-world datasets often leads to dense SCs, with many higher-order simplicies, which results in prohibitive computational requirements in terms of time and memory consumption. The sparsification of such complexes is thus of broad interest, i.e., the approximation of an original SC with a sparser surrogate SC (with typically only a log-linear number of simplices) that maintains the spectrum of the original SC as closely as possible. In this work, we develop a novel method for a probabilistic sparsification of SCs that uses so-called local densities of states. Using this local densities of states, we can efficiently approximate so-called generalized effective resistance of each simplex, which is proportional to the required sampling probability for the sparsification of the SC. To avoid degenerate structures in the spectrum of the corresponding Hodge Laplacian operators, we suggest a ``kernel-ignoring'' decomposition to approximate the sampling probability. Additionally, we utilize certain error estimates to characterize the asymptotic algorithmic complexity of the developed method. We demonstrate the performance of our framework on a family of Vietoris--Rips filtered simplicial complexes.</description>
