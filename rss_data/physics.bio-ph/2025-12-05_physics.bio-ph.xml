      <title>Nano-capattery: Taming electron traffic for a 367% leap in biohydrogen surge through suppressing competing pathways in photo photo-fermentative system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The electron flux diverts electrons from optimal hydrogen production pathways to competitive pathways, which overall reduces the efficiency of the photo fermentation hydrogen production (PFHP) system. For tackling electron flux and metabolic pathway regulation, a hybrid material (nano-capattery (NC)) was developed based on cobalt-iron-nitrogen doped biochar (Co-Fe-NBC). The NC possessed both the capacitor property (287.91 F/g) and battery-like charge storage 38.3 mC/g with the highest energy density of 159.95 mWh/g. These properties existed due to its Fe2+/Fe3+ and Co2+/Co3+ redox cycle ability, a highly porous surface (291.81 m2/g BET surface area) caused by the defects (AD/AG 3.13) and abundant oxygen vacancies (OVs) observed through electro paramagnetic resonance. During PFHP, there is an 85% reduction in propionic acid, a 65.3% record electron management efficiency, an improved 1.34 NAD+/NADH ratio, along with a 87% increase in dehydrogenase activity, confirming the superior role of NC in efficient regulation of the metabolic pathway and electron flux management. These exceptional properties of biochar-based NC raised the cumulative hydrogen production from 151.03 mL (control) to 589.54 mL, which was an enormous increase of 367%.</description>

      <title>Bifurcation Analysis of the Driven FitzHugh-Nagumo Oscillator: Prediction and Experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04212v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bifurcation analysis is applied to the FitzHugh-Nagumo oscillator driven by a sinusoidal source. A numerically generated 2d regime map showing the variety of oscillatory dynamics in the parameter space of source frequency and amplitude agrees well with a map created from analog circuit measurements. Application of the sinusoidal source to the fast variable's first-order differential equation produces an island in the map in which oscillations at the source frequency are unstable and the behavior is dominated by two distinct families of subharmonic limit cycles and by chaos. Previously published maps are portions of the map shown here and are shown to be consistent with it. The more detailed and comprehensive regime map presented here should facilitate the understanding of this foundational system and thereby aid the ongoing research involving more complicated implementations of the Fitzhugh-Nagumo system.</description>

      <title>Why life is hot</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.04725v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The process of evolution by natural selection leads to fitness-maximising phenotypes. On the level of cellular chemical reaction networks, maximising fitness can mean optimising a variety of fitness functions such as robustness, precision, or sensitivity to external stimuli. Using theory and numerics, we show that these diverse goals can be achieved by a versatile, generic mechanism: coupling chemical reaction networks to reservoirs that are strongly out of equilibrium. Moreover, we demonstrate that the degree of optimality achievable by this mechanism saturates, and that nature appears to operate near saturation. We find that the amount of heat generated by this mechanism constitutes a significant fraction of the total heat produced by living organisms, so that 'life is hot' largely because of the need for a versatile mechanism to optimise a variety of fitness functions.</description>

      <title>A High-Order Discretization Scheme for Surface Integral Equations for Analyzing the Electroencephalography Forward Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04845v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A Nystrom-based high-order (HO) discretization scheme for surface integral equations (SIEs) for analyzing the electroencephalography (EEG) forward problem is proposed in this work. We use HO surface elements and interpolation functions for the discretization of the interfaces of the head volume and the unknowns on the elements, respectively. The advantage of this work over existing isoparametric HO discretization schemes resides in the fact that the interpolation points are different from the mesh nodes, allowing for the flexible manipulation of the order of the basis functions without regenerating the mesh of the interfaces. Moreover, the interpolation points are chosen from the quadrature rules with the same number of points on the elements simplifying the numerical computation of the surface integrals for the far-interaction case. In this contribution, we extend the implementation of the HO discretization scheme to the double-layer and the adjoint double-layer formulations, as well as to the isolated-skull-approach for the double-layer formulation and to the indirect adjoint double-layer formulation, employed to improve the solution accuracy in case of high conductivity contrast models, which requires the development of different techniques for the singularity treatment. Numerical experiments are presented to demonstrate the accuracy, flexibility, and efficiency of the proposed scheme for the four SIEs for analyzing the EEG forward problem.</description>

      <title>Shape of population interfaces as an indicator of mutational instability in coexisting cell populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.03105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2009.03105v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cellular populations such as avascular tumors and microbial biofilms may "invade" or grow into surrounding populations. The invading population is often comprised of a heterogeneous mixture of cells with varying growth rates. The population may also exhibit mutational instabilities, such as a heavy deleterious mutation load in a cancerous growth. We study the dynamics of a heterogeneous, mutating population competing with a surrounding homogeneous population, as one might find in a cancerous invasion of healthy tissue. We find that the shape of the population interface serves as an indicator for the evolutionary dynamics within the heterogeneous population. In particular, invasion front undulations become enhanced when the invading population is near a mutational meltdown transition or when the surrounding "bystander" population is barely able to reinvade the mutating population. We characterize these interface undulations and the effective fitness of the heterogeneous population in one- and two-dimensional systems.</description>

      <title>Mesoscale tissue properties and electric fields in brain stimulation -- bridging the macroscopic and microscopic scales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16465v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate simulations of electric fields (E-fields) in brain stimulation depend on tissue conductivity representations that link macroscopic assumptions with underlying microscopic tissue structure. Mesoscale conductivity variations can produce meaningful changes in E-fields and neural activation thresholds but remain largely absent from standard macroscopic models. Recent microscopic models have suggested substantial local E-field perturbations and could, in principle, inform mesoscale conductivity. However, the quantitative validity of microscopic models is limited by fixation-related tissue distortion and incomplete extracellular-space reconstruction. We outline approaches that bridge macro- and microscales to derive consistent mesoscale conductivity distributions, providing a foundation for accurate multiscale models of E-fields and neural activation in brain stimulation.</description>

      <title>Investigating the Role of pH and Counterions in the Intrinsic Fluorescence of Solid-State L-Lysine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19241v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There is currently a growing interest in understanding the origins of intrinsic fluorescence as a way to design non-invasive probes for biophysical processes. In this regard, understanding how pH influences fluorescence in non-aromatic biomolecular assemblies is key to controlling their optical properties in realistic cellular conditions. Here, we combine experiments and theory to investigate the pH-dependent emission of solid-state L-Lysine (Lys). Lys aggregates prepared at different pH values using HCl and H$_2$SO$_4$ exhibit protonation- and counterion-dependent morphology and fluorescence, as shown by microscopy and steady-state measurements. We find an enhancement in the fluorescence moving from acidic to basic conditions. To uncover the molecular origin of these trends, we performed non-adiabatic molecular dynamics simulations on three Lys crystal models representing distinct protonation states. Our simulations indicate that enhanced protonation under acidic conditions facilitates non-radiative decay via proton transfer, whereas basic conditions favor radiative decay. Our combined experimental-theoretical work highlights pH and counterion identity as key factors tuning fluorescence in Lys assemblies, offering insights for designing pH responsive optical materials based on non-aromatic amino acids.</description>

      <title>Depth-enhanced molecular imaging with two-photon oblique plane microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09462v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: High-numerical-aperture (NA) oblique plane microscopy enables noninvasive fluorescence imaging of subcellular dynamics without requiring radical sample modification. However, performance degrades at depth in multicellular specimens as scattering and refractive-index heterogeneity raise out-of-focus background. We report a two-photon oblique plane microscope that improves resolution at depth by combining high-NA single-objective detection with multiphoton plane illumination. The microscope achieves $\sim\!300$ nm lateral and $\sim\!650$ nm axial resolution, with single-molecule sensitivity in vivo. Compared with two-photon point scanning, the lower illumination NA delivers an order of magnitude lower peak intensity, enabling $&gt;\!5\times$ faster volumetric acquisition (up to $3.25 \times 10^6$ voxels s$^{-1}$) with reduced photodamage. In multicellular contexts, near-infrared nonlinear excitation enhances contrast throughout the illumination depth by $\sim\!2\times$ and restores volumetric resolving power by $&gt;\!2\times$ relative to linear excitation. We demonstrate these capabilities through molecular imaging of epithelial tissue, stem-cell-derived gastruloids, and living fruit fly embryos, including multicolor transcription-factor dynamics, optogenetic subcellular control, and single-mRNA tracking, all using standard glass-based mounting.</description>
