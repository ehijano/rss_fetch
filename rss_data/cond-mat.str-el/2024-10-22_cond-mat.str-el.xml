      <title>Intrinsic Thermal Hall Effect in Mott Insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In light of recent experimental data indicating a substantial thermal Hall effect in square lattice antiferromagnetic Mott insulators, we investigate whether a simple Mott insulator can sustain a finite thermal Hall effect. We verify that the answer is "no" if one performs calculations within a spin-only low-energy effective spin model with non-interacting magnons. However, by performing determinant quantum Monte Carlo simulations, we show the single-band $t$-$t'$-$U$ Hubbard model coupled to an orbital magnetic field does support a finite thermal Hall effect when $t' \neq 0$ and $B \neq 0$ in the Mott insulating phase. We argue that the (carrier agnostic) necessary conditions for observing a finite thermal Hall effect are time-reversal and particle-hole symmetry breaking. By considering magnon-magnon scattering using a semi-classical Boltzmann analysis, we illustrate a physical mechanism by which finite transverse thermal conductivity may arise, consistent with our symmetry argument and numerical results. Our results contradict the conventional wisdom that square and triangular lattices with SU(2) symmetry do not support a finite thermal Hall effect and call for a critical re-examination of thermal Hall effect data in insulating magnets, as the magnon contribution should not be excluded a priori.</description>

      <title>Electronic and magnetic properties of LaCu$_{x}$Sb$_{2}$ tuned by Cu occupancy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report thermodynamic and transport properties of LaCu$_{x}$Sb$_{2}$ ($0.92 \leq x \leq 1.12$), synthesized by controlling the initial loading composition and investigated by magnetization, electrical resistivity, and specific heat measurements. The physical properties of this system are highly dependent on Cu-site occupancy $x$, where residual resistivity ratio (RRR), magnetoresistance (MR), superconducting transition temperature ($T_{c}$), and electronic specific heat coefficient ($\gamma$) indicate a systematic variation as a function of $x$. The Shubnikov-de Haas quantum oscillations are observed in magnetoresistance measurements for samples close to the Cu stoichiometry $x \sim 1$, while the de Haas-van Alphen oscillations are detected in a wide range of $x$ ($0.92 \leq x \le 1.12$). For $H \parallel c$, the oscillation frequency indicates a clear $x$-dependence, implying a systematic change of Fermi surface. DFT calculations for the sample closest to ideal Cu stoichiometry reveal electronic structures with a common feature of the square-net-based semimetals, which is in good agreement with the experimental observations. The magnetic response of LaCu$_{x}$Sb$_{2}$ to magnetic fields is anisotropic owing to the Fermi surface anisotropy. Our results show how the physical properties are influenced by the Cu-site occupancy $x$, linked to the electronic bands arising from the Sb square net.</description>

      <title>Predicting Fractionalized Multi-Spin Excitations in Resonant Inelastic X-ray Spectra of Frustrated Spin-1/2 Trimer Chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (RIXS) spectra in a quasi-1D chain of weakly coupled frustrated spin-1/2 trimers, as realized in Na$_{2}$Cu$_{3}$Ge$_{4}$O$_{12}$, with Cu $d^{9}$ 1/2 spins. We compute multi-spin correlations contributing to spin-conserving (SC) and spin non-conserving (NSC) RIXS cross-sections using ultra-short core-hole lifetime expansion within the Kramer-Heisenberg formalism. These excitations involve flipping spins of up to three spin-1/2 trimers and include the inelastic neutron scattering (INS) single spin-flip excitations in the lowest order of the NSC channel. We identify the fractionalization of two coupled frustrated trimers in terms of spinons, doublons, and quartons in the spectra evaluated using exact diagonalization, complementing prior studies single spin-spin flip excitation in inelastic neutron scattering. Specifically, we uncover two new high-energy modes at $\omega \approx 2.4J_1$ and $3.0 J_1$ in the NSC and SC channels that are accessible at the Cu $K$-edge and $L$-edge RIXS spectra, which were missing in the INS study. This, therefore, provides pathways to uncover all the possible excitations in coupled trimers. Our work opens new opportunities for understanding the nature of fractionalization and RIXS spectra of frustrated, low-dimensional spin chains.</description>

      <title>Moment method and continued fraction expansion in Floquet Operator Krylov Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15223v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recursion methods such as Krylov techniques map complex dynamics to an effective non-interacting problem in one dimension. For example, the operator Krylov space for Floquet dynamics can be mapped to the dynamics of an edge operator of the one-dimensional Floquet inhomogeneous transverse field Ising model (ITFIM), where the latter, after a Jordan-Wigner transformation, is a Floquet model of non-interacting Majorana fermions, and the couplings correspond to Krylov angles. We present an application of this showing that a moment method exists where given an autocorrelation function, one can construct the corresponding Krylov angles, and from that the corresponding Floquet-ITFIM. Consequently, when no solutions for the Krylov angles are obtained, it indicates that the autocorrelation is not generated by unitary dynamics. We highlight this by studying certain special cases: stable $m$-periodic dynamics derived using the method of continued fractions, exponentially decaying and power-law decaying stroboscopic dynamics. Remarkably, our examples of stable $m$-periodic dynamics correspond to $m$-period edge modes for the Floquet-ITFIM where deep in the chain, the couplings correspond to a critical phase. Our results pave the way to engineer Floquet systems with desired properties of edge modes and also provide examples of persistent edge modes in gapless Floquet systems.</description>

      <title>Emerging quantum critical phase in a cluster spin-glass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15261v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic frustration has been recognized as pivotal to investigating new phases of matter in correlation-driven Kondo breakdown quantum phase transitions that are not clearly associated with broken symmetry. The nature of these new phases, however, remains underexplored. Here, we report quantum criticalities emerging from a cluster spin-glass in the heavy-fermion metal TiFe$_x$Cu$_{2x-1}$Sb, where frustration originates from intrinsic disorder. Specific heat and magnetic Gr\"uneisen parameter measurements under varying magnetic fields exhibit quantum critical scaling, indicating a quantum critical point near 0.13 Tesla. As the magnetic field increases, the cluster spin-glass phase is progressively suppressed. Upon crossing the quantum critical point, resistivity and Hall effect measurements reveal enhanced screening of local moments and an expanding Fermi surface, consistent with the Kondo breakdown scenario.</description>

      <title>Electronic correlations and spin-charge-density stripes in double-layer La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15298v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using \emph{ab initio} band structure and DFT+dynamical mean-field theory methods we examine the effects of electron-electron interactions on the electronic structure, magnetic state, and structural phase stability of the recently discovered double-layer perovskite superconductor La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ (LNO) under pressure. Our results show the emergence of a double spin-charge-density stripe state characterized by a wave vector ${\bf q}=(\frac{1}{4},\frac{1}{4})$ arrangement of the nominally high-spin Ni$^{2+}_\mathrm{A}$ and low-spin Ni$^{3+}_\mathrm{B}$ ions (diagonal hole stripes oriented at $45^\circ$ to the Ni-O bond) which form zigzag ferromagnetic chains alternating in the $ab$ plane. The phase transition is accompanied by cooperative breathing-mode distortions of the lattice structure and leads to a reconstruction of the low-energy electronic structure and magnetic properties of LNO. We obtain a narrow-gap correlated insulator with a band gap value of $\sim$0.2 eV characterized by strong localization of the Ni $3d$ states and significant spin-orbital polarizations of the charge deficient Ni$^{3+}_\mathrm{B}$ ions. Our results suggest the importance of double exchange to determine the magnetic properties of LNO, similarly to that in charge-ordered manganites. We propose that spin and charge stripe fluctuations play an important role to tune superconductivity in LNO under pressure.</description>

      <title>Kondo Compensation in a Pseudogap Phase: a Renormalization Group Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the critical behavior of the Kondo compensation in the presence of a power-law pseudogap in the density of states, $\varrho(\omega)\sim |\omega|^\epsilon$. For $\epsilon&lt;1$, this model exhibits a quantum phase transition from a partially screened doublet ground state to a fully screened many-body singlet ground state with increasing Kondo coupling, $j$. At the critical point, $j_c$, the Kondo compensation is found to scale as $\kappa(j&lt;j_c) = 1- g(j)$ with the local $g$-factor vanishing as $g \sim |j-j_c|^\beta$. We combine perturbative drone fermion method with non-perturbative NRG computations to determine the critical exponent $\beta (\epsilon)$, which exhibits a non-monotonous behavior as a function of $\epsilon$. Our results confirm that the Kondo cloud builds up continuously in the presence of a weak pseudogap as one approaches the phase transition.</description>

      <title>Momentum-Resolved Fingerprint of Mottness in Layer-Dimerized Nb$_3$Br$_8$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16199v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a well-ordered crystalline solid, insulating behaviour can arise from two mechanisms: electrons can either scatter off a periodic potential, thus forming band gaps that can lead to a band insulator, or they localize due to strong interactions, resulting in a Mott insulator. For an even number of electrons per unit cell, either band- or Mott-insulators can theoretically occur. However, unambiguously identifying an unconventional Mott-insulator with an even number of electrons experimentally has remained a longstanding challenge due to the lack of a momentum-resolved fingerprint. This challenge has recently become pressing for the layer dimerized van der Waals compound Nb$_3$Br$_8$, which exhibits a puzzling magnetic field-free diode effect when used as a weak link in Josephson junctions, but has previously been considered to be a band-insulator. In this work, we present a unique momentum-resolved signature of a Mott-insulating phase in the spectral function of Nb$_3$Br$_8$: the top of the highest occupied band along the out-of-plane dimerization direction $k_z$ has a momentum space separation of $\Delta k_z=2\pi/d$, whereas the valence band maximum of a band insulator would be separated by less than $\Delta k_z=\pi/d$, where $d$ is the average spacing between the layers. As the strong electron correlations inherent in Mott insulators can lead to unconventional superconductivity, identifying Nb$_3$Br$_8$ as an unconventional Mott-insulator is crucial for understanding its apparent time-reversal symmetry breaking Josephson diode effect. Moreover, the momentum-resolved signature employed here could be used to detect quantum phase transition between band- and Mott-insulating phases in van der Waals heterostructures, where interlayer interactions and correlations can be easily tuned to drive such transition.</description>

      <title>Noise resilience in adaptive and symmetric monitored quantum circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14784v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Monitored quantum circuits offer great perspectives for exploring the interplay of quantum information and complex quantum dynamics. These systems could realize the extensively studied entanglement and purification phase transitions, as well as a rich variety of symmetry-protected and ordered non-equilibrium phases. The central question regarding such phases is whether they survive in real-world devices exhibiting unavoidable symmetry-breaking noise. We study the fate of the symmetry-protected absorbing state and charge-sharpening transitions in the presence of symmetry-breaking noise, and establish that the net effect of noise results in coherent and incoherent symmetry-breaking effects. The coherent contribution removes a sharp distinction between different phases and renders phase transitions to crossovers. Nevertheless, states far away from the original phase boundaries retain their essential character. In fact, corrective feedback in adaptive quantum circuits and postselected measurements in symmetric charge-conserving quantum circuits can suppress the effects of noise, thereby stabilizing the absorbing and charge-sharp phases, respectively. Despite the unavoidable noise in current quantum hardwares, our findings offer an optimistic outlook for observing symmetry-protected phases in currently available Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices. Moreover, our work suggests a symmetry-based benchmarking method as an alternative for characterizing noise and evaluating average local gate fidelity.</description>

      <title>Universal quantum computation using Ising anyons from a non-semisimple Topological Quantum Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14860v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a framework for topological quantum computation using newly discovered non-semisimple analogs of topological quantum field theories in 2+1 dimensions. These enhanced theories offer more powerful models for quantum computation. The conventional theory of Ising anyons, which is believed to describe excitations in the $\nu = 5/2$ fractional quantum Hall state, is not universal for quantum computation via braiding of quasiparticles. However, we show that the non-semisimple theory introduces new anyon types that extend the Ising framework. By adding just one new anyon type, universal quantum computation can be achieved through braiding alone. This result opens new avenues for realizing fault-tolerant quantum computing in topologically ordered systems.</description>

      <title>Inter-Cation Charge Transfer Mediated Antiferromagnetism in Co$_{1+x}$Ir$_{2-x}$S$_4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15327v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The antiferromagnetism in transition metal compounds is mostly mediated by the bridging anions through a so-called superexchange mechanism. However, in materials like normal spinels $AB_2X_4$ with local moments only at the $A$ site, such an anion-mediated superexchange needs to be modified. Here we report a new spinel compound Co$_{1+x}$Ir$_{2-x}$S$_4$ ($x$ = 0.3). The physical property measurements strongly suggest an antiferromagnetic-like transition at 292 K in the Co($A$) diamond sublattice. The first-principle calculations reveal that the nearest-neighbor Co($A$) spins align antiferromagnetically with an ordered magnetic moment of 1.67 $\mu_\mathrm{B}$, smaller than the expected $S = 3/2$ for Co$^{2+}$. In the antiferromagnetic state, there exists an inter-cation charge-transfer gap between the non-bonding Ir-$t_\mathrm{2g}$ orbitals at the valence band maximum and the Co-S antibonding molecular orbitals at the conduction band minimum. The small charge transfer energy significantly enhances the virtual hopping between these two states, facilitating a robust long-range superexchange interaction between two neighboring CoS$_4$ complexes, which accounts for the high N\'{e}el temperature in Co$_{1+x}$Ir$_{2-x}$S$_4$. This inter-cation charge transfer mediated magnetic interaction expands the traditional superexchange theory, which could be applicable in complex magnetic materials with multiple cations.</description>

      <title>Floquet-Enriched Nontrivial Topology at Quantum Criticality</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.15395v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Periodically driven (Floquet) systems have attracted growing attention due to the emergence of intriguing phenomena that are absent in equilibrium physics. In this letter, we identify a new class of Floquet criticality characterized by nontrivial topology. For generic driven Majorana fermion chains with chiral symmetry, we analytically demonstrate that Floquet driving can enrich the transition point, resulting in topologically distinct quantum critical lines that are absent in undriven systems. Furthermore, we provide an intuitive physical explanation for the underlying mechanism of the nontrivial topology at Floquet criticality and generalize our results to higher dimensions. This work not only extends the scope of topological physics in Floquet systems but also deepens our understanding of gapless topological phases of matter.</description>

      <title>Intertwined charge and spin density wave state of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15649v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Research on nickel-based superconductors has progressed from infinite-layer LaNiO$_2$ to finite-layer La$_{6}$Ni$_{5}$O$_{12}$, and most recently to the Ruddlesden-Popper-phase La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ discovered under pressure $\sim$16\,GPa, the system exhibits the onset of superconductivity at approximately $\sim$80\,K. Unlike the $d$-wave superconductivity driven by the nearly half-filled $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals in finite- and infinite-layers nickelates, the Ni-$d_{z^2}$ and O-2$p$ orbitals contribute significantly to the low energy states and potentially to the superconducting electron pairing mechanism. Employing density functional calculations and multi-orbital multi-atom Ni$_2$O$_9$ cluster exact diagonalization including local exchange and coulomb interactions, we delve into the pressure dependent electronic structure of the Ni$_2$O$_9$ cluster. We find that several possible charge and spin ordering states are nearly degenerate at ambient pressure but become strongly mixed leading to a more homogeneous phase at high pressure. The various possible spin states and the exchange and superexchange mechanisms are quantified via the involvement of the Ni-$3d_{3z^2-r^2}$ orbitals, the apical bridging O $2p_z$ orbitals, and the orbitals involved in the formation of local Zhang-Rice singlet like states. We note that the energy difference between the charge (CDW)/spin (SDW) density wave states and the uniform high pressure phase is about 10 meV in concordance with phase transition temperatures found experimentally at ambient pressure.</description>

      <title>Augmenting Finite Temperature Tensor Network with Clifford Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15709v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent studies have highlighted the combination of tensor network methods and the stabilizer formalism as a very effective framework for simulating quantum many-body systems, encompassing areas from ground state to time evolution simulations. In these approaches, the entanglement associated with stabilizers is transferred to Clifford circuits, which can be efficiently managed due to the Gottesman-Knill theorem. Consequently, only the non-stabilizerness entanglement needs to be handled, thereby reducing the computational resources required for accurate simulations of quantum many-body systems in tensor network related methods. In this work, we adapt this paradigm for finite temperature simulations in the framework of Time-Dependent Variational Principle, in which imaginary time evolution is performed using the purification scheme. Our numerical results on the one-dimensional Heisenberg model and the two-dimensional $J_1-J_2$ Heisenberg model demonstrate that Clifford circuits can significantly improve the efficiency and accuracy of finite temperature simulations for quantum many-body systems. This improvement not only provides a useful tool for calculating finite temperature properties of quantum many-body systems, but also paves the way for further advancements in boosting the finite temperature tensor network calculations with Clifford circuits and other quantum circuits.</description>

      <title>Controlling Orbital Ordering of Intergrowth Structures with Flat [Ag(II)F2] Layers to Mimic Oxocuprates(II)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15905v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Based on the Density Functional Theory calculations, we propose a new pathway toward compounds featuring flat [AgF2] layers which mimic [CuO2] layers in high-temperature oxocuprate superconductor precursors. Calculations predict the dynamic (phonon) and energetic stability of the new phases over diverse substrates. For some compounds with ferro orbital ordering, we find a gigantic intrasheet superexchange constant of up to minus 211 meV (DFT+U) and minus 256 meV (SCAN), calculated for hypothetical (CsMgF3)2KAgF3 intergrowth. Semiempirical calculations show that at optimum doping, the expected superconducting critical temperature should reach 200 K. The partial substitution of K+ with Ba2+ leads to noticeable electron doping of [AgF2] sublattice, as revealed by progressive population of the Upper-Hubbard band. On the other hand, modest 10 to 15% hole-doping through partial substitution of Mg2+ with Li+, primarily leads to the depopulation of p(z) orbitals of apical F atoms. We also find structures with an undesired antiferrodistortive structural ordering and discuss the structural factors that determine the transition from buckled to flat planes and from different types of orbital ordering using Landau theory of phase transitions.</description>

      <title>Hidden exceptional point, localization-delocalization phase transition in Hermitian bosonic Kitaev model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15967v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Exceptional points (EPs), a unique feature of non-Hermitian systems, represent degeneracies in non-Hermitian operators that likely do not occur in Hermitian systems. Nevertheless, unlike its fermionic counterpart, a Hermitian bosonic Kitaev model supports a non-Hermitian core matrix, involving a quantum phase transition (QPT) when an exceptional point appears. In this study, we examine QPTs by mapping the Hamiltonian onto a set of equivalent single-particle systems using a Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS)-like pairing basis. We demonstrate the connection between the hidden EP and the localization-delocalization transition in the equivalent systems. The result is applicable to a Dicke model, which allows the experimental detection of the transition based on the measurement of the average number of photons for the quench dynamics stating from the empty state. Numerical simulations of the time evolution reveal a clear transition point at the EP.</description>

      <title>Microscopic theory of spin friction and dissipative spin dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16003v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The real-time dynamics of local magnetic moments exchange coupled to a metallic system of conduction electrons is subject to dissipative friction even in the absence of spin-orbit coupling. Phenomenologically, this is usually described by a local Gilbert damping constant. Here, we use both linear response theory and adiabatic response theory to derive the spin friction microscopically for a generic single-band tight-binding model of the electronic structure. The resulting Gilbert damping is time-dependent and nonlocal. For a one-dimensional model, we compare the emergent relaxation dynamics as obtained from LRT and ART against each other and against the full solution of the microscopic equations of motion and demonstrate the importance of nonlocality, while the time dependence turns out to be irrelevant. In two dimensions and for a few magnetic moments in different geometries, it is found that the inclusion of nonlocal Gilbert damping can counterintuitively lead to longer relaxation times. Besides the distance dependence, the directional dependence of the nonlocal Gilbert damping turns out as very important. Our results are based on an expression relating the nonlocal Gilbert damping to the nonlocal tight-binding density of states close to the Fermi energy. This is exact in case of noninteracting electrons. Effects due to electronic correlations are studied within the random-phase approximation. For the Hubbard model at half filling and with increasing interaction strength, we find a strong enhancement of the nonlocality of spin friction.</description>

      <title>Cups and Gates I: Cohomology invariants and logical quantum operations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16250v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We take initial steps towards a general framework for constructing logical gates in general quantum CSS codes. Viewing CSS codes as cochain complexes, we observe that cohomology invariants naturally give rise to diagonal logical gates. We show that such invariants exist if the quantum code has a structure that relaxes certain properties of a differential graded algebra. We show how to equip quantum codes with such a structure by defining cup products on CSS codes. The logical gates obtained from this approach can be implemented by a constant-depth unitary circuit. In particular, we construct a $\Lambda$-fold cup product that can produce a logical operator in the $\Lambda$-th level of the Clifford hierarchy on $\Lambda$ copies of the same quantum code, which we call the copy-cup gate. For any desired $\Lambda$, we can construct several families of quantum codes that support gates in the $\Lambda$-th level with various asymptotic code parameters.</description>

      <title>Imaging supermoire relaxation and conductive domain walls in helical trilayer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16269v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In twisted van der Waals materials, local atomic relaxation can significantly alter the underlying electronic structure and properties. Characterizing the lattice reconstruction and the impact of strain is essential to better understand and harness the resulting emergent electronic states. Here, we use a scanning single-electron transistor to image spatial modulations in the electronic structure of helical trilayer graphene, demonstrating relaxation into a superstructure of large domains with uniform moire periodicity. We further show that the supermoire domain size is enhanced by strain and can even be altered in subsequent measurements of the same device, while nevertheless maintaining the same local electronic properties within each domain. Finally, we observe higher conductance at the boundaries between domains, consistent with the prediction that they host counter-propagating topological edge modes. Our work confirms that lattice relaxation can produce moire-periodic order in twisted multilayers, demonstrates strain-engineering as a viable path for designing topological networks at the supermoire scale, and paves the way to direct imaging of correlation-driven topological phases and boundary modes.</description>

      <title>Electronic Transport and Fermi Surface Topology of Zintl Phase Compound SrZn2Ge2</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.10621v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report a comprehensive study on the electronic transport properties of SrZn2Ge2 single crystals. The electrical resistivity of the compound exhibits metallic behavior, following a T^2 dependence below 35 K, consistent with the Fermi liquid behavior. However, a notable deviation is observed from this behavior at lower temperatures as a pronounced resistivity plateau emerges below 10 K. This plateau is remarkably robust, and persists under the magnetic fields of up to 10 T. Both the transverse and longitudinal magnetoresistance exhibit a crossover at critical field B* from weak-field quadratic-like to high-field unsaturated linear field dependence at low temperatures (T \leq 50 K). Possible sources of linear magnetoresistance are discussed based on the Fermi surface topology, classical and quantum transport models. The Hall resistivity data establish SrZn2Ge2 as a multiband system with contributions from both the electrons and holes. The Hall coefficient is observed to decrease with increasing temperature and magnetic field, changing its sign from positive to negative. The negative Hall coefficient observed at low temperatures in high fields and at high temperatures over the entire field range suggests that the highly mobile electron charge carriers dominate the electronic transport. Our first-principles calculations show that nontrivial topological surface states exist in SrZn2Ge2 within the bulk gap along the Gamma-M path. Notably, these surface states extend from the valence to conduction band with their number varying based on the Sr and Ge termination plane. The Fermi surface of the compound exhibits a distinct tetragonal petal-like structure, with one open and several closed surfaces. Overall, these findings offer crucial insights into the mechanisms underlying the electronic transport of the compound.</description>

Abstract: Orbital magnetism arises due to the coherent cyclotron motion of band electrons. System-bath entanglement is expected to disrupt this coherent electronic motion and quench orbital magnetism. Here, we show that a suitably-tailored bath can lead to an enhancement of the orbital diamagnetic susceptibility of a multi-band electron system and can even convert an orbital paramagnetic response into a diamagnetic one as the system-bath coupling is increased. We also demonstrate how a van Hove singularity in the bath density of states can be exploited to generate a giant enhancement of the orbital magnetic susceptibility. Our work opens doors to the possibility of controlling the orbital magnetic response of band electron systems through bath engineering.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised Learning of Effective Quantum Impurity Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.13600v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generalized quantum impurity models -- which feature a few localized and strongly-correlated degrees of freedom coupled to itinerant conduction electrons -- describe diverse physical systems, from magnetic moments in metals to nanoelectronics quantum devices such as quantum dots or single-molecule transistors. Correlated materials can also be understood as self-consistent impurity models through dynamical mean field theory. Accurate simulation of such models is challenging, especially at low temperatures, due to many-body effects from electronic interactions, resulting in strong renormalization. In particular, the interplay between local impurity complexity and Kondo physics is highly nontrivial. A common approach, which we further develop in this work, is to consider instead a simpler effective impurity model that still captures the low-energy physics of interest. The mapping from bare to effective model is typically done perturbatively, but even this can be difficult for complex systems, and the resulting effective model parameters can anyway be quite inaccurate. Here we develop a non-perturbative, unsupervised machine learning approach to systematically obtain low-energy effective impurity-type models, based on the renormalization group framework. The method is shown to be general and flexible, as well as accurate and systematically improvable. We benchmark the method against exact results for the Anderson impurity model, and provide an outlook for more complex models beyond the reach of existing methods.</description>

Abstract: We use magnetometry, calorimetry, and high-resolution capacitive dilatometry, as well as single-crystal neutron diffraction to explore temperature-field phase diagram of the anisotropic honeycomb magnet BaCo$_2$(AsO$_4)_2$. Our data reveal four distinct ordered states observed for in-plane magnetic fields. Of particular interest is the narrow region between 0.51 and 0.55 T that separates the up-up-down order from the fully polarized state and coincides with the field range where signatures of the spin-liquid behavior have been reported. We show that magnetic Bragg peaks persist in this intermediate phase, thus ruling out its spin-liquid nature. However, the simultaneous nonmonotonic evolution of nuclear Bragg peaks suggests the involvement of the lattice, witnessed also in other regions of the phase diagram where large changes in the sample length are observed upon entering the magnetically ordered states. Our data highlight the importance of lattice effects in BaCo$_2$(AsO$_4)_2$.</description>

Abstract: Compass models provide insights into the properties of Mott-insulating materials that host bond-dependent anisotropic interactions between their pseudospin degrees of freedom. In this article, we explore the classical and quantum ground state properties of one such model relevant to certain layered perovskite materials akin to Ba$_2$IrO$_4$ - namely, the Heisenberg-compass model on the square lattice. We first investigate the ground state phase diagram of this model using classical Monte Carlo simulations. These reveal that the low temperature classical phase diagram is divided into six different classes of long-range ordered phases, including four phases that exhibit an order by disorder selection and two phases that are stabilized energetically. This model admits a special duality transformation, known as the Klein duality, conveniently allowing to map one region of coupling parameters onto another and constraining the phase diagram, and which we exploit in our study. From the analysis of the zero-point energy and the free energy of the spin waves, we find that order by quantum disorder at zero temperature and order by thermal disorder select the same orderings as those found from classical Monte Carlo simulations. We further investigate the quantum ground states of this model using numerical exact diagonalization on small clusters by exploiting the translational symmetry of the square lattice. We obtain a ground state phase diagram bearing close resemblance to that found from the classical analysis.</description>

      <title>Quantum Modelling of Magnetism in Strongly Correlated Materials: Evaluating Constrained DFT and the Hubbard Model for Y114</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.19343v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Transition-metal compounds represent a fascinating playground for exploring the intricate relationship between structural distortions, electronic properties, and magnetic behaviour, holding significant promise for technological advancements. Among these compounds, YBaCo$_4$O$_{7}$ (Y114) is attractive due to its manifestation of a ferrimagnetic component at low temperature intertwined with distortion effect due to the charge disproportionation on Co ions, exerting profound impact on its magnetic properties. In this perspective paper, we study the structural and magnetic intricacies of the Y114 crystal using a novel first-principles methodology. Traditionally, the investigation of such materials has relied heavily on computational modelling using density-functional theory (DFT) with the on-site Coulomb interaction correction $U$ (DFT+$U$) based on the Hubbard model (sometimes including Hund's exchange coupling parameter $J$, DFT+$U$+$J$) to unravel their complexities. Herein, we analysed the spurious effects of magnetic-moment delocalisation and spillover to non-magnetic ions in the lattice on electronic structure and magnetic properties of Y114. To overcome this problem we have applied constrained DFT (cDFT) based on the potential self-consistency approach, and comprehensively explore the Y114 crystal's characteristics in its ferrimagnetic order. We find that cDFT yields magnetic moments of Co ions much closer to the experimental values than Hubbard model with the parameters $U$ and $J$ fitted to reproduce experimental lattice constants. cDFT allows for an accurate prediction of magnetic properties using oxidation states of magnetic ions as well-defined parameters. Through this perspective, we not only enhance our understanding of the magnetic interactions in Y114 crystal, but also pave the way for future investigations into magnetic materials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12357v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a framework to design concurrently a frustration-free quantum many-body Hamiltonian and its numerically exact ground states on a sufficiently large finite-size cluster in one and two dimensions using an elementary matrix product state (MPS) representation. Our approach strategically chooses a local cluster Hamiltonian, which is arranged to overlap with neighboring clusters on a designed lattice. The frustration-free Hamiltonian is given as the sum of the cluster Hamiltonians by ensuring that there exists a state that has its local submanifolds as the lowest-energy eigenstate of every cluster. The key to find such a solution is a systematic protocol, which projects out excited states on every cluster using MPS and effectively entangles the cluster states. The protocol offers several advantages, including the ability to achieve exact many-body ground-state solutions at nearly equal cost in one and two dimensions, those belonging to gapless or long-range entangled classes of ground states, flexibility in designing Hamiltonians unbiasedly across various forms of models, and numerically feasible validation through energy calculations. Our protocol offers the exact ground state for general frustration-free Hamiltonian, and enables the exploration of exact phase boundaries and the analysis of even a spatially nonuniform random system, providing platforms for quantum simulations and benchmarks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11881v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: URhGe is a ferromagnetic superconductor with a distinctive magnetic behavior. In a field applied parallel to the b-axis and perpendicular to the easy axis, URhGe exhibits an abrupt orientational transition of the magnetization with a reentrant superconducting phase emerging close to the transition field. We develop a theoretical description of the magnetic properties of URhGe by considering a spin model with competing magnetic anisotropies. The model is analyzed both analytically at zero temperature and with Monte Carlo simulations at finite temperatures. The constructed H-T phase diagram for a magnetic field parallel to the b-axis features a tricritical point on the line of phase transitions between the ferromagnetic Ising state and the paramagnetic phase. We also demonstrate that the asymptotic tricritical behavior of the order parameter and the correlation length is described by the mean-field critical exponents.</description>

      <title>Testing the tomographic Fermi liquid hypothesis with high-order cyclotron resonance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05147v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent theoretical studies of carrier-carrier scattering in degenerate two-dimensional systems have revealed radically different relaxation times for odd and even angular harmonics of distribution function. This theoretical concept, dubbed as 'tomographic Fermi liquid', is yet challenging to test with dc electrical measurements as electron scattering weakly affects the electrical resistivity. Here, we show that linewidth and amplitude of electromagnetic absorption at the multiple harmonics of the cyclotron resonance carries all necessary information to test the tomographic Fermi liquid hypothesis. Namely, the height and inverse width of $m$-th order cyclotron resonance ($m \ge 2$) is proportional to the lifetime of $m$-th angular harmonic of electron distribution function $\tau_m$, if probed at wavelengths exceeding the cyclotron radius $R_c$. Measurements of high-order cyclotron resonance at short wavelengths order of $R_c$ also enable a direct determination of all lifetimes $\tau_m$ from a simple linear system of equations that we hereby derive. Extraction of cyclotron resonance lifetimes from an experiment on terahertz photoconductivity in graphene shows that third-order resonance is systematically narrower than second-order one, supporting the prediction of tomographic Fermi liquid hypothesis.</description>

      <title>Quantum dynamics in a spin-1/2 square lattice $J_{1}$-$J_{2}$-$\delta$ altermagnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06955v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A key feature of the newly discovered altermagnet is that its spin degeneracy is lifted, although it has an antiferromagnetic order and zero net magnetization. In this work, we investigate a frustrated spin-1/2 $J_1$-$J_2$-$\delta$ Heisenberg model on the square lattice by the tensor network methodin combination with the linear spin-wave theory, with our focus on both the magnon excitations and longitudinal excitations.For a small $J_2$ and a finite range of $\delta$ we demonstrate that such a model hosts an altermagnetic ground state. Its magnon spectrum is split into two branches and the largest splitting occurs at $\left(\pm\pi/2, \pm\pi/2\right)$ in the Brillouin zone. The magnitudes of splitting in the two magnon modes are equal with respect to the case of $\delta=0$. Dynamical spin structure factors show that the low-energy peak in the longitudinal spectral weight around $(\pi/2, \pi/2)$ is also split, and thus the relative positions of the magnon modes and longitudinal modes in energy may change in the presence of a finite $\delta$. These findings demonstrate that the altermagnets harbor more complex quantum dynamics than the conventional collinear antiferromagnets.</description>

      <title>Problem-tailored Simulation of Energy Transport on Noisy Quantum Computers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.03924v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The transport of conserved quantities like spin and charge is fundamental to characterizing the behavior of quantum many-body systems. Numerically simulating such dynamics is generically challenging, which motivates the consideration of quantum computing strategies. However, the relatively high gate errors and limited coherence times of today's quantum computers pose their own challenge, highlighting the need to be frugal with quantum resources. In this work we report simulations on quantum hardware of infinite-temperature energy transport in the mixed-field Ising chain, a paradigmatic many-body system that can exhibit a range of transport behaviors at intermediate times. We consider a chain with $L=12$ sites and find results broadly consistent with those from ideal circuit simulators over 90 Trotter steps, containing up to 990 entangling gates. To obtain these results, we use two key problem-tailored insights. First, we identify a convenient basis$\unicode{x2013}$the Pauli $Y$ basis$\unicode{x2013}$in which to sample the infinite-temperature trace and provide theoretical and numerical justifications for its efficiency relative to, e.g., the computational basis. Second, in addition to a variety of problem-agnostic error mitigation strategies, we employ a renormalization strategy that compensates for global nonconservation of energy due to device noise. We discuss the applicability of the proposed sampling approach beyond the mixed-field Ising chain and formulate a variational method to search for a sampling basis with small sample-to-sample fluctuations for an arbitrary Hamiltonian. This opens the door to applying these techniques in more general models.</description>

      <title>Observation of the non-Hermitian skin effect and Fermi skin on a digital quantum computer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.10143v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Non-Hermitian physics has attracted considerable attention in recent years, particularly the non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) for its extreme sensitivity and non-locality. While the NHSE has been physically observed in various classical metamaterials and even ultracold atomic arrays, its highly-nontrivial implications in many-body dynamics have never been experimentally investigated. In this work, we report the first observation of the NHSE on a universal quantum processor, as well as its characteristic but elusive Fermi skin from many-fermion statistics. To implement NHSE dynamics on a quantum computer, the effective time-evolution circuit not only needs to be non-reciprocal and non-unitary but must also be scaled up to a sufficient number of lattice qubits to achieve spatial non-locality. We show how such a non-unitary operation can be systematically realized by post-selecting multiple ancilla qubits, as demonstrated through two paradigmatic non-reciprocal models on a noisy IBM quantum processor, with clear signatures of asymmetric spatial propagation and many-body Fermi skin accumulation. To minimize errors from inevitable device noise, time evolution is performed using a trainable, optimized quantum circuit produced with variational quantum algorithms. Our study represents a critical milestone in the quantum simulation of non-Hermitian lattice phenomena on present-day quantum computers and can be readily generalized to more sophisticated many-body models with the remarkable programmability of quantum computers.</description>

Abstract: Field transformations for the quantum effective action lead to different pictures of a given physical situation, as describing a given evolution of the universe by different geometries. Field transformations for functional flow equations can reveal important physical features, as the appearance of bound states. They also allow for technical simplifications. We make a critical assessment of the virtues and shortcomings of different versions of field transformations. Key issues are demonstrated by the quantum field theory for scalars with a field-dependent coefficient of the kinetic term. Our findings confirm the principle of field relativity for gravity and cosmology based on the quantum effective action.</description>

      <title>Quasiparticle scattering interference in cuprate superconductors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.07122v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The quasiparticle scattering interference (QSI) is intimately related to the nature of the quasiparticle and of its interplay with a variety of electronic orders and superconductivity. Here starting from the microscopic octet scattering model, the nature of QSI in cuprate superconductors is studied in the $T$-matrix approach. In particular, a new method of the inversion of matrix is developed to accurately derive the $T$-matrix for various kinds of impurities, and then the obtained $T$-matrix is employed to calculate the local density of states (LDOS). It is shown that the overall features of the LDOS modulation can be described qualitatively by taking into account the quasiparticle scattering from a single impurity on the kinetic-energy-driven homogeneous superconducting-state, where the QSI scattering wave vectors ${\bf q}_{i}$ and the related QSI peak dispersions are internally consistent within the octet scattering model. However, the pronounced QSI peaks in the momentum-space LDOS modulation pattern for a single impurity are smeared heavily in the case for multiple impurities, and then the momentum-space LDOS modulation for multiple impurities exhibits a speckle pattern. Moreover, the momentum-space LDOS modulation for Gaussian-random-distribution of on-site impurity at a relatively large deviation displays a similar behavior of the LDOS modulation for multiple impurities. The theory also indicates that the impurity weight linearly increases with the increase of the impurity-scattering strength for the weak scattering strength and tends to saturate in the strong scattering strength, while it decreases with the increase of the impurity-scattering screening length for the short screening-length and saturates in the long screening-length.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional quantum criticality</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02535v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum critical phenomena are widely studied across various materials families, from high temperature superconductors to magnetic insulators. They occur when a thermodynamic phase transition is suppressed to zero temperature as a function of some tuning parameter such as pressure or magnetic field. This generally yields a point of instability - a so-called quantum critical point - at which the phase transition is driven exclusively by quantum mechanical fluctuations. Here we show that the heavy fermion metamagnet UTe$_2$ possesses a quantum phase transition at extreme magnetic field strengths of over 70 T. Surprisingly, rather than terminating at one singular point, we find that the phase boundary is sensitive to magnetic field components in each of the three cartesian axes of magnetic field space. This results in the three-dimensional transition surface being bounded by a continuous ring of quantum critical points, the locus of which forms an extended line of quantum criticality - a novel form of quantum critical phase boundary. Within this quantum critical line sits an intensely field-resilient superconducting state in a striking toroidal shape, persisting to fields over 70 T. We model our data by a phenomenological free energy expansion, and show how a three-dimensional quantum critical phase boundary - rather than a more conventional singular point of instability - anchors the remarkable high magnetic field phase landscape of UTe$_2$.</description>

      <title>Probing electron quadrupling order through ultrasound</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03020v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent experiments have pointed to the formation of a new state of matter, the electron quadrupling condensate in Ba$_{1-x}$K$_x$Fe$_2$As$_2$. The state spontaneously breaks time-reversal symmetry and is sandwiched between two critical points, separating it from the superconducting and normal-metal states. We report a theory of the acoustic effects of systems with an electron quadrupling phase based on ultrasound-velocity measurements of Ba$_{1-x}$K$_x$Fe$_2$As$_2$ single crystals. The theoretical analysis suggests that the ultrasound data can be understood by considering a plain $s$+i$d_{xy}$ order parameter or an $s$+i$s$ order parameter with symmetry-breaking deformations in this material with enhanced nematic susceptibility for the [110] direction, or when the transition to the quartic state is a weakly first-order. Our work provides the theoretical basis and proposes the experimental strategy to study the order parameter symmetry of emerging quadrupling condensates in superconductors.</description>

Abstract: By implementing a charge pumping scheme for one-dimensional aperiodic chains, we confirm the existence of topological phases in these systems whenever their finite-size realizations admit inversion symmetry. These phases are usually characterized by an anomalous edge response as a result of the bulk-boundary correspondence. We show that these signatures are all present in various chains, each representing a different class of structural aperiodicity: the Fibonacci quasicrystal, the Tribonacci quasicrystal, and the Thue-Morse chain. More specifically, we calculate three quantities: the Berry phase of the crystalline approximation of the finite-size systems, the polarization response to an inifintesimal static and constant electric field in systems with open boundary conditions, and the degeneracy of the entanglement spectrum. We find that all of them provide signatures of a topologically nontrivial phase.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional mapping and electronic origin of large altermagnetic splitting near Fermi level in CrSb</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12575v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, a new kind of collinear magnetism, dubbed altermagnetism, has attracted considerable interests. A key characteristic of altermagnet is the momentum-dependent band and spin splitting without net magnetization. However, finding altermagnetic materials with large splitting near the Fermi level, which necessarily requires three-dimensional k-space mapping and is crucial for spintronic applications and emergent phenomena, remains challenging. Here by employing synchrotron-based angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), spin-resolved ARPES and model calculations, we uncover a large altermagnetic splitting, up to ~1.0 eV, near the Fermi level in CrSb. We verify its bulk-type g-wave altermagnetism through systematic three-dimensional k-space mapping, which unambiguously reveals the altermagnetic symmetry and associated nodal planes. The ARPES results are well captured by density functional theory calculations. Spin-resolved ARPES measurements further verify the spin polarizations of the split bands near Fermi level. In addition, tight-binding model analysis indicates that the large altermagnetic splitting arises from strong third-nearest-neighbor hopping mediated by Sb ions, which breaks both the space-time reversal symmetry and the translational spin-rotation symmetry. The large band/spin splitting near Fermi level in metallic CrSb, together with its high TN (up to 705 K) and simple spin configuration, paves the way for exploring emergent phenomena and spintronic applications based on altermagnets.</description>

Abstract: Absence of net magnetization in altermagnetis is both a blessing (no stray fields) and a curse (no obvious way to manipulate altermagnetic domains by external fields). Yet, MnTe was demonstrated experimentally to have no measurable stray fields and yet controllable by external magnetic filed - a win-win situation. In this paper we unravel the microscopic mechanism of this property. It appear to emerge from concerted action of three different mechanisms. Microscopic understanding of the beneficial properties of MnTe opens a road to controllable design of similar altermagnets for spintronics applications.</description>

      <title>Signatures of sliding Wigner crystals in bilayer graphene at zero and finite magnetic fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16628v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: AB-stacked bilayer graphene has emerged as a fascinating yet simple platform for exploring macroscopic quantum phenomena of correlated electrons. Unexpectedly, a phase with negative dR/dT has recently been observed when a large electric displacement field is applied and the charge carrier density is tuned to the vicinity of an ultra-low-density van Hove singularity. This phase exhibits features consistent with Wigner crystallization, including a characteristic temperature dependence and non-linear current bias behavior. However, more direct evidence for the emergence of an electron crystal in AB-stacked bilayer graphene at zero magnetic field remains elusive. Here we explore the low-frequency noise consistent with depinning and sliding of a Wigner crystal lattice. The current bias and frequency dependence of these noise spectra align well with findings from previous experimental and theoretical studies on the quantum electron solids. Our results offer transport signatures consistent with Wigner crystallization in AB-stacked bilayer graphene at zero and finite magnetic fields, paving the way for further substantiating an anomalous Hall crystal in its original form.</description>

      <title>Phonon Dephasing, Entanglement and Exchange-Only Toffoli Gate Sequence in Quantum Dot Spin Chains</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.14735v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The quantum dot spin chain system is vital for quantum simulation and studying collective electron behaviors, necessitating an understanding of its mechanisms and control protocols. Chapter 1 introduces key concepts, focusing on the extended Hubbard model, double quantum dot systems, and electron-phonon coupling. Chapter 2 explores electron-phonon coupling in multielectron double quantum dots under unbiased and biased scenarios via detuning variations. In the unbiased case, dephasing due to electron-phonon coupling generally increases with more electrons in the right dot; this trend is inconsistent in the biased case, suggesting potential advantages of multielectron quantum dots under certain conditions. Chapter 3 investigates entanglement entropy in a multielectron quantum dot spin chain described by the extended Hubbard model. Local and pairwise entanglement are influenced by Coulomb interactions, tunneling strengths, electronic configurations, and site potential energies. The entanglement diagram reveals phase transitions significantly impacted by coupling strength ratios and potential energy variations; adjusting the potential energy of a specific dot critically influences ground state configurations and entanglement entropy. Chapter 4, inspired by the decoherence-free subspace concept, explores operation sequences in a nine-spin, nine-quantum-dot system defined by the Heisenberg model, with bases determined by total angular momentum quantum numbers. Employing the Krotov method of quantum optimal control, we identify a more efficient pulse-level operation sequence for an exchange-only quantum dot spin chain, offering a superior alternative to conventional quantum gate decomposition and potentially enhancing the development of more concise quantum algorithm representations.</description>

Abstract: The entanglement entropy probing novel phases and phase transitions numerically via quantum Monte Carlo has made great achievements in large-scale interacting spin/boson systems. In contrast, the numerical exploration in interacting fermion systems is rare, even though fermion systems attract more attentions in condensed matter. The fundamental restrictions is that the computational cost of fermion quantum Monte Carlo ($\sim \beta N^3$) is much higher than that of spin/boson ($\sim \beta N$). To tackle the problem cumbersome existent methods of eantanglement entropy calculation, we propose a fermionic quantum Monte Carlo algorithm based on the incremental technique along physical parameters, which greatly improves the efficiency of extracting entanglement entropy. Taking a two-dimensional square lattice Hubbard model as an example, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm and show the high computation precision. In this simulation, the calculated scaling behavior of the entanglement entropy elucidates the different phases of the Fermi surface and Goldstone modes.</description>
