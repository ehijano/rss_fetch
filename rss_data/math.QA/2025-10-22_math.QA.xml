      <title>Representations of the Drinfeld doubles of Pointed rank one Hopf algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18216v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the representations of the Drinfeld doubles $D(H_{\mathcal{D}})$ of pointed rank one Hopf algebras $H_{\mathcal{D}}$ over an algebraically closed field $\Bbbk$ of characteristic zero. We provide a complete classification of all finite-dimensional indecomposable $D(H_{\mathcal{D}})$-modules up to isomorphism and explicitly describe the Auslander-Reiten sequences in the category of finite-dimensional $D(H_{\mathcal{D}})$-modules. We show that $D(H_{\mathcal{D}})$ is of tame representation type.</description>

      <title>Compactification of quasi-local algebras on the lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18021v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a compactification construction for abstract quasi-local C*-algebras over countable metric spaces equipped with an isometric group action which is functorial with respect to bounded spread isomorphisms. In $1$D, the construction recovers Ocneanu's Tube algebra for fusion spin chains, and provides a canonical bridge between infinite-volume observables and observables with periodic boundary conditions. We exploit this connection to derive an obstruction for the implementability of such topological symmetries as Kramers-Wannier type dualities on symmetric subalgebras.</description>

      <title>The hypergraph isomorphism game, Hopf algebras and Galois extensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18679v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop an algebraic and operational framework for quantum isomorphisms of hypergraphs, using tools from compact quantum group theory. We introduce a new synchronous version of the hypergraph isomorphism game whose game algebra uniformly encodes multiple notions of quantum isomorphisms of hypergraphs. We show that there exist hypergraphs that are quantum isomorphic but not classically isomorphic. For graphs, we show that the $*$-algebra of the hypergraph isomorphism game is a quotient of the $*$-algebra of the graph isomorphism game. We further prove that the hypergraph game algebra forms a bi-Galois extension over the quantum automorphism groups of the underlying hypergraphs. This allows us to deduce that the algebraic notion of a quantum isomorphism of hypergraphs coincides with the operational one coming from the existence of perfect quantum strategies. Viewing games themselves as hypergraphs, we analyze isomorphisms and the transfer of strategies within this setting. Finally, we construct a $*$-algebra whose representation theory characterizes distinct classes of quantum isomorphisms between non-local games.</description>

      <title>On the cabling of non-involutive set-theoretic solutions of the Yang--Baxter equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23821v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We extend the cabling method by Lebed, Ram\'irez and Vendramin from involutive to bijective non-degenerate set-theoretic solutions of the Yang--Baxter equation by working in the Yang--Baxter monoid $M(X,r)$ rather than the group $G(X,r)$. This shift in approach overcomes the obstruction that, for non-involutive solutions, the canonical map from $X$ to the Yang--Baxter group $G(X,r)$ need not be injective and yields a well-defined cabling. We prove that cabling is functorial on biquandles and that the diagonal map transforms as $q\mapsto q^k$. We also show that decomposability is preserved by injectivization and by passing to the associated biquandle, allowing us to work within that class without loss of generality. This leads to criteria for (in)decomposability. As an application, we obtain that square-free solutions with nilpotent derived monoid are decomposable.</description>

      <title>A cohomology theory of supercommutative algebras and grading-restricted vertex superalgebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17293v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper constructs the cohomology theory for grading-restricted vertex superalgebras, generalizing Yi-Zhi Huang's cohomology theory of grading-restricted vertex algebras. To simplify the discussion, motivate the construction, and make it easier for the reader to understand the technical points, we also include the construction of the cohomology theory of supercommutative associative algebras, a generalization of the Harrison cohomology theory of a commutative algebra that has not been explicitly written down. The paper will serve as the foundation for many subsequent studies, especially, the deformation theory of vertex superalgebras.</description>

      <title>Based morphisms for characters of quantum symmetric pairs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17655v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study based one-dimensional modules of quantum symmetric pairs over the field $\mathbb{Q}(q)$. We provide a complete classification of one-dimensional $\mathbf{B}$-modules that appear as submodules of simple finite-dimensional based $\mathbf{U}$-modules and determine the corresponding branching rules. The main result of this paper shows that the corresponding projections are morphisms of based $\mathbf{B}$-modules. To this end we characterize one-dimensional modules at $q=\infty$, thus developing a $\imath$crystal basis theory for these modules. This is then applied to show compatibility with the integral forms of the (dual-)canonical basis.</description>

      <title>Universal K-matrices for quantum Kac-Moody algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.09218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2007.09218v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of a cylindrical bialgebra, which is a quasitriangular bialgebra $H$ endowed with a universal K-matrix, i.e., a universal solution of a generalized reflection equation, yielding an action of cylindrical braid groups on tensor products of its representations. We prove that new examples of such universal K-matrices arise from quantum symmetric pairs of Kac-Moody type and depend upon the choice of a pair of generalized Satake diagrams. In finite type, this yields a refinement of a result obtained by Balagovi\'c and Kolb, producing a family of non-equivalent solutions interpolating between the quasi-K-matrix originally due to Bao and Wang and the full universal K-matrix. Finally, we prove that this construction yields formal solutions of the generalized reflection equation with a spectral parameter in the case of finite-dimensional representations over the quantum affine algebra $U_qL\mathfrak{sl}_2$.</description>

      <title>Trigonometric K-matrices for finite-dimensional representations of quantum affine algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.16503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.16503v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\mathfrak{g}$ be a complex simple Lie algebra and $U_q(\hat{\mathfrak{g}})$ the corresponding quantum affine algebra. We prove that every irreducible finite-dimensional $U_q(\hat{\mathfrak{g}})$-module gives rise to a family of trigonometric solutions of Cherednik's generalized reflection equation. These depend upon the choice of a quantum affine symmetric pair $U_q(\mathfrak{k})\subset U_q(\hat{\mathfrak{g}})$. Our result relies on the construction of universal K-matrices for arbitrary quantum symmetric pairs, obtained in our previous work, as well as the fact that every irreducible $U_q(\hat{\mathfrak{g}})$-module is generically irreducible under restriction to $U_q({\mathfrak{k}})$. In the case of small modules and Kirillov-Reshetikhin modules, we obtain new solutions of the standard and the transposed reflection equations.</description>

      <title>Equivalence of field theories: Crane-Yetter and the shadow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.04570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.04570v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work solves a 28-year conjecture by showing that two major invariants of smooth 4-manifolds, the shadow model (motivated by statistical mechanics [Tur91]) and the simplicial Crane-Yetter model (motivated by topological quantum field theory [CY93]), are in fact equal.
  These invariants, both of which degenerate to the 3D Witten-Reshetikhin-Turaev model in a special case, had been open for years to clarify their relationship. Despite the seeming difference in their origins and formal constructions, we prove their equivalence. Along the way, we sketch a dictionary between the two models, provide a brief survey of the shadow construction \`a la Turaev, and suggest once again that the semisimple models have reached their limits.</description>

      <title>The Many Faces of Non-invertible Symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18072v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the interplay between algebraic and categorical notions of non-invertible symmetries. In particular, a fusion categorical symmetry $\mathcal{C}$ is shown to induce an algebraic symmetry encoded in a weak Hopf algebra $H$ which is Tannaka-Krein dual to $\mathcal{C}$ in the sense that $\mathcal{C} = \text{Rep}(H^*)$. The latter duality is not unique, and consequently the algebraic symmetry acts on an extended system relative to the categorical one. We present an approach to analyzing the symmetry breaking patterns of weak Hopf algebraic non-invertible symmetries. The central ingredient is a certain conditional expectation, which serves as the analog of a group averaging map for a non-invertible symmetry. The index of this conditional expectation emerges as a quantum information theoretic quantity that determines the extent to which the underlying symmetry can be broken. Ambiguities which ensue from the non-uniqueness of the categorical reconstruction lead to distinct properties of symmetry breaking compared to the invertible case. Finally, we exemplify our approach through topological and conformal quantum field theories in which non-invertible symmetries are naturally interpreted as defect operators and boundary conditions.</description>
