      <title>Quantifying Imaginarity in Neutrino Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01871v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is a fundamental question why quantum mechanics employs complex numbers rather than solely real numbers. In this letter, we conduct the first analysis of imaginarity quantification in neutrino flavor and spin-flavor oscillations. As quantum systems in coherent superposition, neutrinos are ideal candidates for quantifying imaginarity within the resource theoretic framework, using measures such as the $\ell_1$-norm and the relative entropy of imaginarity. Our findings reveal that even in the case of two-flavor mixing, these measures of imaginarity are nonzero. The measures of imaginarity reach their extreme values when the probabilistic features of quantum theory are fully maximized, i.e., both the transitional and survival probabilities are approximately equal, averaging around $1/2$. We further extend our analysis to explore the dynamics of three-flavor neutrino mixing, incorporating the effects of a nonzero CP phase. Our study reveals that the imaginarity in neutrino systems is not solely attributed to the CP-violating phase. More importantly, it can also arise from the intrinsic quantum dynamics of the neutrino mixing system itself.</description>

      <title>Long-lived vectors from electromagnetic cascades at SHiP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01880v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We simulate dark-vector, $V$, production from electromagnetic cascades at the recently approved SHiP experiment. The cascades (initiated by photons from $\pi^0\rightarrow \gamma \gamma$) can lead to 3-4 orders of magnitude increase of the event rate relative to using primary production alone. We provide new SHiP sensitivity projections for dark photons and electrophilic gauge bosons, which are significantly improved compared to previous literature. The main gain in sensitivity occurs for long-lived dark vectors with masses below $\sim 50-300~{\rm MeV}$. The dominant production mode in this parameter space is low-energy annihilation $e^+ e^- \rightarrow V(\gamma)$. This motivates a detailed study of backgrounds and efficiencies in the SHiP experiment for sub-GeV signals.</description>

      <title>Prospects for quantum process tomography at high energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01892v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In quantum information theory, the evolution of an open quantum system -- a unitary evolution followed by a measurement -- is described by a quantum channel or, more generally, a quantum instrument. In this work, we formulate spin and flavour measurements in collider experiments as a quantum instrument. We demonstrate that the Choi matrix, which completely determines input-output transitions, can be both theoretically computed from a given model and experimentally reconstructed from a set of final state measurements (quantum state tomography) using varied input states. The reconstruction of the Choi matrix, known as quantum process tomography, offers a powerful new approach for probing potential extensions of the Standard Model within the quantum field theory framework and also provides a fundamental test of quantum mechanics itself. As an example, we outline a quantum process tomography approach applied to the $e^+ e^- \to t \bar{t}$ process at a polarized lepton collider.</description>

      <title>Constraints on the malaphoric $B_3-L_2$ model from di-lepton resonance searches at the LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We confront the malaphoric $B_3-L_2$ model with bounds coming from a search for resonances in the di-lepton channels at the 13~TeV LHC. In contrast to the original $B_3-L_2$ model, the $Z^\prime$ of the malaphoric $B_3-L_2$ model has sizeable couplings to the lighter two families; these originate from order unity kinetic mixing with the hypercharge gauge boson and ameliorate the fit to lepton flavour universality measurements in $B-$meson decays. The $Z^\prime$ coupling to the first two families of quark means that the resulting constraints from resonant di-lepton searches are stronger. Nevertheless, we find that for $M_{Z^\prime}&gt;2.8$ TeV there remains a non-negligible region of allowed parameter space where the model significantly improves upon several Standard Model predictions for observables involving the $b \rightarrow s l^+ l^-$ transition. We estimate that the 3000 fb$^{-1}$ HL-LHC will extend this sensitivity to $M_{Z^\prime}= 4.2$ TeV.</description>

      <title>Deep-inelastic scattering with collider neutrinos at the LHC and beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02019v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Proton-proton collisions at the LHC generate high-intensity collimated beams of forward neutrinos up to TeV energies. Their recent observations and the initiation of a novel LHC neutrino program motivate investigations of this previously unexploited beam. The kinematic region for neutrino deep-inelastic scattering measurements at the LHC overlaps with that of the Electron-Ion Collider. The effect of the LHC $\nu$DIS data on parton distribution functions (PDFs) is assessed by generating projections for the Run 3 LHC experiments, and for select proposed detectors at the HL-LHC. Estimating their impact in global (n)PDF analyses reveals a significant reduction of PDF uncertainties, particularly for strange and valence quarks. Furthermore, the effect of neutrino flux uncertainties is examined by parametrizing the correlations between a broad selection of neutrino production predictions in forward hadron decays. This allows determination of the highest achievable precision for neutrino observations, and constraining physics within and beyond the Standard Model. This is demonstrated by setting bounds on effective theory operators, and discussing the prospects for an experimental confirmation of the enhanced strangeness scenario proposed to resolve the cosmic ray muon puzzle, using LHC data. Moreover, there is promise for a first measurement of neutrino tridents with a statistical significance exceeding 5$\sigma$.</description>

      <title>Multi-component secluded WIMP dark matter and Dirac neutrino masses with an extra Abelian gauge symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02027v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scenarios for secluded WIMP dark matter models have been extensively studied in simplified versions. This paper shows a complete UV realization of a secluded WIMP dark matter model with an extra Abelian gauge symmetry that includes two-component dark matter candidates, where the dark matter conversion process plays a significant role in determining the relic density in the Universe. The model contains two new unstable mediators: a dark Higgs and a dark photon. It generates Dirac neutrino masses and can be tested in future direct detection experiments of dark matter. The model is also compatible with cosmological and theoretical constraints, including the branching ratio of Standard model particles into invisible, Big Bang nucleosynthesis restrictions, and the number of relativistic degrees of freedom in the early Universe, even without kinetic mixing.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic interactions in elastic neutrino-nucleon scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A thorough account of electromagnetic interactions of massive Dirac neutrinos as well as their spin-flavor state in the theoretical formulation of elastic neutrino-nucleon scattering is given. The formalism of neutrino charge, magnetic, electric, and anapole form factors defined as matrices in the mass basis is employed under the assumption of three-neutrino mixing. The flavor and spin change of neutrinos propagating from the source to the detector is taken into account in the form of a spin-flavor density matrix of the neutrino arriving at the detector. The potential effects of the neutrino charge radii, magnetic moments, and spin polarization in the neutrino-nucleon scattering experiments are outlined.</description>

      <title>Remarks on strong phase shifts in weak nonleptonic baryon decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02170v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A sizable strong-interaction phase shift in weak two-body nonleptonic baryon decay would enhance the possibility of discovering charge-conjugation parity ($CP$) violation in the baryon sector, which might help in the quest for understanding the matter-antimatter asymmetry in the universe. Over the past 60 years, empirical analyses involving different types of instruments, including fixed-target experiments and $e^+e^-$ colliders, have indicated that the phase shifts in nonleptonic hyperon decays are relatively small, below order ten degrees in size. A large phase shift, however, has been observed by BESIII in the decay of a charmed baryon into a hyperon and kaon, $\Lambda_c^+\to \Xi^0K^+$. In various experimental and theoretical studies on hyperon, charmed-baryon, and bottomed-baryon decays, different conventions have been adopted for defining the strong phases. It is important to be aware of this situation when obtaining global averages from different measurements and applying the results to future investigations on $CP$ violation among baryons. This paper gives an overview of the conventions employed in the literature for the strong phases and suggests a unified parameterization form applicable to the different alternatives. Numerical results under the unified parameterization form are also provided, which can serve as useful inputs to further pursuits of baryon $CP$ violation.</description>

      <title>96 GeV Scalar Boson in the 2HDM with U(1)_H Gauge Symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02178v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study two Higgs doublet models with gauged U(1)_H symmetry, motivated by the excesses around 96 GeV reported by the CMS collaboration in the searches for light resonances decaying to two photons and two \tau's. In this model, one Higgs doublet field is charged under the U(1)_H symmetry to avoid tree-level flavor changing neutral currents. The extra gauge symmetry requires extra chiral fermions, to satisfy the anomaly-free conditions. We analyze the signals of the light resonances, taking into account the contribution of the extra fermions, and discuss the consistency with the experimental results in this model.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic polarizabilities of the spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ singly heavy baryons in heavy baryon chiral perturbation theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02297v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We calculate the electromagnetic polarizabilities of the spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ singly heavy baryons in the heavy baryon chiral perturbation theory up to $\mathcal{O}(p^3)$. We estimate the low-energy constants using the magnetic moments of singly charmed baryons from lattice QCD simulations and the experimental decay widths of $\Sigma_c$ and $\Sigma_c^*$. Our results indicate that the long-range chiral corrections make significant contributions to the polarizabilities. Additionally, the magnetic dipole transitions $\mathcal{B}_6^* \to \mathcal{B}_6 +\gamma $ also provide large contribution to the magnetic polarizabilities.</description>

      <title>Analysis of anomalous $H\gamma\gamma$ coupling in light-by-light collision at future muon collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, the process $\gamma\gamma \to \gamma\gamma$ is investigated to establish constraints on anomalous Higgs boson couplings at $H\gamma\gamma$ vertice within the framework of the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). The study is performed for a future muon collider operating at a CoM energy of 10 TeV with an integrated luminosity of 10 ab$^{-1}$, where the incoming photons are modeled using the Weizs\"acker-Williams approximation. Signal and background events are simulated using MadGraph, with the SMEFT Lagrangian implemented via FeynRules and UFO frameworks. Parton showering is evaluated with PYTHIA 8, and detector effects are accounted for using Delphes. Limits on the Wilson coefficients $\bar{c}_\gamma$ and $\tilde{c}_\gamma$ of the dim-6 operators are reported at the 95% confidence level, demonstrating the potential of a high-energy muon collider to provide precise constraints on these couplings and presenting a significant improvement over experimental and related phenomenological results.</description>

      <title>Deformed AdS/QCD, mesonic mass spectra, and DCE: Still a margin for heavier resonances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02375v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The mass spectra of light-flavor mesons are analyzed in a deformed AdS/QCD soft-wall model, driven by four distinct anomalous 5-dimensional mass corrections of the scalar field, coupled to Einstein--Hilbert gravity, from the QCD running coupling. Using the differential configurational entropy (DCE) underlying the families of pseudoscalar, axial-vector, scalar, and vector mesons, the mass spectra of heavier meson resonances with radial quantum numbers beyond the ones already in the summary table of Particle Data Group (PDG) are then estimated. This protocol merges AdS/QCD and experimental data in PDG through Regge-like trajectories. Some of the estimated meson resonances may be identified as further candidates omitted from the summary table in PDG.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02401v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It has long been understood that the inclusion of temperature in the perturbative treatment of quantum field theories leads to complications that are not present at zero temperature. In these proceedings we report on the non-perturbative obstructions that arise, and how these lead to deviations in the predictions of lattice scalar correlation functions in massive $\phi^{4}$ theory. Using the known non-perturbative spectral constraints satisfied by finite-temperature correlation functions we outline why the presence of distinct particle-like excitations could provide a resolution to these issues.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Waves as a Probe of Particle Dark Matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Galactic dark matter (DM) particles, having non-gravitational interactions with nucleons, can interact with stellar constituents and eventually become captured within stars. Over the lifetime of the celestial body, these non-annihilating, heavy DM particles may accumulate and eventually form a comparable stellar mass black hole (BH), referred to as a Transmuted Black Hole (TBH). We investigate how current gravitational wave (GW) experiments could detect such particle DM through the presence of low-mass TBHs, which cannot form via standard stellar evolution. Different stellar objects (compact and non-compact) provide laboratories across DM-nucleon interaction regimes, offering insight into DM's mass and its non-gravitational properties.</description>

      <title>Excited $\Omega$ hyperon in charmful $\Omega_b$ weak decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02464v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the sextet $b$-baryon decay processes $\Omega_b\to J/\psi\Omega^{(*)}$, where $\Omega^*$ represents the $1P$-, $1D$- and $2S$-wave excited $\Omega$ hyperons in the spectroscopy. Using the constituent quark model, we obtain ${\cal B}(\Omega_b \to J/\psi\Omega)=2.1\times 10^{-4}$, which agrees with the previous studies to the order of magnitude. By identifying $\Omega(2012)$ as $\Omega(1^2P_{3/2^-})$, ${\cal B}(\Omega_b \to J/\psi\Omega(2012))=2.7\times 10^{-4}$ can be similarly significant. Additionally, $\Omega(1^2D_{5/2^+})$ and $\Omega(1^4D_{3/2^+},1^4D_{5/2^+})$ states exhibit production rates of 0.6, and (0.7, 1.0), respectively, relative to their ground-state counterpart. Notably, our findings suggest that ${\cal B}(\Omega_b\to J/\psi\Omega(2^2S_{1/2^+},2^4S_{3/2^+}))$ are as large as $(1.2,5.1)\times 10^{-4}$, making them accessible to experiments at LHCb.</description>

      <title>Separation of left-handed and anomalous right-handed vector operators contributions into the Wtb vertex for single and double resonant top quark production processes using a neural network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02468v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper describes the application of deep neural networks for the searchdeviations from the Standard Model predictions at the Wtb vertex in the processes of single and double resonant top quark production with identical final state tWb. Monte-Carlo events preliminary classified by first level neural network as corresponding to single or double resonant top quark production are analyzed by two second level neural networks if there is a possible contribution of the anomalous right-handed vector operator into Wtb vertex or events are corresponded to the Standard Model. The second level neural networks are different for single and double resonant classes. The classes depend differently on anomalous contribution and such splitting leads to better sensitivity. The developed statistical model is used to set constraints on the anomalous right-handed vector operator at the Wtb vertex in different regions of phase space. It is demonstrated that the proposed method allows to increase the efficiency of a search for the anomalous contributions to the Wtb vertex.</description>

      <title>Determination of the Strong Coupling Constant $\alpha_s$ from Inclusive Semi-leptonic $B$ Meson Decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new methodology for determining the strong coupling constant, $\alpha_s$, from the inclusive semi-leptonic decay width of $B$ mesons. We express the semi-leptonic $B$ decay width as a function of $\alpha_s$(5 GeV), the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa matrix element $|V_{cb}|$, $b$- and $c$-quark masses in the $\overline{\mathrm{MS}}$ scheme. The method fixes the value of $|V_{cb}|$ according to the recent measurement from Belle based on exclusive $B$ decays and uses the PDG averages for the $b$- and $c$-quark masses. By fitting $\alpha_s(5\mathrm{\,GeV})$ to current world averages of the $B^{\pm}$ and $B^{0}$ semi-leptonic decay widths, the analysis obtains $\alpha_s(5\mathrm{\,GeV}) = 0.225 \pm 0.012$, corresponding to a 5-flavor extrapolation of $\alpha_s(m_{Z}) = 0.121 \pm 0.003$. Taking into account future results from higher-order perturbative QCD calculations, heavy quark masses derived from lattice QCD, and measurements of $|V_{cb}|$ as well as $B$ decay widths from upcoming $B$ and $Z$ factory data, this method could yield a determination of $\alpha_s(m_{Z})$ with a competitive precision of $\Delta\alpha_s(m_{Z}) \sim 0.0018$. This precision is comparable to the current accuracy of $\alpha_s(m_{Z})$ measurements from $\tau$ decays, which is regarded as the most precise approach.</description>

      <title>Particle production in the toy world: multiplicity distribution and entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02504v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we found the multiplicity distribution of the produced dipoles in the final state for dipole-dipole scattering in the zero dimension toy models. This distribution shows the great differences from the distributions of partons in the wave function of the projectile. However, in spite of this difference the entropy of the produced dipoles turns out to be the same as the entropy of the dipoles in the wave function. This fact is not surprising since in the parton approach only dipoles in the hadron wave function which can be produced at $t = +\infty$ and measured by the detectors. We can also confirm the result of Kharzeev and Levin that this entropy is equal to $S_E = \ln\bigl(xG(x)\bigr)$, where we denote by $xG$ the mean multiplicity of the dipoles in the deep inelastic scattering. The evolution equations for $\sigma_n$ are derived.</description>

      <title>Exploring Dark Photon Production and Kinetic Mixing Constraints in Heavy-Ion Collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vector $U$-bosons, often referred to as 'dark photons', are potential candidates for mediating dark matter interactions. In this study, we outline a procedure to derive theoretical constraints on the upper bound of the kinetic mixing parameter $\epsilon^2(M_U)$ using dilepton data from heavy-ion from SIS to RHIC energies. The analysis is based on the microscopic Parton-Hadron-String Dynamics (PHSD) transport model, which successfully reproduces the measured dilepton spectra in $p+p$, $p+A$, and $A+A$ collisions. Besides the dilepton channels resulting from interactions and decays of Standard Model particles (such as mesons and baryons), we extend the PHSD approach to include the decay of hypothetical $U$-bosons into dileptons, $U \to e^+ e^-$. The production of these $U$-bosons occurs via Dalitz decays of pions, $\eta$-mesons, $\omega$-mesons, Delta resonances, as well as from the decays of vector mesons and $K^+$ mesons. This analysis provides an upper limit on $\epsilon^2(M_U)$ and offers insights into the accuracy required for future experimental searches for dark photons through dilepton experiments.</description>

      <title>Bounds on Axions-Like Particles Shining in the Ultra-Violet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02543v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Axion-like particles (ALPs) can decay into two photons with a rest-frame frequency given by half of the ALP mass. This implies that ultra-violet searches can be used to investigate ALPs in the multi-eV mass range. We use archival data from the Hubble Space Telescope between 110 and 170 nm to constrain ALPs with mass between 14.4-22.2 eV. We consider observations of a set of dwarf spheroidal galaxies and galaxy clusters and assume the ALP density in these objects to follow their dark matter density. The derived limit on the ALP-photon coupling $g_{a\gamma}$ excludes values above $10^{-12}~{\rm GeV}^{-1}$ over the whole mass range and surpasses previous limits by over one order of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Anatomy of singlet-doublet dark matter relic: annihilation, co-annihilation, co-scattering, and freeze-in</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The singlet-doublet vector-like fermion dark matter model has been extensively studied in the literature over the past decade. An important parameter in this model is the singlet-doublet mixing angle ($\sin\theta$). All the previous studies have primarily focused on annihilation and co-annihilation processes for obtaining the correct dark matter relic density, assuming that the singlet and doublet components decouple at the same epoch. In this work, we demonstrate that this assumption holds only for larger mixing angles with a dependency on the mass of the dark matter. However, it badly fails for the mixing angle $\sin\theta&lt;0.05$. We present a systematic study of the parameter space of the singlet-doublet dark matter relic, incorporating annihilation, co-annihilation, and, for the first time, co-scattering processes. Additionally, the freeze-in parameter space is also explored. We found that due to the inclusion of co-scattering processes, the correct relic density parameter space is shifted towards the detection sensitivity range of the LHC and MATHUSLA via displaced vertex signatures.</description>

      <title>Heavy quark mass effects in the Energy-Energy Correlation in the back-to-back region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02629v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider heavy quark mass ($m$) effects in the Energy-Energy Correlation function in $e^+e^- \to hadrons$ at high energy $Q$, in the back-to-back (or two-jet) region. In the ultra-relativistic limit, $Q \gg m$, the QCD Sudakov form factor $S(b)$ in impact parameter ($b$-)space reads: %%% \begin{eqnarray} \log S(b) &amp;=&amp; -\int\limits_{m^2}^{Q^2} \frac{dk^2}{k^2} \left\{\log\left(\frac{Q^2}{k^2}\right) A\left[\alpha_S\left(k^2\right)\right] +B\left[\alpha_S\left(k^2\right)\right]\right\}\big[1-J_0\left(b k\right)\big] \nonumber\\ &amp;&amp;-\int\limits_0^{m^2}\frac{dk^2}{k^2}\left\{ \log\left(\frac{Q^2}{m^2}\right) A\left[\alpha_S\left(k^2\right)\right] +D\left[\alpha_S\left(k^2\right)\right] \right\}\big[1-J_0\left(b k\right) \big].\nonumber \end{eqnarray} %%% The double-log function $A(\alpha_S)$ describes the effects of soft gluons quasi-collinear to the original quark-antiquark pair, while the single-log functions $B(\alpha_S)$ and $D(\alpha_S)$ describe hard collinear gluons and soft gluons not log-collinearly enhanced respectively. The usual logarithmic expansion of the low transverse momenta contribution ($k^2&lt;m^2$) involves two new function series. An explicit evaluation of the heavy quark form factor up to Next-to-Leading Logarithmic (NLL) accuracy is presented. The relation of our results with the well-known (classical) dead-cone effect in gauge theories is analyzed and an improved formula for the dead cone is proposed. The dead-cone opening angle receives indeed quantum corrections, in each order of perturbation theory. At first order in QCD, $\mathcal{O}(\alpha_S)$, the opening angle is increased by a factor $\sqrt{e} \simeq 1.64872$. The generalization of the above formula to the resummation of shape variables in $e^+e^-$ annihilation, or the generalization to the resummation of the transverse momentum distributions in hadron collisions, is also briefly discussed.</description>

      <title>Gravitational waves from supercooled phase transitions in conformal Majoron models of neutrino mass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02645v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study supercooled first-order phase transitions above the QCD scale in a wide class of conformal Majoron-like U(1)' models that explain the totality of active neutrino oscillation data and produce a detectable stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) at LIGO, LISA and ET. We place constraints on the U(1)' breaking scale and gauge coupling using current LIGO-Virgo-Kagra data. We find that strong supercooling can be ruled out in large regions of parameter space if a SGWB is not detected by these experiments. A null signal at LIGO and ET will disfavor a type-I seesaw scale above $10^{14}$ GeV, while a positive signal is a signature of heavy right-handed neutrinos. On the other hand, LISA will be sensitive to seesaw scales as low as a TeV, and could detect a SGWB even if the right-handed neutrinos are decoupled.</description>

      <title>Interpreting the extremely diffuse stellar distribution of Nube galaxy through fuzzy dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01307v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent observations have revealed an unusual stellar distribution within the almost dark dwarf galaxy Nube. The galaxy exhibits a remarkably flat stellar distribution, with an effective radius of approximately 6.9 kpc, exceeding the typical size of dwarf galaxies and even surpassing that of ultra-diffuse galaxies (UDGs) with similar stellar masses. The dynamical heating effect of fuzzy dark matter (FDM) may offer an explanation for this extremely diffuse stellar distribution in Nube. In this research, we utilize simulation techniques to investigate this issue and find that a particle mass $\mathcal{O} (1)\times 10^{-23}$ eV offers a plausible explanation for this peculiar stellar distribution anomaly.</description>

      <title>High-energy interactions of charged black holes in full general relativity II: Near-extremal merger remnants and universality with the irreducible mass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01881v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a previous paper, arXiv:2411.11960 [gr-qc], we initiated a study of high-energy interactions of charged binary black holes near the scattering threshold, focusing on zoom-whirl orbits. In this second paper in our series, we focus on merger remnant properties and energetics with new simulations of equal-mass, equal-charge, nonspinning binary black holes with variable impact parameter. We find near-extremal merger remnants with Kerr-Newman parameter reaching $\Upsilon_f = 0.97$, and observe that the maximum $\Upsilon_f$ increases monotonically with $\lambda$ for a fixed initial Lorentz factor. We find that binaries with larger $\lambda$ radiate less total energy despite having stronger electromagnetic emission. The maximum energy radiated by a binary in our study is $31\%$ of its gravitational mass. Increasing $\lambda$ has little effect on the maximum angular momentum radiated, which was $\approx 72\%$ of the spacetime total angular momentum for each $\lambda$ explored here. Lastly, we provide additional evidence for the universality with the irreducible mass that we discovered in arXiv:2411.11960 [gr-qc]. The black hole horizon areal radius determines a fundamental, gauge-invariant length scale governing BH interactions near the scattering threshold.</description>

      <title>Clustering and Runaway Merging in a Primordial Black Hole Dominated Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01890v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: If primordial black holes (PBH) are present in the early universe, their contribution to the energy budget grows relative to that of radiation and generically becomes dominant unless the initial abundance is exponentially small. This black hole domination scenario is largely unconstrained for PBHs with masses $\lesssim 10^9\,\mathrm{g}$, which evaporate prior to Big Bang nucleosynthesis. However, if the era of PBH domination is sufficiently long, the PBHs form clusters and can merge appreciably within these objects. We calculate the population statistics of these clusters within the Press-Schechter formalism and find that, for a wide range of PBH masses and Hubble rates at the onset of PBH domination, the mergers within PBH clusters can exhibit runaway behavior, where the majority of the cluster will eventually form a single black hole with a mass much greater than the original PBH mass. These mergers can dramatically alter the PBH mass distribution and leave behind merged relic black holes that evaporate after Big Bang nucleosynthesis and yield various observational signatures, excluding parameter choices previously thought to be viable</description>

      <title>A note on loop resummation in de Sitter spacetime with the wavefunction of the universe approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01891v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze the computation of $n$-point correlation functions in de Sitter spacetime, including loop corrections, using the wavefunction of the universe approach. This method consists of two stages employing distinct Feynman rules. First, one must compute the wavefunction coefficients using interactions as vertices. Then, in the second stage, one computes correlation functions using wavefunction coefficients as vertices. For massless fields, loop corrections in the first stage are free of infrared (IR) divergences, which leads to the question of how this matches the well-known IR behavior of correlators obtained via other methods. By considering a scalar field with an arbitrary potential, we compute $n$-point correlation functions to first order in the potential but to all orders in loops. We find that, although loop integrals in the first stage are indeed IR convergent, the second procedure reintroduces the IR divergence. We discuss how this induces renormalization of the interaction potential such that the final result combining both steps exactly matches the form of $n$-point functions previously calculated with other methods.</description>

      <title>Estimating energy levels from lattice QCD correlation functions using a transfer matrix formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01900v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an efficient method for estimating energy levels from lattice QCD correlation functions by computing the eigenvalues of the transfer matrix of the corresponding lattice QCD Hamiltonian. This method is equivalent to the Lanczos procedure introduced recently (Wagman-2024), but more general and simpler to implement. We demonstrate the efficacy of the method by calculating the two lowest energy levels of a large number of hadrons including a few nuclei. While the signal-to-noise problem does not improve significantly, the extracted energy levels are found to be more reliable, compared to those extracted by conventional methods. Within a given statistical dataset the proposed method can effectively account for both statistical uncertainties and systematic errors, including those arising from the fitting window, and hence can reliably be employed in lattice QCD calculations.</description>

      <title>Banks-Zaks Stabilisation of Non-SUSY Strings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01914v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It appears to be difficult within string theory to obtain genuine scale separation between spacetime and the internal sector. In this paper, we propose a novel mechanism for scale-separated vacua which hinges on stringy effects that are invisible at the level of effective field theory. We show that (meta)stable vacua can form if a super no-scale one-loop potential combines with generic two-loop contributions to the vacuum energy, in a manner analogous to Banks-Zaks fixed points. Weak string coupling and scale separation arise from the accidental smallness of the one-loop term, which receives contributions only from massive states, relative to the two-loop term. We provide a proof of concept of this mechanism in explicit non-supersymmetric heterotic toroidal orbifolds by balancing the complete one-loop contribution against the estimated two-loop term and numerically minimizing the resulting effective potential in a restricted sector of moduli space. We note that this mechanism is generically possible within any fundamental theory that has a one-loop energy that gets contributions only from massive modes.</description>

      <title>Regulating chiral gauge theory at $\theta=0$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02024v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It has recently been argued that a proposal to nonperturbatively regulate chiral gauge theories on the boundary of a five-dimensional lattice will fail due to the existence of exact $U(1)$ symmetries not present in the target theories. A related observation is that in the presence of gauge fields with nontrivial topology, fermion zeromodes will appear embedded in the extra dimension which do not decouple from the four-dimensional world. Here we show that these problems can be evaded by simulating the theory in the trivial topological sector of the boundary gauge fields. A regulated version of the Standard Model using this approach in the continuum and large volume limits is expected to appear as if it possessed a Peccei-Quinn mechanism for relaxing $\theta_\text{QCD}$ to zero, without there being an axion in the spectrum.</description>

      <title>Quantum theory of neutron in magnetic field and neutron-electron collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02115v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The paper presents solution of quantum problem of neutron propagation in the magnetic field with multipole field expansion. Rigorous solution of the Pauli equation for neutron reveals existence of two solutions, finite and infinite, for any miltipole configuration. As an example, we present detailed study of neutron motion in quadrupole and sextupole. Our predictions agree with the results of Stern-Gerlach experiment for neutrons. To verify existence of finite and infinite motion, we discuss an experiment which could be performed in the Budker Insitute of Nuclear Physics using existing equipment. We conclude with the proposal of neutron-electron intersecting ring (neutron-electron ``collider''), which, if realized, would allow to accomplish a number of important experiments devoting to study neutron internal structure.</description>

      <title>First Pulsar Polarization Array Limits on Ultralight Axion-like Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02229v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We conduct the first-ever Pulsar Polarization Array (PPA) analysis to detect the ultralight Axion-Like Dark Matter (ALDM) using the polarization data of 22 millisecond pulsars from the third data release of Parkes Pulsar Timing Array. As one of the major dark matter candidates, the ultralight ALDM exhibits a pronounced wave nature on astronomical scales and offers a promising solution to small-scale structure issues within local galaxies. While the linearly polarized pulsar light travels through the ALDM galactic halo, its position angle (PA) can be subject to an oscillation induced by the ALDM Chern-Simons coupling with electromagnetic field. The PPA is thus especially suited for detecting the ultralight ALDM by correlating polarization data across the arrayed pulsars. To accomplish this task, we develop an advanced Bayesian analysis framework that allows us to construct pulsar PA residual time series, model noise contributions properly and search for pulsar cross-correlations. We find that for an ALDM density of $\rho_0=0.4\,\textrm{GeV}/\textrm{cm}^3$, the Parkes PPA offers the best global limits on the ALDM Chern-Simons coupling, namely $\lesssim 10^{-13.5}-10^{-12.2}~{\rm GeV}^{-1}$, for the mass range of $10^{-22} - 10^{-21}~{\rm eV}$. The crucial role of pulsar cross-correlation in recognizing the nature of the derived limits is also highlighted.</description>

Abstract: We provide a first-principles non-perturbative determination of the mass of the lightest gluino-gluon bound state (gluino-glue) in large-$N$ $\mathcal{N}=1$ Supersymmetric Yang--Mills theory by means of numerical Monte Carlo simulations of the lattice-discretized theory, and exploiting large-$N$ twisted volume reduction. Our large-$N$ determination is consistent with naive extrapolation of previously-known $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ and $\mathrm{SU}(3)$ results.</description>

      <title>Lefschetz thimble-inspired weight regularizations for complex Langevin simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02396v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Complex Langevin (CL) is a computational method to circumvent the numerical sign problem with applications in finite-density quantum chromodynamics and the real-time dynamics of quantum field theories. It has long been known that, depending on the simulated system, CL does not always converge correctly. In this work, we provide numerical evidence that the success or failure of the complex Langevin method is deeply tied to the Lefschetz thimble structure of the simulated system. This is demonstrated by constructing weight function regularizations that deform the thimbles of systems with compact domains. Our results indicate that CL converges correctly when the regularized system exhibits a single relevant compact thimble. We introduce a bias correction to retrieve the values of the original theory for parameter sets where a direct complex Langevin approach fails. The effectiveness of this method is illustrated using several toy models, including the cosine model and the SU(2) and SU(3) Polyakov chains. Finally, we discuss the opportunities and limitations of this regularization approach for lattice field theories.</description>

      <title>Constraint on initial conditions of one-dimensional expanding fluids from nonlinear causality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02405v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The initial conditions of one-dimensional expanding viscous fluids in relativistic heavy-ion collisions are scrutinized in terms of nonlinear causality of the relativistic hydrodynamic equations. Conventionally, it is believed that the matter generated in relativistic heavy-ion collisions starts to behave as a fluid all at once at some initial time. However, it is by no means trivial how soon after the first contact of two high-energy nuclei the fluid picture can be applied. It is demonstrated that one-dimensional expanding viscous fluids violate the necessary and the sufficient conditions of nonlinear causality at large departures from local equilibrium. We therefore quantify the inverse Reynolds number to justify the hydrodynamic description to be valid. The initial conditions are strictly constrained not to violate the causality conditions during the time evolution. With the help of the transverse energies per rapidity measured at RHIC and LHC, we obtain the minimum initial proper time and the maximum energy density allowed by nonlinear causality. This analysis strongly suggests that the initial stage of relativistic heavy-ion collisions needs to be described by a non-equilibrium description other than the framework of relativistic dissipative hydrodynamics.</description>

      <title>Formulation and Proof of the Gravitational Entropy Bound</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02470v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide a formulation and proof of the gravitational entropy bound. We use a recently given framework which expresses the measurable quantities of a quantum theory as a weighted sum over paths in the theory's phase space. If this framework is applied to a field theory on a spacetime foliated by a hypersurface $\Sigma,$ the choice of a codimension-2 surface $B$ without boundary contained in $\Sigma$ specifies a submanifold in the phase space. We show here that this submanifold is naturally restricted to obey an entropy bound if the field theory is diffeomorphism-invariant. We prove this restriction to arise by considering the quantum-mechanical sum of paths in phase space and exploiting the interplay of the commutativity of the sum with diffeomorphism-invariance. The formulation of the entropy bound, which we state and derive in detail, involves a functional $K$ on the submanifold associated to $B.$ We give an explicit construction of $K$ in terms of the Lagrangian. The gravitational entropy bound then states: For any real $\frac{\lambda}{\hbar},$ consider the set of states where $K$ takes a value not bigger than $\lambda$ and let $V$ denote the phase space volume of this set. One has then $\ln (V) \le \frac{\lambda}{\hbar}.$ Especially, we show for the Einstein-Hilbert Lagrangian in any dimension with cosmological constant and arbitrary minimally coupled matter, one has $K = \frac{A}{4G}.$ Hereby, $A$ denotes the area of $B$ in a particular state.</description>

      <title>Study of primordial non-Gaussianity $f_{\mathrm{NG}}$ and $g_{\mathrm{NG}}$ with the cross-correlations between the scalar-induced gravitational waves and the cosmic microwave background</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02500v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The stochastic gravitational-wave background originating from cosmic sources contains vital information about the early universe. In this work, we comprehensively study the cross-correlations between the energy-density anisotropies in scalar-induced gravitational waves (SIGWs) and the temperature anisotropies and polarization in the cosmic microwave background (CMB). In our analysis of the angular power spectra for these cross-correlations, we consider all contributions of the local-type primordial non-Gaussianity $f_{\mathrm{NL}}$ and $g_{\mathrm{NL}}$ that can lead to large anisotropies. We show that the angular power spectra are highly sensitive to primordial non-Gaussianity. Furthermore, we project the sensitivity of future gravitational-wave detectors to detect such signals and, consequently, measure the primordial non-Gaussianity.</description>

      <title>Constraints on the Dirac spectrum from chiral symmetry restoration and the fate of $\mathrm{U}(1)_A$ symmetry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02517v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: I discuss chiral symmetry restoration in the chiral limit $m\to 0$ of QCD with two light quark flavours of mass $m$, focussing on its consequences for scalar and pseudoscalar susceptibilities, and on the resulting constraints on the Dirac spectrum. I show that $\mathrm{U}(1)_A$ symmetry remains broken in the $\mathrm{SU}(2)_A$ symmetric phase if the spectral density $\rho(\lambda;m)$ develops a singular near-zero peak, tending to $O(m^4)/\lambda$ in the chiral limit. Moreover, $\mathrm{SU}(2)_A$ restoration requires that the number of modes in the peak be proportional to the topological susceptibility, indicating that such a peak must be of topological origin.</description>

      <title>Testing inflation on all scales: a case study with $\alpha$-attractors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02544v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A plethora of inflationary models can produce interesting small-scale phenomenology, such as enhanced scalar fluctuations leading to primordial black hole (PBH) production and large scalar-induced GW. Nevertheless, good models must simultaneously explain current observations on all scales. In this work, we showcase our methodology to establish the small-scale phenomenology of inflationary models on firm grounds. We consider the case of hybrid $\alpha$-attractors, and focus on a reduced parameter space featuring the two potential parameters which roughly determine the position of the peak in the scalar power spectrum, $\mathcal{P}_\zeta$, and its amplitude. We first constrain the parameter space by comparing the large-scale predictions for $\mathcal{P}_\zeta$ with current CMB anisotropies measurements and upper limits on $\mu$-distortions. We take into account uncertainties due to the reheating phase, and observe that the parameter-space area compatible with large-scale constraints shrinks for extended reheating stages. We then move to smaller scales, where we find that non-Gaussianity at peak scales is of the local type and has amplitude $f_\text{NL}\sim \mathcal{O}(0.1)$. This ensures that non-linear effects are subdominant, motivating us to employ the tree-level $\mathcal{P}_\zeta$ to compute the abundance of PBHs and the spectrum of induced GWs for models consistent with large-scale tests. The former allows us to further constrain the parameter space, by excluding models which over-produce PBHs. We find that a subset of viable models can lead to significant production of PBHs, and a fraction of these is within reach for LISA, having a signal-to-noise ratio larger than that of astrophysical foregrounds. Our first-of-its-kind study systematically combines tests at different scales, and exploits the synergy between cosmological observations and theoretical consistency requirements.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02672v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN in Switzerland became operational in 2009 and has since then produced a plethora of results for proton-proton (pp) collisions. This short review covers results that relates to soft QCD focusing on non-diffractive physics at mid-rapidity. Most of the presented results comes from transverse momentum ($p_{\rm T}$) spectra and related/derived observables such as multiplicity, $\langle p_{\rm T} \rangle$ and ratios, but also the observed ``ridge'' and the questions of quark-gluon plasma in pp collisions will be discussed. The goal of the review is on one hand to introduce the topics and provide references for scientists joining the LHC program while at the same time highlighting what we consider the most interesting results and open questions to inspire novel measurements.</description>

      <title>Medium modifications to jet angularities using SCET with Glauber gluons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.10237v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We perform a comprehensive analysis of medium modifications on ungroomed jet angularities, $\tau_a$, within the framework of Soft-Collinear Effective Theory with Glauber gluons (SCET$_{\rm G}$). Angularities are a one-parameter family of jet substructure observables with angularity exponent $a&lt;2$ for infrared safety. Variation of the angularity exponent allows to modify the relative weighting of the collinear-to-soft radiations in the jet, thereby giving access to different moments of the jet transverse momentum spectrum. In this article, we focus on angularity exponents $a&lt;1$ and provide detailed results for $a=-1,0$, and $0.5$. Within SCET$_{\rm G}$, the interaction between jet and medium constituents is comprehended by off-shell Glauber gluons generated from the color gauge fields in the medium. While the medium modifications are incorporated in the jet function via the use of in-medium splitting functions, the soft function remains unmodified for $a&lt;1$. For all values of $a$, we find that in the medium, the distributions are shifted towards smaller values of jet angularity for any given value of the angularity exponent `$a$' and have a steeper fall compared to the vacuum distributions. This redistribution of the ungroomed angularity spectrum is more apparent for a jet with a larger cone size and for larger values of the exponent `$a$'. We also present results for the medium sensitivity towards $p_T$ of the jet and for a jet initiated in a less central event ($10-30\%$ centrality). Finally, we provide the ratios of nucleus-nucleus and proton-proton differential angularity distributions for different angularity exponents and for two values of the jet radius parameter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.13594v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present evidence for new phases of the Standard Model Higgs potential. We study the Standard Model physical trajectory accounting for the Higgs curvature mass with the mass-dependent functional renormalisation group. New unstable and non-trivially stable phases are found at energies above the Planck scale and below the Abelian Landau pole. While the first aggravates the well-known metastable phase and threatens the viability of the Standard Model extrapolated to arbitrary scales, the latter can provide a well-defined ultraviolet completion. We investigate the phase diagram as a function of the top quark pole mass and study the effect of new physics through a scalar singlet portal coupling. The new non-trivial phase appears below the Planck scale in extensions of the Standard Model seeking stable trajectories. These findings have a significant impact on existing model building.</description>

      <title>Transverse Momentum Distributions from Lattice QCD without Wilson Lines</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.01391v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The transverse-momentum-dependent distributions (TMDs), which are defined by gauge-invariant 3D parton correlators with staple-shaped lightlike Wilson lines, can be calculated from quark and gluon correlators fixed in the Coulomb gauge on a Euclidean lattice. These quantities can be expressed gauge-invariantly as the correlators of Coulomb-gauge-dressed fields, which reduce to the standard TMD correlators under principal-value prescription in the infinite boost limit. In the framework of Large-Momentum Effective Theory, a quasi-TMD defined from such correlators in a large-momentum hadron state can be matched to the TMD via a factorization formula, whose exact form is derived using Soft Collinear Effective Theory and verified at one-loop order. Compared to the currently used gauge-invariant correlators, this new method can substantially improve statistical precision and simplify renormalization for the time-reversal-even TMDs, which will greatly enhance the predicative power of lattice QCD in the non-perturbative region.</description>

Abstract: This paper is the extension of our previous work entitled Searching a systematics for nonfactorizable contributions to and hadronic decays. Obtaining the factorizable contributions from the spectator quark model for a systematics has been identified among the isospin reduced amplitudes for the nonfactorizable terms among decay modes. This systematics helps us to derive a generic formula which assists to predict the branching fractions for Inspired by this observation, we extend our analysis to p wave meson emitting decays of which have similar isospin structure and make predictions for where the experimental measurements are not yet available.</description>

Abstract: Quantum chromodynamics (QCD) with pure imaginary baryon number chemical potential mu =i theta T, where T is temperature and theta is a real number, has the Roberge-Weiss periodicity. We study the theta-dependence of the baryon number density and the pressure in the hadron resonance gas model with excluded volume effects of baryons. It is shown that the baryon number density and the pressure are smooth periodic functions of theta at low or high temperature. However, they have singular behavior at theta =(2k+1)pi where k is an integer, when T sim 211MeV. This temperature is consistent with the Roberge-Weiss transition temperature TRW obtained by lattice QCD simulations. This singularity can be explained by the dual excluded volume effects in which the roles of point-like and non point-like particles are exchanged each other in the ordinary excluded volume effects. It is also indicated that the excluded volume effect is visible just below TRW and is directly detectable by the lattice QCD simulation at finite theta. We compare the results with the one obtained by the Polyakov-loop extended Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model.</description>

      <title>Femtoscopy with L\'evy sources from SPS through RHIC to LHC</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.01249v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Femtoscopy is a unique tool to investigate the space-time geometry of the matter created in ultra-relativistic collisions. If the probability density distribution of hadron emission is parametrized, then the dependence of its parameters on particle momentum, collision energy, and collision geometry can be given. In recent years, several measurements came to light that indicated the adequacy of assuming a L\'evy-stable shape for the mentioned distribution. In parallel, several new phenomenological developments appeared, aiding the interpretation of the experimental results or providing tools for the measurements. In this paper, we discuss important aspects of femtoscopy with L\'evy sources in light of some of these advances, including phenomenological and experimental ones.</description>

      <title>Unified Interpretation of Muon g-2 anomaly, 95 GeV Diphoton, and $b\bar{b}$ Excesses in the General Next-to-Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.15847v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate three intriguing anomalies within the framework of the General Next-to-Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model. These anomalies include a significant deviation of the experimental results for the muon anomalous magnetic moment from its Standard Model prediction, with a confidence level of $5.1\sigma$; a joint observation by the CMS and ATLAS collaborations of a diphoton excess with a local significance of $3.1 \sigma$ in the invariant mass distribution around 95.4 GeV; and a reported excess in the $b\bar{b}$ production at LEP with a local significance of $2.3 \sigma$. Through analytical and numerical analyses, we provide unified interpretations across an extensive parameter space that remain consistent with current experimental restrictions from data on the Higgs boson at 125 GeV, B-physics measurements, dark matter observables, as well as existing searches for supersymmetry and extra Higgs bosons. We attribute the muon anomaly to loops involving muon-smuon-neutralino and muon-sneutrino-chargino interactions, while attributing the diphoton and $b \bar{b}$ excesses to the resonant production of a singlet-dominated scalar. These proposed solutions are poised for experimental tests at the high-luminosity LHC and future linear colliders.</description>

      <title>Energy-Energy Correlation in the back-to-back region at N$^3$LL+NNLO in QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04077v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the Energy-Energy Correlation (EEC) function in high-energy electron-positron annihilation to hadrons. In the back-to-back (two-jet) region, we perform the all-order resummation of the logarithmically-enhanced contributions in QCD perturbation theory up to next-to-next-to-next-to-leading logarithmic (N$^3$LL) accuracy. Away from the back-to-back region, we consistently combine resummed predictions with the known fixed-order results up to next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) and we are able to obtain an accurate fit of the $\mathcal{O}(\alpha_S^3)$ remainder function from the numerical QCD computation of the full spectrum. All perturbative terms up to order $\alpha_S^3$ are included in our calculation and a non-trivial cross-check in the back-to-back region is obtained by comparing the SCET analytic calculation against the corresponding numerical QCD computation. In particular, the values of the $\mathcal{O}(\alpha_S^3)$ resummation coefficients have been numerically verified. We regularize the Landau singularity of the QCD coupling within the so-called Minimal Prescription and we discuss the reduction of the perturbative scale dependence of distributions at higher orders, as a means to estimate the corresponding residual perturbative uncertainty. Finally, after introducing within a dispersive approach non-perturbative power corrections, we are able to obtain an accurate description of experimental data at LEP and SLC accelerators.</description>

      <title>Light Higgs signal strengths in the B-LSSM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01926v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There are two light Higgs bosons within the framework of the $B-L$ supersymmetric model (B-LSSM), where one of them corresponds to the observed 125 GeV Higgs, and the mass of the other one ranges from tens GeV to hundreds GeV. This study investigates two possible scenarios: 1, the lightest Higgs boson refers to the observed 125 GeV Higgs; 2, the lightest Higgs boson mass is around 95 GeV to account for the excesses observed in the diphoton and $b\bar b$ data, while the next-to lightest Higgs is the observed 125 GeV Higgs. The mixings between these two light Higgs states play important roles in explaining the light Higgs signal strengths, which arise from the gauge kinetic mixing effect. And new bounds on the parameter space of the model are obtained by fitting the Higgs signal strengths in the experimental $2\sigma$ intervals. In order to take into account the mixing effects and the light Higgs boson masses more precisely, we consider the two-loop effective potential corrections to the squared Higgs mass matrix in the calculations.</description>

      <title>95GeV Excesses in the $\mathbb{Z}_3$-symmetric Next-to Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10969v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent analyses by CMS and ATLAS suggest a deviation in the di-photon channel at approximately 95 GeV, alongside a previously observed excess in $b\bar{b}$ signals at a similar mass by LEP, potentially hinting at a new scalar particle. This study explores this possibility within the framework of the well-established $\mathbb{Z}_3$-symmetric Next-to-Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model. A comprehensive parameter scan was conducted, integrating constraints from dark matter relic density, direct detection experiments, and the properties of the observed 125 GeV Higgs boson. The results demonstrate that the model can accommodate the observed excesses with a singlet-dominated CP-even Higgs boson near 95 GeV. The model accurately predicts signal strengths of the di-photon and $b\bar{b}$ channels at a level of $1\sigma$. Furthermore, it accounts for the measured dark matter relic abundance through Bino-dominated neutralinos co-annihilation with Wino-like electroweakinos, all while remaining consistent with existing LHC constraints. These findings pave the way for future validation at the high-luminosity LHC and linear colliders, which may offer crucial tests of the model's predictions.</description>

      <title>Constraints on freeze-in dark matter from Lyman-$\alpha$ forest and 21-cm signal : single-field models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08225v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report new Lyman-$\alpha$ and 21-cm constraints on freeze-in dark matter (FIDM) which injects energy into the intergalactic medium either through annihilation or decay to photon(s) or electron-positron pair. With respect to Lyman-$\alpha$ we fix the baseline ionization history using low redshift data about astrophysical reionization, whereas for 21-cm signal we adopt the baseline values of 21-cm power spectrum through a standard modeling of star formation developed so far. Using the latest numerical tools, we show that (i) for sterile neutrino FIDM, current Lyman-$\alpha$ data and future sensitivity of SKA-low (1000 hrs) on the 21-cm power spectra excludes the FIDM mass up to $1.8\times 10^{-3}$ GeV at 95$\%$ CL and $5.46\times 10^{-4}$ GeV, respectively, and (ii) for millicharged FIDM, current Lyman-$\alpha$ data only excludes the millicharge down to $10^{-8}$ within the FIDM mass range of $10^{-3}-1$ GeV at 95$\%$ CL, suggesting that the surviving parameter space of millicharged FIDM is still intact.</description>

      <title>A new method to clarify contribution of chiral magnetic effect in small collision system $p^{\uparrow} + A$ involving a transversely polarized proton</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02939v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new experiment method to check contribution of chiral magnetic effect (CME). With experimental data of DIS involving transversely polarized proton, we have calculated the 3-D charge density inside the polarized proton, which is found to have a significant violation to spherical symmetry. Then we have calculated the property of electromagnetic field (E-M field) generated by a single transversely polarized proton ($p^{\uparrow}$). Based on them, the E-M field generated in small collision system $p^{\uparrow}+A$ are studied. We find that the orientation of this E-M field has a significant dependence on the polarization direction of the proton, and the correlator ($\Delta\gamma$ ) has also significant dependence on the angle between reaction plane and polarization direction. As background contribution are canceled comparing two collision geometry schemes, only contribution of CME is remained.</description>

      <title>Neural Network Modeling of Heavy-Quark Potential from Holography</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03784v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLP) and Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN), we construct a holographic model based on lattice QCD data for the heavy-quark potential in the 2+1 system. The deformation factor $w(r)$ in the metric is obtained using the two types of neural network. First, we numerically obtain $w(r)$ using MLP, accurately reproducing the QCD results of the lattice, and calculate the heavy quark potential at finite temperature and the chemical potential. Subsequently, we employ KAN within the Andreev-Zakharov model for validation purpose, which can analytically reconstruct $w(r)$, matching the Andreev-Zakharov model exactly and confirming the validity of MLP. Finally, we construct an analytical holographic model using KAN and study the heavy-quark potential at finite temperature and chemical potential using the KAN-based holographic model. This work demonstrates the potential of KAN to derive analytical expressions for high-energy physics applications.</description>

      <title>Photon Frequency Conversion in High-$Q$ Superconducting Resonators: Axion Electrodynamics, QED &amp; Nonlinear Meissner Radiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08275v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-Q superconducting resonators have been proposed and developed as detectors of light-by-light scattering mediated by the hypothesized axion or virtual electron-positron pairs in quantum electrodynamics - the Euler-Heisenberg (EH) interaction. Photon frequency and mode conversion is central to the scheme for detecting such rare events. Superconducting resonators are nonlinear devices. The Meissner screening currents that confine the electromagnetic fields to the vacuum region of a superconducting RF cavity are nonlinear functions of the EM field at the vacuum-superconducting interface, and as a result can generate source currents and frequency conversion of microwave photons in the cavity. In this report we consider photon frequency and mode conversion in superconducting resonators with high quality factors from Meissner currents in single and dual cavity setups proposed for axion and QED searches based on light-by-light scattering. In a single cavity with two pump modes photon frequency conversion by the Meissner screening current dominates photon generation by the EH interaction for cavities with $Q \lesssim 10^{12}$. The Meissner currents also generate background photons that limits the operation of the resonator for axion detection in three-mode, single cavity setups. We also consider the leakage of photons from pump modes into the signal mode for both axion and EH mediated light-by-light scattering. Photon frequency conversion by the EH interaction can compete with Meissner and leakage radiation in \emph{ultra-high-Q} cavities that are beyond current state of the art. Meissner radiation and leakage backgrounds can be suppressed in dual cavity setups with appropriate choices for pump and spectator modes, as well as the single-cavity setup proposed for heterodyne detection of galactic axion dark matter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.12508v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neutral triple gauge couplings (nTGCs) are manifestation of new physics beyond the Standard Model (SM), as they are absent in the SM and are first generated by dimension-8 operators in the SM Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). We study the UV completion of nTGCs in a renormalizable model with vector-like heavy fermions. We compute the one-loop heavy fermion contributions to nTGC vertices by matching them to dimension-8 operators in the low energy limit. Such fermion loops contain either heavy fermions only or mixture of heavy fermions with light SM fermions. We find that their contributions can induce dimension-8 nTGC effective operators containing two SM Higgs-doublet fields, which are formulated with a complete set of 7 dimension-8 operators generating off-shell CP-even nTGCs. We present the results in terms of SMEFT coefficients and in terms of nTGC vertices (form factors) with two on-shell gauge bosons. In the heavy-light mixing case there appear terms that cannot be accommodated by conventional parametrizations of form factors due to extra logarithmic corrections. We further discuss the implications for probing such UV dynamics via nTGCs at the high energy colliders.</description>

Abstract: Benchmarks for beyond the Standard Model (BSM) searches are mostly constructed around particular features of interest related to the experiment under consideration without giving due address to the results from other experiments. In this article, we present a 30-parameter MSSM phenomenological framework and benchmark points relevant for the long-lived particles and Higgs boson decays to BSM particle studies. These are extracted via scans of the model parameter space compatible with low-energy constraints from electroweak physics, B-physics, the dipole moment of the electron, and cold dark matter relic density measurements. We present four benchmark points that are illustrative on how light values of supersymmetric particles can still be. Neutralinos and charginos can be lighter than W-boson mass in sharp contrast to the expectations by conclusions derived based on simplified supersymmetric models.</description>

      <title>Hidden strangeness in meson weak decays to baryon pair</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11374v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Our study focuses on the weak decay of $ D_s^+ \to p \overline{n} $, which is the only possible two-body baryonic decay in the $ D $ meson system. An analysis using perturbative quantum chromodynamics (pQCD) is challenging in this decay due to the small amount of energy released. In particular, naive factorization, suppressed by the light quark masses, results in a minor contribution to this channel. In the framework of final state interactions, the hidden strangeness in the intermediate state naturally avoids this chiral suppression from light quark masses. The branching fraction is predicted to be $ {\cal B}(D_s^+ \to p\overline{n}) = (1.43 \pm 0.10) \times 10^{-3} $, in agreement with the experimental value of $ (1.22 \pm 0.11) \times 10^{-3} $. We also analyze the decays of $ B $ mesons into two charmed baryons involving annihilation-type topological diagrams. In these decays, we conduct a joint analysis of naive factorization and final state interactions. Using the experimental upper bound of $ {\cal B}(B_s^0 \to \Lambda_c^+ \overline{\Lambda}_c^-) &lt; 8 \times 10^{-5} $, we set a constraint on the coupling constant $ g_{D^+ \Lambda_c^+ n} &lt; 7.5 $. Final state interactions lead to a prediction of the decay parameter $ \gamma(B_s^0 \to \Lambda_c^+ \overline{\Lambda}_c^-) &gt; 0.8 $, whereas pQCD predicts it to be negative. We propose future measurements of $ B^0 \to \Xi_c^+ \overline{\Xi}_c^- $, predicting a significant $ SU(3)_F $ breaking effect with $ \frac{{\cal B}(B^0 \to \Xi_c^+ \overline{\Xi}_c^-)}{{\cal B}(B_s^0 \to \Lambda_c^+ \overline{\Lambda}_c^-)} = 1.4\% $, contrary to the naive estimate of $ 5.3\% $. We strongly recommend future measurements.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.17854v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A model based on a $U(1)_{T^3_R}$ extension of the Standard Model can address the mass hierarchy between generations of fermions, explain thermal dark matter abundance, and the muon $g - 2$, $R_{(D)}$, and $R_{(D^*)}$ anomalies. The model contains a light scalar boson $\phi'$ and a heavy vector-like quark $\chi_\mathrm{u}$ that can be probed at CERN's Large Hadron Collider (LHC). We perform a phenomenology study on the production of $\phi'$ and ${\chi}_u$ particles from proton-proton $(\mathrm{pp})$ collisions at the LHC at $\sqrt{s}=13.6$ TeV, primarily through $g{-g}$ and $t{-\chi_\mathrm{u}}$ fusion. We work under an effective field theory approach, in which the $\chi_\mathrm{u}$ and $\phi'$ masses are free parameters. We perform a phenomenological analysis considering $\chi_\mathrm{u}$ final states to b-quarks, muons, and neutrinos, and $\phi'$ decays to $\mu^+\mu^-$. A machine learning algorithm is used to maximize the signal sensitivity, considering an integrated luminosity of $3000$ $\textrm{fb}^{-1}$. The proposed methodology can be a key mode for discovery over a large mass range, including low masses, traditionally considered difficult due to experimental constraints.</description>

Abstract: The standard perception is that the detection of high energy (TeV energies and above) neutrinos from an astrophysical object is a conclusive evidence for the presence of hadronic cosmic rays at the source. In the present work we demonstrate that TeV neutrinos can also be originated from energetic electrons via electromagnetic interactions in different potential cosmic ray sources with flux levels comparable to that of the hadronic originated neutrinos at high energies. Our findings thus imply that at least a part of the neutrinos observed by Icecube observatory may be originated from energetic electrons. The present analysis further suggests that only a combine study of TeV gamma rays and neutrinos over a wide energy range from an astrophysical object can unambiguously identify the nature of their parents, hadrons or leptons.</description>

      <title>Weyl Fermion Creation by Cosmological Gravitational Wave Background at 1-loop</title>

Abstract: Weyl fermions of spin $\frac12$ minimally coupled to Einstein's gravity in 4 dimensions cannot be produced purely gravitationally in an expanding Universe at tree level. Surprisingly, as we showed in a recent letter [1], this changes at gravitational 1-loop when cosmic perturbations, like a gravitational wave background, are present. Such a background introduces a new scale, thereby breaking the fermions' conformal invariance. This leads to a non-vanishing gravitational self-energy for Weyl fermions at 1-loop and induces their production. In this paper, we present an extended study of this new mechanism, explicitly computing this effect using the in-in formalism. We work in an expanding Universe in the radiation-dominated era as a fixed background. Gravitational wave-induced fermion production has rich phenomenological consequences. Notably, if Weyl fermions eventually acquire mass, and assuming realistic - and potentially detectable - gravitational wave backgrounds, the mechanism can explain the abundance of dark matter in the Universe. More generally, gravitational-wave induced freeze-in is a new purely gravitational mechanism for generating other feebly interacting fermions, e.g. right-handed neutrinos. We show that this loop level effect can dominate over the conventional - tree-level - gravitational production of superheavy fermions in a sizable part of the parameter space.</description>

      <title>Shock breakouts from compact CSM surrounding core-collapse SN progenitors may contribute significantly to the observed $\gtrsim10$ TeV neutrino background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14233</link>

Abstract: Growing observational evidence suggests that enhanced mass loss from the progenitors of core-collapse supernovae (SNe) is common during $\sim1$ yr preceding the explosion, creating an optically thick circum-stellar medium (CSM) shell at $\sim10^{14.5}$ cm radii. We show that if such mass loss is indeed common, then the breakout of the SN shock through the dense CSM shell produces a neutrino flux that may account for a significant fraction of the observed $\gtrsim10$ TeV neutrino background. The neutrinos are created within a few days from the explosion, during and shortly after the shock breakout, which produces also large UV (and later X-ray) luminosity. The compact size and large UV luminosity imply a pair production optical depth of $\sim10^4$ for $&gt;100$ GeV photons, naturally accounting for the lack of a high-energy gamma-ray background accompanying the neutrino background. SNe producing $&gt;1$ neutrino event in a 1 km$^2$ detector are expected at a rate of $\lesssim0.1$/yr. A quantitative theory describing the evolution of the electromagnetic spectrum during a breakout, as the radiation-mediated shock is transformed into a collisionless one, is required to enable (i) using data from upcoming surveys that will systematically detect large numbers of young, $&lt;1$ d old SNe, to determine the pre-explosion mass loss history of the SN progenitor population, and (ii) a quantitative determination of the neutrino luminosity and spectrum.</description>

      <title>Quantum simulation of thermal field theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19601v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present our recent studies on thermal field theories using quantum algorithms. We first delve into the representation of quantum fields via qubits on general digital quantum computers alongside the quantum algorithms employed to evaluate thermal properties of generic quantum field theories. Then, we show our numerical results of thermal field theories in 1+1 dimensions using quantum simulators. Both fermion and scalar fields will be discussed. These studies aim to understand thermal fixed points for our forthcoming work on studying thermalisation in quantum field theories in real time quantum simulation.</description>
