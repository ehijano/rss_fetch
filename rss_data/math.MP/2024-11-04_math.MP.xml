      <description>arXiv:2411.00176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We employ Weyl's method and Vinogradov's method to analyze skew-shift dynamics on semi-algebraic sets. Consequently, we improve the quantum dynamical upper bounds of Jitomirskaya-Powell, Liu, and Shamis-Sodin for long-range operators with skew-shift potentials.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00678v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a rigorous construction of the Feynman integral on the compactified Einstein Universe (EU) using white noise calculus. Presented construction of the functional averaging may also be thought of as a solution of the problem posed by Bogoliubov and Shirkov in Chap.VIII.43 of their book Introduction to the Theory of Quantized Fields'', Wiley 1980.</description>

      <title>Thick Arnold tongues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00175v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce and study a physically motivated problem that exhibits interesting and perhaps unexpected mathematical features. A cellular flow is a two-dimensional Hamiltonian flow of the Hamiltonian $H(x, y) = \cos(x) \cos(y)$. We study a simple model of the dynamics of an inertial particle carried by such a flow, subject to viscous drag and to an additional constant external force $(b, a)$. In the limiting case of zero inertia particles the dynamics is Hamiltonian with $H(x, y) = \cos(x) \cos(y) - ax + by$. For small but nonzero $a, \ b $ there appear ``channels" of trajectories that wind their way to infinity, of small relative measure, while most trajectories remain periodic.
  By contrast, for nonzero inertia, no matter how small, almost all particle trajectories drift to infinity. Moreover, the asymptotic direction of this drift no longer coincides with the direction of forcing, and rather becomes Cantor-like function of the forcing direction $a/b$, and with an unexpected feature: the plateaus of this function occupy a set of full measure. Moreover, the complement to this set has zero Hausdorff dimension. In a two-parameter representation (one parameter being the forcing direction $a/b$, the other the drag coefficient), this gives rise to Arnold tongues, the tongues corresponding to rational slopes of drift. However, unlike Arnold's example, the complement to the union of all tongues has zero measure. This is explained by the behavior of rotation number for monotone families of circle maps with flat spots.</description>

      <title>Cluster Reductions, Mutations, and $q$-Painlev\'e Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00325v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose an extension of the Goncharov-Kenyon class of cluster integrable systems by their Hamiltonian reductions. This extension allows us to fill in the gap in cluster construction of the $q$-difference Painlev\'e equations, showing that all of them can be obtained as deautonomizations of the reduced Goncharov-Kenyon systems.
  Conjecturally, the isomorphisms of reduced Goncharov-Kenyon integrable systems are given by mutations in another, dual in some sense, cluster structure. These are the polynomial mutations of the spectral curve equations and polygon mutations of the corresponding decorated Newton polygons. In the Painlev\'e case the initial and dual cluster structures are isomorphic. It leads to self-duality between the spectral curve equation and the Painlev\'e Hamiltonian, and also extends the symmetry from affine to elliptic Weyl group.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.00443v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spinor bilinears of generalized spinors and their properties are investigated. Generalized Killing and twistor spinor equations are considered and their relations to the equations satisfied by special types of differential forms are found. Killing equation in generalized geometry is written in terms of the generalized covariant derivative and Killing-Yano forms are described in the framework of generalized geometry. Construction of generalized Killing-Yano forms and generalized closed conformal Killing-Yano forms in terms of the spinor bilinears of generalized Killing spinors are determined.</description>

      <title>Homogeneity supermanifolds and homogeneous Darboux theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00537v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop the concept of a homogeneity supermanifold, which is more general than most of the approaches to graded manifolds present in the literature. Instead of doing it via ringed spaces and sheaves of graded algebras, we prefer a purely differential geometric language and view gradings as provided by an additional structure on supermanifolds, namely the weight vector field. This gives us a privileged atlas with homogeneous local coordinates. The fact that the transition maps `preserve weights' is then automatic, but weights of homogeneous coordinates may vary from one chart to the other. Moreover, such local homogeneous coordinates may have arbitrary real weights, not only integers. We study homogeneity submanifolds, homogeneity Lie supergroups, tangent and cotangent lifts of homogeneity structures, homogeneous distributions and codistributions, and other related concepts. The main achievements in this framework are proofs of the homogeneous Poincar\'e Lemma and a homogeneous analog of the Darboux Theorem.</description>

      <title>Topological QBits in Flux-Quantized Super-Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00628v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We first give a brief exposition of our recent realization of anyonic quantum states on single M5-brane probes in 11D super-gravity backgrounds, by non-perturbative quantization of the topological sector of the self-dual tensor field on the 6D worldvolume, after its proper flux-quantization. This opens the prospect of holographic models for topological qbits away from the usual but unrealistic limit of large numbers of branes.
  At the same time, the elementary homotopy-theoretic nature of the construction yields a slick expression of topological quantum gates in homotopically-typed programming languages, opening the prospect of topological-hardware aware quantum programming.
  In view of these results, we end with some more meta-physical remarks on (cohesive) homotopy (type) theory in view of emergent fundamental physics and, possibly, M-theory.</description>

Abstract: We give an operadic interpretation of the known result of L.Shapiro and A.B.Stephens that characterizes percolating permutation matrices. A relation of ideals and suboperads of the non-symmetric operad of permutations to percolative properties of sets in the 2-neighbor percolation process is discussed. On a related note, we discuss a certain presentation of the operad of permutations.</description>

      <title>Categorical 't Hooft expansion and chiral algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00760v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Twisted holography captures protected aspects of well-known holographic dualities. We show how the holographic dual B-model background can be systematically derived from the 't Hooft expansion of the chiral algebras associated to four-dimensional ${\cal N}=2$ superconformal quiver gauge theories. A crucial tool is the match of planar BRST anomalies in the field theory and on the worldsheet, especially in the presence of probe D-branes. Our construction is very general and can be applied to chiral algebras which do not have a four-dimensional origin. The resulting holographic dual backgrounds are typically non-geometric and appear to be novel. We expect our strategy to have a wide range of applications to other examples of twisted holography and, potentially, weak coupling holography.</description>

      <title>3d SUSY enhancement and non-semisimple TQFTs from four dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00766v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It has been recently shown that the celebrated SCFT$_4$/VOA$_2$ correspondence can be bridged via three-dimensional field theories arising from a specific R-symmetry twisted circle reduction. We apply this twisted reduction to the $(A_1,A_{n})$ and $(A_1,D_{n})$ families of 4d $\mathcal{N}=2$ Argyres-Douglas SCFTs using their $\mathcal{N}=1$ Agarwal-Maruyoshi-Song Lagrangians. From $(A_1,A_{2n})$ we derive the Gang-Kim-Stubbs family of 3d $\mathcal{N}=2$ gauge theories with SUSY enhancement to $\mathcal{N}=4$ in the infrared, generalizing a recent derivation made in the special cases $n=1,2$. Topological twists of these theories are known to yield $semisimple$ TQFTs supporting $rational$ VOAs on holomorphic boundaries. From $(A_1,A_{2n-1})$, $(A_1,D_{2n+1})$, and $(A_1,D_{2n})$, we obtain three new infinite families of 3d $\mathcal{N}=2$ abelian gauge theories, all with monopole superpotentials, flowing to $\mathcal{N}=4$ SCFTs without Coulomb branch, but with the same non-trivial Higgs branch as the four-dimensional parent. Their topological A-twist yields $non$-$semisimple$ TQFTs related to $logarithmic$ VOAs such as $\widehat{\mathfrak{su}}(2)_{-4/3}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.02811v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we study the low-lying spectrum of the AKLT model perturbed by small, finite-range potentials and with open boundary conditions imposed at the edges of the chain. Our analysis is based on the \emph{local, iterative Lie Schwinger block-diagonalization method} which allows us to control small interaction terms localized near the boundary of the chain that are responsible for the possible splitting of the ground-state energy of the AKLT Hamiltonian into energy levels separated by small gaps. This improves earlier results concerning the persistence of the so called \emph{bulk} gap in these models, besides illustrating the power of our general methods in a non-trivial application.</description>

Abstract: We consider a neutral bosonic molecule in the Born-Oppenheimer approximation without spin and assume the physically obvious assertion that a neutral molecule prefers to break into smaller neutral clusters. We prove the existence of a global in space/uniform spectral gap between the ground state and first excited state energies. To do so, we improve upon previous results using a different tool, the time-independent Feshbach-Schur map.</description>

      <title>Hankel Determinants for a Deformed Laguerre Weight with Multiple Variables and Generalized Painlev\'{e} V Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22780v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the Hankel determinant generated by the moments of the deformed Laguerre weight function $x^{\alpha}{\rm{e}}^{-x}\prod\limits_{k=1}^{N}(x+t_k)^{\lambda_k}$, where $x\in \left[0,+\infty \right)$, $\alpha,t_k &gt;0, \lambda_k\in\mathbb{R}$ for $k=1,\cdots ,N$. By using the ladder operators for the associated monic orthogonal polynomials and three compatibility conditions, we express the recurrence coefficients in terms of the $2N$ auxiliary quantities which are introduced in the ladder operators and shown to satisfy a system of difference equations. Combining these results with the differential identities obtained from the differentiation of the orthogonality relations, we deduce the Riccati equations for the auxiliary quantities. From them we establish a system of second order PDEs which are reduced to a Painlev\'{e} V equation for $N=1$. Moreover, we derive the second order PDE satisfied by the logarithmic derivative of the Hankel determinant, from which the limiting PDE is obtained under a double scaling. When $N=1$, these two PDEs are reduced to the $\sigma$-form of a Painlev\'{e} V and III equation respectively. When the dimension of the Hermitian matrices from the corresponding deformed Laguerre unitary ensemble is large and $\lambda_k\ge0$, based on Dyson's Coulomb fluid theory, we deduce the equilibrium density for the eigenvalues.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23414v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we construct a family of topological conformal field theories (TCFTs) associated to a Calabi-Yau space by modifying the heat kernel and sections of the Calabi-Yau space. This is done by restricting to certain eigenspaces of the Laplacian. We then present two a-priori distinct ways to regularize the Calabi-Yau TCFT by using these modified heat kernels, and then show that they are equivalent. Finally, we relate the regularized TCFTs for different cutoffs.</description>

Abstract: The notion of nonlocal $H$-convergence is extended to domains with nontrivial topology, that is, domains with non-vanishing harmonic Dirichlet and/or Neumann fields. If the space of harmonic Dirichlet (or Neumann) fields is infinite-dimensional, there is an abundance of choice of pairwise incomparable topologies generalising the one for topologically trivial $\Omega$. It will be demonstrated that if the domain satisfies the Maxwell's compactness property the corresponding natural version of the corresponding (generalised) nonlocal $H$-convergence topology has no such ambiguity. Moreover, on multiplication operators the nonlocal $H$-topology coincides with the one induced by (local) $H$-convergence introduced by Murat and Tartar. The topology is used to obtain nonlocal homogenisation results including convergence of the associated energy for electrostatics. The derived techniques prove useful to deduce a new compactness criterion relevant for nonlinear static Maxwell problems.</description>

      <title>The stochastic primitive equations with non-isothermal turbulent pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.05973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.05973v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce and study the primitive equations with $\textit{non}$-isothermal turbulent pressure and transport noise. They are derived from the Navier-Stokes equations by employing stochastic versions of the Boussinesq and the hydrostatic approximations. The temperature dependence of the turbulent pressure can be seen as a consequence of an additive noise acting on the small vertical dynamics. For such a model we prove global well-posedness in $H^1$ where the noise is considered in both the It\^{o} and Stratonovich formulations. Compared to previous variants of the primitive equations, the one considered here presents a more intricate coupling between the velocity field and the temperature. The corresponding analysis is seriously more involved than in the deterministic setting. Finally, the continuous dependence on the initial data and the energy estimates proven here are new, even in the case of isothermal turbulent pressure.</description>

      <title>Fractional kinetics equation from a Markovian system of interacting Bouchaud trap models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.10156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.10156v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a partial exclusion process evolving on $\mathbb Z^d$ in a random trapping environment. In dimension $d\ge 2$, we derive the fractional kinetics equation \begin{equation*}\frac{\partial^\beta\rho_t}{\partial t^\beta} = \Delta \rho_t
  \end{equation*} as a hydrodynamic limit of the particle system. Here, $\frac{\partial^\beta}{\partial t^\beta}$, $\beta\in(0,1)$, denotes the fractional derivative in the Caputo sense. We thus exhibit a Markovian interacting particle system whose empirical density field rescales to a sub-diffusive equation corresponding to a non-Markovian process, the Fractional Kinetics process. In contrast, we show that, when $d=1$, the system rescales to the solution to \begin{equation*}
  \frac{\partial \rho_t}{\partial t}= \mathcal L_\beta \rho_t\ , \end{equation*} where $\mathcal L_\beta$ is the random generator of the singular quasi-diffusion known as FIN diffusion.</description>

      <title>Characterising the infinite volume scaling limit of gradient models with non-convex energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.12226v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the scaling limit of statistical mechanics models with non-convex Hamiltonians that are gradient perturbations of Gaussian measures. Characterising features of our gradient models are the imposed boundary tilt and the surface tension (free energy) as a function of tilt. In the regime of low temperatures and bounded tilt, we prove the scaling limit with respect to infinite volume Gibbs states for macroscopic functions on the continuum, and we show that the limit is a continuum Gaussian Free Field with covariance (diffusion) matrix given as the Hessian of surface tension. Our proof of this longstanding conjecture for non-convex energy complements recent studies in [Hil16, ABKM], as well as the proof for strictly convex Hamiltonians in [AW22].</description>

      <title>Wrinkling of an elastic sheet floating on a liquid sphere</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.15504v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A thin circular elastic sheet floating on a drop-like liquid substrate gets deformed due to incompatibility between the curved substrate and the planar sheet. We adopt a variational viewpoint by minimizing the non-convex membrane energy plus a higher-order convex bending energy. Being interested in thin sheets, we expand the minimum of the energy in terms of a small thickness $h$, and identify the first two terms of this expansion. The leading order term comes from a minimization of a family of one-dimensional ``relaxed'' problems, while for the next-order term we only identify its scaling law. This generalizes the previous work [P. Bella and R.V. Kohn. Wrikling of a thin circular sheet bonded to a spherical substrate, Philos. Trans. Roy. Soc. A, 375(2017). arXiv:1611.01781] to the physically relevant case of a liquid substrate.</description>

Abstract: In this work we study the convergence to equilibrium for a (potentially) degenerate nonlinear and nonlocal McKean-Vlasov equation. We show that the solution to this equation is related to the solution of a linear degenerate and/or defective Fokker-Planck equation and employ recent sharp convergence results to obtain an easily computable (and many times sharp) rates of convergence to equilibrium for the equation in question.</description>

      <title>A model of random sequential adsorption on a ladder graph</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.02747v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In random sequential adsorption (RSA), objects are deposited on a substrate randomly, irreversibly, and sequentially. Attempts of deposition that lead to an overlap with previously deposited objects are discarded. The process continues until the system reaches a jammed state when no further additions are possible. We analyze a class of RSA models on a two-row square ladder graph in which landing on an empty site in a graph is allowed when at least $b$ neighboring sites in the graph are unoccupied ($b \in \mathbb{N}$). In this paper we complement this typical way of studying RSA models by analyzing also the structure of the set of all jammed states in a static way, disregarding the dynamics that led to a particular jammed state. In both considered settings (dynamic and static) we provide explicit expressions for key statistics that describe the average proportion of the substrate covered by deposited objects, and then we comment on significant differences between the two settings. We illustrate all of our findings through a toy model for ensembles of trapped Rydberg atoms with blockade range $b$.</description>

      <title>Super Weil-Petersson measures on the moduli space of curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.14558v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The super Weil-Petersson metric defined over the moduli space of smooth super curves produces a natural measure over the moduli space of smooth curves. The construction of the measure uses the extra data of a spin structure on each smooth curve. When we allow marked points, the construction produces a collection of measures indexed by the behaviour of the spin structure at marked points -- Neveu-Schwarz or Ramond. In this paper we define these measures, and prove that they are finite. Each total measure gives the super volume of the moduli space of super curves with marked points. The Neveu-Schwarz volumes are polynomials that satisfy a recursion relation discovered by Stanford and Witten, analogous to Mirzakhani's recursion relations between Weil-Petersson volumes of moduli spaces of hyperbolic surfaces. We prove here that the Ramond boundary behaviour produces deformations of the Neveu-Schwarz volume polynomials, satisfying a variant of the Stanford-Witten recursion relations.</description>

      <title>Infrared finite scattering theory: Amplitudes and soft theorems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.18637v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Any non-trivial scattering with massless fields in four spacetime dimensions will generically produce an out-state with memory. Scattering with any massless fields violates the standard assumption of asymptotic completeness -- that all "in" and "out" states lie in the standard (zero memory) Fock space -- and therefore leads to infrared (IR) divergences in the standard $S$-matrix amplitudes. In this paper we define an infrared finite scattering theory which assumes only (1) the existence of in/out algebras and (2) that Heisenberg evolution is an automorphism of these algebras. The resulting "superscattering" map $\$$ allows for transitions between different in/out memory states and agrees with the standard $S$-matrix when it is defined. We construct $\$$-amplitudes by defining (3) a "generalized asymptotic completeness" which accommodates states with memory in the space of asymptotic states and (4) a complete basis of improper states which generalize the usual $n$-particle momentum basis to account for states with memory. Using only general properties of $\$$, we prove an analog of the Weinberg soft theorems in quantum gravity and QED which imply that all $\$$-amplitudes are well-defined in the infrared. We comment on how one must generalize this framework to consider $\$$-amplitudes for theories with collinear divergences (e.g., massless QED and Yang-Mills theories).</description>

      <title>Siegmund duality for physicists: a bridge between spatial and first-passage properties of continuous and discrete time stochastic processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10537v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a generic one-dimensional stochastic process $x(t)$, or a random walk $X_n$, which describes the position of a particle evolving inside an interval $[a,b]$, with absorbing walls located at $a$ and $b$. In continuous time, $x(t)$ is driven by some equilibrium process $\mathbf{\theta}(t)$, while in discrete time, the jumps of $X_n$ follow a stationary process that obeys a time reversal property. An important observable to characterize its behaviour is the exit probability $E_b(x,t)$, which is the probability for the particle to be absorbed first at the wall $b$, before or at time $t$, given its initial position $x$. In this paper we show that the derivation of this quantity can be tackled by studying a dual process $y(t)$ very similar to $x(t)$ but with hard walls at $a$ and $b$. More precisely, we show that the quantity $E_b(x,t)$ for the process $x(t)$ is equal to the probability $\tilde \Phi(x,t|b)$ of finding the dual process inside the interval $[a,x]$ at time $t$, with $y(0) =b$. This is known as Siegmund duality in mathematics. Here we show that this duality applies to various processes which are of interest in physics, including models of active particles, diffusing diffusivity models, a large class of discrete and continuous time random walks, and even processes subjected to stochastic resetting. For all these cases, we provide an explicit construction of the dual process. We also give simple derivations of this identity both in the continuous and in the discrete time setting, as well as numerical tests for a large number of models of interest. Finally, we use simulations to show that the duality is also likely to hold for more complex processes such as fractional Brownian motion.</description>

      <title>Efficient unitary designs and pseudorandom unitaries from permutations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16751v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work we give an efficient construction of unitary $k$-designs using $\tilde{O}(k\cdot poly(n))$ quantum gates, as well as an efficient construction of a parallel-secure pseudorandom unitary (PRU). Both results are obtained by giving an efficient quantum algorithm that lifts random permutations over $S(N)$ to random unitaries over $U(N)$ for $N=2^n$. In particular, we show that products of exponentiated sums of $S(N)$ permutations with random phases approximately match the first $2^{\Omega(n)}$ moments of the Haar measure. By substituting either $\tilde{O}(k)$-wise independent permutations, or quantum-secure pseudorandom permutations (PRPs) in place of the random permutations, we obtain the above results. The heart of our proof is a conceptual connection between the large dimension (large-$N$) expansion in random matrix theory and the polynomial method, which allows us to prove query lower bounds at finite-$N$ by interpolating from the much simpler large-$N$ limit. The key technical step is to exhibit an orthonormal basis for irreducible representations of the partition algebra that has a low-degree large-$N$ expansion. This allows us to show that the distinguishing probability is a low-degree rational polynomial of the dimension $N$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05085v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: By considering the basis-covariant constituents of N-Higgs-doublet potentials, we derive necessary and sufficient conditions for canonical SO(4)_C Custodial Symmetry (CS) of potentials with N&gt;2 doublets, based on representation-theoretical and geometrical relations. In essence, our characterization relates the presence of canonical CS to basis-covariant vectors corresponding to particular bases of the defining representation of the orthogonal Lie algebras. For N=3,4 and 5, the conditions demand little computational effort to be evaluated, and we provide practical algorithms that may be efficiently implemented in a computer program, for deciding whether or not a potential is custodial-symmetric.</description>

      <title>Cumulants and Limit Theorems for $q$-step walks on random graphs of long-range percolation radius model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11667v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study cumulants of $q$-step walks and $3$-step closed walks on Erd\"os-R\'enyi-type random graphs of long-range percolation radius model in the limit when the number of vertices $N$, concentration $c$, and the interaction radius $R$ tend to infinity. These cumulants represent terms of cumulant expansion of the free energy of discrete analogs of matrix models widely known in mathematical and theoretical physics.
  Using a diagram technique, we show that the limiting values of $k$-th cumulants ${\cal F}_k^{(q)}$ exist and can be associated with one or another family of tree-type diagrams, in dependence of the asymptotic behavior of parameters $cR/N$ for $q$-step non-closed walks and $c^2R/N^2$ for 3-step closed walks, respectively.
  These results allow us to prove Limit Theorems for the number of non-closed walks and for the number of triangles in large random graphs. Adapting the Pr\"ufer codification procedure to the tree-type diagrams obtained, we get explicit expressions for their numbers. This allows us to get upper bounds for ${\cal F}_k^{(q)}$ as $k\to\infty$ and, in the limit of infinite $q$, to get upper bounds in terms of high moments of Compound Poisson distribution.</description>

      <title>Implementation of thermal conduction energy transfer models in the Bifrost Solar atmosphere MHD code</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.07074v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Context: Thermal conductivity provides important contributions to the energy evolution of the upper solar atmosphere, behaving as a non-linear concentration-dependent diffusion equation. Recently, different methods have been offered as best-fit solutions to these problems in specific situations, but their effectiveness and limitations are rarely discussed. Aims. We rigorously test the different implementations of solving the conductivity flux, in the massively-parallel magnetohydrodynamics code, Bifrost, with the aim of specifying the best scenarios for the use of each method. Methods: We compare the differences and limitations of explicit versus implicit methods, and analyse the convergence of a hyperbolic approximation. Among the tests, we use a newly derived 1st-order self-similar approximation to compare the efficacy of each method analytically in a 1D pure-thermal test scenario. Results: We find that although the hyperbolic approximation proves the most accurate and the fastest to compute in long-running simulations, there is no optimal method to calculate the mid-term conductivity with both accuracy and efficiency. We also find that the solution of this approximation is sensitive to the initial conditions, and can lead to faster convergence if used correctly. Hyper-diffusivity is particularly useful in aiding the methods to perform optimally. Conclusions: We discuss recommendations for the use of each method within more complex simulations, whilst acknowledging the areas of opportunity for new methods to be developed.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the Fourier dimension, $\dim_F\mu$, of Mandelbrot multiplicative cascade measures $\mu$ on the $d$-dimensional unit cube. We show that if $\mu$ is the cascade measure generated by a sub-exponential random variable then \[\dim_F\mu=\min\{2,\dim_2\mu\}\,,\] where $\dim_2\mu$ is the correlation dimension of $\mu$ and it has an explicit formula.
  For cascades on the circle $S\subset\mathbb{R}^2$, we obtain \[\dim_F\mu\ge\frac{\dim_2\mu}{2+\dim_2\mu}\,.\]</description>

      <title>Mechanical Hamiltonization of unreduced $\phi$-simple Chaplygin systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18648v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove that the trajectories of unreduced $\phi$-simple Chaplygin kinetic systems are reparametrizations of horizontal geodesics with respect to a modified Riemannian metric. Furthermore, our proof is constructive and these Riemannian metrics, which are not unique, are obtained explicitly in interesting examples. We also extend these results to $\phi$-simple Chaplygin mechanical systems (not necessarily kinetic).</description>
