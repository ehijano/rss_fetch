      <title>Signal Timing Optimization for Mixed Connected Automated Traffic Based on A Markov Delay Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11522v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Connected Automated Vehicles (CAVs) offer unparalleled opportunities to revolutionize existing transportation systems. In the near future, CAVs and human-driven vehicles (HDVs) are expected to coexist, forming a mixed traffic system. Although several prototype traffic signal systems leveraging CAVs have been developed, a simple yet realistic approximation of mixed traffic delay and optimal signal timing at intersections remains elusive. This paper presents an analytical approximation for delay and optimal cycle length at an isolated intersection of mixed traffic using a stochastic framework that combines Markov chain analysis, a car following model, and queuing theory. Given the intricate nature of mixed traffic delay, the proposed framework systematically incorporates the impacts of multiple factors, such as the distinct arrival and departure behaviors and headway characteristics of CAVs and HDVs, through mathematical derivations to ensure both realism and analytical tractability. Subsequently, closed-form expressions for intersection delay and optimal cycle length are derived. Numerical experiments are then conducted to validate the model and provide insights into the dynamics of mixed traffic delays at signalized intersections.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Energy Consumption in Stochastic Production Systems: Using a Simulation-Based Approach for Stopping Policy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In response to the escalating need for sustainable manufacturing, this study introduces a Simulation-Based Approach (SBA) to model a stopping policy for energy-intensive stochastic production systems, developed and tested in a real-world industrial context. The case company - an energy-intensive lead-acid battery manufacturer - faces significant process uncertainty in its heat-treatment operations, making static planning inefficient. To evaluate a potential sensor-based solution, the SBA leverages simulated sensor data (using a Markovian model) to iteratively refine Bayesian energy estimates and dynamically adjust batch-specific processing times. A full-factorial numerical simulation, mirroring the company's 2024 heat-treatment process, evaluates the SBA's energy reduction potential, configuration robustness, and sensitivity to process uncertainty and sensor distortion. Results are benchmarked against three planning scenarios: (1) Optimized Planned Processing Times (OPT); (2) the company's Current Baseline Practice; and (3) an Ideal Scenario with perfectly known energy requirements. SBA significantly outperforms OPT across all tested environments and in some cases even performs statistically equivalent to an Ideal Scenario. Compared to the Current Baseline Practice, energy input is reduced by 14-25%, depending on uncertainty and sensor accuracy. A Pareto analysis further highlights SBA's ability to balance energy and inspection-labour costs, offering actionable insights for industrial decision-makers.</description>

      <title>Stability Analysis of Soft Sensor-Based Control Systems--A Lur\'e-Postnikov Approach Using a Novel Gated Recurrent Neural Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article addresses certification of closed-loop stability when a soft-sensor based on a gated recurrent neural network operates in the feedback path of a nonlinear control system. The Hadamard gating used in standard GRU/LSTM cells is shown to violate the Lur\'e-Postnikov Lyapunov conditions of absolute-stability theory, leading to conservative analysis. To overcome this limitation, a modified architecture--termed the Lur\'e-Postnikov gated recurrent neural network (LP-GRNN)--is proposed; its affine update law is compatible with the Lur\'e-Postnikov framework while matching the prediction accuracy of vanilla GRU/LSTM models on the NASA CMAPSS benchmark. Embedding the LP-GRNN, the plant, and a saturated PI controller in a unified standard nonlinear operator form (SNOF) reduces the stability problem to a compact set of tractable linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) whose feasibility certifies global asymptotic stability. A linearized boiler case study illustrates the workflow and validates the closed-loop performance, thereby bridging modern soft-sensor design with formal stability guarantees.</description>

      <title>Control Invariant Sets for Neural Network Dynamical Systems and Recursive Feasibility in Model Predictive Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural networks are powerful tools for data-driven modeling of complex dynamical systems, enhancing predictive capability for control applications. However, their inherent nonlinearity and black-box nature challenge control designs that prioritize rigorous safety and recursive feasibility guarantees. This paper presents algorithmic methods for synthesizing control invariant sets specifically tailored to neural network based dynamical models. These algorithms employ set recursion, ensuring termination after a finite number of iterations and generating subsets in which closed-loop dynamics are forward invariant, thus guaranteeing perpetual operational safety. Additionally, we propose model predictive control designs that integrate these control invariant sets into mixed-integer optimization, with guaranteed adherence to safety constraints and recursive feasibility at the computational level. We also present a comprehensive theoretical analysis examining the properties and guarantees of the proposed methods. Numerical simulations in an autonomous driving scenario demonstrate the methods' effectiveness in synthesizing control-invariant sets offline and implementing model predictive control online, ensuring safety and recursive feasibility.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11667v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, data-driven approaches have become increasingly pervasive across all areas of control engineering. However, the applications of data-based techniques to Boolean Control Networks (BCNs) are still very limited. In this paper we aim to fill this gap, by exploring the possibility of solving three fundamental control problems, i.e., state feedback stabilization, safe control and output regulation, for a BCN, leveraging only a limited amount of data generated by the network, without knowing or identifying its model.</description>

      <title>Model-free Dynamic Mode Adaptive Control using Matrix RLS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11844v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel, model-free, data-driven control synthesis technique known as dynamic mode adaptive control (DMAC) for synthesizing controllers for complex systems whose mathematical models are not suitable for classical control design. DMAC consists of a dynamics approximation module and a controller module. The dynamics approximation module is motivated by data-driven reduced-order modeling techniques and directly approximates the system's dynamics in state-space form using a matrix version of the recursive least squares algorithm. The controller module includes an output tracking controller that utilizes sparse measurements from the system to generate the control signal. The DMAC controller design technique is demonstrated through various dynamic systems commonly found in engineering applications. A systematic sensitivity study demonstrates the robustness of DMAC with respect to its own hyperparameters and the system's parameters.</description>

      <title>Reach-avoid games for players with damped double integrator dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies a reach-avoid game of two damped double integrator players. An attacker aims to reach a static target, while a faster defender tries to protect the target by intercepting the attacker before it reaches the target. In scenarios where the defender succeeds, the defender aims to maximize the attacker's final distance from the target, while the attacker aims to minimize it. This work focuses on determining the equilibrium strategy in the defender-winning scenarios. The optimal state feedback strategy is obtained by a differential game approach combining geometric analysis. We construct a multiple reachable region to analyse the damped double integrator player's motion under optimal strategy. Building on this, a new type of the attacker's dominance region is introduced for the first time. It is shown that different strategies are required when the terminal point lies in distinct areas of the attacker's dominance region. Then, a necessary condition is derived for the proposed strategy to be optimal using differential game approach. Furthermore, a case where both players start at rest is discussed, and some useful properties about the dominance region and the optimal strategy are presented. Simulations are conducted to show the effectiveness of the proposed strategy.</description>

      <title>Particle Filtering for Enhanced Parameter Estimation in Bilinear Systems Under Colored Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12041v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the challenging problem of parameter estimation in bilinear systems under colored noise. A novel approach, termed B-PF-RLS, is proposed, combining a particle filter (PF) with a recursive least squares (RLS) estimator. The B-PF-RLS algorithm tackles the complexities arising from system nonlinearities and colored noise by effectively estimating unknown system states using the particle filter, which are then integrated into the RLS parameter estimation process. Furthermore, the paper introduces an enhanced particle filter that eliminates the need for explicit knowledge of the measurement noise variance, enhancing the method's practicality for real-world applications. Numerical examples demonstrate the B-PF-RLS algorithm's superior performance in accurately estimating both system parameters and states, even under uncertain noise conditions. This work offers a robust and effective solution for system identification in various engineering applications involving bilinear models subject to complex noise environments.</description>

      <title>Optimal Satellite Maneuvers for Spaceborne Jamming Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12146v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Satellites are becoming exceedingly critical for communication, making them prime targets for cyber-physical attacks. We consider a rogue satellite in low Earth orbit that jams the uplink communication between another satellite and a ground station. To achieve maximal interference with minimal fuel consumption, the jammer carefully maneuvers itself relative to the target satellite's antenna. We cast this maneuvering objective as a two-stage optimal control problem, involving i) repositioning to an efficient jamming position before uplink communication commences; and ii) maintaining an efficient jamming position after communication has started. We obtain the optimal maneuvering trajectories for the jammer and perform simulations to show how they enable the disruption of uplink communication with reasonable fuel consumption.</description>

      <title>Impact of Power Fluctuations on Frequency Quality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper analyzes how power injections affect frequency quality in power systems. We first derive a general expression linking active and reactive power injections at buses to the system's frequency. This formulation explicitly considers both real and imaginary frequency components, providing a complete description of frequency behavior in power systems during transients. Next, we extend our analysis to incorporate stochastic variations of power injections. Using the frequency divider concept and power-based frequency estimation, we develop analytical relationships linking stochastic load fluctuations to frequency deviations. We discuss under which conditions the Central Limit Theorem cannot be applied to capture the frequency distribution, thereby clarifying how its hypotheses are not satisfied in power system applications. Then, we establish clear criteria for the appropriate use of statistical methods in frequency analysis. Finally, we validate our theoretical results through simulations on modified IEEE 14-bus and all-island Irish transmission test systems, highlighting the accuracy, practical utility, and limitations of our proposed formulation.</description>

      <title>Data-Efficient Automatic Shaping of Liquid Droplets on an Air-Ferrofluid Interface with Bayesian Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12394v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Manipulating the shape of a liquid droplet is essential for a wide range of applications in medicine and industry. However, existing methods are typically limited to generating simple shapes, such as ellipses, or rely on predefined templates. Although recent approaches have demonstrated more complex geometries, they remain constrained by limited adaptability and lack of real-time control. Here, we introduce a data-efficient method that enables real-time, programmable shaping of nonmagnetic liquid droplets into diverse target forms at the air-ferrofluid interface using Bayesian optimization. The droplet can adopt either convex or concave shapes depending on the actuation of the surrounding electromagnets. Bayesian optimization determines the optimal magnetic flux density for shaping the liquid droplet into a desired target shape. Our method enables automatic shaping into various triangular and rectangular shapes with a maximum shape error of 0.81 mm, as well as into letter-like patterns. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of real-time, automatic shaping of nonmagnetic liquid droplets into desired target shapes using magnetic fields or other external energy fields.</description>

      <title>Time-Continuous Frequency Allocation for Feeder Links of Mega Constellations with Multi-Antenna Gateway Stations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12429v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the recent rapid advancement of mega low earth orbit (LEO) satellite constellations, multi-antenna gateway station (MAGS) has emerged as a key enabler to support extremely high system capacity via massive feeder links. However, the densification of both space and ground segment leads to reduced spatial separation between links, posing unprecedented challenges of interference exacerbation. This paper investigates graph coloring-based frequency allocation methods for interference mitigation (IM) of mega LEO systems. We first reveal the characteristics of MAGS interference pattern and formulate the IM problem into a $K$-coloring problem using an adaptive threshold method. Then we propose two tailored graph coloring algorithms, namely Generalized Global (GG) and Clique-Based Tabu Search (CTS), to solve this problem. GG employs a low-complexity greedy conflict avoidance strategy, while CTS leverages the unique clique structure brought by MAGSs to enhance IM performance. Subsequently, we innovatively modify them to achieve time-continuous frequency allocation, which is crucial to ensure the stability of feeder links. Moreover, we further devise two mega constellation decomposition methods to alleviate the complexity burden of satellite operators. Finally, we propose a list coloring-based vacant subchannel utilization method to further improve spectrum efficiency and system capacity. Simulation results on Starlink constellation of the first and second generations with 34396 satellites demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed methodology.</description>

      <title>Optimal Task and Motion Planning for Autonomous Systems Using Petri Nets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12503v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study deals with the problem of task and motion planning of autonomous systems within the context of high-level tasks. Specifically, a task comprises logical requirements (conjunctions, disjunctions, and negations) on the trajectories and final states of agents in certain regions of interest. We propose an optimal planning approach that combines offline computation and online planning. First, a simplified Petri net system is proposed to model the autonomous system. Then, indicating places are designed to implement the logical requirements of the specifications. Building upon this, a compact representation of the state space called extended basis reachability graph is constructed and an efficient online planning algorithm is developed to obtain the optimal plan. It is shown that the most burdensome part of the planning procedure may be removed offline, thanks to the construction of the extended basis reachability graph. Finally, series of simulations are conducted to demonstrate the computational efficiency and scalability of our developed method.</description>

      <title>Transmission Neural Networks: Approximation and Optimal Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12657v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transmission Neural Networks (TransNNs) introduced by Gao and Caines (2022) connect virus spread models over networks and neural networks with tuneable activation functions. This paper presents the approximation technique and the underlying assumptions employed by TransNNs in relation to the corresponding Markovian Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible (SIS) model with 2^n states, where n is the number of nodes in the network. The underlying infection paths are assumed to be stochastic with heterogeneous and time-varying transmission probabilities. We obtain the conditional probability of infection in the stochastic 2^n-state SIS epidemic model corresponding to each state configuration under mild assumptions, which enables control solutions based on Markov decision processes (MDP). Finally, MDP control with 2^n-state SIS epidemic models and optimal control with TransNNs are compared in terms of mitigating virus spread over networks through vaccination, and it is shown that TranNNs enable the generation of control laws with significant computational savings, albeit with more conservative control actions.</description>

      <title>A Control Oriented Fractional-Order Model of Lithium-ion Batteries Based on Caputo Definition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12725v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This letter proposes a fractional-order battery model based on the Caputo definition. A closed-form time-domain solution is derived, enabling a simple recursive expression for discrete-time implementation. The model requires only the current and previous time-step states in each iteration, significantly reducing memory usage compared to the conventional Gr\"{u}nwald--Letnikov (G-L) method. This recursive structure is highly compatible with filter design and online parameter identification. Experimental validation on a 40.2~Ah NCM622 cell shows that the proposed first-order model achieves voltage prediction accuracy comparable to a second-order integer-order model. The results demonstrate that the Caputo-based model offers a practical balance between accuracy and computational efficiency, making it well suited for real-time battery management systems (BMS).</description>

      <title>Secrecy Capacity of Hybrid VLC-RF Systems with Light Energy Harvesting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12739v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the performance of physical layer security (PLS) in a multi-user hybrid heterogeneous visible light communication (VLC) and radio frequency (RF) wireless communication system with simultaneous lightwave information and power transfer (SLIPT). In the considered system, VLC is used for downlink (DL) while RF is employed for uplink (UL) transmission. In addition, to support multiple users, time division multiple access (TDMA) is assumed for both DL and UL channels. In the DL, each user receives information during its allocated time slot of the TDMA frame and harvests energy from the received signal outside the time slot. The harvested energy is then used for transmitting the signal over the UL channel, which is subject to eavesdropping by an unauthorized user. Therefore, PLS is employed to protect the confidentiality of the UL information. Then, an optimization problem is formulated to solve the optimal DL and UL time slots that maximize the PLS performance given a target sum rate of the DL. We show that the problem can be cast as a difference of convex functions (DC) program, which can be solved efficiently using the DC algorithm (DCA).</description>

      <title>Connecting the Equinoctial Elements and Rodrigues Parameters: A New Set of Elements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12812v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A geometric interpretation of the equinoctial elements is given with a connection to orthogonal rotations and attitude dynamics in Euclidean 3-space. An identification is made between the equinoctial elements and classic Rodrigues parameters. A new set of equinoctial elements are developed using the modified Rodrigues parameters, thereby removing the coordinate singularity for retrograde equatorial orbits present in previous versions of these elements. A low-thrust trajectory optimization problem is set up using the new elements to numerically verify convergence for the two-point boundary problem, as compared to their predecessors.</description>

      <title>Scheduling of Flexible Manufacturing Systems Based on Place-Timed Petri Nets and Basis Reachability Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12862v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scheduling is a key decision-making process to improve the performance of flexible manufacturing systems. Place-timed Petri nets provide a formal method for graphically modeling and analyzing such systems. By generating reachability graphs and combining intelligent search algorithms, operation sequences from the initial state to the target state can be found for the underlying system. However, the reachability graph grows exponentially with the system size increases, which is the main challenge of existing methods for scheduling large systems. To this end, we develop an efficient improved beam search algorithm to optimize the makespan based on a compact representation of reachability graph called basis reachability graph. The key idea behind the proposed method is to form a state together with the basis markings and its corresponding transition sequences, and evaluate the cost of the state based on the resource idle time. Experimental results are conducted on several benchmark systems which show that the developed method improves the search efficiency while ensuring the quality of the solution compared with existing methods.</description>

      <title>Power Allocation for Delay Optimization in Device-to-Device Networks: A Graph Reinforcement Learning Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12902v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The pursuit of rate maximization in wireless communication frequently encounters substantial challenges associated with user fairness. This paper addresses these challenges by exploring a novel power allocation approach for delay optimization, utilizing graph neural networks (GNNs)-based reinforcement learning (RL) in device-to-device (D2D) communication. The proposed approach incorporates not only channel state information but also factors such as packet delay, the number of backlogged packets, and the number of transmitted packets into the components of the state information. We adopt a centralized RL method, where a central controller collects and processes the state information. The central controller functions as an agent trained using the proximal policy optimization (PPO) algorithm. To better utilize topology information in the communication network and enhance the generalization of the proposed method, we embed GNN layers into both the actor and critic networks of the PPO algorithm. This integration allows for efficient parameter updates of GNNs and enables the state information to be parameterized as a low-dimensional embedding, which is leveraged by the agent to optimize power allocation strategies. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method effectively reduces average delay while ensuring user fairness, outperforms baseline methods, and exhibits scalability and generalization capability.</description>

      <title>6G-Enabled Smart Railways</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12946v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Smart railways integrate advanced information technologies into railway operating systems to improve efficiency and reliability. Although the development of 5G has enhanced railway services, future smart railways require ultra-high speeds, ultra-low latency, ultra-high security, full coverage, and ultra-high positioning accuracy, which 5G cannot fully meet. Therefore, 6G is envisioned to provide green and efficient all-day operations, strong information security, fully automatic driving, and low-cost intelligent maintenance. To achieve these requirements, we propose an integrated network architecture leveraging communications, computing, edge intelligence, and caching in railway systems. We have conducted in-depth investigations on key enabling technologies for reliable transmissions and wireless coverage. For high-speed mobile scenarios, we propose an AI-enabled cross-domain channel modeling and orthogonal time-frequency space-time spread multiple access mechanism to alleviate the conflict between limited spectrum availability and massive user access. The roles of blockchain, edge intelligence, and privacy technologies in endogenously secure rail communications are also evaluated. We further explore the application of emerging paradigms such as integrated sensing and communications, AI-assisted Internet of Things, semantic communications, and digital twin networks for railway maintenance, monitoring, prediction, and accident warning. Finally, possible future research and development directions are discussed.</description>

      <title>Regularized Model Predictive Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12977v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In model predictive control (MPC), the choice of cost-weighting matrices and designing the Hessian matrix directly affects the trade-off between rapid state regulation and minimizing the control effort. However, traditional MPC in quadratic programming relies on fixed design matrices across the entire horizon, which can lead to suboptimal performance. This letter presents a Riccati equation-based method for adjusting the design matrix within the MPC framework, which enhances real-time performance. We employ a penalized least-squares (PLS) approach to derive a quadratic cost function for a discrete-time linear system over a finite prediction horizon. Using the method of weighting and enforcing the constraint equation by introducing a large penalty parameter, we solve the constrained optimization problem and generate control inputs for forward-shifted horizons. This process yields a recursive PLS-based Riccati equation that updates the design matrix as a regularization term in each shift, forming the foundation of the regularized MPC (Re-MPC) algorithm. To accomplish this, we provide a convergence and stability analysis of the developed algorithm. Numerical analysis demonstrates its superiority over traditional methods by allowing Riccati equation-based adjustments.</description>

      <title>RSS-Based Localization: Ensuring Consistency and Asymptotic Efficiency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the problem of signal source localization using received signal strength measurements. We begin by presenting verifiable geometric conditions for sensor deployment that ensure the model's asymptotic localizability. Then we establish the consistency and asymptotic efficiency of the maximum likelihood (ML) estimator. However, computing the ML estimator is challenging due to its reliance on solving a non-convex optimization problem. To overcome this, we propose a two-step estimator that retains the same asymptotic properties as the ML estimator while offering low computational complexity, linear in the number of measurements. The main challenge lies in obtaining a consistent estimator in the first step. To address this, we construct two linear least-squares estimation problems by applying algebraic transformations to the nonlinear measurement model, leading to closed-form solutions. In the second step, we perform a single Gauss-Newton iteration using the consistent estimator from the first step as the initialization, achieving the same asymptotic efficiency as the ML estimator. Finally, simulation results validate the theoretical property and practical effectiveness of the proposed two-step estimator.</description>

      <title>Low-regret Strategies for Energy Systems Planning in a Highly Uncertain Future</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large uncertainties in the energy transition urge decision-makers to develop low-regret strategies, i.e., strategies that perform well regardless of how the future unfolds. To address this challenge, we introduce a decision-support framework that identifies low-regret strategies in energy system planning under uncertainty. Our framework (i) automatically identifies strategies, (ii) evaluates their performance in terms of regret, (iii) assesses the key drivers of regret, and (iv) supports the decision process with intuitive decision trees, regret curves and decision maps. We apply the framework to evaluate the optimal use of biomass in the transition to net-zero energy systems, considering all major biomass utilization options: biofuels, biomethane, chemicals, hydrogen, biochar, electricity, and heat. Producing fuels and chemicals from biomass performs best across various decision-making criteria. In contrast, the current use of biomass, mainly for low-temperature heat supply, results in high regret, making it a must-avoid in the energy transition.</description>

      <title>Output behavior equivalence and simultaneous subspace identification of systems and faults</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13294v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address the problem of identifying a system subject to additive faults, while simultaneously reconstructing the fault signal via subspace methods. We do not require nominal data for the identification, neither do we impose any assumption on the class of faults, e.g., sensor or actuator faults. We show that, under mild assumptions on the fault signal, standard PI-MOESP can recover the system matrices associated to the input-output subsystem. Then we introduce the concept of output behavior equivalence, which characterizes systems with the same output behavior set, and present a method to establish this equivalence from system matrices. Finally, we show how to estimate from data the complete set of fault matrices for which there exist a fault signal with minimal dimension that explains the data.</description>

      <title>Frequency-Dependent Power Consumption Modeling of CMOS Transmitters for WNoC Architectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13310v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wireless Network-on-Chip (WNoC) systems, which wirelessly interconnect the chips of a computing system, have been proposed as a complement to existing chip-to-chip wired links. However, their feasibility depends on the availability of custom-designed high-speed, tiny, ultra-efficient transceivers. This represents a challenge due to the tradeoffs between bandwidth, area, and energy efficiency that are found as frequency increases, which suggests that there is an optimal frequency region. To aid in the search for such an optimal design point, this paper presents a behavioral model that quantifies the expected power consumption of oscillators, mixers, and power amplifiers as a function of frequency. The model is built on extensive surveys of the respective sub-blocks, all based on experimental data. By putting together the models of the three sub-blocks, a comprehensive power model is obtained, which will aid in selecting the optimal operating frequency for WNoC systems.</description>

      <title>Quantum Hardware-in-the-Loop for Optimal Power Flow in Renewable-Integrated Power Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13356v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a proof-of-concept for integrating quantum hardware with real-time digital simulator (RTDS) to model and control modern power systems, including renewable energy resources. Power flow (PF) analysis and optimal power flow (OPF) studies are conducted using RTDS coupled with Fujitsu's CMOS Digital Annealer and D-Wave's Advantage quantum processors. The adiabatic quantum power flow (AQPF) and adiabatic quantum optimal power flow (AQOPF) algorithms are used to perform PF and OPF, respectively, on quantum and quantum-inspired hardware. The experiments are performed on the IEEE 9-bus test system and a modified version that includes solar and wind farms. The findings demonstrate that the AQPF and AQOPF algorithms can accurately perform PF and OPF, yielding results that closely match those of classical Newton-Raphson (NR) solvers while also exhibiting robust convergence. Furthermore, the integration of renewable energy sources (RES) within the AQOPF framework proves effective in maintaining system stability and performance, even under variable generation conditions. These findings highlight the potential of quantum computing to significantly enhance the modeling and control of future power grids, particularly in systems with high renewable energy penetration.</description>

      <title>An Empirical Bayes approach to ARX Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Empirical Bayes inference is based on estimation of the parameters of an a priori distribution from the observed data. The estimation technique of the parameters of the prior, called hyperparameters, is based on the marginal distribution obtained by integrating the joint density of the model with respect to the prior. This is a key step which needs to be properly adapted to the problem at hand. In this paper we study Empirical Bayes inference of linear autoregressive models with inputs (ARX models) for time series and compare the performance of the marginal parametric estimator with that a full Empirical Bayesian analysis based on the estimated prior. Such a comparison, can only make sense for a (realistic) finite data length. In this setting, we propose a new estimation technique of the hyperparameters by a sequential Bayes procedure which is essentially a backward Kalman filter. It turns out that for finite data length the marginal Bayes tends to behave slightly better than the full Empirical Bayesian parameter estimator and so also in the case of slowly varying random parameters.</description>

      <title>The Value of Information in Multi-Scale Feedback Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11509v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Complex adaptive systems (CAS) can be described as systems of information flows dynamically interacting across scales in order to adapt and survive. CAS often consist of many components that work towards a shared goal, and interact across different informational scales through feedback loops, leading to their adaptation. In this context, understanding how information is transmitted among system components and across scales becomes crucial for understanding the behavior of CAS. Shannon entropy, a measure of syntactic information, is often used to quantify the size and rarity of messages transmitted between objects and observers, but it does not measure the value that information has for each specific observer. For this, semantic and pragmatic information have been conceptualized as describing the influence on an observer's knowledge and actions. Building on this distinction, we describe the architecture of multi-scale information flows in CAS through the concept of Multi-Scale Feedback Systems, and propose a series of syntactic, semantic and pragmatic information measures to quantify the value of information flows. While the measurement of values is necessarily context-dependent, we provide general guidelines on how to calculate semantic and pragmatic measures, and concrete examples of their calculation through four case studies: a robotic collective model, a collective decision-making model, a task distribution model, and a hierarchical oscillator model. Our results contribute to an informational theory of complexity, aiming to better understand the role played by information in the behavior of Multi-Scale Feedback Systems.</description>

      <title>On the Sharp Input-Output Analysis of Nonlinear Systems under Adversarial Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11688v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with learning the input-output mapping of general nonlinear dynamical systems. While the existing literature focuses on Gaussian inputs and benign disturbances, we significantly broaden the scope of admissible control inputs and allow correlated, nonzero-mean, adversarial disturbances. With our reformulation as a linear combination of basis functions, we prove that the $l_1$-norm estimator overcomes the challenges as long as the probability that the system is under adversarial attack at a given time is smaller than a certain threshold. We provide an estimation error bound that decays with the input memory length and prove its optimality by constructing a problem instance that suffers from the same bound under adversarial attacks. Our work provides a sharp input-output analysis for a generic nonlinear and partially observed system under significantly generalized assumptions compared to existing works.</description>

      <title>Robustness of Incentive Mechanisms Against System Misspecification in Congestion Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11791v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To steer the behavior of selfish, resource-sharing agents in a socio-technical system towards the direction of higher efficiency, the system designer requires accurate models of both agent behaviors and the underlying system infrastructure. For instance, traffic controllers often use road latency models to design tolls whose deployment can effectively mitigate traffic congestion. However, misspecifications of system parameters may restrict a system designer's ability to influence collective agent behavior toward efficient outcomes. In this work, we study the impact of system misspecifications on toll design for atomic congestion games. We prove that tolls designed under sufficiently minor system misspecifications, when deployed, do not introduce new Nash equilibria in atomic congestion games compared to tolls designed in the noise-free setting, implying a form of local robustness. We then upper bound the degree to which the worst-case equilibrium system performance could decrease when tolls designed under a given level of system misspecification are deployed. We validate our theoretical results via Monte-Carlo simulations as well as realizations of our worst-case guarantees.</description>

      <title>PyScrew: A Comprehensive Dataset Collection from Industrial Screw Driving Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11925v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive collection of industrial screw driving datasets designed to advance research in manufacturing process monitoring and quality control. The collection comprises six distinct datasets with over 34,000 individual screw driving operations conducted under controlled experimental conditions, capturing the multifaceted nature of screw driving processes in plastic components. Each dataset systematically investigates specific aspects: natural thread degradation patterns through repeated use (s01), variations in surface friction conditions including contamination and surface treatments (s02), diverse assembly faults with up to 27 error types (s03-s04), and fabrication parameter variations in both upper and lower workpieces through modified injection molding settings (s05-s06). We detail the standardized experimental setup used across all datasets, including hardware specifications, process phases, and data acquisition methods. The hierarchical data model preserves the temporal and operational structure of screw driving processes, facilitating both exploratory analysis and the development of machine learning models. To maximize accessibility, we provide dual access pathways: raw data through Zenodo with a persistent DOI, and a purpose-built Python library (PyScrew) that offers consistent interfaces for data loading, preprocessing, and integration with common analysis workflows. These datasets serve diverse research applications including anomaly detection, predictive maintenance, quality control system development, feature extraction methodology evaluation, and classification of specific error conditions. By addressing the scarcity of standardized, comprehensive datasets in industrial manufacturing, this collection enables reproducible research and fair comparison of analytical approaches in an area of growing importance for industrial automation.</description>

      <title>WaLRUS: Wavelets for Long-range Representation Using SSMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12161v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: State-Space Models (SSMs) have proven to be powerful tools for modeling long-range dependencies in sequential data. While the recent method known as HiPPO has demonstrated strong performance, and formed the basis for machine learning models S4 and Mamba, it remains limited by its reliance on closed-form solutions for a few specific, well-behaved bases. The SaFARi framework generalized this approach, enabling the construction of SSMs from arbitrary frames, including non-orthogonal and redundant ones, thus allowing an infinite diversity of possible "species" within the SSM family. In this paper, we introduce WaLRUS (Wavelets for Long-range Representation Using SSMs), a new implementation of SaFARi built from Daubechies wavelets.</description>

      <title>Finite-time stabilization of ladder multi-level quantum systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12303v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, a novel continuous non-smooth control strategy is proposed to achieve finite-time stabilization of ladder quantum systems. We first design a universal fractional-order control law for a ladder n-level quantum system using a distance-based Lyapunov function, and then apply the Filippov solution in the sense of differential inclusions and the LaSalle's invariance principle to prove the existence and uniqueness of the solution of the ladder system under the continuous non-smooth control law. Both asymptotic stability and finite-time stability for the ladder system is rigorously established by applying Lyapunov stability theory and finite-time stability criteria. We also derive an upper bound of the time required for convergence to an eigenstate of the intrinsic Hamiltonian. Numerical simulations on a rubidium ladder three-level atomic system validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.12350v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce Multi-CALF, an algorithm that intelligently combines reinforcement learning policies based on their relative value improvements. Our approach integrates a standard RL policy with a theoretically-backed alternative policy, inheriting formal stability guarantees while often achieving better performance than either policy individually. We prove that our combined policy converges to a specified goal set with known probability and provide precise bounds on maximum deviation and convergence time. Empirical validation on control tasks demonstrates enhanced performance while maintaining stability guarantees.</description>

      <title>A universal policy wrapper with guarantees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12354v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a universal policy wrapper for reinforcement learning agents that ensures formal goal-reaching guarantees. In contrast to standard reinforcement learning algorithms that excel in performance but lack rigorous safety assurances, our wrapper selectively switches between a high-performing base policy -- derived from any existing RL method -- and a fallback policy with known convergence properties. Base policy's value function supervises this switching process, determining when the fallback policy should override the base policy to ensure the system remains on a stable path. The analysis proves that our wrapper inherits the fallback policy's goal-reaching guarantees while preserving or improving upon the performance of the base policy. Notably, it operates without needing additional system knowledge or online constrained optimization, making it readily deployable across diverse reinforcement learning architectures and tasks.</description>

      <title>Adaptive MPC-based quadrupedal robot control under periodic disturbances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12361v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in adaptive control for reference trajectory tracking enable quadrupedal robots to perform locomotion tasks under challenging conditions. There are methods enabling the estimation of the external disturbances in terms of forces and torques. However, a specific case of disturbances that are periodic was not explicitly tackled in application to quadrupeds. This work is devoted to the estimation of the periodic disturbances with a lightweight regressor using simplified robot dynamics and extracting the disturbance properties in terms of the magnitude and frequency. Experimental evidence suggests performance improvement over the baseline static disturbance compensation. All source files, including simulation setups, code, and calculation scripts, are available on GitHub at https://github.com/aidagroup/quad-periodic-mpc.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.12492v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Congestion control (CC) crucially impacts user experience across Internet services like streaming, gaming, AR/VR, and connected cars. Traditionally, CC algorithm design seeks universal control rules that yield high performance across diverse application domains and networks. However, varying service needs and network conditions challenge this approach. We share operational experience with a system that automatically customizes congestion control logic to service needs and network conditions. We discuss design, deployment challenges, and solutions, highlighting performance benefits through case studies in streaming, gaming, connected cars, and more.
  Our system leverages PCC Vivace, an online-learning based congestion control protocol developed by researchers. Hence, along with insights from customizing congestion control, we also discuss lessons learned and modifications made to adapt PCC Vivace for real-world deployment.</description>

      <title>Robust Reinforcement Learning-Based Locomotion for Resource-Constrained Quadrupeds with Exteroceptive Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12537v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Compact quadrupedal robots are proving increasingly suitable for deployment in real-world scenarios. Their smaller size fosters easy integration into human environments. Nevertheless, real-time locomotion on uneven terrains remains challenging, particularly due to the high computational demands of terrain perception. This paper presents a robust reinforcement learning-based exteroceptive locomotion controller for resource-constrained small-scale quadrupeds in challenging terrains, which exploits real-time elevation mapping, supported by a careful depth sensor selection. We concurrently train both a policy and a state estimator, which together provide an odometry source for elevation mapping, optionally fused with visual-inertial odometry (VIO). We demonstrate the importance of positioning an additional time-of-flight sensor for maintaining robustness even without VIO, thus having the potential to free up computational resources. We experimentally demonstrate that the proposed controller can flawlessly traverse steps up to 17.5 cm in height and achieve an 80% success rate on 22.5 cm steps, both with and without VIO. The proposed controller also achieves accurate forward and yaw velocity tracking of up to 1.0 m/s and 1.5 rad/s respectively. We open-source our training code at github.com/ETH-PBL/elmap-rl-controller.</description>

      <title>MSCEKF-MIO: Magnetic-Inertial Odometry Based on Multi-State Constraint Extended Kalman Filter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12634v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To overcome the limitation of existing indoor odometry technologies which often cannot simultaneously meet requirements for accuracy cost-effectiveness, and robustness-this paper proposes a novel magnetometer array-aided inertial odometry approach, MSCEKF-MIO (Multi-State Constraint Extended Kalman Filter-based Magnetic-Inertial Odometry). We construct a magnetic field model by fitting measurements from the magnetometer array and then use temporal variations in this model-extracted from continuous observations-to estimate the carrier's absolute velocity. Furthermore, we implement the MSCEKF framework to fuse observed magnetic field variations with position and attitude estimates from inertial navigation system (INS) integration, thereby enabling autonomous, high-precision indoor relative positioning. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves superior velocity estimation accuracy and horizontal positioning precision relative to state-of-the-art magnetic array-aided INS algorithms (MAINS). On datasets with trajectory lengths of 150-250m, the proposed method yields an average horizontal position RMSE of approximately 2.5m. In areas with distinctive magnetic features, the magneto-inertial odometry achieves a velocity estimation accuracy of 0.07m/s. Consequently, the proposed method offers a novel positioning solution characterized by low power consumption, cost-effectiveness, and high reliability in complex indoor environments.</description>

      <title>2T1R Regulated Memristor Conductance Control Array Architecture for Neuromorphic Computing using 28nm CMOS Technology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12830v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Memristors are promising devices for scalable and low power, in-memory computing to improve the energy efficiency of a rising computational demand. The crossbar array architecture with memristors is used for vector matrix multiplication (VMM) and acts as kernels in neuromorphic computing. The analog conductance control in a memristor is achieved by applying voltage or current through it. A basic 1T1R array is suitable to avoid sneak path issues but suffer from wire resistances, which affects the read and write procedures. A conductance control scheme with a regulated voltage source will improve the architecture and reduce the possible potential divider effects. A change in conductance is also possible with the provision of a regulated current source and measuring the voltage across the memristors. A regulated 2T1R memristor conductance control architecture is proposed in this work, which avoids the potential divider effect and virtual ground scenario in a regular crossbar scheme, as well as conductance control by passing a regulated current through memristors. The sneak path current is not allowed to pass by the provision of ground potential to both terminals of memristors.</description>

      <title>Disentangling Coordiante Frames for Task Specific Motion Retargeting in Teleoperation using Shared Control and VR Controllers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13054v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Task performance in terms of task completion time in teleoperation is still far behind compared to humans conducting tasks directly. One large identified impact on this is the human capability to perform transformations and alignments, which is directly influenced by the point of view and the motion retargeting strategy. In modern teleoperation systems, motion retargeting is usually implemented through a one time calibration or switching modes. Complex tasks, like concatenated screwing, might be difficult, because the operator has to align (e.g. mirror) rotational and translational input commands. Recent research has shown, that the separation of translation and rotation leads to increased task performance. This work proposes a formal motion retargeting method, which separates translational and rotational input commands. This method is then included in a optimal control based trajectory planner and shown to work on a UR5e manipulator.</description>

      <title>Constraint-Aware Diffusion Guidance for Robotics: Real-Time Obstacle Avoidance for Autonomous Racing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13131v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models hold great potential in robotics due to their ability to capture complex, high-dimensional data distributions. However, their lack of constraint-awareness limits their deployment in safety-critical applications. We propose Constraint-Aware Diffusion Guidance (CoDiG), a data-efficient and general-purpose framework that integrates barrier functions into the denoising process, guiding diffusion sampling toward constraint-satisfying outputs. CoDiG enables constraint satisfaction even with limited training data and generalizes across tasks. We evaluate our framework in the challenging setting of miniature autonomous racing, where real-time obstacle avoidance is essential. Real-world experiments show that CoDiG generates safe outputs efficiently under dynamic conditions, highlighting its potential for broader robotic applications.

      <title>Learning Driven Elastic Task Multi-Connectivity Immersive Computing Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13331v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In virtual reality (VR) environments, computational tasks exhibit an elastic nature, meaning they can dynamically adjust based on various user and system constraints. This elasticity is essential for maintaining immersive experiences; however, it also introduces challenges for communication and computing in VR systems. In this paper, we investigate elastic task offloading for multi-user edge-computing-enabled VR systems with multi-connectivity, aiming to maximize the computational energy-efficiency (computational throughput per unit of energy consumed). To balance the induced communication, computation, energy consumption, and quality of experience trade-offs due to the elasticity of VR tasks, we formulate a constrained stochastic computational energy-efficiency optimization problem that integrates the multi-connectivity/multi-user action space and the elastic nature of VR computational tasks. We formulate a centralized phasic policy gradient (CPPG) framework to solve the problem of interest online, using only prior elastic task offloading statistics (energy consumption, response time, and transmission time), and task information (i.e., task size and computational intensity), while observing the induced system performance (energy consumption and latency). We further extend our approach to decentralized learning by formulating an independent phasic policy gradient (IPPG) method and a decentralized shared multi-armed bandit (DSMAB) method. We train our methods with real-world 4G, 5G, and WiGig network traces and 360 video datasets to evaluate their performance in terms of response time, energy efficiency, scalability, and delivered quality of experience. We also provide a comprehensive analysis of task size and its effect on offloading policy and system performance. In particular, we show that CPPG reduces latency by 28% and energy consumption by 78% compared to IPPG.</description>

Abstract: We investigate multitask edge-user communication-computation resource allocation for $360^\circ$ video streaming in an edge-computing enabled millimeter wave (mmWave) multi-user virtual reality system. To balance the communication-computation trade-offs that arise herein, we formulate a video quality maximization problem that integrates interdependent multitask/multi-user action spaces and rebuffering time/quality variation constraints. We formulate a deep reinforcement learning framework for \underline{m}ulti-\underline{t}ask \underline{r}ate adaptation and \underline{c}omputation distribution (MTRC) to solve the problem of interest. Our solution does not rely on a priori knowledge about the environment and uses only prior video streaming statistics (e.g., throughput, decoding time, and transmission delay), and content information, to adjust the assigned video bitrates and computation distribution, as it observes the induced streaming performance online. Moreover, to capture the task interdependence in the environment, we leverage neural network cascades to extend our MTRC method to two novel variants denoted as R1C2 and C1R2. We train all three methods with real-world mmWave network traces and $360^\circ$ video datasets to evaluate their performance in terms of expected quality of experience (QoE), viewport peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), rebuffering time, and quality variation. We outperform state-of-the-art rate adaptation algorithms, with C1R2 showing best results and achieving $5.21-6.06$ dB PSNR gains, $2.18-2.70$x rebuffering time reduction, and $4.14-4.50$ dB quality variation reduction.</description>

      <title>Deep Reinforcement Learning for Wireless Scheduling in Distributed Networked Control</title>

      <description>arXiv:2109.12562v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a joint uplink and downlink scheduling problem of a fully distributed wireless networked control system (WNCS) with a limited number of frequency channels. Using elements of stochastic systems theory, we derive a sufficient stability condition of the WNCS, which is stated in terms of both the control and communication system parameters. Once the condition is satisfied, there exists a stationary and deterministic scheduling policy that can stabilize all plants of the WNCS. By analyzing and representing the per-step cost function of the WNCS in terms of a finite-length countable vector state, we formulate the optimal transmission scheduling problem into a Markov decision process and develop a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based framework for solving it. To tackle the challenges of a large action space in DRL, we propose novel action space reduction and action embedding methods for the DRL framework that can be applied to various algorithms, including Deep Q-Network (DQN), Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG), and Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3). Numerical results show that the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms benchmark policies.</description>

      <title>A Cyclic Small Phase Theorem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.00956v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces a brand-new phase definition called the segmental phase for multi-input multi-output linear time-invariant systems. The underpinning of the definition lies in the matrix segmental phase which, as its name implies, is graphically based on the smallest circular segment covering the matrix normalized numerical range in the unit disk. The matrix segmental phase has the crucial product eigen-phase bound, which makes itself stand out from several existing phase notions in the literature. The proposed bound paves the way for stability analysis of a single-loop cyclic feedback system consisting of multiple subsystems. A cyclic small phase theorem is then established as our main result, which requires the loop system phase to lie between $-\pi$ and $\pi$. The proposed theorem complements a cyclic version of the celebrated small gain theorem. In addition, a generalization of the proposed theorem is made via the use of angular scaling techniques for reducing conservatism.</description>

Abstract: Automated vehicle (AV) platooning has the potential to improve the safety, operational, and energy efficiency of surface transportation systems by limiting or eliminating human involvement in the driving tasks. The theoretical validity of the AV platooning strategies has been established and practical applications are being tested under real-world conditions. The emergence of sensors, communication, and control strategies has resulted in rapid and constant evolution of AV platooning strategies. In this paper, we review the state-of-the-art knowledge in AV longitudinal platoon formation using a five-component platooning framework, which includes vehicle model, information-receiving process, information flow topology, spacing policy, and controller and discuss the advantages and limitations of the components. Based on the discussion about existing strategies and associated limitations, potential future research directions are presented.</description>

      <title>Economic Capacity Withholding Bounds of Competitive Energy Storage Bidders</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.05705v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Economic withholding in electricity markets refers to generators bidding higher than their true marginal fuel cost, and is a typical approach to exercising market power. However, existing market designs require storage to design bids strategically based on their own future price predictions, motivating storage to conduct economic withholding without assuming market power. As energy storage takes up more significant roles in wholesale electricity markets, understanding its motivations for economic withholding and the consequent effects on social welfare becomes increasingly vital. This paper derives a theoretical framework to study the economic capacity withholding behavior of storage participating in competitive electricity markets and validate our results in simulations based on the ISO New England system. We demonstrate that storage bids can reach unbounded high levels under conditions where future price predictions show bounded expectations but unbounded deviations. Conversely, in scenarios with peak price limitations, we show the upper bounds of storage bids are grounded in bounded price expectations. Most importantly, we show that storage capacity withholding can potentially lower the overall system cost when price models account for system uncertainties. Our paper reveals energy storage is not a market manipulator but an honest player contributing to the social welfare. It helps electricity market researchers and operators better understand the economic withholding behavior of storage and reform market policies to maximize storage contributing to a cost-efficient decolonization.</description>

      <title>Matrix-Valued Measures and Wishart Statistics for Target Tracking Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00861v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ensuring sufficiently accurate models is crucial in target tracking systems. If the assumed models deviate too much from the truth, the tracking performance might be severely degraded. While the models are usually defined using multivariate conditions, the measures used to validate them are most often scalar-valued. In this paper, we propose matrix-valued measures for both offline and online assessment of target tracking systems. Recent results from Wishart statistics, and approximations thereof, are adapted and it is shown how these can be incorporated to infer statistical properties for the eigenvalues of the proposed measures. In addition, we relate these results to the statistics of the baseline measures. Finally, the applicability of the proposed measures are demonstrated using two important problems in target tracking: (i) distributed track fusion design; and (ii) filter model mismatch detection.</description>

      <title>Safety Critical Control for Nonlinear Systems with Complex Input Constraints</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09534v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel Control Barrier Function (CBF) based controller for nonlinear systems with complex, time-varying input constraints. To deal with these constraints, we introduce an auxiliary control input to transform the original system into an augmented one, thus reformulating the constrained-input problem into a constrained-output one. This transformation simplifies the Quadratic Programming (QP) formulation and enhances compatibility with the CBF framework. As a result, the proposed method can systematically address the complex, time-varying, and state-dependent input constraints. The efficacy of the proposed approach is validated using numerical examples.</description>

      <title>Modeling Nonlinear Oscillator Networks Using Physics-Informed Hybrid Reservoir Computing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.05867v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Surrogate modeling of non-linear oscillator networks remains challenging due to discrepancies between simplified analytical models and real-world complexity. To bridge this gap, we investigate hybrid reservoir computing, combining reservoir computing with "expert" analytical models. Simulating the absence of an exact model, we first test the surrogate models with parameter errors in their expert model. Second, in a residual physics task, we assess their performance when their expert model lacks key non-linear coupling terms present in an extended ground-truth model. We focus on short-term forecasting across diverse dynamical regimes, evaluating the use of these surrogates for control applications. We show that hybrid reservoir computers generally outperform standard reservoir computers and exhibit greater robustness to parameter tuning. This advantage is less pronounced in the residual physics task. Notably, unlike standard reservoir computers, the performance of the hybrid does not degrade when crossing an observed spectral radius threshold. Furthermore, there is good performance for dynamical regimes not accessible to the expert model, demonstrating the contribution of the reservoir.</description>

      <title>State-Dependent Conformal Perception Bounds for Neuro-Symbolic Verification of Autonomous Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.21308v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It remains a challenge to provide safety guarantees for autonomous systems with neural perception and control. A typical approach obtains symbolic bounds on perception error (e.g., using conformal prediction) and performs verification under these bounds. However, these bounds can lead to drastic conservatism in the resulting end-to-end safety guarantee. This paper proposes an approach to synthesize symbolic perception error bounds that serve as an optimal interface between perception performance and control verification. The key idea is to consider our error bounds to be heteroskedastic with respect to the system's state -- not time like in previous approaches. These bounds can be obtained with two gradient-free optimization algorithms. We demonstrate that our bounds lead to tighter safety guarantees than the state-of-the-art in a case study on a mountain car.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.00192v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a potent paradigm for autonomous decision-making in complex environments. However, the integration of event-driven decision processes within RL remains a challenge. This paper presents a novel architecture that combines a Discrete Event Supervisory (DES) model with a standard RL framework to create a hybrid decision-making system. Our model leverages the DES's capabilities in managing event-based dynamics with the RL agent's adaptability to continuous states and actions, facilitating a more robust and flexible control strategy in systems characterized by both continuous and discrete events. The DES model operates alongside the RL agent, enhancing the policy's performance with event-based insights, while the environment's state transitions are governed by a mechanistic model. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach through simulations that show improved performance metrics over traditional RL implementations. Our results suggest that this integrated approach holds promise for applications ranging from industrial automation to intelligent traffic systems, where discrete event handling is paramount.</description>

      <title>Electrifying Heavy-Duty Trucks: Battery-Swapping vs Fast Charging</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.08080v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The advantages and disadvantages of Battery Swapping Stations (BSS) for heavy-duty trucks are poorly understood, relative to Fast Charging Stations (FCS) systems. This study evaluates these two charging mechanisms for electric heavy-duty trucks, aiming to compare the systems' efficiency and identify their optimal design. A model was developed to address the planning and operation of BSS in a charging network, considering in-station batteries as assets for various services. We assess performance metrics including transportation efficiency and battery utilization efficiency. Our evaluation reveals that BSS significantly increased transportation efficiency by reducing vehicle downtime compared to fast charging, but may require more batteries. BSS with medium-sized batteries offers improved transportation efficiency in terms of time and labor. FCS-reliant trucks require larger batteries to compensate for extended charging times. To understand the trade-off between these two metrics, a cost-benefit analysis was performed under different scenarios involving potential shifts in battery prices and labor costs. Additionally, BSS shows potential for significant $\text{CO}_2$ emission reductions and increased profitability through energy arbitrage and grid ancillary services. These findings emphasize the importance of integrating BSS into future electric truck charging networks and adopting carbon-aware operational frameworks.</description>

      <title>System Identification Under Bounded Noise: Optimal Rates Beyond Least Squares</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.16817v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: System identification is a fundamental problem in control and learning, particularly in high-stakes applications where data efficiency is critical. Classical approaches, such as the ordinary least squares estimator (OLS), achieve an $O(1/\sqrt{T})$ convergence rate under Gaussian noise assumptions, where $T$ is the number of samples. This rate has been shown to match the lower bound. However, in many practical scenarios, noise is known to be bounded, opening the possibility of improving sample complexity. In this work, we establish the minimax lower bound for system identification under bounded noise, proving that the $O(1/T)$ convergence rate is indeed optimal. We further demonstrate that OLS remains limited to an $\Omega(1/\sqrt{T})$ convergence rate, making it fundamentally suboptimal in the presence of bounded noise. Finally, we instantiate two natural variations of OLS that obtain the optimal sample complexity.</description>

      <title>CP-NCBF: A Conformal Prediction-based Approach to Synthesize Verified Neural Control Barrier Functions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.17395v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) are a practical approach for designing safety-critical controllers, but constructing them for arbitrary nonlinear dynamical systems remains a challenge. Recent efforts have explored learning-based methods, such as neural CBFs (NCBFs), to address this issue. However, ensuring the validity of NCBFs is difficult due to potential learning errors. In this letter, we propose a novel framework that leverages split-conformal prediction to generate formally verified neural CBFs with probabilistic guarantees based on a user-defined error rate, referred to as CP-NCBF. Unlike existing methods that impose Lipschitz constraints on neural CBF-leading to scalability limitations and overly conservative safe sets--our approach is sample-efficient, scalable, and results in less restrictive safety regions. We validate our framework through case studies on obstacle avoidance in autonomous driving and geo-fencing of aerial vehicles, demonstrating its ability to generate larger and less conservative safe sets compared to conventional techniques.</description>

      <title>Timely Trajectory Reconstruction in Finite Buffer Remote Tracking Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.00849v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Remote tracking systems play a critical role in applications such as IoT, monitoring, surveillance and healthcare. In such systems, maintaining both real-time state awareness (for online decision making) and accurate reconstruction of historical trajectories (for offline post-processing) are essential. While the Age of Information (AoI) metric has been extensively studied as a measure of freshness, it does not capture the accuracy with which past trajectories can be reconstructed. In this work, we investigate reconstruction error as a complementary metric to AoI, addressing the trade-off between timely updates and historical accuracy. Specifically, we consider three policies, each prioritizing different aspects of information management: Keep-Old, Keep-Fresh, and our proposed Inter-arrival-Aware dropping policy. We compare these policies in terms of impact on both AoI and reconstruction error in a remote tracking system with a finite buffer. Through theoretical analysis and numerical simulations of queueing behavior, we demonstrate that while the Keep-Fresh policy minimizes AoI, it does not necessarily minimize reconstruction error. In contrast, our proposed Inter-arrival-Aware dropping policy dynamically adjusts packet retention decisions based on generation times, achieving a balance between AoI and reconstruction error. Our results provide key insights into the design of efficient buffer management policies for resource-constrained IoT networks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.08190v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The control of a Dubins Vehicle when subjected to a loss of control effectiveness in the turning rate is considered. A complex state-space representation is used to model the vehicle dynamics. An adaptive control design is proposed, with the underlying stability analysis guaranteeing closed-loop boundedness and tracking of a desired path. It is shown that a path constructed by waypoints and a minimum turn radius can be specified using a reference model which can be followed by the closed loop system. The control design utilizes the complex representation as well as a PID controller for the nominal closed-loop. How the design can be modified to ensure to ensure path following even in the presence input constraints is also discussed. Simulation studies are carried out to complement the theoretical derivations.</description>

Abstract: This study presents an innovative approach to Model Predictive Control (MPC) by leveraging the powerful combination of Koopman theory and Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL). By transforming nonlinear dynamical systems into a higher-dimensional linear regime, the Koopman operator facilitates the linear treatment of nonlinear behaviors, paving the way for more efficient control strategies. Our methodology harnesses the predictive prowess of Koopman-based models alongside the optimization capabilities of DRL, particularly using the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm, to enhance the controller's performance. The resulting end-to-end learning framework refines the predictive control policies to cater to specific operational tasks, optimizing both performance and economic efficiency. We validate our approach through rigorous NMPC and eNMPC case studies, demonstrating that the Koopman-RL controller outperforms traditional controllers by achieving higher stability, superior constraint satisfaction, and significant cost savings. The findings indicate that our model can be a robust tool for complex control tasks, offering valuable insights into future applications of RL in MPC.</description>

      <title>Integrating Koopman theory and Lyapunov stability for enhanced model predictive control in nonlinear systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08139v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper delves into the challenges posed by the increasing complexity of modern control systems, specifically focusing on bilinear systems, a prevalent subclass of non-linear systems characterized by state dynamics influenced by the interaction of state and control variables. Traditional control strategies, such as PID controllers, often fall short in adequately addressing the intricacies of such systems due to their predictive limitations. To bridge this gap, we introduce Model Predictive Control (MPC), a sophisticated technique that utilizes system models to forecast future behaviors, allowing for the computation of an optimal control sequence by minimizing deviations and control efforts. The Koopman operator emerges as a pivotal tool in this framework by providing a means to linearize the nonlinear dynamics of bilinear systems. By integrating the principles of Lyapunov theory with the linearizing capabilities of the Koopman operator into the MPC framework, we give rise to Koopman Lyapunov-based Model Predictive Control (Koopman LMPC). This approach not only retains MPC's predictive capabilities but also harnesses the Koopman operator's ability to transform complex nonlinear behaviors into a linear framework, thereby enhancing the robustness and applicability of LMPC. With the stability assurances from Lyapunov theory, Koopman LMPC presents a robust solution to effectively control and stabilize bilinear systems. The paper underscores the efficacy of Koopman LMPC, emphasizing its significance in achieving optimal performance and system stability, marking it as a promising approach for the future of advanced control systems.</description>

      <title>Non-Blocking Robustness Analysis in Discrete Event Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08166v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a mathematical framework for characterizing state blocking in discrete event systems (DES) under transition deletions. We introduce a path-based analysis approach that determines whether systems maintain non-blocking properties when transitions are removed. Through formal analysis and case studies, we establish three key contributions: a mathematical characterization of transition-induced blocking with necessary and sufficient conditions, a definition of robust deviations that preserve non-blocking properties, and an algorithm for identifying critical transitions and analyzing system behavior under deletions. Our algorithm reduces computational complexity by leveraging minimal blocking sets, achieving significant reduction in computational requirements. We demonstrate the framework's effectiveness through manufacturing system and autonomous vehicle case studies, showing substantial improvements in identifying critical transitions and predicting potential blocking scenarios across different application domains.</description>

      <title>Stability and Convergence Analysis of Multi-Agent Consensus with Communication Delays: A Lambert W Function Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09897v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the effect of constant time delay in weakly connected multi-agent systems modeled by double integrator dynamics. A novel analytical approach is proposed to establish an upper bound on the permissible time delay that ensures stability and consensus convergence. The analysis employs the Lambert W function method in higher-dimensional systems to derive explicit conditions under which consensus is achieved. The theoretical results are rigorously proven and provide insight into the allowable delay margins. The analysis applies to general leaderless undirected network topologies. The framework also accounts for complex and realistic delays, including non-commensurate communication delays. Numerical examples are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Robust Path Recommendations During Public Transit Disruptions Under Demand Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.01437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2201.01437v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When there are significant service disruptions in public transit systems, passengers usually need guidance to find alternative paths. This paper proposes a path recommendation model to mitigate congestion during public transit disruptions. Passengers with different origins, destinations, and departure times are recommended with different paths such that the system travel time is minimized. We model the path recommendation problem as an optimal flow problem with uncertain demand information. To tackle the lack of analytical formulation of travel times due to capacity constraints, we propose a simulation-based first-order approximation to transform the original problem into a linear program. Uncertainties in demand are modeled using robust optimization to protect the path recommendation strategies against inaccurate estimates. A real-world rail disruption scenario in the Chicago Transit Authority (CTA) system is used as a case study. Results show that even without considering uncertainty, the nominal model can reduce the system travel time by 9.1% (compared to the status quo), and outperforms the benchmark capacity-based path recommendation. The average travel time of passengers in the incident line (i.e., passengers receiving recommendations) is reduced more (-20.6% compared to the status quo). After incorporating the demand uncertainty, the robust model can further reduce system travel times. The best robust model can decrease the average travel time of incident-line passengers by 2.91% compared to the nominal model. The improvement of robust models is more prominent when the actual demand pattern is close to the worst-case demand.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement Learning for Control of Evolutionary and Ecological Processes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.03340v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As Evolutionary Dynamics moves from the realm of theory into application, algorithms are needed to move beyond simple models. Yet few such methods exist in the literature. Ecological and physiological factors are known to be central to evolution in realistic contexts, but accounting for them generally renders problems intractable to existing methods. We introduce a formulation of evolutionary games which accounts for ecology and physiology by modeling both as computations and use this to analyze the problem of directed evolution via methods from Reinforcement Learning. This combination enables us to develop first-of-their-kind results on the algorithmic problem of learning to control an evolving population of cells. We prove a complexity bound on eco-evolutionary control in situations with limited prior knowledge of cellular physiology or ecology, give the first results on the most general version of the mathematical problem of directed evolution, and establish a new link between AI and biology.</description>

      <title>Carbon Footprint Reduction for Sustainable Data Centers in Real-Time</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14092v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As machine learning workloads significantly increase energy consumption, sustainable data centers with low carbon emissions are becoming a top priority for governments and corporations worldwide. This requires a paradigm shift in optimizing power consumption in cooling and IT loads, shifting flexible loads based on the availability of renewable energy in the power grid, and leveraging battery storage from the uninterrupted power supply in data centers, using collaborative agents. The complex association between these optimization strategies and their dependencies on variable external factors like weather and the power grid carbon intensity makes this a hard problem. Currently, a real-time controller to optimize all these goals simultaneously in a dynamic real-world setting is lacking. We propose a Data Center Carbon Footprint Reduction (DC-CFR) multi-agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) framework that optimizes data centers for the multiple objectives of carbon footprint reduction, energy consumption, and energy cost. The results show that the DC-CFR MARL agents effectively resolved the complex interdependencies in optimizing cooling, load shifting, and energy storage in real-time for various locations under real-world dynamic weather and grid carbon intensity conditions. DC-CFR significantly outperformed the industry standard ASHRAE controller with a considerable reduction in carbon emissions (14.5%), energy usage (14.4%), and energy cost (13.7%) when evaluated over one year across multiple geographical regions.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear integral extension of PID control with improved convergence of perturbed second-order dynamic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02502v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nonlinear extension of the integral part of a standard proportional-integral-derivative (PID) feedback control is proposed for perturbed second-order systems. The approach is model-free and requires solely the Lipschitz boundedness of the unknown matched perturbations. For constant disturbances, the global asymptotic stability is shown based on the circle criterion. For Lipschitz perturbations, an ultimately bounded output error is provided based on the steady-state behavior in frequency domain. Also the transient response to the stepwise disturbances is analyzed for the control tuning. Based on the developed analysis, the design recommendations are formulated as a step by step procedure. It is also discussed how the proposed control is applicable to second-order systems extended by additional (parasitic) actuator dynamics with low-pass characteristics. The proposed nonlinear control is proven to outperform its linear PID counterpart during the settling phase, i.e. at convergence of the residual output error. An experimental case study of the second-order system with an additional actuator dynamics and considerable perturbations is demonstrated to confirm and benchmark the control performance.</description>

      <title>Two-Player Zero-Sum Hybrid Games</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10107v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we formulate a two-player zero-sum game under dynamic constraints defined by hybrid dynamical equations. The game consists of a min-max problem involving a cost functional that depends on the actions and resulting solutions to the hybrid system, defined as functions of hybrid time and, hence, can flow or jump. A terminal set conveniently defined allows to recast both finite and infinite horizon problems. We present sufficient conditions given in terms of Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman-Isaacs-like equations to guarantee to attain a solution to the game. It is shown that when the players select the optimal strategy, the value function can be evaluated without computing solutions to the hybrid system. Under additional conditions, we show that the optimal state-feedback laws render a set of interest asymptotically stable for the resulting hybrid closed-loop system. Applications of these games, presented here as robust control problems, include disturbance rejection and security problems.</description>

      <title>Characterization of input-to-output stability for infinite-dimensional systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06013v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove a superposition theorem for input-to-output stability (IOS) of a broad class of nonlinear infinite-dimensional systems with outputs including both continuous-time and discrete-time systems. It contains, as a special case, the superposition theorem for input-to-state stability (ISS) of infinite-dimensional systems and the IOS superposition theorem for systems of ordinary differential equations known from the literature.
  To achieve this result, we introduce and examine several novel stability and attractivity concepts for infinite-dimensional systems with outputs: We prove criteria for the uniform limit property for systems with outputs, several of which are new already for systems with full-state output, we provide superposition theorems for systems which satisfy both the output Lagrange stability (OL) and IOS, give a sufficient condition for OL and characterize ISS in terms of IOS and input/output-to-state stability. Finally, by means of counterexamples, we illustrate the challenges appearing on the way of extension of the superposition theorems from the literature to infinite-dimensional systems with outputs.</description>

      <title>Enhancing LLMs for Power System Simulations: A Feedback-driven Multi-agent Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16707v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The integration of experimental technologies with large language models (LLMs) is transforming scientific research. It positions AI as a versatile research assistant rather than a mere problem-solving tool. In the field of power systems, however, managing simulations -- one of the essential experimental technologies -- remains a challenge for LLMs due to their limited domain-specific knowledge, restricted reasoning capabilities, and imprecise handling of simulation parameters. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a feedback-driven, multi-agent framework. It incorporates three proposed modules: an enhanced retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) module, an improved reasoning module, and a dynamic environmental acting module with an error-feedback mechanism. Validated on 69 diverse tasks from Daline and MATPOWER, this framework achieves success rates of 93.13% and 96.85%, respectively. It significantly outperforms ChatGPT 4o, o1-preview, and the fine-tuned GPT-4o, which all achieved a success rate lower than 30% on complex tasks. Additionally, the proposed framework also supports rapid, cost-effective task execution, completing each simulation in approximately 30 seconds at an average cost of 0.014 USD for tokens. Overall, this adaptable framework lays a foundation for developing intelligent LLM-based assistants for human researchers, facilitating power system research and beyond.</description>

      <title>On the Surprising Effectiveness of Spectrum Clipping in Learning Stable Linear Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01168v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When learning stable linear dynamical systems from data, three important properties are desirable: i) predictive accuracy, ii) provable stability, and iii) computational efficiency. Unconstrained minimization of reconstruction errors leads to high accuracy and efficiency but cannot guarantee stability. Existing methods to enforce stability often preserve accuracy, but do so only at the cost of increased computation. In this work, we investigate if a straightforward approach can simultaneously offer all three desiderata of learning stable linear systems. Specifically, we consider a post-hoc approach that manipulates the spectrum of the learned system matrix that was computed using unconstrained least squares. We call this approach spectrum clipping (SC) as it involves eigen decomposition and subsequent reconstruction of the system matrix after clipping any eigenvalues that are larger than one to one (without altering the eigenvectors). Through comprehensive experiments involving two different applications and publicly available benchmark datasets, we show that this simple technique can efficiently learn highly-accurate linear systems that are provably-stable. Notably, we find that SC can match or outperform strong baselines while being orders-of-magnitude faster. We also show that SC can be readily combined with Koopman operators to learn stable nonlinear dynamics, such as those underlying complex dexterous manipulation skills involving multi-fingered robotic hands. Finally, we find that SC can learn stable robot policies even when the training data includes unsuccessful or truncated demonstrations. Our codes and dataset can be found at https://github.com/GT-STAR-Lab/spec_clip.</description>

Abstract: The inertia tensor is an important parameter in many engineering fields, but measuring it can be cumbersome and involve multiple experiments or accurate and expensive equipment. We propose a method to measure the moment of inertia tensor of a rigid body from a single spinning throw, by attaching a small and inexpensive stand-alone measurement device consisting of a gyroscope, accelerometer and a reaction wheel. The method includes a compensation for the increase of moment of inertia due to adding the measurement device to the body, and additionally obtains the location of the centre of gravity of the body as an intermediate result. Experiments performed with known rigid bodies show that the mean accuracy is around 2%.</description>

      <title>Value-Oriented Forecast Combinations for Unit Commitment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.13677v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Value-oriented forecasts for two-stage power system operational problems have been demonstrated to reduce cost, but prove to be computationally challenging for large-scale systems because the underlying optimization problem must be internalized into the forecast model training. Therefore, existing approaches typically scale poorly in the usable training data or require relaxations of the underlying optimization. This paper presents a method for value-oriented forecast combinations using progressive hedging, which unlocks high-fidelity, at-scale models and large-scale datasets in training. We also derive one-shot training model for reference and study how different modifications of the training model impact the solution quality.</description>

Abstract: We study the problem of certifying the stability of closed-loop systems under control policies derived from optimal control or reinforcement learning (RL). Classical Lyapunov methods require a strict step-wise decrease in the Lyapunov function but such a certificate is difficult to construct for a learned control policy. The value function associated with an RL policy is a natural Lyapunov function candidate but it is not clear how it should be modified. To gain intuition, we first study the linear quadratic regulator (LQR) problem and make two key observations. First, a Lyapunov function can be obtained from the value function of an LQR policy by augmenting it with a residual term related to the system dynamics and stage cost. Second, the classical Lyapunov decrease requirement can be relaxed to a generalized Lyapunov condition requiring only decrease on average over multiple time steps. Using this intuition, we consider the nonlinear setting and formulate an approach to learn generalized Lyapunov functions by augmenting RL value functions with neural network residual terms. Our approach successfully certifies the stability of RL policies trained on Gymnasium and DeepMind Control benchmarks. We also extend our method to jointly train neural controllers and stability certificates using a multi-step Lyapunov loss, resulting in larger certified inner approximations of the region of attraction compared to the classical Lyapunov approach. Overall, our formulation enables stability certification for a broad class of systems with learned policies by making certificates easier to construct, thereby bridging classical control theory and modern learning-based methods.</description>
