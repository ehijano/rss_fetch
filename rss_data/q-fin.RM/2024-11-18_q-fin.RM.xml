      <title>Some remarks on the effect of risk sharing and diversification for infinite mean risks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The basic principle of any version of insurance is the paradigm that exchanging risk by sharing it in a pool is beneficial for the participants. In case of independent risks with a finite mean this is the case for risk averse decision makers. The situation may be very different in case of infinite mean models. In that case it is known that risk sharing may have a negative effect, which is sometimes called the nondiversification trap. This phenomenon is well known for infinite mean stable distributions. In a series of recent papers similar results for infinite mean Pareto and Fr\'echet distributions have been obtained. We further investigate this property by showing that many of these results can be obtained as special cases of a simple result demonstrating that this holds for any distribution that is more skewed than a Cauchy distribution. We also relate this to the situation of deadly catastrophic risks, where we assume a positive probability for an infinite value. That case gives a very simple intuition why this phenomenon can occur for such catastrophic risks. We also mention several open problems and conjectures in this context.</description>

      <title>The role of debt valuation factors in systemic risk assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The fragility of financial systems was starkly demonstrated in early 2023 through a cascade of major bank failures in the United States, including the second, third, and fourth largest collapses in the US history. The highly interdependent financial networks and the associated high systemic risk have been deemed the cause of the crashes. The goal of this paper is to enhance existing systemic risk analysis frameworks by incorporating essential debt valuation factors. Our results demonstrate that these additional elements substantially influence the outcomes of risk assessment. Notably, by modeling the dynamic relationship between interest rates and banks' credibility, our framework can detect potential cascading failures that standard approaches might miss. The proposed risk assessment methodology can help regulatory bodies prevent future failures, while also allowing companies to more accurately predict turmoil periods and strengthen their survivability during such events.</description>
