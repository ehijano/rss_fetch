      <title>Learning dynamical behaviors in physical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07856v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physical learning is an emerging paradigm in science and engineering whereby (meta)materials acquire desired macroscopic behaviors by exposure to examples. So far, it has been applied to static properties such as elastic moduli and self-assembled structures encoded in minima of an energy landscape. Here, we extend this paradigm to dynamic functionalities, such as motion and shape change, that are instead encoded in limit cycles or pathways of a dynamical system. We identify the two ingredients needed to learn time-dependent behaviors irrespective of experimental platforms: (i) learning rules with time delays and (ii) exposure to examples that break time-reversal symmetry during training. After providing a hands-on demonstration of these requirements using programmable LEGO toys, we turn to realistic particle-based simulations where the training rules are not programmed on a computer. Instead, we elucidate how they emerge from physico-chemical processes involving the causal propagation of fields, like in recent experiments on moving oil droplets with chemotactic signalling. Our trainable particles can self-assemble into structures that move or change shape on demand, either by retrieving the dynamic behavior previously seen during training, or by learning on the fly. This rich phenomenology is captured by a modified Hopfield spin model amenable to analytical treatment. The principles illustrated here provide a step towards von Neumann's dream of engineering synthetic living systems that adapt to the environment.</description>

      <title>Synchronous and Asynchronous Updates of Active Ising Spins in One Dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: How do update rules affect the dynamical and steady state properties of a flock? In this study, we have explored the active Ising spins (s = +-1) in one dimension, where spin updates its orientation according to the Metropolis algorithm (based on the neighbors) via two different update rules. (i) Parallel, and (ii) Random-sequential. We explore the effect of Parallel and Random-sequential updates on the dynamical properties of flocks in one dimension. Due to the inherent asynchronous nature of the Random-sequential update, the directional switching of the flock is increased compared to the Parallel one. The nature of phase transition is affected by the difference in the updating mechanism: discontinuous for Parallel and continuous for Random-sequential updates.</description>

      <title>Dilute suspensions of Janus rods: the role of bond and shape anisotropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08083v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nanometer-sized clusters are often targeted due to their potential applications as nanoreactors or storage/delivery devices. One route to assemble and stabilize finite structures consists in imparting directional bonding patterns between the nanoparticles. When only a portion of the particle surface is able to form an inter-particle bond, finite-size aggregates such as micelles and vesicles may form. Building on this approach, we combine particle shape anisotropy with the directionality of the bonding patterns and investigate the combined effect of particle elongation and surface patchiness on the low density assembly scenario. To this aim, we study the assembly of tip-functionalised Janus hard spherocylinder by means of Monte Carlo simulations. By exploring the effects of changing the interaction strength and range at different packing fractions, we highlight the role played by shape and bond anisotropy on the emerging aggregates (micelles, vesicles, elongated micelles and lamellae). We observe that shape anisotropy plays a crucial role in suppressing phases that are typical to spherical Janus nanoparticles and that a careful tuning of the interaction parameters allows to promote the formation of spherical micelles. These finite-size spherical clusters composed of elongated particles might offer more interstitials and larger surface areas than those offered by micelles of spherical or almost-spherical units, thus enhancing their storage and catalytic properties.</description>

      <title>Investigating the Interplay Between Aging and Rejuvenation in Spin Glasses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07628v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Aging in a single crystal spin glass ($\mathrm{Cu}_{0.92}\mathrm{Mn}_{0.08}$) has been measured using ac susceptibility techniques over a temperature range of $0.3 - 0.8 \, T_g$. In these studies, traditional aging experiments (or ``quench'' aging protocols) are compared to aging curves constructed from finite-cooling-rate curves. By comparing the growth rates of spin glass order between the two types of aging curves, it is determined that quantitative comparisons between protocols which are taken by quenching and protocols using a finite cooling rate are not possible without a deeper understanding of the interplay between aging and rejuvenation. We then demonstrate that the data presented indicate that rejuvenation, rather than cumulative aging, is the cause for the discrepancies between the two growth rates.</description>

      <title>Conformable Derivative Approach to Granular Gases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07748v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Proper modeling of complex systems requires innovative mathematical tools. In this sense, we sought to use deformed or fractal derivatives for studying the dynamics of systems, particularly those, such as granular gases, in which the description of the dynamics can be done by using the stretched exponential probability densities. In this contribution we draw up three results of this application of mathematical tools. The first result shows that when we use constraints with finite momentum and the principle of maximum entropy, the Kohlrausch--Williams--Watts function, known as stretched exponential, emerges naturally and in a simpler way, when compared to results in the literature. Next, we obtain generalized expressions for the Langevin equation, as well as its solutions for three different deformed derivatives, including those connected with nonaddictive statistical mechanics. The Haff's-like law for granular gases are obtained. Next, we calculate the partition function $Z$ for a granular gas system by building up the probability density in terms of the stretched exponential function. From this partition function, we determine the internal energy of the system as well as the specific heat, both dependent on temperature. The consistency with classical approach of kinetic theory for ideal gases was verified.</description>

      <title>Wobbling and Migrating Ferrofluid Droplets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08289v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Active components incorporated in materials generate motion by inducing conformational changes in response to external fields. Magnetic fields are particularly interesting as they can actuate materials remotely. Millimeter-sized ferrofluid droplets placed on a solid surface, surrounded by an ambient gas phase, are shown here to migrate under a rotating magnetic field due to the periodic deformation of the liquid-gas interface. This interface wobbling leads to droplet migration with speeds that increase as the amplitude and frequency of the magnetic field increase. In addition to migrating in a controlled manner, we demonstrate the ability of magnetic droplets to clean surface impurities and transport cargo.</description>

      <title>Sequence Complexity and Monomer Rigidity Control the Morphologies and Aging Dynamics of Protein Aggregates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08362v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Protein aggregates exhibit diverse morphology, exemplified by amyloid fibrils, gel-like structures, and liquid-like condensates. Differences in the morphologies in identical proteins play important functional roles in several diseases. Simulations using a minimal model show that such structures are encoded in the sequence complexity and bending rigidity of the monomers. The low-complexity flexible sequences form liquid droplets, whose relaxation dynamics are ergodic. In contrast, rigid low and high-complexity sequences, which form ordered nematic fibril-like structures and amorphous aggregates, exhibit heterogenous, non-ergodic dynamics. The relaxation times under these conditions increase as the waiting time increases, which is a signature of aging. The implications of our findings for aging in intrinsically disordered proteins and repeat RNA sequences are outlined.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.08421v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Randomly moving active particles can be herded into directed motion by asymmetric geometric structures. Although such a rectification process has been extensively studied due to its fundamental and technological relevance, a comprehensive understanding of active matter rectification based on single particle dynamics remains elusive. Here, by combining experiments, simulations, and theory, we study the directed transport and energetics of swimming bacteria navigating through funnel-shaped obstacles -- a paradigmatic model of rectification of living active matter. We develop a microscopic parameter-free model for bacterial rectification, which quantitatively explains experimental and numerical observations and predicts the optimal geometry for the maximum rectification efficiency. Furthermore, we quantify the degree of time irreversibility and measure the extractable work associated with bacterial rectification. Our study provides quantitative solutions to long-standing questions on bacterial rectification and establishes a generic relationship between time irreversibility, particle fluxes, and extractable work, shedding light on the energetics of non-equilibrium rectification processes in living systems.</description>

      <title>A mathematical approach to mechanical properties of networks in thermoplastic elastomers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.14962v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We employ a mathematical model to analyze stress chains in thermoplastic elastomers (TPEs) with a microphase-separated spherical structure composed of triblock copolymers. The model represents stress chains during uniaxial and biaxial extensions using networks of spherical domains connected by bridges. We advance previous research and discuss permanent strain and other aspects of the network. It explores the dependency of permanent strain on the extension direction, using the average of tension tensors to represent isotropic material behavior. The concept of deviation angle is introduced to measure network anisotropy and is shown to play an essential role in predicting permanent strain when a network is extended in a specific direction. The paper also discusses methods to create a new network structure using various polymers.</description>

      <title>Universal equation describes the shape of air bubbles trapped in ice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.13456v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Water usually contains dissolved gases, and because freezing is a purifying process these gases must be expelled for ice to form. Bubbles appear at the freezing front and are trapped in ice, making pores. These pores come in a range of sizes from microns to millimeters and their shapes are peculiar; never spherical but elongated, and usually fore-aft asymmetric. We show that these remarkable shapes result of a delicate balance between freezing, capillarity, and mass diffusion. A non-linear ordinary differential equation suffices to describe the bubbles, with only two non-dimensional parameters representing the supersaturation and the freezing rate. Our experiments provide us with a large variety of pictures of bubble shapes. We show that all of them have their rounded tip well described by an asymptotic regime of the differential equation, and that most of them can have their full shape quantitatively matched by a full solution. This enables the measurement of the freezing conditions of ice samples, and the design of freeze-cast porous materials. Furthermore, the equation exhibits a bifurcation that explains why some bubbles grow indefinitely and make long cylindrical ``ice worms'', well known to glaciologists.</description>

      <title>EXCOGITO, an extensible coarse-graining toolbox for the investigation of biomolecules by means of low-resolution representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08097v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bottom-up coarse-grained (CG) models proved to be essential to complement and sometimes even replace all-atom representations of soft matter systems and biological macromolecules. The development of low-resolution models takes the moves from the reduction of the degrees of freedom employed, that is, the definition of a mapping between a system's high-resolution description and its simplified counterpart. Even in the absence of an explicit parametrisation and simulation of a CG model, the observation of the atomistic system in simpler terms can be informative: this idea is leveraged by the mapping entropy, a measure of the information loss inherent to the process of coarsening. Mapping entropy lies at the heart of the extensible coarse-graining toolbox, or EXCOGITO, developed to perform a number of operations and analyses on molecular systems pivoting around the properties of mappings. EXCOGITO can process an all-atom trajectory to compute the mapping entropy, identify the mapping that minimizes it, and establish quantitative relations between a low-resolution representation and the geometrical, structural, and energetic features of the system. Here, the software, which is available free of charge under an open-source licence, is presented and showcased to introduce potential users to its capabilities and usage.

      <title>Evidence of ferroelectric features in low-density supercooled water from ab initio deep neural-network simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08338v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Over the last decade, an increasing body of evidence has emerged, supporting the existence of a metastable liquid-liquid critical point in supercooled water, whereby two distinct liquid phases of different densities coexist. Analysing long molecular dynamics simulations performed using deep neural-network force fields trained to accurate quantum mechanical data, we demonstrate that the low-density liquid phase displays a strong propensity toward spontaneous polarization, as witnessed by large and long-lived collective dipole fluctuations. Our findings suggest that the dynamical stability of the low-density phase, and hence the transition from high-density to low-density liquid, is triggered by a collective process involving an accumulation of rotational angular jumps, which could ignite large dipole fluctuations. This dynamical transition involves subtle changes in the electronic polarizability of water molecules which affects their rotational mobility within the two phases. These findings hold the potential for catalyzing new activity in the search for dielectric-based probes of the putative second critical point.</description>

      <title>Adsorption of polyelectrolytes in the presence of varying dielectric discontinuity between solution and substrate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13484v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examine the interactions between polyelectrolytes (PEs) and uncharged substrates at conditions corresponding to a dielectric discontinuity between the aqueous solution and the substrate. To this end, we vary the relevant system characteristics, in particular the substrate dielectric constant $\varepsilon_{\rm s}$ under different salt conditions. We employ coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations with rodlike PEs in salt solutions with explicit ions and implicit water solvent with dielectric constant $\varepsilon_{\rm w} = 80$. As expected, at low salt concentrations, PEs are repelled from the substrates with $\varepsilon_{\rm s} &lt; \varepsilon_{\rm w}$ but are attracted to substrates with a high dielectric constant due to image charges. This attraction considerably weakens for high salt and multivalent counterions due to enhanced screening. Further, for monovalent salt, screening enhances adsorption for weakly charged PEs, but weakens it for strongly charged ones. Multivalent counterions, on the other hand, have little effect on weakly charged PEs, but prevent adsorption of highly charged PEs, even at low salt concentrations. We also find that correlation-induced charge inversion of a PE is enhanced close to the low dielectric constant substrates, but suppressed when the dielectric constant is high. To explore the possibility of a PE monolayer formation, we examine the interaction of a pair of like-charged PEs aligned parallel to a high dielectric constant substrate with $\varepsilon_{\rm s} = 8000$. Our main conclusion is that monolayer formation is possible only for weakly charged PEs at high salt concentrations of both monovalent and multivalent counterions. Finally, we also consider the energetics of a PE approaching the substrate perpendicular to it, in analogy to polymer translocation.</description>

      <title>Harmonically trapped inertial run-and-tumble particle in one dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06120v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the nonequilibrium stationary state of a one-dimensional inertial run-and-tumble particle (IRTP) trapped in a harmonic potential. We find that the presence of inertia leads to two distinct dynamical scenarios, namely, overdamped and underdamped, characterized by the relative strength of the viscous and the trap time-scales. We also find that inertial nature of the active dynamics leads to the particle being confined in specific regions of the phase plane in the overdamped and underdamped cases, which we compute analytically. Moreover, the interplay of the inertial and active time-scales gives rise to several sub-regimes, which are characterized by very different behaviour of position and velocity fluctuations of the IRTP. In particular, in the underdamped regime, both the position and velocity undergoes transitions from a novel multi-peaked structure in the strongly active limit to a single peaked Gaussian-like distribution in the passive limit. On the other hand, in the overdamped scenario, the position distribution shows a transition from a U-shape to a dome-shape, as activity is decreased. Interestingly, the velocity distribution in the overdamped scenario shows two transitions -- from a single-peaked shape with an algebraic divergence at the origin in the strongly active regime to a double peaked one in the moderately active regime to a dome-shaped one in the passive regime.</description>
