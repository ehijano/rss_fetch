      <title>The influence of cell phenotype on collective cell invasion into the extracellular matrix</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06810v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the interactions between cells and the extracellular matrix (ECM) during collective cell invasion is crucial for advancements in tissue engineering, cancer therapies, and regenerative medicine. This study focuses on the roles of contact guidance and ECM remodelling in directing cell behaviour, with a particular emphasis on exploring how differences in cell phenotype impact collective cell invasion. We present a computationally tractable two-dimensional hybrid model of collective cell migration within the ECM, where cells are modelled as individual entities and collagen fibres as a continuous tensorial field. Our model incorporates random motility, contact guidance, cell-cell adhesion, volume filling, and the dynamic remodelling of collagen fibres through cellular secretion and degradation. Through a comprehensive parameter sweep, we provide valuable insights into how differences in the cell phenotype, in terms of the ability of the cell to migrate, secrete, degrade, and respond to contact guidance cues from the ECM, impacts the characteristics of collective cell invasion.</description>

      <title>Emergence of cellular nematic order is a conserved feature of gastrulation in animal embryos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12124v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cells undergo dramatic morphological changes during embryogenesis, yet how these changes affect the formation of ordered tissues remains elusive. Here, we show that a phase transition leading to the formation of a nematic liquid crystal state during gastrulation in the development of embryos of fish, frogs, and fruit flies occurs by a common mechanism despite substantial differences between these evolutionarily distant animals. Importantly, nematic order forms early before any discernible changes in the shapes of cells. All three species exhibit similar propagation of the nematic phase, reminiscent of nucleation and growth mechanisms. The spatial correlations in the nematic phase in the notochord region are long-ranged and follow a similar power-law decay (y~$x^{-\alpha}$ ) with $\alpha$ less than unity, indicating a common underlying physical mechanism. To explain the common physical mechanism, we created a theoretical model that not only explains the experimental observations but also predicts that the nematic phase should be disrupted upon loss of planar cell polarity (frog), cell adhesion (frog), and notochord boundary formation (zebrafish). Gene knockdown or mutational studies confirm the theoretical predictions. The combination of experiments and theory provides a unified framework for understanding the potentially universal features of metazoan embryogenesis, in the process shedding light on the advent of ordered structures during animal development.</description>
