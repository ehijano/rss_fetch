      <title>Excitons and trions in CrSBr bilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15493v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study theoretically the neutral and charged excitons in two-dimensional semiconductors with anisotropic dispersion of charge carriers. Such a situation is realized in CrSBr-based van der Waals heterostructures. We calculate the binding energies of excitons and trions and explore their dependence on the mass ratio, dielectric screening, and interlayer distance in bilayer structures. We also address the correlations between the excitons and the Fermi sea of resident electrons and the effects of exciton-light coupling, including the radiative decay and long-range electron-hole interaction. The estimates for CrSBr bilayers are in reasonable agreement with recent experiments.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous Measurement of Thermal Conductivity, Heat Capacity, and Interfacial Thermal Conductance by Leveraging Negative Delay-Time Data in Time-Domain Thermoreflectance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15767v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Time-domain thermoreflectance (TDTR) is a widely used technique for characterizing the thermal properties of bulk and thin-film materials. Traditional TDTR analyses typically focus on positive delay time data for fitting, often requiring multiple-frequency measurements to simultaneously determine thermal conductivity and heat capacity. However, this multiple-frequency approach is cumbersome and may introduce inaccuracies due to inconsistencies across different frequency measurements. In this study, we propose a novel solution to these challenges by harnessing the often-overlooked negative delay time data in TDTR. By integrating these data points, we offer a streamlined, single-frequency method that simultaneously measures thermal conductivity, heat capacity, and interface thermal conductance for both bulk and thin-film materials, enhancing measurement efficiency and accuracy. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this method by measuring several bulk samples including sapphire, silicon, diamond, and Si0.992Ge0.008, and several thin-film samples including a 1.76-{\mu}m-thick gallium nitride (GaN) film epitaxially grown on a silicon substrate, a 320-nm-thick gallium oxide ({\epsilon}-Ga2O3) film epitaxially grown on a silicon carbide substrate, and a 330-nm-thick tantalum nitride (TaN) film deposited on a sapphire substrate, all coated with an aluminum (Al) transducer layer on the surface. Our results show that the new method accurately determines the thermal conductivity and heat capacity of these samples as well as the Al/sample interface thermal conductance using a single modulation frequency, except for the Si0.992Ge0.008 sample. This study sheds light on the untapped potential of TDTR, offering a new, efficient, and accurate avenue for thermal analysis in material science.</description>

      <title>Distinctive Electronic Characteristics and Ultra-high Thermoelectric Power Factor in Be-Fe Intermetallics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15780v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Beryllium (Be) alloys are indispensable in cutting-edge applications due to their unique advantages. However, the scientific understanding about their structure and property is deficient, which greatly restricts their applications within a narrow field. In this work, a systematic investigation on the structure and properties of Be-Fe binary was carried out with first-principles unbiased evolutionary algorithms. Five new intermetallics unreported before, including insulating Be11Fe and Be4Fe, metallic Be3Fe, and metastable BeFe and BeFe2 were discovered, among which Be11Fe has a unique clathrate structure and is an electride. Surprisingly, we found that Fe unexpectedly acts as an anion in all known Be-Fe intermetallics, and its valence state can even reach -5, leading to the complete filling of its 3d orbitals. Most of these compounds exhibiting a gap or pseudogap at the Fermi level. Specifically, the band gap is determined as 0.22 eV and 0.85 eV for Be11Fe and Be4Fe at the level of single-shot GW, respectively. This is the first report of insulating phases in Be-based intermetallics. We also discovered that Be11Fe exhibits an impressive thermoelectric power factor of 178 ${\mu}W cm^{-1}K^2$ at room temperature, to our best knowledge, the highest among known semiconductors under ambient conditions, indicating its potential for waste heat harvesting and active cooling. These findings will deepen our understanding of Be-based and Fe-based compounds, and expand the application fields of Be-based alloys to a brand-new realm.</description>

      <title>Spin-dependent photovoltage in graphene/MoS2-based field-effect transistors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16328v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It has recently been shown that Terahertz sensors can effectively detect the spin resonances of Dirac fermions in graphene. The associated photovoltaic measurement technique allows for the investigation of the intrinsic spin-orbit coupling in graphene as well as its topological properties from microwave to Terahertz frequencies. In this work, using graphene/MoS2-based Field-Effect Transistors, we observed a magnetic resonance photovoltage signal in the Gigahertz range that is independent of the gate bias. The dispersion of the associated spin-flip transitions remains intriguingly unaffected by the MoS2 layer. In parallel, the spin-related signal consistently appears as a drop in photovoltage, regardless of the signal's polarity or origin, whether it arises from plasma wave rectification or thermoelectric effects. This behavior is interpreted as a decrease in the system's spin polarization due to spin-dependent recombination or scattering of photocarriers. Understanding the various photovoltaic signals in highly sensitive Gigahertz/Terahertz sensors paves the way for exploring spin-dependent mechanisms in two-dimensional quantum materials, influenced by proximity effects such as spin-orbit coupling, topology, and magnetism.</description>

      <title>Characterization of Silicon Carbide Biphenylene Network through G0W0-BSE Calculations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16520v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional silicon carbide stands out among 2D materials, primarily due to its notable band gap, unlike its carbon-based counterparts. However, the binary nature and non-layered structure of bulk SiC present challenges in fabricating its 2D counterpart. Recent advancements in technology have led to the successful synthesis of atomically thin, large-scale epitaxial monolayers of hexagonal-SiC and Si9C15 , marking a significant milestone in semiconductor research. Inspired by these advancements, we have computationally designed another stable phase of 2D-SiC in the popular biphenylene network, termed SiC-biphenylene. This structure is characterized by interconnected polygons of octagons, hexagons, and tetragons arranged periodically. The dynamical and thermal stability has been confirmed through ab initio phonon dispersion and molecular dynamics simulations. The structure demonstrates a high melting point of approximately 3475 K and a direct band gap of 2.16 eV using the HSE06 functional. Upon considering many-body effects, the quasiparticle band gap widens to 2.89 eV at the G0W0 level, indicating pronounced electron correlation effects within the material. The optical spectrum obtained from solving the Bethe-Salpeter equation (G0W0+BSE) identifies the first optically active exciton peak at 2.07 eV, corresponding to a strongly bound exciton with a binding energy of 0.82 eV. Furthermore, the investigation into stable bilayer structures across various stacking configurations highlights the impact of stacking patterns on excitonic binding energies. Our investigation extends to identifying the stable bulk phase of SiC-biphenylene, revealing lower self-energy corrections compared to monolayer and bilayer structures, attributed to increased electron delocalization in bulk structures.</description>

      <title>Non-Hermitian Floquet dynamics in absorption spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16559v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A theory of the absorption of a laser field by an atomic or condensed matter medium is presented for the case where the medium is also interacting with a strong electromagnetic field. The rotating wave approximation is not assumed for the latter. It is shown that in the weak probe limit the Lindblad master equation reduces to a smaller system of linear equations for the relevant steady state coherences. In this limit, the complex susceptibility of the medium can be expressed in terms of individual contributions of decaying dressed states, the latter being eigenstates of a non-Hermitian Floquet Hamiltonian.</description>

      <title>Gapless dispersive continuum in a modulated quantum kagome antiferromagnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01931v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The pursuit of quantum spin liquid (QSL) states in condensed matter physics has drawn attention to kagome antiferromagnets (AFM) where a two-dimensional corner-sharing network of triangles frustrates conventional magnetic orders. While quantum kagome AFMs based on Cu$^{2+}$ (3d$^9$, $s=\frac{1}{2}$) ions have been extensively studied, there is so far little work beyond copper-based systems. Here we present our bulk magnetization, specific heat and neutron scattering studies on single crystals of a new titanium fluoride Cs$_8$RbK$_3$Ti$_{12}$F$_{48}$ where Ti$^{3+}$ (3d$^1$, $s = \frac{1}{2}$) ions form a modulated quantum kagome antiferromagnet that does not order magnetically down to 1.5 K. Our comprehensive map of the dynamic response function $S(Q,\hbar\omega)$ acquired at 1.5 K where the heat capacity is T-linear reveals a dispersive continuum emanating from soft lines that extend along (100). The data indicate fractionalized spinon-like excitations with quasi-one-dimensional dispersion within a quasi-two-dimensional spin system.</description>
