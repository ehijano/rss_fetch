      <title>Metrology and Manufacturing-Integrated Digital Twin (MM-DT) for Advanced Manufacturing: Insights from CMM and FARO Arm Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metrology, the science of measurement, plays a key role in Advanced Manufacturing (AM) to ensure quality control, process optimization, and predictive maintenance. However, it has often been overlooked in AM domains due to the current focus on automation and the complexity of integrated precise measurement systems. Over the years, Digital Twin (DT) technology in AM has gained much attention due to its potential to address these challenges through physical data integration and real-time monitoring, though its use in metrology remains limited. Taking this into account, this study proposes a novel framework, the Metrology and Manufacturing-Integrated Digital Twin (MM-DT), which focuses on data from two metrology tools, collected from Coordinate Measuring Machines (CMM) and FARO Arm devices. Throughout this process, we measured 20 manufacturing parts, with each part assessed twice under different temperature conditions. Using Ensemble Machine Learning methods, our proposed approach predicts measurement deviations accurately, achieving an R2 score of 0.91 and reducing the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) to 1.59 micrometers. Our MM-DT framework demonstrates its efficiency by improving metrology processes and offers valuable insights for researchers and practitioners who aim to increase manufacturing precision and quality.</description>

      <title>Improving Computational Cost of Bayesian Optimization for Controller Tuning with a Multi-stage Tuning Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05355v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Control auto-tuning for industrial and robotic systems, when framed as an optimization problem, provides an excellent means to tune these systems. However, most optimization methods are computationally costly, and this is problematic for high-dimension control parameter spaces. In this paper, we present a multi-stage control tuning framework that decomposes control tuning into subtasks, each with a reduced-dimension search space. We show formally that this framework reduces the sample complexity of the control-tuning task. We empirically validate this result by applying a Bayesian optimization approach to tuning multiple PID controllers in an unmanned underwater vehicle benchmark system. We demonstrate an 86\% decrease in computational time and 36\% decrease in sample complexity.</description>

      <title>Fast Stochastic Subspace Identification of Densely Instrumented Bridges Using Randomized SVD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05510v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rising number of bridge collapses worldwide has compelled governments to introduce predictive maintenance strategies to extend structural lifespan. In this context, vibration-based Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) techniques utilizing Operational Modal Analysis (OMA) are favored for their non-destructive and global assessment capabilities. However, long multi-span bridges instrumented with dense arrays of accelerometers present a particular challenge, as the computational demands of classical OMA techniques in such cases are incompatible with long-term SHM. To address this issue, this paper introduces Randomized Singular Value Decomposition (RSVD) as an efficient alternative to traditional SVD within Covariance-driven Stochastic Subspace Identification (CoV-SSI). The efficacy of RSVD is also leveraged to enhance modal identification results and reduce the need for expert intervention by means of 3D stabilization diagrams, which facilitate the investigation of the modal estimates over different model orders and time lags. The approach's effectiveness is demonstrated on the San Faustino Bridge in Italy, equipped with over 60 multiaxial accelerometers.</description>

      <title>Towards a Real-Time Simulation of Elastoplastic Deformation Using Multi-Task Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05575v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study introduces a surrogate modeling framework merging proper orthogonal decomposition, long short-term memory networks, and multi-task learning, to accurately predict elastoplastic deformations in real-time. Superior to single-task neural networks, this approach achieves a mean absolute error below 0.40\% across various state variables, with the multi-task model showing enhanced generalization by mitigating overfitting through shared layers. Moreover, in our use cases, a pre-trained multi-task model can effectively train additional variables with as few as 20 samples, demonstrating its deep understanding of complex scenarios. This is notably efficient compared to single-task models, which typically require around 100 samples.
  Significantly faster than traditional finite element analysis, our model accelerates computations by approximately a million times, making it a substantial advancement for real-time predictive modeling in engineering applications. While it necessitates further testing on more intricate models, this framework shows substantial promise in elevating both efficiency and accuracy in engineering applications, particularly for real-time scenarios.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Alignment Landscape: LLMs and Geometric Deep Models in Protein Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05316v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Latent representation alignment has become a foundational technique for constructing multimodal large language models (MLLM) by mapping embeddings from different modalities into a shared space, often aligned with the embedding space of large language models (LLMs) to enable effective cross-modal understanding. While preliminary protein-focused MLLMs have emerged, they have predominantly relied on heuristic approaches, lacking a fundamental understanding of optimal alignment practices across representations. In this study, we explore the alignment of multimodal representations between LLMs and Geometric Deep Models (GDMs) in the protein domain. We comprehensively evaluate three state-of-the-art LLMs (Gemma2-2B, LLaMa3.1-8B, and LLaMa3.1-70B) with four protein-specialized GDMs (GearNet, GVP, ScanNet, GAT). Our work examines alignment factors from both model and protein perspectives, identifying challenges in current alignment methodologies and proposing strategies to improve the alignment process. Our key findings reveal that GDMs incorporating both graph and 3D structural information align better with LLMs, larger LLMs demonstrate improved alignment capabilities, and protein rarity significantly impacts alignment performance. We also find that increasing GDM embedding dimensions, using two-layer projection heads, and fine-tuning LLMs on protein-specific data substantially enhance alignment quality. These strategies offer potential enhancements to the performance of protein-related multimodal models. Our code and data are available at https://github.com/Tizzzzy/LLM-GDM-alignment.</description>

      <title>High-Resolution Agent-Based Modeling of Campus Population Behaviors for Pandemic Response Planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11414v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper reports a case study of an application of high-resolution agent-based modeling and simulation to pandemic response planning on a university campus. In the summer of 2020, we were tasked with a COVID-19 pandemic response project to create a detailed behavioral simulation model of the entire campus population at Binghamton University. We conceptualized this problem as an agent migration process on a multilayer transportation network, in which each layer represented a different transportation mode. As no direct data were available about people's behaviors on campus, we collected as much indirect information as possible to inform the agents' behavioral rules. Each agent was assumed to move along the shortest path between two locations within each transportation layer and switch layers at a parking lot or a bus stop, along with several other behavioral assumptions. Using this model, we conducted simulations of the whole campus population behaviors on a typical weekday, involving more than 25,000 agents. We measured the frequency of close social contacts at each spatial location and identified several busy locations and corridors on campus that needed substantial behavioral intervention. Moreover, systematic simulations with varying population density revealed that the effect of population density reduction was nonlinear, and that reducing the population density to 40-45% would be optimal and sufficient to suppress disease spreading on campus. These results were reported to the university administration and utilized in the pandemic response planning, which led to successful outcomes.</description>

      <title>No Tick-Size Too Small: A General Method for Modelling Small Tick Limit Order Books</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08744v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Tick sizes not only influence the granularity of the price formation process but also affect market agents' behavior. We investigate the disparity in the microstructural properties of the Limit Order Book (LOB) across different relative tick sizes. A key contribution of this study is the identification of several stylized facts, which are used to differentiate between large, medium, and small tick stocks, along with clear metrics for their measurement. We provide cross-asset visualizations to illustrate how these attributes vary with relative tick size. Further, we propose a Hawkes Process model that accounts for sparsity, multi-tick level price moves, and the shape of the book in small-tick stocks. Through simulation studies, we demonstrate the universality of the model and identify key variables that determine whether a simulated LOB resembles a large-tick or small-tick stock. Our tests show that stylized facts like sparsity, shape, and relative returns distribution can be smoothly transitioned from a large-tick to a small-tick asset using our model. We test this model's assumptions, showcase its challenges and propose questions for further directions in this area of research.</description>
