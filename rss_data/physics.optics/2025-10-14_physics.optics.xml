      <title>Neuro-inspired automated lens design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09979v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The highly non-convex optimization landscape of modern lens design necessitates extensive human expertise, resulting in inefficiency and constrained design diversity. While automated methods are desirable, existing approaches remain limited to simple tasks or produce complex lenses with suboptimal image quality. Drawing inspiration from the synaptic pruning mechanism in mammalian neural development, this study proposes OptiNeuro--a novel automated lens design framework that first generates diverse initial structures and then progressively eliminates low-performance lenses while refining remaining candidates through gradient-based optimization. By fully automating the design of complex aspheric imaging lenses, OptiNeuro demonstrates quasi-human-level performance, identifying multiple viable candidates with minimal human intervention. This advancement not only enhances the automation level and efficiency of lens design but also facilitates the exploration of previously uncharted lens architectures.</description>

      <title>High-Contrast Interferometric Imaging of Single-Molecule Dynamics on Optical Fibers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10061v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Single-molecule detection enables direct observation of individual biomolecular events, providing mechanistic insights into biological processes and offering a powerful tool for disease diagnostics. However, the fundamental scale mismatch between optical wavelengths and molecules restricts the application of label-free techniques, leading to poor signal-to-noise (SNR) performance. Here, we propose a high-contrast, label-free approach based on interferometric imaging, utilizing the strong evanescent field supported on a microfiber surface to provide near-field illumination. We observed unique interference patterns generated by in-plane scattering from natural defects, which enabled high-contrast detection of localized phase changes induced by single molecules. The results indicate an approximately 38 dB enhancement in SNR over the conventional fluorescence methods, without employing any plasmonic or microcavity-based amplification techniques. This approach was further applied to track molecular dynamics, capturing both conformational transition and binding behaviors of individual protein molecules. Meanwhile, the stimulus-response of single molecules to acoustic waves was investigated, demonstrating the ultimate miniaturization of an acoustic sensor at the single-molecule scale. By enabling direct observation of molecular dynamics and mechanical responses at the single-molecule level, this approach provides a versatile platform for probing fundamental biological processes and developing ultra-sensitive biosensors. Moreover, this approach lays the foundation for coupling optical and acoustic waves at the molecular scale, opening new avenues for next-generation single-molecule diagnostics and precision biophysics studies.</description>

      <title>Enabling High-Quality In-the-Wild Imaging from Severely Aberrated Metalens Bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10083v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We tackle the challenge of robust, in-the-wild imaging using ultra-thin nanophotonic metalens cameras. Meta-lenses, composed of planar arrays of nanoscale scatterers, promise dramatic reductions in size and weight compared to conventional refractive optics. However, severe chromatic aberration, pronounced light scattering, narrow spectral bandwidth, and low light efficiency continue to limit their practical adoption. In this work, we present an end-to-end solution for in-the-wild imaging that pairs a metalens several times thinner than conventional optics with a bespoke multi-image restoration framework optimized for practical metalens cameras. Our method centers on a lightweight convolutional network paired with a memory-efficient burst fusion algorithm that adaptively corrects noise, saturation clipping, and lens-induced distortions across rapid sequences of extremely degraded metalens captures. Extensive experiments on diverse, real-world handheld captures demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms existing burst-mode and single-image restoration techniques.These results point toward a practical route for deploying metalens-based cameras in everyday imaging applications.</description>

      <title>Time-diffracting 2D wave vortices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wave vortices constitute a large family of wave entities, closely related to phase singularities and orbital angular momentum (OAM). So far, two main classes of localized wave vortices have been explored: (i) transversely-localized monochromatic vortex beams that carry well-defined longitudinal OAM and propagate/diffract in space, and (ii) 2D-localized spatiotemporal vortex pulses that carry the more elusive transverse (or tilted) OAM and propagate/diffract in both space and time. Here we introduce another class of wave vortices which are localized in a 2D plane, do not propagate in space (apart from uniform radial deformations), and instead propagate/diffract solely in time. These vortices possess well-defined transverse OAM and can naturally appear in 2D wave systems, such as surface polaritons or water waves. We provide a general integral expression for time-diffracting 2D wave vortices, their underlying ray model, as well as examples of approximate and exact wave solutions. We also analyze the temporal Gouy phase closely related to the rotational evolution in such vortices.</description>

      <title>Exploring phase sensitivity and limit of detection near the critical coupling of metasurfaces and its phase singularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is commonly accepted that phase singularities in refractive index sensors can provide highly sensitive detection. To address this issue, we studied the phase sensitivity and the limit of detection of Tamm photonic crystals used as temperature sensors, taken here as a model system by exploring critical coupling and its associated phase singularity. To finely tune the optical Tamm mode to critical coupling, the top metal layer is periodically nanostructured and controlled, enabling the investigation of optical Tamm resonances around phase singularities. We use a highly stable common-path interferometry setup based on digital holography, which allows us to measure extremely high phase sensitivity even at very low light intensities, while also providing information about reflectivity in the complex domain. We experimentally validate an analytical model based on Temporal Coupled Mode Theory, which fully explains the phase sensitivity response and the limit of detection of such resonant photonic sensors. We demonstrate that, although approaching a phase singularity drastically enhances phase sensitivity, no improvement of the limit of detection is expected. Furthermore, phase singularity has no effect on the limit of detection, and therefore on the efficiency of such sensors for practical applications. This work provides a comprehensive description of phase sensors operating at critical coupling, and challenges the commonly accepted assumption regarding the role of phase singularities in sensing.</description>

      <title>Expanding detection bandwidth via a photonic reservoir for ultrafast optical sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10404v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The detection of ultrafast optical and radio-frequency (RF) signals is crucial for applications ranging from high-speed communications to advanced sensing. However, conventional detectors are fundamentally constrained by their intrinsic bandwidth, limiting accurate broadband signal measurement. Here, we show that a neuromorphic photonic processing approach can overcome this limitation, enabling accurate broadband signal detection beyond the detector bandwidth. The key idea lies in the spatiotemporal encoding of input waveforms within a photonic reservoir network, which reconstructs high-frequency components otherwise inaccessible to individual detectors. We experimentally demonstrate the detection of high-speed optical phase signals with more than an eightfold effective bandwidth expansion using an on-chip silicon photonic reservoir. This approach provides a scalable and integrable platform for high-speed optical and RF signal processing, opening new opportunities in ultrafast photonics and next-generation communication systems.</description>

      <title>Amplified Directional Photoluminescence from CIS Quantum Dots and hBN Quantum Emitters using Tunable BIC Metasurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated and tunable light sources are critical for advancing quantum nanophotonic chips in quantum computing, communications, and sensing. However, efficient and tunable emission amplification post-fabrication poses major challenges. Hybrid metasurfaces combining niobium pentoxide (Nb2O5), copper indium sulfide (CIS) quantum dots or hexagonal boron nitride (hBN), and antimony trisulfide (Sb2S3) as a low-loss phase-change material offer a compelling solution for dynamic control and amplification of photoluminescence and quantum light emission. In this work, we report an active hybrid metasurface supporting tunable bound states in the continuum (BIC) resonances in the visible regime, achieving experimental Q-factors up to 206 and strong amplification of CIS QDs photoluminescence as well as quantum light emission of hBN single-photon emitters. The metasurface enables BIC resonance shifts of 33.5 nm in the visible spectrum via phase transition of Sb2S3, and 17 nm through dimensional parametric tuning. We experimentally demonstrate highly directional photoluminescence amplification up to 33-fold, alongside broad tunable amplified PL emission upon Sb2S3 phase modulation. Furthermore, we propose amplified, tunable, and on-demand strong coupling of hBN single-photon emitters with the tunable BIC metasurface for next-generation broadband quantum nanophotonic chips. This work sets a new benchmark in reconfigurable nanophotonic platforms for efficient quantum light sources in integrated photonic systems.</description>

      <title>Multipolar Origin and Active Control of High-Q Quasi-BIC Fano Resonances in Dielectric Metasurfaces for Sensing Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10507v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We designed an ingenious all-dielectric metasurface, employing cuboid structures patterned with bow-tie-shaped nanoholes, exhibiting multiple Fano resonances induced by quasi-bound states in the continuum (quasi-BICs) through structural asymmetry. Among them, several resonant modes demonstrated high quality factors in the range of 10^3-10^4, along with near-unity modulation depth and strong spectral contrast. The optical responses were analyzed utilizing the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method, with Fano profiles fitted to theoretical models and the BIC governed modes validated via the squared inverse ratio law. Furthermore, multipolar decomposition and electromagnetic spatial field profile revealed the origins of the resonance, while LC circuit modeling provided additional physical insight into the Fano profiles. The proposed metasurface also exhibited strong polarization dependence, indicating its potential for active optical switching. Finally, refractive index sensing performance, including the detection of Vibrio cholerae, reached a sensitivity of 342 nm/RIU and a figure of merit of 217.14 RIU^-1. Advancing the control of high-Q quasi-BIC Fano resonances, this study highlights Fano resonators' potential for refractive index sensing and active switching.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.10562v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spectral and statistical properties are explored for surface plasmon (SP) emission in resonance fluorescence from a driven two level emitter in the proximity of 2D single graphene sheet. We derive expressions for the emitted SP field and spectrum function that depend on the graphene conductivity and take into account the controllable parameters of the graphene system. We present analysis for the spectrum and second order coherence functions and discuss the possibility of their control using graphene system parameters to manipulate the spectral linewidth and coherence.</description>

      <title>Light coupling to photonic integrated circuits using optimized lensed fibers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10635v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficient and reliable light coupling between optical fibers and photonic integrated circuits has arguably been the most essential issue in integrated photonics for optical interconnects, nonlinear signal conversion, neuromorphic computing, and quantum information processing. A commonly employed approach is to use inverse tapers interfacing with lensed fibers, particularly for waveguides of relatively low refractive index such as silicon nitride (Si3N4), silicon oxynitride and lithium niobate. This approach simultaneously enables broad operation bandwidth, high coupling efficiency, and simplified fabrication. While diverse taper designs have been invented and characterized so far, lensed fibers play equally important roles here, but their optimization has long underexplored. Here we fill this gap and introduce a comprehensive co-optimization strategy that synergistically refines the geometries of the taper and the lensed fiber. By incorporating the genuine lensed fiber's shape into simulation, we accurately capture the non-Gaussian emission profile of the lensed fiber, nullifying the widely accepted approximation using a paraxial Gaussian mode. We further characterize many lensed fibers and Si3N4 tapers of varying shapes using different fabrication processes. Our experimental and simulation results show remarkable agreement, both achieving maximum coupling efficiencies exceeding 80% per facet. Finally, we summarize the optimal choices of lensed fibers and Si3N4 tapers that can be directly deployed in modern CMOS foundries for scalable manufacturing of Si3N4 photonic integrated circuits. Our study not only contributes to light coupling solutions, but is also critical for photonic packaging and optoelectronic assembly that are currently revolutionizing datacenters and AI.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.10638v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article explores the application of various artificial intelligence techniques to the analysis of near-infrared (NIR) spectra of paracetamol, within the spectral range of 900 nm to 1800 nm. The main objective is to evaluate the performance of several dimensionality reduction algorithms; namely, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Kernel PCA (KPCA), Sparse Kernel PCA, t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE), and Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) in modeling and interpreting spectral features. These techniques, derived from data science and machine learning, are evaluated for their ability to simplify analysis and enhance the visualization of NIR spectra in pharmaceutical applications.</description>

      <title>A complete formalism for giant Goos-H\"anchen shift of metasurface sensors with phase singularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10788v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Giant Goos-H\"anchen shift is a promising effect for very highly sensitive sensors application. For sensors working at the critical coupling regime, we provide here a complete formalism that describes analytically the Goos-Hanchen shift, the Goos-H\"anchen sensitivity and the limit of detection. It reveals the key parameters (quality factor, angular dispersion but also the phase singularity) which are involved in the GH shift. Approaching the critical coupling leads to ultimate Goos-H\"anchen shift and sensitivity. Thanks to this theoretical description confirmed numerically, we propose lateral beam displacement that goes beyond giant GH shift and sensitivity values as high as $10^{13} {\mu}m/RIU$ which is an improvement of Goos-H\"anchen sensitivity by more than one thousand compared to theoretical value and more than ten million if compared to experimental works. We illustrate it for surface plasmon resonance of thin metal film where the critical coupling is approached with the crystallisation of a phase change material GST and for metasurfaces supporting Bloch Surface Waves. We also discuss the effect of beam size on GH effect and showed that it is the main limitation for increasing GH sensitivty and is a parameter that must be considered. The limit of detection of GH sensors is finally described analytically. Theses results open the way for new sensing application needing high sensitivity.</description>

      <title>Packaging of Low-Environmental-Sensitivity WGM Resonators for Practical Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10939v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a prism-coupled packaging strategy for whispering-gallery mode resonators (WGMRs). Utilizing an all-solid-state optical adhesive process with active temperature control and hermetic sealing, the package exhibits exceptional long-term stability and environmental robustness. A standalone WGMR module was characterized, demonstrating a temperature sensitivity below 10^-7 /{\deg}C and a low-frequency Z-axis acceleration sensitivity below 10^-10 /g. The module was applied as a stable optical frequency reference, achieving a short-term frequency stability of 2x10^-13 at 2 ms, and as a nonlinear photonic platform, generating Kerr soliton microcombs with a pump power of 100 mW. This compact, robust packaging solution enhances the applicability of WGMRs in real-world applications such as narrow-linewidth lasers and portable microcombs, facilitating the transition from laboratory research to practical deployment.</description>

      <title>Lattice Boltzmann method for electromagnetic wave scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11042v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose the lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) as an alternative numerical approach for electromagnetic scattering. The method is systematically validated over a wide range of size parameters, thereby covering the Rayleigh, Mie, and geometric optics regimes, through comparison with established reference solutions. For circular cylinders, both perfect electrically conducting (PEC) and dielectric, LBM results are benchmarked against analytical Mie theory. For dielectric cylinders, comparisons are performed over a broad range of relative permittivities to assess accuracy across different material contrasts. Scattering from dielectric spheres is likewise compared with exact Mie solutions, showing excellent agreement. To assess performance for non-canonical geometries, we investigate a hexagonal dielectric cylinder and validate the results against the Discretized Mie-Formalism, demonstrating that LBM can accurately capture edge diffraction and sharp-facet effects. Overall, the study provides the first systematic benchmarking of LBM for electromagnetic scattering in one-, two-, and three-dimensional configurations, establishing it as a promising and versatile tool in computational electromagnetics.</description>

      <title>Space-time singularities in spatially-chirped Laguerre-Gaussian beams of any order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The electric field distributions and space-time singularity curves are computed for ultrashort pulsed Laguerre-Gaussian laser beams having spatial chirp. Due to the breaking of cylindrical symmetry by the spatial chirp, the singularities trace complicated curves in space-time, which also vary for different combinations of radial and vortical orders. Analytical solutions are mostly presented along with a recipe for numerically calculating higher orders. The behavior of the singularities upon propagation is also shown, along with a discussion of the extension towards few-cycle pulses. These results are an example of how a simple physical scenario can result in highly complicated singular behavior in space-time.</description>

      <title>Canalized hyperbolic magnetoexciton polaritons by Shubnikov-de Haas effect in van der Waals semiconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polariton canalization exhibits highly collimated and diffraction-free propagation characteristics in natural hyperbolic materials, holding great promise for molding the energy flow at nanoscale. Previously, the majority of canalizations are realized in phonon polaritons. Herein, we theoretically explore hyperbolic magnetoexciton polaritons (HMEPs) in van der Waals crystals of WTe2, MoS2, and phosphorene. Based on the Shubnikov-de Haas effect, canalized HMEPs with ultralow group velocity (~10-5c) and super-long lifetime (hundreds of microseconds) are predicted. We also show that the inter-Landau-level transitions and non-local dielectric screening effect significantly modify the optical topologies of canalized HMEPs, manifested by various exotic isofrequency contours (IFCs) including hyperbolic, witch-of-Agnesi, one-sheet, two-fold, and twisted pincerlike IFCs. Our findings reveal the significant effects of magneto-optical transport on hyperbolic polaritons, which not only enrich the interplay mechanism between magnetics and polaritonics, but also provide a promising playground for future developments in hyperbolic materials.</description>

      <title>Astigmatism-free 3D Optical Tweezer Control for Rapid Atom Rearrangement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11451v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reconfigurable arrays of neutral atoms are a leading platform for quantum computing, quantum simulation, and quantum metrology. The most common method for atom reconfiguration using optical tweezers relies on frequency chirping of acousto-optic deflectors (AODs). However, chirp-induced acoustic lensing limits the speed of atom transport by deformation of the tweezer profile and warping of the tweezer trajectory. We use a three-dimensional acousto-optic deflector lens (3D-AODL) to mitigate both effects, a design predicted to halve current state-of-the-art long-range transport times. Additionally, we introduce fading-Shepard waveforms that bypass the finite AOD bandwidth and thus enable sustained axial displacement. We demonstrate unrestricted 3D motion within a cuboid volume of at least 200 $\mu$m $\times$ 200 $\mu$m $\times$ 136 $\mu$m, with tweezer velocities exceeding 4.2 m/s. The ability to move optical tweezers along arbitrary trajectories in 3D should enable rapid in-plane and out-of-plane rearrangement of atoms in 2D or 3D tweezer arrays and optical lattices, as well as omnidirectional trajectories and dynamical engineering of optical potentials. This technology has the potential to advance quantum control and atom manipulation in current atom-array quantum computers, boosting clock rates and enabling rapid sorting in geometries scalable to millions of qubits.</description>

      <title>Efficient Lasing in MoS$_2$/WSe$_2$-Based Metasurfaces Enabled by Quasi-Dark Magnetic Dipole Resonance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The novel combination of a strongly-resonant optical metasurface with the MoS$_2$/WSe$_2$ hetero-bilayer is proposed for efficient free-space lasing enabled by the enhanced coupling between the optical and matter (exciton) states. The metasurface comprises silicon-rich nitride meta-atoms periodically arrayed in a subdiffractive lattice and overlaid with MoS$_2$/WSe$_2$, which provides optically-pumped gain around $1130~\mathrm{nm}$. Light emission is enabled by exploiting a quasi-bound state in the continuum in the form of a perturbed vertical magnetic dipole resonance. Following a meticulous design process guided by full-wave simulations and multipole expansion analysis, an ultralow lasing threshold of $\sim 6~\mathrm{kW/cm^2}$ is achieved. Moreover, the thermal stability of the lasing structure is examined through heat transfer simulations; stable operation with pump power densities up to a few MW/cm$^2$ (three orders of magnitude above the threshold) is predicted. These results demonstrate that MoS$_2$/WSe$_2$-based metasurface lasers can exhibit robust operation, paving the way for highly-performing ultrathin light-emitting surfaces. The lasing response is rigorously assessed through a highly-efficient temporal coupled-mode theory framework, verified by time-domain FEM simulations showing excellent agreement. Thus, an efficient and accurate approach to design and study metasurface lasers with arbitrary geometries and surface or bulk gain media is introduced, exhibiting significant advantages over cumbersome full-wave simulations.</description>

      <title>A review of cultural heritage inspection: Toward terahertz from mid-infrared region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This review explores non-invasive imaging (NII) methods covering the mid- and far-infrared to the terahertz spectral regions (up to approximately 1000 um) for the detection and analysis of cultural heritage artifacts. In the thermal infrared domain, where radiation follows Planck's law, the self-emission of materials reveals intrinsic properties and internal degradation. By contrast, in the near-infrared range, external illumination enhances surface details and pigment differentiation. Far-infrared and terahertz techniques, operating in both transmission and reflection modes, provide complementary insights by penetrating surface layers to uncover subsurface structures and concealed features. Integrating visible and infrared imaging further enriches diagnostic capabilities by correlating conventional visual assessments with spectral information. Beyond reviewing the wide applications of these NII techniques in cultural heritage research, this work also summarizes recent advances in signal processing, encompassing both hardware and software developments. In particular, deep learning has revolutionized the field by enabling automated classification, feature extraction, defect detection, and super-resolution imaging. Through supervised and unsupervised learning strategies, neural networks can reliably identify subtle anomalies and material variations indicative of past restorations or early stages of deterioration. In conclusion, the convergence of advanced spectral imaging, sophisticated signal processing, and deep neural networks offers a transformative pathway toward more accurate, efficient, and data-driven cultural heritage analysis, ultimately supporting more informed conservation and restoration decisions.</description>

      <title>Attosecond-level synchronisation of chip-integrated oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Attosecond science provides a window to the fastest processes in chemistry, materials science, and biology. Accessing this time scale requires precisely synchronised oscillators. In free-electron X-ray lasers, which also provide sub-atomic resolution, synchronisation must be achieved across hundreds of meters. Current approaches to synchronisation based on mode-locked lasers deliver this level of performance but complexity, cost and size hinder their deployment in facility-wide multi-node networks. Here, we demonstrate attosecond-level synchronisation of two chip-integrated photonic oscillators (microcombs) separated by 100 m of fibre. A pair of continuous-wave lasers establishes a time reference that is delivered over fibre, and on-chip Kerr-nonlinear synchronisation results in an integrated relative timing jitter of the microcombs below 400 as (1 kHz to 1 MHz), without any active stabilisation. These results unlock precision timing at scale for large facilities and next-generation technologies such as disaggregated computing and quantum networks, and ultimately may lead to chip-integrated attosecond photonics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.10298v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The process of dephasing during wave evolution has traditionally been viewed as an obstacle to localization, leading to diffusion even in strongly disordered Hermitian lattices. In contrast, here we demonstrate how the interplay of dephasing with non-Hermitian defects can be harnessed to engineer wave localization. Specifically, we identify a novel dynamical localization phenomenon characterized by wavefunction accumulation at the lattice's boundary due solely to dephasing, despite globally reciprocal couplings. Furthermore, we study the incoherent skin effect arising from coupling asymmetry, and investigate the interplay between these antagonistic localization mechanisms. By reframing dephasing from a hindrance into a tool, this study overturns established paradigms of wave localization and paves the way for novel approaches to controlling localization phenomena in non-Hermitian physics.</description>

      <title>Towards a compact transportable optical clock based on the octupole transition in 171Yb+</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10476v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optical clocks have extremely attractive applications in many fields, including time-frequency metrology, validation of fundamental physical principles, and relativistic geodesy. The 467 nm octupole transition in 171Yb+ ion exhibits intrinsic insensitivity to magnetic field and an ultra-long clock state lifetime of 1.6 years. In addition, the entire laser system can be realized by semiconductor technologies, rendering this platform uniquely advantageous for developing high-precision, compact and transportable optical clocks. Here, we report the development of a compact optical clock based on the 467 nm transition of a single 171Yb+ ion. Using a narrow linewidth 467 nm laser to interrogate the clock transition, we obtain a near-Fourier-limited linewidth of 2.3 Hz in an integrated ion trapping system. Self-comparison demonstrated a frequency instability of 2.2E-15/sqrt(tau/s) with an interrogation time of 180 ms, which reaches the high parts in E-18 level with an averaging time of only one day. These work laid the technical foundation for the subsequent clock systematic evaluation and the packaging of each subsystem into an engineering prototype with high-precision at the level of E-18.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.11154v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Qudits have proven to be a powerful resource for quantum information processing, offering enhanced channel capacities, improved robustness to noise, and highly efficient implementations of quantum algorithms. The encoding of photonic qudits in transverse-spatial degrees of freedom has emerged as a versatile tool for quantum information processing, allowing access to a vast information capacity within a single photon. In this review, we examine recent advances in quantum optical circuits with spatially structured light, focusing particularly on top-down approaches that employ complex mode-mixing transformations in free-space and fibers. In this context, we highlight circuits based on platforms such as multi-plane light conversion, complex scattering media, multimode and multi-core fibers. We discuss their applications for the manipulation and measurement of multi-dimensional and multi-mode quantum states. Furthermore, we discuss how these circuits have been employed to perform multi-party operations and multi-outcome measurements, thereby opening new avenues for scalable photonic quantum information processing.</description>

      <title>Raman Microspectroscopy for Real-Time Structure Indicator in Ultrafast Laser Writing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11422v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Raman microspectroscopy provides non-destructive, structure-specific contrast suited to in situ monitoring of femtosecond (fs) laser fabrication processes. In this work, we introduce a sample-agnostic Raman workflow that screens candidate spectral indicators using drift-resistant, self-normalized metrics and, where appropriate, label-free hyperspectral unmixing to extract endmembers and validate metric selection. Using diamond as an example, hyperspectral maps and electrical tests show that depletion of the 1332 cm-1 sp3 line is a monotonic, robust predictor of resistance, counterintuitively outperforming sp2-based measures often assumed optimal. This enables a practical implementation: a single narrowband channel at the selected marker provides real-time feedback without full-spectrum acquisition. Because the selection hinges on general band definitions and functional validation rather than diamond-specific physics, the approach translates Raman phase information directly into device specifications and is transferable to other Raman-active hosts for in-line quality control of laser-written structures.</description>

      <title>Telecom-compatible cross-band quantum memory via dual photon modes dark-state polaritons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11585v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum memories are essential components of quantum networks, enabling synchronization, quantum repeaters, and long-distance entanglement distribution. Most ensemble-based realizations rely on dark-state polaritons (DSPs) in $\Lambda$-type systems that operate at near-infrared wavelengths, such as 795 nm in $^{87}$Rb, far from the telecom band where long fiber transmission is optimal. Here we identify a DSP in $^{87}$Rb that coherently couples two photonic modes at 795 nm and 1324 nm through a shared spin-wave coherence. We derive its field operator and group velocity, extending the Fleischhauer-Lukin model to a dual-wavelength regime, and formulate a memory protocol enabling bidirectional storage and retrieval between the two modes. Numerical simulations of the full six-level dynamics confirm two-way storage and retrieval for both same-mode and cross-mode operation between the two wavelengths. The results demonstrate a dual-wavelength memory that unifies node-band and telecom-band operation within a single ensemble, providing a potential route toward frequency-conversion-free quantum-network interfaces.</description>

      <title>Deterministic hBN bubbles as a versatile platform for studies on single-photon emitters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11610v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Single-photon emitters (SPEs) in two-dimensional materials are highly promising candidates for quantum technologies. SPEs in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) have been widely investigated, but mostly in exfoliated or powder samples that require an activation process, making it difficult to compare studies and reproduce results. Here, we address this problem and propose a platform based on large-area metaloraganic vapour phase epitaxy (MOVPE)-grown hBN, which combines reproducibility and scalability with the ability to readily host SPEs without activation. Through the creation of bubbles via electron-beam irradiation, we achieve additional functionalities, including an interference-mediated enhancement of emission by approximately 100-200\%, dedicated structures that allow the relocation of individual emitters across different systems, and the opportunity to investigate strain-induced effects. Moreover, in contrast to other gas-filled bubbles that deflate at low temperatures, our bubbles remain stable under cryogenic conditions, allowing studies as a function of temperature. To improve the control over the shape and position of bubbles, we demonstrate a~mask-based method that enables deterministic control over bubble formation. The presented hBN bubbles constitute a versatile platform for reproducible studies of hBN-based emitters, providing a reliable insight into their nature and properties.</description>

Abstract: Classical vector waves can possess intricate spin angular momenta (SAM), which are \emph{perpendicular} to the propagation direction, as revealed by the recent recognition of surprisingly transverse SAM in electromagnetic (EM) fields. In this paper, we employ the Hertz potential method to define structured vector fields and analytically decompose the SAM of the wave fields in two parts. Our novel approach of decomposition not only confirms that transverse SAM may originate from the first-order spatial inhomogeneity of the Poynting momentum, but also points out that for \emph{non-planar vector waves with near fields}, an extraordinary spin appears as a distinct part out of transverse spin. By four examples of vector beams, we further demonstrate that the proposed transverse spins prevail universally in both propagating and evanescent waves. This work renews our fundamental understanding of the decomposition of SAM for classical vector waves.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.14393v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the results of full-wave numerical simulations of light transmission through layers of irregular dielectric particles, demonstrating three-dimensional Anderson localization of light in disordered, uncorrelated discrete media. Our simulations show that a high degree of disorder in a dense layer suppresses the transverse spreading of a propagating beam. A transition from the purely diffusive regime to a non-exponential temporal dependence is observed in short-pulse time-resolved transmission measurements as the system approaches the Ioffe-Regel condition. Along with this, near-field dynamics leads over time to the formation of spatially localized modes and the transmission spectrum becomes consistent with the Thouless criterion. The effect depends on the turbidity of the layer: increasing the volume fraction of scatterers and the refractive index contrast enhances the non-exponential behavior induced by disorder, which is a clear signature of Anderson localization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.07626v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Wavefront shaping enables precise control of light propagation through multimode fibers, facilitating diffraction-limited focusing for applications such as high-resolution single-fiber imaging and high-power fiber amplifiers. While the theoretical intensity enhancement at the focal point is dictated by the number of input degrees of freedom, practical constraints-such as phase-only modulation and experimental noise-impose significant limitations. Despite its importance, the upper bounds of enhancement under these constraints remain largely unexplored. In this work, we establish a theoretical framework to predict the fundamental limits of intensity enhancement with phase-only modulation in the presence of noise-induced phase errors, and we experimentally demonstrate wavefront shaping that approaches these limits. Our experimental results confirm an enhancement factor of 5,000 in a large-core multimode fiber, approaching the theoretical upper bound, enabled by noise-tolerant wavefront shaping. These findings provide key insights into the limits of phase-only control in multimode fibers, with profound implications for single-fiber imaging, optical communication, high-power broad-area fiber amplification, and beyond.</description>

      <title>Overcoming light scattering with high optical nonlinearity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.10423v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While scattered light conveys most of the information we perceive, scattering may also distort that information before it reaches our detectors. The problem is acute in many applications, such as in high-resolution microscopy of biological tissue, where scattering degrades both resolution and signal-to-noise ratio. Here, for the first time, we demonstrate that uniting two intrinsic properties of scattered light: speckle statistics and the angular memory effect, with highly non-linear optical response yields, rather surprisingly, super-resolution, low-background, non-invasive imaging of objects completely hidden behind a strongly scattering, opaque layer. Crucially, our technique of non-invasive imaging through scatterers does not resort to wavefront shaping, adaptive optics, complicated optical setups, or iterative image reconstruction algorithms. Because the strategy relies solely on the properties of scattered light and high-order nonlinear response of the fluorophores, it can be applied to any speckle-forming propagation, from biological tissue to multicore fibres, combined with any type of phenomenon that exhibits a sufficiently high order nonlinearity.</description>

Abstract: Molecular fluorescence microscopy is a leading approach to super-resolution and nanoscale imaging in life and material sciences. However, super-resolution fluorescence microscopy is often bottlenecked by system-specific calibrations and long acquisitions of sparsely blinking molecules. We present a deep-learning approach that reconstructs super-resolved images directly from a single diffraction-limited camera frame. The model is trained exclusively on synthetic data encompassing a wide range of optical and sample parameters, enabling robust generalization across microscopes and experimental conditions. Applied to dense terrylene samples with 150 ms acquisition time, our method significantly reduces reconstruction error compared to Richardson-Lucy deconvolution and ThunderSTORM multi-emitter fitting. The results confirm the ability to resolve emitters separated by 35 nm at 580 nm wavelength, corresponding to sevenfold resolution improvement beyond the Rayleigh criterion. By delivering unprecedented details from a single short camera exposure without prior information and calibration, our approach enables plug-and-play super-resolution imaging of fast, dense, or light-sensitive samples on standard wide-field setups.</description>

Abstract: Differentiable optics, as an emerging paradigm that jointly optimizes optics and (optional) image processing algorithms, has made innovative optical designs possible across a broad range of applications. Many of these systems utilize diffractive optical components (DOEs) for holography, PSF engineering, or wavefront shaping. Existing approaches have, however, mostly remained limited to laboratory prototypes, owing to a large quality gap between simulation and manufactured devices. We aim at lifting the fundamental technical barriers to the practical use of learned diffractive optical systems. To this end, we propose a fabrication-aware design pipeline for diffractive optics fabricated by direct-write grayscale lithography followed by nano-imprinting replication, which is directly suited for inexpensive mass production of large area designs. We propose a super-resolved neural lithography model that can accurately predict the 3D geometry generated by the fabrication process. This model can be seamlessly integrated into existing differentiable optics frameworks, enabling fabrication-aware, end-to-end optimization of computational optical systems. To tackle the computational challenges, we also devise tensor-parallel compute framework centered on distributing large-scale FFT computation across many GPUs. As such, we demonstrate large scale diffractive optics designs up to 32.16 mm $\times$ 21.44 mm, simulated on grids of up to 128,640 by 85,760 feature points. We find adequate agreement between simulation and fabricated prototypes for applications such as holography and PSF engineering. We also achieve high image quality from an imaging system comprised only of a single DOE, with images processed only by a Wiener filter utilizing the simulation PSF. We believe our findings lift the fabrication limitations for real-world applications of diffractive optics and differentiable optical design.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.18570v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, a long-cavity semiconductor laser subject to optical feedback is exploited to generate repetitive temporal patterns with enhanced intra-pattern sample diversity. Stable limit cycle dynamics characterized by multiple frequency harmonics are experimentally demonstrated by considering a 2 m external cavity with appropriate optical feedback conditions. This simple configuration can enable stable and continuous generation of periodic waveforms with a tunable repetition rate ranging from 3.28 to 4.21 GHz. Distinct, highly consistent temporal patterns are obtained by applying high-pass filtering to adjust the relative power of the harmonics. The resulting system operates as a physical waveform generator capable of producing diverse and repeatable signal patterns, making it well-suited for use in the masking stage of time delay reservoir computing architectures.</description>

Abstract: Reconfigurable photonics have rapidly become an invaluable tool for information processing. Light-based computing accelerators are promising for boosting neural network learning and inference and optical interconnects are foreseen as a solution to the information transfer bottleneck in high-performance computing. In this study, we demonstrate the successful programming of a transformation implemented using a reconfigurable photonic circuit with a non-conventional architecture. The core of most photonic processors is an MZI-based architecture that establishes an analytical connection between the controllable parameters and circuit transformation. However, several architectures that are substantially more difficult to program have improved robustness to fabrication defects. We use two algorithms that rely on different initial datasets to reconstruct the circuit model of a complex interferometer, and then program the required unitary transformation. Both methods performed accurate circuit programming with an average fidelity above 98%. Our results provide a strong foundation for the introduction of non-conventional interferometric architectures for photonic information processing.</description>

      <title>Breakdown of the Kirchhoff's law of thermal radiation by a spatiotemporally modulated nonreciprocal metasurface</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.00463v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Kirchhoff's law of thermal radiation, which dictates that the emissivity of a surface equals its absorptivity under thermal equilibrium, which dictates that the emissivity of a surface equals its absorptivity under thermal equilibrium, fundamentally limits the efficiency of photonic systems by enforcing reciprocal energy exchange between source and detector. Breaking this reciprocity is particularly important for advancing photonic devices for energy conversion, radiative cooling, and mid-infrared sensing and imaging. Driven by the growing need for photonic platforms to overcome reciprocity constraints, we present the first demonstration of spatiotemporally modulated nonreciprocal metasurfaces operating at mid-infrared frequencies suitable for the violation of the Kirchhoff's law at room temperature. We fabricate a graphene-based integrated photonic structure and experimentally demonstrate nonreciprocal reflection from a metasurface modulated at gigahertz frequencies. We develop a theoretical framework to relate nonreciprocal scattering under spatiotemporal modulation with unequal absorptivity and emissivity for violation of the spectral directional Kirchhoff's law. Our experiment and theory imply effective decoupling of absorption and emission channels by breaking time-reversal symmetry at thermal wavelengths.</description>

      <title>Interpretation of measured 3x3 partial depolarizing Mueller matrices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.06305v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mueller polarimetry is a powerful technique with broad applications in astronomy, remote sensing, advanced material analysis, and biomedical imaging. However, instrumental constraints frequently restrict the measurement to an incomplete Mueller matrix limited to its upper-left 3x3 submatrix. Simply padding the missing entries with zeros to form a 4x4 matrix can produce physically inconsistent results, even for nondepolarizing systems. To address this issue, we present a systematic procedure to complete 3x3 measured Mueller matrices into physically consistent 4x4 matrices. The method relies on the covariance matrix formalism and selects, among the infinitely many admissible completions, the one with maximal polarimetric purity. This criterion ensures that the synthesized matrix corresponds to the least random (most deterministic) model compatible with the measurement. The procedure is fully general and can be applied to any 3x3 partial Mueller polarimetric data, providing a reliable and physically grounded reconstruction tool for polarimetric imaging and materials characterization.</description>

      <title>Developing a Cost-Effective Spectrometer: A Practical Approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.06703v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The paper demonstrates the design and execution of a low-cost optical spectrometer that employs a webcam, diffraction grating &amp; Python (a free, open-source programming language). The device's design prioritized economy and usability, with a black box casing to reduce stray light and increase measurement accuracy. A diffraction grating made from a DVD was used to split light into its constituent wavelengths, which were then collected by the camera. The calibration procedure used a RED TIDE USB650 Fiber Optic Spectrometer to set calibration values for various wavelength ranges, which ensured that the spectrometer's results closely matched those derived from the former, a high-cost industry-standard model. Spectrums of several light sources, such as red, green, blue, yellow, white, magenta, orange, and UV LEDs, as well as a green laser, were studied and compared. The results showed a high level of precision, with minimal divergence from industry-standard spectrometer measurements. This comparison was carried out utilizing Origin software, which allowed for extensive analysis and display of the spectrum data. In addition, the spectrometer captured data in real time, allowing users to watch live spectrum changes and ensure instant accessibility of results. Despite its simplicity and low cost, the spectrometer provides significant value for instructional and practical applications, making it a valuable tool in cost-constrained situations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00405v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Postselection can compress the metrological information and improve sensitivity in the presence of certain types of technical noise. Postselected quantum metrology with pure states has been significantly advanced recently. However, extending this framework to mixed states leads to formidable challenges, such as the difficulty in searching for lossless postselection measurements or even the loss of metrological information. In this work, we leverage the intuition for the lossless postselection of pure states and generalize the theory to the lossless postselection of a class of mixed states, dubbed quasi-pure states. We illustrate our findings in postselected quantum imaging, unitary estimation problems, and show that the quasi-pure structure can be universally engineered through only classical correlation with an ancilla. Our findings extend the utility of postselection techniques to scenarios with decoherence and also offer new perspectives to foundational questions in quantum information geometry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.10733v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the design and assembly of a cavity microscope for quantum simulations with ultracold atoms. The system integrates a high-finesse optical cavity with a pair of high-numerical aperture lenses sharing a common optical axis, enabling simultaneous operation with light close-to-atomic resonance. The system keeps the advantages of a rigid, single-block structure holding the lenses and cavity together, and improves over existing designs by using most of the solid angle left free by the cavity mode for imaging and atomic manipulation purposes. The cavity has a length of \SI{19.786}{\milli\meter}, a finesse of \SI{2.35}{\times 10^4} and operates \SI{214}{\micro\meter} away from the concentric limit, deep in the strong coupling regime. The two lenses offer a numerical aperture of $0.52$ each and maximal optical access in all directions transverse to the cavity axis, compatible with applications in quantum-gas microscopes, micro-tweezer arrays or few-fermions systems, as well as future cavity-assisted quantum simulation protocols demanding sub-cavity-mode control of the atom-cavity coupling.</description>

      <title>Theory of Three-Photon Transport Through a Weakly Coupled Atomic Ensemble</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.03428v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding multi-photon interactions in non-equilibrium quantum systems is an outstanding challenge in quantum optics. In this work, we develop an analytical and diagrammatic framework to explore three-photon interactions in atomic ensembles weakly coupled to a one-dimensional waveguide. Taking advantage of the weak coupling, we use our diagrammatic framework to perform perturbation theory and calculate the leading-order contributions to the three-photon wavefunction, which would otherwise be intractable. We then compute the outgoing photon wavefunction of a resonantly driven atomic ensemble, with photon-photon interactions truncated up to three photons. Our formulation not only captures the individual transmission of photons but also isolates the connected S-matrix elements that embody genuine photon-photon correlations. Through detailed analysis, we obtain the analytic expressions of the connected third-order correlation function and the third-order electric-field-quadrature cumulant, which reveal non-Gaussian signatures emerging from the interplay of two- and three-photon processes. We also calculate the optical depth where non-Gaussian photon states can be observed. Numerical simulations based on a cascaded master equation validate our analytical predictions on a small-scale system. These results provide a formalism to further explore non-equilibrium quantum optics in atomic ensembles and extend this to the regime of non-Gaussian photon transport.</description>

      <title>Landscape of scattering universality with general dispersion relations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.01782v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Universality in physics describes how disparate systems can exhibit identical low-energy behavior. Here, we reveal a rich landscape of new universal scattering phenomena governed by the interplay between an interaction and a system's density of states. We investigate one-dimensional scattering with general dispersion relations of the form $\epsilon(k) = |k|^m$ and $\epsilon(k) = \text{sign}(k)|k|^m$ for any real $m \geq 1$. For key models such as emitter scattering and separable potentials, we prove that the low-energy S-matrix converges to universal forms determined solely by the dispersion exponent $m$ and a few integers defining the interaction. This establishes a broad classification of new universality classes, extending far beyond the standard quadratic dispersion paradigm. Furthermore, we derive a generalized Levinson's theorem relating the total winding of the scattering phase to the number of bound states. Our findings are directly relevant to synthetic quantum systems, where engineered dispersion relations in atomic arrays and photonic crystals offer a platform to explore these universal behaviors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.14649v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report the first characterization results of an optical time-stamping camera based on the Timepix4 chip coupled to a fully depleted optical silicon sensor and fast image intensifier, enabling sub-nanosecond scale, time-resolved imaging for single photons. The system achieves an RMS time resolution of 0.27 ns in direct detection mode without the intensifier and from 0.55 to 1.4 ns in the single-photon regime with intensifier for different amplitude-based signal selections. This shows that Timepix4 provides a significant improvement over previous Timepix3-based cameras in terms of timing precision, pixel count, and data throughput. We analyze key factors that affect performance, including sensor bias and time-walk, and demonstrate effective correction methods to recover high temporal accuracy. The camera temporal resolution, event-driven readout and high rate capability make it a scalable platform for a wide range of applications, including quantum optics, ultrafast imaging, and time-correlated photon counting experiments.</description>

Abstract: Lasers provide intense coherent radiation, essential to cool and trap atoms into a Bose-Einstein condensate or can alternatively drive the non-linear dynamics of high-order harmonic generation. Yet, these two fundamental processes remained of independent consideration. Here, we connect matter waves at ultracold temperatures with radiation bursts on the ultrafast attosecond timescale. We do this by exploring high harmonic generation from a Bose-Einstein condensate. We show that the quantum state of the generated harmonics of a driven Bose gas is a classical mixture, while below the critical temperature of Bose-Einstein condensation the emitted harmonic radiation is in a pure quantum state. These states furthermore exhibit squeezing and entanglement across all field modes.</description>

Abstract: Long-living, hot and dense plasmas generated by ultra-intense laser beams are of critical importance for laser-driven nuclear physics, bright hard X-ray sources, and laboratory astrophysics. We report the experimental observation of plasmas with nanosecond-scale lifetimes, near-solid density, and keV-level temperatures, produced by irradiating periodic arrays of composite nanowires with ultra-high contrast, relativistically intense femtosecond laser pulses. Jet-like plasma structures extending up to 1~mm from the nanowire surface were observed, emitting K-shell radiation from He-like Ti$^{20+}$ ions. High-resolution X-ray spectra were analyzed using 3D Particle-in-Cell (PIC) simulations of the laser-plasma interaction combined with collisional--radiative modeling (FLYCHK). The results indicate that the jets consist of plasma with densities of $10^{20}$-$10^{22}$ cm$^{-3}$ and keV-scale temperatures, persisting for several nanoseconds. We attribute the formation of these jets to the generation of kiloTesla-scale global magnetic fields during the laser interaction, as predicted by PIC simulations. These fields may drive long-timescale current instabilities that sustain magnetic fields of several hundred tesla, sufficient to confine hot, dense plasma over nanosecond durations.</description>
