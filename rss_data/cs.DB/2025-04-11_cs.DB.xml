      <title>MatBase Metadata Catalog Management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: MatBase is a prototype intelligent data and knowledge base management system based on the Relational, Entity-Relationship, and (Elementary) Mathematical Data Models. The latter distinguishes itself especially by its rich panoply of constraint types: 61, partitioned into three categories (set, containing 16 types, mapping, containing 44 types, and object) and eight subcategories (general set, dyadic relation, general mapping, autofunction, general function product, homogeneous binary function product, function diagram, and object). They provide database and software application designers with the tools necessary for capturing and enforcing all business rules from any subuniverse of discourse, thus guaranteeing database instances plausibility, a sine qua non condition of data quality. This mathematical data model also includes Datalog, thus making MatBase also a deductive, so a knowledge base system. Currently, there are two MatBase versions (one developed in MS Access and the other in MS .NET, using C# and SQL Server), used by two software developing companies, as well as during labs of our M.Sc. students with the Advanced Databases lectures and labs, both at the Ovidius University at Constanta and at the Department of Engineering in Foreign Languages, Computer Science Taught in English Stream of the Bucharest Polytechnic University. This paper presents MatBase's metadata catalog and its management.</description>

      <title>MatBase Algorithm for Translating Entity-Relationship Data Models into (Elementary) Mathematical Data Model Schemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07326v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a pseudocode algorithm for translating Entity-Relationship data models into (Elementary) Mathematical Data Model schemes. We prove that this algorithm is linear, solid, complete, and optimal. We apply this algorithm to an Entity-Relationship data model for a teaching sub-universe. We also provide the main additional features added to the implementation of this algorithm in MatBase, our intelligent knowledge and database management system prototype based on both the Entity-Relationship, (Elementary) Mathematical, and Relational Data Models.</description>

      <title>How Robust Are Router-LLMs? Analysis of the Fragility of LLM Routing Capabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07113v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language model (LLM) routing has emerged as a crucial strategy for balancing computational costs with performance by dynamically assigning queries to the most appropriate model based on query complexity. Despite recent advances showing that preference-data-based routers can outperform traditional methods, current evaluation benchmarks remain limited. They largely focus on general model capabilities while overlooking task-specific behaviors and critical concerns such as privacy, safety, and potential backdoor vulnerabilities introduced through preference data. In response, we propose the DSC benchmark: Diverse, Simple, and Categorized, an evaluation framework that categorizes router performance across a broad spectrum of query types, including coding, translation, mathematics, human instructions, general knowledge, and LLM jailbreaking. Additionally, it integrates privacy and safety assessments to reveal hidden risks. Our experiments on three preference-based routers and two commercial counterparts demonstrate that while these systems improve efficiency, they often make suboptimal, category-driven decisions. For instance, a BERT-based router directs all coding and mathematics queries to the most powerful LLM even when simpler models would suffice, while routing jailbreaking attempts to weaker models, thereby elevating safety risks.</description>

      <title>Privacy-Enhanced Database Synthesis for Benchmark Publishing (Technical Report)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01312v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Benchmarking is crucial for evaluating a DBMS, yet existing benchmarks often fail to reflect the varied nature of user workloads. As a result, there is increasing momentum toward creating databases that incorporate real-world user data to more accurately mirror business environments. However, privacy concerns deter users from directly sharing their data, underscoring the importance of creating synthesized databases for benchmarking that also prioritize privacy protection. Differential privacy (DP)-based data synthesis has become a key method for safeguarding privacy when sharing data, but the focus has largely been on minimizing errors in aggregate queries or downstream ML tasks, with less attention given to benchmarking factors like query runtime performance. This paper delves into differentially private database synthesis specifically for benchmark publishing scenarios, aiming to produce a synthetic database whose benchmarking factors closely resemble those of the original data. Introducing \textit{PrivBench}, an innovative synthesis framework based on sum-product networks (SPNs), we support the synthesis of high-quality benchmark databases that maintain fidelity in both data distribution and query runtime performance while preserving privacy. We validate that PrivBench can ensure database-level DP even when generating multi-relation databases with complex reference relationships. Our extensive experiments show that PrivBench efficiently synthesizes data that maintains privacy and excels in both data distribution similarity and query runtime similarity.</description>
