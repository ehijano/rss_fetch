      <title>Weighted blow-up desingularization of plane curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01232v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a singular hypersurface in a regular 2-dimensional scheme essentially of finite type over a field, we construct an embedded resolution of singularities by tame Artin stacks. This applies in particular to plane curves. The key tool is Hironaka's characteristic polyhedron from which we determine a suitable center for a stack-theoretic weighted blow-up. In particular, we show that the order strictly decreases at every point lying above the center. In contrast to earlier work by the authors, we do not have to restrict to perfect base fields and we deduce an inductive argument, despite the fact that higher dimensional tangent spaces arise, by taking torus actions and equivariant centers into account. Hence, we work with weighted blow-ups of tame Artin stacks and we do not have to pass to multi-weighted blow-ups of Deligne--Mumford stacks.</description>

      <title>Resolving the Singularities of Splitting Loci</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct modular resolutions of singularities for splitting loci, and use them to show that tame splitting loci have rational singularities. As a corollary of our results and Hurwitz-Brill-Noether theory, we prove that if $C$ is a general $k$-gonal curve, the components of $W^r_d(C)$ have rational singularities. We also recover the classical Gieseker-Petri theorem. Along the way, we prove a cohomology vanishing statement for certain tautological vector bundles on $\operatorname{Quot}^{r,d}_{\mathbb{P}^1}(\mathcal{O}^{\oplus N})$, which may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Smooth minimal surfaces of general type with $p_g=0, K^2=7$ and involutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01405v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lee and the second named author studied involutions on smooth minimal surfaces $S$ of general type with $p_g(S)=0$ and $K_S^2=7$. They gave the possibilities of the birational models $W$ of the quotients and the branch divisors $B_0$ induced by involutions $\sigma$ on the surfaces $S$.
  In this paper we improve and refine the results of Lee and the second named author. We exclude the case of the Kodaira dimension $\kappa(W)=1$ when the number $k$ of isolated fixed points of an involution $\sigma$ on $S$ is nine. The possibilities of branch divisors $B_0$ are reduced for the case $k=9$, and are newly given for the case $k=11$. Moreover, we show that if the branch divisor $B_0$ has three irreducible components, then $S$ is an Inoue surface.</description>

      <title>Adjoints of Polytopes: Determinantal Representations and Smoothness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01672v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article we study determinantal representations of adjoint hypersurfaces of polytopes. We prove that adjoint polynomials of all polygons can be represented as determinants of tridiagonal symmetric matrices of linear forms with the matrix size being equal to the degree of the adjoint. We prove a sufficient combinatorial condition for a surface in the projective three-space to have a determinantal representation and use it to show that adjoints of all three-dimensional polytopes with at most eight facets and a simple facet hyperplane arrangement admit a determinantal representation. This includes all such polytopes with a smooth adjoint. We demonstrate that, starting from four dimensions, adjoint hypersurfaces may not admit linear determinantal representations. Along the way we prove that, starting from three dimensions, adjoint hypersurfaces are typically singular, in contrast to the two-dimensional case. We also consider a special case of interest to physics, the ABHY associahedron. We construct a determinantal representation of its universal adjoint in three dimensions and show that in higher dimensions a similarly structured representation does not exist.</description>

      <title>On nefness of the lowest piece of Hodge modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01731v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give degree lower bounds for quotient line bundles of the lowest piece of a Hodge module induced by a variation of Hodge structures outside a simple normal crossing divisor. We also give sufficient conditions on when the lowest piece is nef. Classical results say when X is a curve or monodromies are unipotent, the lowest piece is a nef vector bundle on X. In dimension greater than or equal to two, if the monodromies at infinity are not unipotent there are counter-examples where nefness fails. This note aims at giving an explanation of failure of nefness. Our result is a lower bound on degrees of quotient line bundles of the pullback of the lowest piece to curves, in terms of local monodromy and intersection numbers with the boundary divisors. The proof uses twisted Hodge modules, which appears naturally when specializing the lowest piece to divisors. We also give geometric examples to show that the lower bound can be achieved.</description>

      <title>On the Euler characteristic of weakly ordinary varieties of maximal Albanese dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01797v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that a smooth proper weakly ordinary variety $X$ of maximal Albanese dimension satisfies $\chi(X, \omega_X) \geq 0$. We also show that if $X$ is not of general type, then $\chi(X, \omega_X) = 0$ and the Albanese image of $X$ is fibered by abelian varieties. The proof uses the positive characteristic generic vanishing theory developed by Hacon-Patakfalvi, as well as our recent Witt vector version of Grauert-Riemenschneider vanishing.</description>

      <title>A hierarchical invariant for line bundles and its applications in algebraic geometry codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of hierarchical depth for line bundles on smooth projective surfaces, defined via filtrations by line subbundles with successive quotients supported on effective divisors. This invariant helps to investigate both the algebraic and geometric complexity of line bundles through discrete stepwise constructions. We study some of its basic properties, including functorial behavior under restriction to curves and compatibility with ampleness and base-point freeness. Applying this framework to algebraic geometry (AG) codes, we show that hierarchical filtrations yield natural code families whose combinatorial parameters (dimension, minimum distance) evolve predictably across the filtration.</description>

      <title>More regular formal moduli spaces and arithmetic transfer conjectures: the ramified quadratic case</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.01395v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For unitary groups associated to a ramified quadratic extension of a $p$-adic field, we define various regular formal moduli spaces of $p$-divisible groups with parahoric levels, characterize exceptional special divisors on them, and construct correspondences between them. We formulate arithmetic transfer conjectures, which are variants of the arithmetic fundamental lemma conjecture in this context. We prove the conjectures in the lowest dimensional cases.</description>

As applications, we provide effecitive Noether type inequalities for log canonical threefolds and stable surfaces. Also, we obtain a uniform bound on the order of the symplectic automorphism group $\mathrm{Aut}_s(S)$ of smooth projective surfaces $S$ of general type.</description>

      <title>Permuting the roots of univariate polynomials whose coefficients depend on parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.14235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.14235v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We address two interrelated problems concerning permutation of roots of univariate polynomials whose coefficients depend on parameters. First, we compute the Galois group of polynomials $\varphi(x)\in\mathbb{C}[t_1,\cdots,t_k][x]$ over $\mathbb{C}(t_1,\cdots,t_k)$. Provided that the corresponding multivariate polynomial $\varphi(x,t_1,\cdots,t_k)$ is generic with respect to its support $A\subset \mathbb{Z}^{k+1}$, we determine the Galois group associated to any $A$. Second, we determine the Galois group of systems of polynomial equations of the form $p(x,t)=q(t)=0$ where $p$ and $q$ have fixed supports $A_1\subset \mathbb{Z}^2$ and $A_2\subset \{0\}\times \mathbb{Z}$, respectively. For each problem, we determine the image of an appropriate braid monodromy map in order to compute the sought Galois group. Among the applications, we determine the Galois group of any rational function that is generic with respect to its support. We also provide general obstructions on the Galois group of enumerative problems over algebraic groups.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2211.15719v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that every toric monoid appears in a space of maps from tropical curves to an orthant. It follows that spaces of logarithmic maps to Artin fans exhibit arbitrary toric singularities: a virtual universality theorem for logarithmic maps to pairs. The target rank depends on the chosen singularity: we show that the cone over the 7-gon never appears in a space of maps to a rank 1 target. We obtain similar results for tropical maps to affine space.</description>

      <title>Logarithmic motivic homotopy theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.02729v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work is dedicated to the construction of a new motivic homotopy theory for (log) schemes, generalizing Morel-Voevodsky's (un)stable $\mathbb{A}^1$-homotopy category. Our framework can be used to represent log topological Hochschild and cyclic homology, as well as algebraic $K$-theory of regular schemes. Additionally, we can realize the cyclotomic trace as a morphism between motivic spectra. Among our applications, we provide a generalized framework of oriented cohomology theories that enables us to produce new residue sequences for (topological) Hochschild, periodic, and cyclic homology of classical schemes. We also compute $THH$ and its variants for Grassmannians, and we define a new version of algebraic cobordism. Finally, we give a construction of a log \'etale stable realization functor, as well as a Kato-Nakayama realization functor, which is of independent interest for applications in log geometry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.10013v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a new moduli stack $\mathscr{E}_{g,n}$ of ``equinormalized curves," closely related to the moduli space of all reduced, connected algebraic curves. We construct a stratification $\bigsqcup_\Gamma \mathscr{E}_\Gamma$ of $\mathscr{E}_{g,n}$ indexed by generalized dual graphs and prove that each stratum $\mathscr{E}_{\Gamma}$ is a fiber bundle over a finite quotient of a product of $\moduli_{g,n}$s. The fibers are moduli schemes parametrizing subalgebras of a fixed algebra, and are in principle explicitly computable as locally closed subschemes of products of Grassmannians. We thus obtain a remarkably explicit geometric description of moduli of reduced curves with arbitrary singularities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.08008v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\varphi: F\longrightarrow G$ be a graded morphism between free $R$-modules of rank $t$ and $t+c-1$, respectively, and let $I_j(\varphi)$ be the ideal generated by the $j \times j$ minors of a matrix representing $\varphi$. In this short note: (1) We show that the canonical module of $R/I_j(\varphi)$ is up to twist equal to a suitable Schur power $\Sigma ^I M$ of $M=\coker (\varphi ^*)$; thus equal to $\wedge ^{t+1-j}M$ if $c=2$ in which case we find a minimal free $R$-resolution of $\wedge ^{t+1-j}M$ for any $j$, (2) For $c = 3$, we construct a free $R$-resolution of $\wedge ^2M$ which starts almost minimally (i.e. the first three terms are minimal up to a precise summand), and (3) For $c \ge 4$, we construct under a certain depth condition the first three terms of a free $R$-resolution of $\wedge ^2M$ which are minimal up to a precise summand. As a byproduct we answer the first open case of a question posed by Buchsbaum and Eisenbud.</description>

      <title>The defect of a cubic threefold and applications to intermediate Jacobian fibrations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.05118v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The defect of a cubic threefold $X$ with isolated singularities is a global invariant that measures the failure of $\mathbb{Q}$-factoriality. We compute the defect for such cubics in terms of topological data about the curve of lines through a singular point. We express the mixed Hodge structure on the middle cohomology of $X$ in terms of both the defect and local invariants of the singularities. We then relate the defect to various geometric properties of $X$: in particular, we show that a cubic threefold is not $\mathbb{Q}$-factorial if and only if it contains either a plane or a cubic scroll. We relate the defect to existence of compactified intermediate Jacobian fibrations with irreducible fibers associated to a cubic fourfold.</description>

      <title>Breaking the symmetry in excess intersection and counting solutions of systems of polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18276v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit the fundamental problem of assigning intersection multiplicities to subsets of solutions of (square) systems of polynomials. Severi [Ann. Mat. Pura Appl. 26 (4), 1947] suggested an intuitive dynamic solution to this problem which was later corrected and made rigorous by Lazarsfeld [Compos. Math. 43, 1981]. We consider an asymmetric variant of this approach and find an explicit description of the resulting "ordered intersection multiplicity" which opens pathways to step by step solutions to the affine B\'ezout problem of counting isolated solutions to (square) systems of polynomials via "Bernstein-Kushnirenko type" estimates in terms of Newton diagrams. To illustrate our methods we compute the number of common tangent lines to $4$ general spheres in the affine $3$-space (which is known to be 12 due to Macdonald, Pach, and Theobald [Discrete Comput. Geom. 26 (1), 2001]) via certain ordered intersection multiplicities on the corresponding Grassmannian.</description>

      <title>Proving the Grothendieck--Teichm\"uller Conjecture for Profinite Spaces &amp; The Galois Grothendieck Path Integral</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13006v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish that the Grothendieck-Teichmuller conjecture, which predicts an isomorphism between the Grothendieck-Teichmuller group GT and the absolute Galois group of rational numbers Gal, holds in the setting of profinite spaces. To access arithmetic information within this framework, we introduce a generalization of the notion of path integrals, defined simultaneously for GT and Gal. This construction reveals new arithmetic invariants for both groups, capturing, in particular, the rationality of periods associated with GT and the rational structure of the coefficients in the Drinfeld associator. Moreover, this perspective provides a mechanism to detect the descent of cohomology classes to Q under the action of Gal, and more broadly, a method to compute ranks of arithmetic objects. Furthermore, we introduce an algorithm, which we call the Cubic Matrioshka, encoding paths in both GT and Gal as unique infinite binary sequences. The compatibility of these binary encodings reflects the underlying homeomorphism and ensures that symmetries of GT are faithfully mirrored in the corresponding binary representation within Gal.</description>
