      <title>Quasiconformal Maps between Bowditch Boundaries of Relatively Hyperbolic Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17312v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classifying groups up to quasi-isometry is a fundamental problem in geometric group theory. In the context of hyperbolic and relatively hyperbolic groups, one of the key invariants in this classification is the boundary at infinity. F. Paulin proved that two hyperbolic groups are quasi-isometric if and only if their Gromov boundaries are quasiconformally equivalent. In this article, we extend Paulin's result to relatively hyperbolic groups and their Bowditch boundaries.
  A notion of quasiconformal map preserving the shadows of horoballs relative to a point at the Bowditch boundary is defined and we have shown that every coarsely cusp-preserving quasi-isometry between two relatively hyperbolic groups induces a shadow-preserving quasiconformal map between their Bowditch boundaries. Conversely, we have shown that if the Bowditch boundaries of two relatively hyperbolic groups are quasiconformally equivalent and the quasiconformal map coarsely preserves the shadows of horoballs relative to each boundary point, then the quasiconformal map induces a coarsely cusp-preserving quasi-isometry between those groups.</description>

      <title>On the smoothing theory delooping of disc diffeomorphism and embedding spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14699v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The celebrated Morlet-Burghelea-Lashof-Kirby-Siebenmann smoothing theory theorem states that the group $\mathrm{Diff}_\partial(D^n)$ of diffeomorphisms of a disc $D^n$ relative to the boundary is equivalent to $\Omega^{n+1}\left(\mathrm{PL}_n/\mathrm{O}_n\right)$ for any $n\geq 1$ and to $\Omega^{n+1}\left(\mathrm{TOP}_n/\mathrm{O}_n\right)$ for $n\neq 4$. We revise smoothing theory results to show that the delooping generalizes to different versions of disc smooth embedding spaces relative to the boundary, namely the usual embeddings, those modulo immersions, and framed embeddings. The latter spaces deloop as $\mathrm{Emb}_\partial^{fr}(D^m,D^n)\simeq\Omega^{m+1}\left(\mathrm{O}_n\backslash\!\!\backslash\mathrm{PL}_n/\mathrm{PL}_{n,m}\right)\simeq \Omega^{m+1}\left(\mathrm{O}_n\backslash\!\!\backslash\mathrm{TOP}_n/\mathrm{TOP}_{n,m}\right)$ for any $n\geq m\geq 1$ ($n\neq 4$ for the second equivalence), where the left-hand side in the case $n-m=2$ or $(n,m)=(4,3)$ should be replaced by the union of the path-components of $\mathrm{PL}$-trivial knots (framing being disregarded). Moreover, we show that for $n\neq 4$, the delooping is compatible with the Budney $E_{m+1}$-action. We use this delooping to combine the Hatcher $\mathrm{O}_{m+1}$-action and the Budney $E_{m+1}$-action into a framed little discs operad $E_{m+1}^{\mathrm{O}_{m+1}}$-action on $\mathrm{Emb}_\partial^{fr}(D^m,D^n)$.</description>

      <title>Filtered instanton homology and cosmetic surgery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21248v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The cosmetic surgery conjecture predicts that for a non-trivial knot in the three-sphere, performing two different Dehn surgeries results in distinct oriented three-manifolds. Hanselman reduced the problem to $\pm 2$ or $\pm 1/n$ surgeries being the only possible cosmetic surgeries. We remove the case of $\pm 1/n$-surgeries using the Chern-Simons filtration on Floer's original irreducible-only instanton homology, reducing the conjecture to the case of $\pm 2$ surgery on genus $2$ knots with trivial Alexander polynomial. We also prove some similar results for surgeries on knots in $S^2 \times S^1$. As key steps in establishing these results, we define invariants of the oriented homeomorphism type of three-manifolds derived from filtered instanton Floer homology and introduce a new surgery relationship for Floer's instanton homology.</description>

      <title>Quasi-projective varieties whose fundamental group is a free product of cyclic groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.17282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.17282v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work we study smooth complex quasi-projective surfaces whose fundamental group is a free product of cyclic groups. In particular, we prove the existence of an admissible map from the quasi-projective surface to a smooth complex quasi-projective curve. Associated with this result, we prove addition-deletion Lemmas for fibers of the admissible map which describe how these operations affect the fundamental group of the quasi-projective surface. Our methods also allow us to produce curves in smooth projective surfaces whose fundamental groups of their complements are free products of cyclic groups, generalizing classical results on $C_{p,q}$ curves and torus type projective sextics, and showing how general this phenomenon is.</description>

      <title>On the topology of fiber-type curves: a Zariski pair of affine nodal curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.07359v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we explore conditions for a curve in a smooth projective surface to have a free product of cyclic groups as the fundamental group of its complement. It is known that if the surface is $\mathbb P^2$, then such curves must be of fiber type, i.e. a finite union of fibers of an admissible map onto a complex curve. In this setting, we exhibit an infinite family of Zariski pairs of fiber-type curves, that is, pairs of plane projective fiber-type curves whose tubular neighborhoods are homeomorphic, but whose embeddings in $\mathbb P^2$ are not. This includes a Zariski pair of curves in $\mathbb C^2$ with only nodes as singularities (and the same singularities at infinity) whose complements have non-isomorphic fundamental groups, one of them being free. Our examples show that the position of nodes also affects the topology of the embedding of projective curves. Twisted Alexander polynomials with respect to finite $SU(2)$ representations show to be useful for this purpose, since all their abelian invariants are the same for both fundamental groups.</description>

      <title>The formality of the Goldman-Turaev Lie bialgebra on a closed surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06154v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We reformulate the Kashiwara-Vergne groups and associators in higher genera, introduced in Alekseev-Kawazumi-Kuno-Naef, in terms of non-commutative connections using the tools developed in a previous paper. As the main result, the case of closed surfaces is dealt with to determine the pro-unipotent automorphism group of the associated graded of the Goldman-Turaev Lie bialgebra.</description>

      <title>Differential topology of the spaces of asymptotically stable vector fields and Lyapunov functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10828v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the topology of the space of all smooth asymptotically stable vector fields on $\mathbb{R}^n$, as well as the space of all proper smooth Lyapunov functions for such vector fields. We prove that both spaces are path-connected and simply connected when $n\neq 4,5$ and weakly contractible when $n\leq 3$. Moreover, both spaces have the weak homotopy type of the nonlinear Grassmannian of submanifolds of $\mathbb{R}^n$ diffeomorphic to the $n$-disc.
  The proofs rely on Lyapunov theory and differential topology, such as the work of Smale and Perelman on the generalized Poincar\'{e} conjecture and results of Smale, Cerf, and Hatcher on the topology of diffeomorphism groups of discs. Applications include a partial answer to a question of Conley, a parametric Hartman-Grobman theorem for nonyperbolic but asymptotically stable equilibria, and a parametric Morse lemma for degenerate minima. We also study the related topics of hyperbolic equilibria, Morse minima, and relative homotopy groups of the space of asymptotically stable vector fields inside the space of those vanishing at a single point.</description>
