      <title>Measurement of exciton fraction of microcavity exciton-polaritons using transfer-matrix modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12940v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a careful calibration of the exciton fraction of polaritons in high-$Q$ ($\sim 300,000$), long-lifetime ($\sim 300$ ps), GaAs/AlGaAs microcavities.This is a crucial parameter for many-body theories which include the polariton-polariton interactions.It is much harder to establish this number in high-$Q$ structures compared to low-$Q$ structures, because the upper polariton is nearly invisible in high-$Q$ cavities.We present a combination of photoluminescence, photoluminescence excitation, and reflectivity measurements to highly constrain the fit model, and compare the results of this model to the results from low-$Q$ structures.We present a fitted curve of exciton fraction as a function of the lower polariton energy for multiple samples which have been used in prior experiments.</description>

      <title>A fractal geometry immersed in a hierarchical magnetic flux distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12972v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fractal geometry presents us with a self-similarity in their pattern at various length scales that is prevalent in our natural world. We present theoretical model of a Sierpinski gasket (SPG) fractal geometry with a deterministic perturbation in the form of a hierarchical distribution of magnetic flux. Such flux configuration induces a deterministic disorder in the Aharonov-Bohm (AB) phases picked up by the electron wavefunction. Using the tight-binding formalism, we show that by tunning the strength of the hierarchy parameter of those AB phases, one can systematically engineer quantum states in a SPG fractal lattice. In addition to this, we have also observed that by controlling the strength of this hierarchy parameter in the magnetic flux, one can effectively regulate the persistent current in the SPG fractal structure. This characteristic is found to be true for various filling factors. Our results could be useful for designing nanoelectronic devices using molecular fractal structures fabricated by chemical synthesis technique.</description>

      <title>Unified Finite-element Model for Transient Absorption and Raman Scattering of Vibrating Noble Metal Nanoparticles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transient absorption and Raman scattering measurements on noble metal nanoparticles offer complimentary information on their vibrational modes and mechanical interactions with their surroundings. We have developed a comprehensive modeling tool for simulating both of these spectra based on COMSOL Multiphysics finite-element simulation software. This application can be used to predict the spectra for arbitrary geometries and metal compositions, takes into account local changes in dielectric function for the metals, and can model the small vibrational amplitudes of real transient absorption measurements. We present simulation results for gold and silver nanospheres, silver nanocubes, and gold truncated nanocubes, showing the ability to calculate relative peaks heights in Raman spectra and the ability to fit amplitudes of transient-absorption signals to experiment, and showing that Raman spectra can include contributions from modes often neglected due to symmetry considerations.</description>

      <title>Dynamical phase-field model of cavity electromagnonic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13203v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cavity electromagnonic system, which simultaneously consists of cavities for photons, magnons (quanta of spin waves), and acoustic phonons, provides an exciting platform to achieve coherent energy transduction among different physical systems down to single quantum level. Here we report a dynamical phase-field model that allows simulating the coupled dynamics of the electromagnetic waves, magnetization, and strain in 3D multiphase systems. As examples of application, we computationally demonstrate the excitation of hybrid magnon-photon modes (magnon polaritons), Floquet-induced magnonic Aulter-Townes splitting, dynamical energy exchange (Rabi oscillation) and relative phase control (Ramsey interference) between the two magnon polariton modes. The simulation results are consistent with analytical calculations based on Floquet Hamiltonian theory. Simulations are also performed to design a cavity electro-magno-mechanical system that enables the triple phonon-magnon-photon resonance, where the resonant excitation of a chiral, fundamental (n=1) transverse acoustic phonon mode by magnon polaritons is demonstrated. With the capability to predict coupling strength, dissipation rates, and temporal evolution of photon/magnon/phonon mode profiles using fundamental materials parameters as the inputs, the present dynamical phase-field model represents a valuable computational tool to guide the fabrication of the cavity electromagnonic system and the design of operating conditions for applications in quantum sensing, transduction, and communication.</description>

      <title>Quantum Metric-induced Oscillations in Flat Bands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13324v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The transport of Bloch electrons under strong fields is traditionally understood through two mechanisms: intraband Bloch oscillations and interband Zener tunneling. Here we propose a new oscillation mechanism induced by the interband quantum metric, which would significantly affect the electron dynamics under strong fields. By considering the multiband dynamics to the second order of the density matrix, we reveal that quantum metric-induced oscillations (QMO) persist regardless of band dispersion, even in exactly flat bands. The resultant drift current can reach a magnitude comparable to the Bloch oscillations-induced drift current in systems where interband tunneling is negligible. Notably, the {QMO}-induced drift current increases linearly with electric field strength under the constraints of time-reversal or spatial-inversion symmetry, emerging as the primary delocalized current. We further show that both one-dimensional and two-dimensional superlattices are potential platforms for investigating QMO.</description>

      <title>Topological boundary states in engineered quantum-dot molecules on the InAs(111)A surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13347v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Atom manipulation by scanning tunneling microscopy was used to construct quantum dots on the InAs(111)A surface. Each dot comprised six ionized indium adatoms. The positively charged adatoms create a confining potential acting on surface-state electrons, leading to the emergence of a bound state associated with the dot. By lining up the dots into N-dot chains with alternating tunnel coupling between them, quantum-dot molecules were constructed that revealed electronic boundary states as predicted by the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model of one-dimensional topological phases. Dot chains with odd N were constructed such that they host a single end or domain-wall state, allowing one to probe the localization of the boundary state on a given sublattice by scanning tunneling spectroscopy. We found probability density also on the forbidden sublattice together with an asymmetric energy spectrum of the chain-confined states. This deviation from the SSH model arises because the dots are charged and create a variation in onsite potential along the chain - which does not remove the boundary states but shifts their energy away from the midgap position. Our results demonstrate that topological boundary states can be created in quantum-dot arrays engineered with atomic-scale precision.</description>

      <title>Quasiparticles with fractional charges in fractionally filled systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13429v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study systems that approach a state possessing discrete symmetry due to different degenerate realizations for the system. For concreteness, we consider fractionally filled systems where degeneracy comes from the presence of identical sub-lattices. We show that such systems possess a new type of quasiparticles with fractional charges, which we refer to as fractyons. We discuss static and dynamic properties of these quasiparticles.</description>

      <title>An Attempt to Derive the Expression of the Constant in the Thermodynamic Uncertainty Relations by a Statistical Model for a Quasi-Ideal Nano-Gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent work, we have shown that fundamental quantities such as the total entropy production, the thermodynamic variables conjugate to the thermodynamic forces, and the Glansdorff-Prigogine's dissipative variable may be discretized at the mesoscopic scale. The Canonical Commutation Rules (CCRs) valid at the mesoscopic scale have been postulated and the measurement process consists of determining the eigenvalues of the operators associated with the thermodynamic quantities. The essence of that work was to analyze the consequences of these postulates. This letter aims to understand the physical nature of the new constant (beta) introduced in the CCRs. In particular, two questions are still open. Is beta a new fundamental constant? Does the constant in the CCRs correspond to the lowest limit? We shall tackle the problem starting from the simplest assumption: the expression of beta can be derived from a simple model (a heuristic model) for nano-gas and studied through the tools of classical statistical physics. We will find that the theoretical value is very close to the experimental one. We shall not go further in our interpretation; we shall limit ourselves simply by noticing that according to our model, the constant beta does not appear to be a new fundamental constant but corresponds to the minimum value.</description>

      <title>Quasiperiodic potential induced corner states in a quadrupolar insulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13535v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We systematically investigate the topological and localization properties of a quadrupolar insulator represented by the celebrated Benalcazar-Bernevig-Hughes model in presence of a quasiperiodic disorder instilled in its hopping amplitude. While disorder can be detrimental to the existence of the topological order in a system, we observe the emergence of a disorder driven topological phase where the original (clean) system demonstrates trivial behavior. This phenomenon is confirmed by the re-emergence of zero energy states in the bandstructure together with a non-zero bulk quadrupole moment, which in turn establishes the bulk boundary correspondence (BBC). Furthermore, the distribution of the excess electronic charge shows a pattern that is reminiscent of the bulk quadrupole topology. To delve into the localization properties of the mid-band states, we compute the inverse participation and normalized participation ratios. It is observed that the in-gap states become critical (multifractal) at the point that discerns a transition from a topological localized to a trivial localized phase. Finally, we carry out a similar investigation to ascertain the effect of the quasiperiodic disorder on the quadrupolar insulator when the model exhibits topological properties in the absence of disorder. Again, we note a multifractal behavior of the eigenstates in the vicinity of the transition.</description>

      <title>Landau Level Single-Electron Pumping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13615v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first detailed study of the effect of a strong magnetic field on single-electron pumping in a device utilising a finger-gate split-gate configuration. In the quantum Hall regime, we demonstrate electron pumping from Landau levels in the leads, where the measurements exhibit pronounced oscillations in the lengths of the pumping plateaus with the magnetic field, reminiscent of Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations. This similarity indicates that the pumping process is dependent on the density of states of the 2D electron gas over a narrow energy window. Based on these observations, we develop a new theoretical description of the operation of single-electron pumps which for the first time allows for the determination of the physical parameters of the experiment; such as the capture energy of the electrons, the broadening of the quantised Landau levels in the leads, and the quantum lifetime of the electrons.</description>

      <title>Universal Role of Combined Symmetry for the Protection of the Dirac Cone in Antiferromagnetic Topological Insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13639v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Antiferromagnetic topological insulators (AF TIs) are predicted to exhibit exotic physical properties such as gigantic optical and topological magnetoelectric responses. While a key to achieving such phenomena relies on how to break the symmetry protecting the Dirac-cone surface state (SS) and acquire the mass of Dirac fermions, the mechanism has yet to be clarified. To address this issue, we carried out micro-focused angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy for GdBi hosting the type-II AF order, and uncovered the stripe-type 2$\times$1 reconstruction of the Fermi surface associated with the AF band folding. Intriguingly, in contrast to NdBi with the type-I AF order displaying the surface-selective Dirac-fermion mass, GdBi shows massless behavior irrespective of AF domains due to the robust topological protection. These results strongly suggest a crucial role of the ThetaTD (time-reversal and translational) symmetry to create the Dirac-fermion mass in AF TIs.</description>

      <title>Oxygen vacancies kinetics in $TaO_{2-h}$/$Ta_{2}$$O_{5-x}$ memristive interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13676v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Oxygen vacancies (OV) are pervasive in metal oxides and play a pivotal role in the switching behaviour of oxide-based memristive devices. In this work we address, through a combination of experiments and theoretical simulations, OV dynamics in $Pt/TaO_{2-h}/Ta_{2}O_{5-x}/TaO_${2-y}$/Pt$ devices. In particular, we focus on the RESET transition (from low to high resistance), induced by the application of electrical pulse(s), by choosing different initial OV profiles and studying their kinetics during the mentioned process. We demonstrate that by selecting specific OV profiles it is possible to tune the characteristic time-scale of the RESET. Finally, we show that the implementation of gradual RESETs, induced by applying many (small) successive pulses, allows estimating the activation energies involved in the OV electromigration process. Our results help paving the way for OV engineering aiming at optimizing key memristive figures such as switching speed or power consumption, which are highly relevant for neuromorphic or in-memory computing implementations.</description>

      <title>Observation of Electronic Viscous Dissipation in Graphene Magneto-thermal Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hydrodynamic transport effectively describes the collective dynamics of fluids with well-defined thermodynamic quantities. With enhanced electron-electron interactions at elevated temperatures, the collective behavior of electrons in graphene with minimal impurities can be depicted as a hydrodynamic flow of charges. In this new regime, the well-known rules of Ohmic transport based on a single electron picture no longer apply, necessitating the consideration of collective electron dynamics. In particular, the hydrodynamic analogues of Joule heating and thermal transport require consideration of the viscous motion of the electron fluid, which has a direct impact on energy dissipation and heat generation by the fluidic motion of charge. In this work, we probe graphene hydrodynamics with thermal transport and find two distinct, qualitative signatures: thermal conductivity suppression below the Wiedemann-Franz value and viscous heating leading to magnetically-induced redistribution of temperature. We find these two effects are coincident in temperature and density, providing robust qualitative signatures of hydrodynamics, despite arising from two distinct aspects of this new regime: microscopic momentum conservation due to electron-electron scattering, and geometry-dependent viscous dissipation. Our results mark the first observation of viscous electronic heating in an electron fluid, providing insight for thermal management in electronic hydrodynamic devices and offering a new methodology for identifying hydrodynamic states in other systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.13825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the low-frequency noise (LFN), i.e. flicker noise, also referred to as 1/f noise, in 2D networks of molecularly functionalized gold nanoparticles (NMN: nanoparticle-molecule network). We examine the noise behaviors of the NMN hosting alkyl chains (octanethiol), fatty acid oleic acids (oleylamine), redox molecule switches (polyoxometalate derivatives) or photo-isomerizable molecules (azobenzene derivatives) and we compare their 1/f noise behaviors. These noise metrics are used to evaluate which molecules are the best candidates to build in-materio reservoir computing molecular devices based on NMNs.</description>

      <title>Room-temperature Ferroelectric Control of 2D Layered Magnetism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electrical tuning of magnetism is crucial for developing fast, compact, ultra-low power electronic devices. Multiferroics offer significant potential due to their ability to control magnetic via an electric field through magnetoelectric coupling, especially in layered ferroelectric/ferromagnet heterostructures. A key challenge is achieving reversible and stable switching between distinct magnetic states using a voltage control. In this work, we present ferroelectric tuning of room-temperature magnetism in a 2D layered ferromagnet. The energy-efficient control consumes less than 1 fJ per operation which is normally in the order of several aJ, resulting in a ~43% change in magnetization. This tunable multiferroic interface and associated devices provide promising opportunities for next-generation reconfigurable communication systems, spintronics, sensors and memories.</description>

      <title>Role of Bath-Induced Many-Body Interactions in the Dissipative Phases of the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13878v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Su-Schrieffer-Heeger chain is a prototype example of a symmetry-protected topological insulator. Coupling it non-perturbatively to local thermal environments, either through the intercell or the intracell fermion tunneling elements, modifies the topological window. To understand this effect, we employ the recently developed reaction-coordinate polaron transform (RCPT) method, which allows treating system-bath interactions at arbitrary strengths. The effective system Hamiltonian, which is obtained via the RCPT, exposes the impact of the baths on the SSH chain through renormalization of tunneling elements and the generation of many-body interaction terms. By performing exact diagonalization and computing the ensemble geometric phase, a topological invariant applicable even to systems at finite temperature, we distinguish the trivial band insulator (BI) from the topological insulator (TI) phases. Furthermore, through the RCPT mapping, we are able to pinpoint the main mechanism behind the extension of the parameter space for the TI or the BI phases (depending on the coupling scheme, intracell or intercell), which is the bath-induced, dimerized, many-body interaction. We also study the effect of on-site staggered potentials on the SSH phase diagram, and discuss extensions of our method to higher dimensions.</description>

Abstract: The magnetoresistance (MR) effect, which stems from the spin-exchange coupling between local moments and itinerant electrons in magnetic materials, is a challenging many-body and open-quantum problem. Here, we develop a comprehensive microscopic theory of MR from an open-quantum system perspective. The theory not only predicts the magnetic field and temperature dependencies of MR which are related to spin relaxation time and spin-exchange field but also obtains the universal cosine-square law of anisotropic MR that microscopically elucidates diverse MR effects from the magnon-induced spin flip, anisotropic spin relaxation, and Hanle spin precession of itinerant electrons. Moreover, we reveal fruitful behaviors of the MR effect that enable the simple detection of the microscopic spin-exchange coupling through an electrical approach. Our theory contributes to a deeper understanding of the fundamental physics underlying MR and provides insights for experiments involving magnetic materials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.13953v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological excitations in periodic magnetic crystals have received significant recent attention. However, it is an open question on their fate once the lattice periodicity is broken. In this work, we theoretically study the topological properties embedded in the collective dynamics of magnetic texture array arranged into a Sierpi\'nski carpet structure with effective Hausdorff dimensionality $d_{f}=1.893$. By evaluating the quantized real-space quadrupole moment, we obtain the phase diagram supporting peculiar corner states that are absent in conventional square lattices. We identify three different higher-order topological states, i.e., outer corner state, type I and type II inner corner states. We further show that all these corner states are topologically protected and are robust against moderate disorder. Full micromagnetic simulations are performed to verify theoretical predictions with good agreement. Our results pave the way to investigating topological phases of magnetic texture based fractals and bridging the gap between magnetic topology and fractality.</description>

      <title>Topological Solitons in Square-root Graphene Nanoribbons Controlled by Electric Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13978v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) are unique quasi-one-dimensional (1D) materials that have garnered a lot of research interest in the field of topological insulators. While the topological phases exhibited by GNRs are primarily governed by their chemical structures, the ability to externally control these phases is crucial for their potential utilization in quantum electronics and spintronics. Here we propose a class of GNRs featured by mirror symmetry and four zigzag segments in a unit cell that has unique topological properties induced and controlled by an externally applied electric field. Their band structures manifest two finite gaps which support topological solitons, as described by an effective square-root model. To demonstrate the experimental feasibility, we design and synthesize a representative partially zigzag chevron-type GNR (pzc-GNR) with the desired zigzag segments using a bottom-up approach. First-principles calculations on pzc-GNR reveal band inversions at the two finite gaps by switching the direction of the electric field, which is in accordance with predictions from the square-root Hamiltonian. We show different topological phases can be achieved by controlling the direction of the field and the chemical potential of the system in square-root GNRs. Consequently, upon adding a step-function electric field, solitons states can be generated at the domain wall. We discuss the properties of two types of soliton states, depending on whether the terminating commensurate unit cell is mirror symmetric.</description>

      <title>Dirac-like fermions anomalous magneto-transport in a spin-polarized oxide two-dimensional electron system</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In two-dimensional electron systems (2DES) the breaking of the inversion, time-reversal and bulk crystal-field symmetries is interlaced with the effects of spin-orbit coupling (SOC) triggering exotic quantum phenomena. Here, we used epitaxial engineering to design and realize a 2DES characterized simultaneously by ferromagnetic order, large Rashba SOC and hexagonal band warping at the (111) interfaces between LaAlO$_{3}$, EuTiO$_{3}$ and SrTiO$_{3}$ insulators. The 2DES displays anomalous quantum corrections to the magneto-conductance driven by the time-reversal-symmetry breaking occurring below the magnetic transition temperature. The results are explained by the emergence of a non-trivial Berry phase and competing weak anti-localization / weak localization back-scattering of Dirac-like fermions, mimicking the phenomenology of gapped topological insulators. These findings open perspectives for the engineering of novel spin-polarized functional 2DES holding promises in spin-orbitronics and topological electronics.</description>

      <title>Anisptropic plasmons in threefold Hopf semimetals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Threefold Hopf semimetals are a novel type of topological semimetals that possess an internal anisotropy characterized by a dipolar structure of the Berry curvature and an isotropic energy band structure consisting of a Dirac cone and a flat band. In this study, we theoretically investigate the impact of internal anisotropy on plasmons in threefold Hopf semimetals using random-phase approximation. In contrast to the classical intuition that isotropy of the energy band dispersion leads to isotropic plasmons in the classical regime (i.e., in the wavelength limit), we find that plasmons in threefold Hopf semimetals exhibit notable anisotropy even in the long-wavelength limit. We derive an explicit analytical form of the long-wavelength plasmon frequency, and numerically demonstrate the validity of our results in a wide range of situations. Our work reveals that the anisotropy of long-wavelength plasmons can reach 25%, making it experimentally observable.</description>

      <title>2024 roadmap on 2D topological insulators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 2D topological insulators promise novel approaches towards electronic, spintronic, and quantum device applications. This is owing to unique features of their electronic band structure, in which bulk-boundary correspondences enforces the existence of 1D spin-momentum locked metallic edge states - both helical and chiral - surrounding an electrically insulating bulk. Forty years since the first discoveries of topological phases in condensed matter, the abstract concept of band topology has sprung into realization with several materials now available in which sizable bulk energy gaps - up to a few hundred meV - promise to enable topology for applications even at room-temperature. Further, the possibility of combining 2D TIs in heterostructures with functional materials such as multiferroics, ferromagnets, and superconductors, vastly extends the range of applicability beyond their intrinsic properties. While 2D TIs remain a unique testbed for questions of fundamental condensed matter physics, proposals seek to control the topologically protected bulk or boundary states electrically, or even induce topological phase transitions to engender switching functionality. Induction of superconducting pairing in 2D TIs strives to realize non-Abelian quasiparticles, promising avenues towards fault-tolerant topological quantum computing. This roadmap aims to present a status update of the field, reviewing recent advances and remaining challenges in theoretical understanding, materials synthesis, physical characterization and, ultimately, device perspectives.</description>

      <title>Excitons in nonlinear optical responses: shift current in MoS$_2$ and GeS monolayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14215v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is well-known that exciton effects are determinant to understand the optical absorption spectrum of low-dimensional materials. However, the role of excitons in nonlinear optical responses has been much less investigated at an experimental level. Additionally, computational methods to calculate nonlinear conductivities in real materials are still not widespread, particularly taking into account excitonic interactions. We present a methodology to calculate the excitonic second-order optical responses in 2D materials relying on: (i) ab initio tight-binding Hamiltonians obtained by Wannier interpolation and (ii) the Bethe-Salpeter equation with effective electron-hole interactions. Here, in particular, we explore the role of excitons in the shift current of monolayer materials. Focusing on MoS$_2$ and GeS monolayer systems, our results show that $2p$-like excitons, which are dark in the linear response regime, yield a contribution to the photocurrent comparable to that of $1s$-like excitons. Under radiation with intensity $\sim 10^{4} $W/cm$^2$, the excitonic theory predicts in-gap photogalvanic currents of almost $\sim 10$ nA in sufficiently clean samples, which is typically one order of magnitude higher than the value predicted by independent-particle theory near the band edge.</description>

      <title>Electrical switching of chirality in rhombohedral graphene Chern insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14289v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A Chern insulator hosts topologically protected chiral edge currents with quantized conductance characterized by its Chern number. Switching the chirality of the Chern insulator, namely, the direction of the edge current, is highly challenging due to topologically forbidden backscattering but is of considerable importance for the design of topological devices. Nevertheless, this can be achieved by reversing the sign of the Chern number through a topological phase transition. Here, we report electrically switchable chirality in rhombohedral heptalayer graphene-based Chern insulators. The surface flat band and giant Berry curvature in rhombohedral multilayer graphene provide a highly tunable platform for engineering the topological states. By introducing moire superlattices in rhombohedral heptalayer graphene, we observed a cascade of topological phase transitions at quarter electron filling of a moire band. The Chern number can be continuously tuned from 0, -1, 1 to 2 by electric fields, manifesting as a large anomalous Hall effect and following Streda's formula. Sign reversal and the anomalous Hall effect also occurred at non-integer fillings, suggesting the possibility of electrically tunable topological phase transitions within the regime of fractional Chern insulators. Our work establishes rhombohedral heptalayer graphene moire superlattices as a versatile platform for topological engineering. The realization of switchable chirality enhances the potential application of chiral edge currents in topological circuit interconnects.</description>

      <title>Non-Hermitian topology of transport in Chern insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14303v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It has recently been shown that signatures of non-Hermitian topology can be realized in a conventional quantum Hall device connected to multiple current sources. These signatures manifest as robust current-voltage characteristics, dictated by the presence of a nontrivial, non-Hermitian topological invariant of the conductance matrix. Chiral edge states are believed to be responsible for this non-Hermitian response, similar to how they lead to a quantized Hall conductivity in the presence of a single current source. Here, we go beyond this paradigm, showing that multi-terminal conductance matrices can exhibit non-Hermitian topological phase transitions that cannot be traced back to the presence and directionality of a boundary-localized chiral mode. By performing quantum transport simulations in the quantum Hall regime of monolayer graphene, we find that when the chemical potential is swept across the zeroth Landau level, unavoidable device imperfections cause the appearance of an additional non-Hermitian phase of the conductance matrix. This highlights graphene as an ideal platform for the study of non-Hermitian topological phase transitions, and is a first step towards exploring how the geometry of quantum devices can be harnessed to produce robust, topologically-protected transport characteristics.</description>

      <title>Magnetic anisotropy of $4f$ atoms on a WSe$_2$ monolayer: a DFT+U study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inspired by recent advancements in the field of single-atom magnets, particularly those involving rare-earth (RE) elements, we present a theoretical exploration employing DFT+$U$ calculations to investigate the magnetic properties of selected $4f$ atoms, specifically Eu, Gd and Ho, on a monolayer of the transition-metal dichalcogenide WSe$_2$ in the 1H-phase. This study comparatively examines RE with diverse $4f$ orbital fillings and valence chemistry, aiming to understand how different coverage densities atop WSe$_2$ affect the magnetocrystalline anisotropy. We observe that RE elements lacking $5d$ occupation in the atomic limit exhibit larger magnetic anisotropy energies at high densities, while those with outer $5d$ electrons show larger anisotropies in dilute configurations. Additionally, even half-filled $4f$ shell atoms with small orbital magnetic moments can generate substantial energy barriers for magnetization rotation due to prominent orbital hybridizations with WSe$_2$. Open $4f$ shell atoms further enhance anisotropy barriers through spin-orbit coupling effects. This aspect is crucial for the experimental realization of stable magnetic information units.</description>

      <title>Electrical switching of Ising-superconducting nonreciprocity for quantum neuronal transistor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonreciprocal quantum transport effect is mainly governed by the symmetry breaking of the material systems and is gaining extensive attention in condensed matter physics. Realizing electrical switching of the polarity of the nonreciprocal transport without external magnetic field is essential to the development of nonreciprocal quantum devices. However, electrical switching of superconducting nonreciprocity remains yet to be achieved. Here, we report the observation of field-free electrical switching of nonreciprocal Ising superconductivity in Fe3GeTe2/NbSe2 van der Waals (vdW) heterostructure. By taking advantage of this electrically switchable superconducting nonreciprocity, we demonstrate a proof-of-concept nonreciprocal quantum neuronal transistor, which allows for implementing the XOR logic gate and faithfully emulating biological functionality of a cortical neuron in the brain. Our work provides a promising pathway to realize field-free and electrically switchable nonreciprocity of quantum transport and demonstrate its potential in exploring neuromorphic quantum devices with both functionality and performance beyond the traditional devices.</description>

      <title>The superconducting clock-circuit: Improving the coherence of Josephson radiation beyond the thermodynamic uncertainty relation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the field of superconducting electronics, the on-chip generation of AC radiation is essential for further advancements. Although a Josephson junction can emit AC radiation from a purely DC voltage bias, the coherence of this radiation is significantly limited by Johnson-Nyquist noise. We relate this limitation to the thermodynamic uncertainty relation (TUR) in the field of stochastic thermodynamics. Recent findings indicate that the thermodynamic uncertainty relation can be broken by a classical pendulum clock. We demonstrate how the violation of the TUR can be used as a design principle for radiation sources by showing that a superconducting clock circuit emits coherent AC radiation from a DC bias.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14465v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the magneto-optical properties of two-dimensional nonsymmorphic Dirac semimetals in the presence of antiferromagnetic order. Using the Kubo formula, we calculate the conductivity tensor of two-dimensional CuMnAs, a prototype antiferromagnetic Dirac material, as a function of light frequency. From the finite-frequency conductivity tensor, we derive the dynamic dielectric function and magnetic linear dichroism, demonstrating how they are influenced by the orientation of the N{\'e}el order parameter. Adjusting the N{\'e}el vector changes both the sign and amplitude of the system's magneto-optical response. We propose that magnetic linear dichroism spectroscopy is a powerful technique for determining the orientation of the N{\'e}el vector.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12939v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in superconducting circuit technology have made the fabrication of large, customizable circuits routine. This has led to their application to areas beyond quantum information and, in particular, to their use as quantum simulators. A key challenge in this effort has been the identification of the quantum states realized by these circuits. Here, we propose a probe circuit capable of reading out many-body correlations in an analog quantum simulator. Our measurement scheme, designed for many-photon states, exploits the non-linearity of the Josephson junction to measure two-point (and potentially higher-order) correlation functions of the superconducting phase operator. We demonstrate the capabilities of this design in the context of an LC-ladder with a quantum impurity. The proposed probe allows for the measurement of inherently quantum correlations, such as squeezing, and has the potential to significantly expand the scope of analog quantum simulations using superconducting circuits.</description>

      <title>Origin of the hidden energy scale and the $f$-ratio in geometrically frustrated magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12966v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sufficiently clean geometrically frustrated (GF) magnets are the largest class of candidate materials that may host quantum spin liquids (QSLs). Some of them have been shown to exhibit spin-glass freezing, potentially precluding QSLs, at the "hidden energy scale", which is significantly lower than the microscopic energy scale of spin interactions. Here, we investigate the origin of the hidden energy scale and its relationship to the $f$-ratio, the figure of merit for the degree of frustration in GF magnetic materials. The available experimental and numerical data provide evidence that GF magnets display, universally, two distinct temperature scales in the specific heat, the lowest of which is of the order of the hidden energy scale $T^*$. We argue that this scale is determined by non-magnetic excitations, similar to spin exchanges in chains of spins. The collective entropy of such excitations matches the entropy of the ground states of the Ising model on the same lattice, which provides a way to verify the proposed scenario in experiment. We further confirm this scenario of the hidden energy scale by numerical simulations of spins on the kagome lattice. As $T^*$ is a property of the clean GF medium, it leads to a constraint on the $f$-ratio.</description>

Abstract: Topological and geometrical features arising in bosonic Bogoliubov-de Gennes (BdG) systems have mainly been studied by utilizing a generalized symplectic version of the Berry curvature and related Chern numbers. Here, we propose a symplectic quantum geometric tensor (SQGT), whose imaginary part leads to the previously studied symplectic Berry curvature, while the real part gives rise to a symplectic quantum metric, providing a natural distance measure in the space of bosonic Bogoliubov modes. We propose how to measure all components of the SQGT by extracting excitation rates in response to periodic modulations of the systems' parameters. Moreover, we connect the symplectic Berry curvature to a generalized symplectic anomalous velocity term for Bogoliubov Bloch wave packets. We test our results for a bosonic Bogoliubov-Haldane model.</description>

      <title>Self-Hybridized Exciton-Polariton Photovoltaics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.13065v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Excitonic semiconductors are attractive for next-generation photovoltaics (PVs) with lower cost, lighter weight, and lower material consumption than conventional technologies. Among them, transition metal dichalcogenide materials like WS2 are especially interesting due to exceptionally strong light-matter interaction. Photocurrent generation in excitonic PVs relies on exciton diffusion to heterointerfaces. However, efficiencies of excitonic PVs are often limited by short exciton diffusion lengths. Here we report that the strong coupling of excitons to cavity photons in a WS2 absorber layer can enhance the external quantum efficiency by a factor of &gt;10, internal quantum efficiency by a factor of ~3, and power conversion efficiency of excitonic PVs by an order of magnitude. The resulting hybrid states, exciton-polaritons, enhance the resonant absorption and exciton transport while the use of the WS2 layer as its own optical cavity enables broadband absorption. Thickness dependent device characterization reveals anomalous internal quantum efficiency and fill factor behavior that are attributed to novel exciton-polariton transport. Exciton-polariton enhanced transport occurs for both resonant and off-resonant excitation, emphasizing the value and practicality of the self-hybridized device structure. Our work presents a route towards excitonic PVs with broadband absorption and improved exciton transport without strict requirements of donor/acceptor structure of other excitonic PVs.</description>

      <title>Ultralow thermal conductance across the [FePt/h-BN/FePt] interface</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.13085v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Heat transfer in nanocomposite materials has attracted great interest for various applications. Multilayer structures provide an important platform to study interfacial thermal transport and to engineer materials with ultralow thermal conductivity. Here we report on the fabrication and thermal characterization of [h-BN/$L1_0$-FePt]xN multilayers, where hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) nanosheets (2.5 nm thick) and $L1_0$-FePt layers (6.5 nm thick) alternate periodically. Differential three-omega($3\omega$) measurements reveal an ultralow effective thermal conductivity of $ 0.60 \pm 0.05 W \cdot m^{-1}K^{-1}$ across the multilayer films, and a low thermal boundary conductance (TBC) of $ 67.9 \pm 6.6 MW \cdot m^{-2}K^{-1}$ for the [FePt/h-BN(2.5nm)/FePt] interface at room temperature. We attribute the ultralow thermal conductivity to the weak van der Waals bonding at h-BN/FePt interfaces, which dominates the thermal resistance of the multilayer structure. These findings provide insights into the thermal transport in 2D-material/metal multilayer nanostructures and suggest the [h-BN/FePt] superlattice as a promising material for nanoscale thermal barrier coating. Furthermore, the obtained TBC lays the foundation for analyzing heat transfer in FePt-(h-BN) nanogranular films, a promising magnetic recording media which can potentially provide high thermal gradient for heat-assisted magnetic recording (HAMR). This work advances the understanding of thermal transport in 2D-material/metal nanocomposites and demonstrates interface engineering as an effective approach to achieve materials with ultralow thermal conductivity.</description>

      <title>Magnetoresistance hysteresis in the superconduting state of Kagome CsV$_3$Sb$_5$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.13164v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The hysteresis of magnetoresistance observed in superconductors is of great interest due to its potential connection with unconventional superconductivity. In this study, we perform electrical transport measurements on Kagome superconductor CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ nanoflakes and uncover unusual hysteretic behaviour of magnetoresistance in the superconducting state. This hysteresis can be induced by applying either a large DC or AC current at temperatures ($T$) well below the superconducting transition temperature ($T_{\rm c}$). As $T$ approaches $T_{\rm c}$, similar weak hysteresis is also be detected by applying a small current. Various scenarios are discussed, with particular focus on the effects of vortex pinning and the presence of time-reversal-symmtery-breaking superconducting domains. Our findings support the latter, hinting at chiral superconductivity in Kagome superconductors.</description>

      <title>Chiral {\pi} Domain Walls Composed of Twin Half-Integer Surface Disclinations in Ferroelectric Nematic Liquid Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13326v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ferroelectric nematic liquid crystals are polar fluids characterized by microscopic orientational ordering and macroscopic spontaneous polarizations. Within these fluids, walls that separate domains of different polarizations are ubiquitous. We demonstrate that the {\pi} walls in films of polar fluids consist of twin half-integer surface disclinations spaced horizontally, enclosing a subdomain where the polarization exhibits left- or right-handed {\pi} twists across the film. The degenerate geometric configurations of these twin disclinations give rise to kinks and antikinks, effectively partitioning subdomains of opposite chirality like Ising chains. The hierarchical topological structures dictate that field-driven polar switching entails a two-step annihilation process of the disclinations. These findings serve as a cornerstone for comprehending other walls in ferroelectric and ferromagnetic materials, thereby laying the base for domain engineering crucial for advancing their nonlinear and optoelectronic applications.</description>

      <title>Kinetic Inductance, Quantum Geometry, and Superconductivity in Magic-Angle Twisted Bilayer Graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13740v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The physics of superconductivity in magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene (MATBG) is a topic of keen interest in moir\'e systems research, and it may provide insight into the pairing mechanism of other strongly correlated materials such as high-$T_{\mathrm{c}}$ superconductors. Here, we use DC-transport and microwave circuit quantum electrodynamics (cQED) to measure directly the superfluid stiffness of superconducting MATBG via its kinetic inductance. We find the superfluid stiffness to be much larger than expected from conventional single-band Fermi liquid theory; rather, it aligns well with theory involving quantum geometric effects that are dominant at the magic angle. The temperature dependence of the superfluid stiffness exhibits a power-law behavior, which contraindicates an isotropic BCS model; instead, the extracted power-law exponents indicate an anisotropic superconducting gap, whether interpreted using the conventional anisotropic BCS model or a quantum geometric theory of flat-band superconductivity. Moreover, the quadratic dependence of the stiffness on both DC and microwave current is consistent with Ginzburg-Landau theory. Taken together, these findings strongly suggest a connection between quantum geometry, superfluid stiffness, and unconventional superconductivity in MATBG. Finally, the combined DC-microwave measurement platform used here is applicable to the investigation of other atomically thin superconductors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.13742v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The robustness of the macroscopic quantum nature of a superconductor can be characterized by the superfluid stiffness, $\rho_s$, a quantity that describes the energy required to vary the phase of the macroscopic quantum wave function. In unconventional superconductors, such as cuprates, the low-temperature behavior of $\rho_s$ drastically differs from that of conventional superconductors due to quasiparticle excitations from gapless points (nodes) in momentum space. Intensive research on the recently discovered magic-angle twisted graphene family has revealed, in addition to superconducting states, strongly correlated electronic states associated with spontaneously broken symmetries, inviting the study of $\rho_s$ to uncover the potentially unconventional nature of its superconductivity. Here we report the measurement of $\rho_s$ in magic-angle twisted trilayer graphene (TTG), revealing unconventional nodal-gap superconductivity. Utilizing radio-frequency reflectometry techniques to measure the kinetic inductive response of superconducting TTG coupled to a microwave resonator, we find a linear temperature dependence of $\rho_s$ at low temperatures and nonlinear Meissner effects in the current bias dependence, both indicating nodal structures in the superconducting order parameter. Furthermore, the doping dependence shows a linear correlation between the zero temperature $\rho_s$ and the superconducting transition temperature $T_c$, reminiscent of Uemura's relation in cuprates, suggesting phase-coherence-limited superconductivity. Our results provide strong evidence for nodal superconductivity in TTG and put strong constraints on the mechanisms of these graphene-based superconductors.</description>

Abstract: Interactions between quasiparticles mediated by a surrounding environment are ubiquitous and lead to a range of important effects from collective modes of low temperature quantum gases, superconductivity, to the interaction between elementary particles at high energies. This perspective article is motivated by experimental progress in the fields of quantum degenerate atomic gases, cavity QED, and two-dimensional (2D) semi-conductors, which enable a systematic exploration of mediated interactions in new settings and regimes. We first describe how to microscopically calculate the quasiparticle interaction using perturbation theory, diagrammatics, and the path integral, highlighting the key role played by the quantum statistics of the quasiparticles. Recent theoretical and experimental insights into quasiparticle and mediated interactions in general obtained from atomic gases are then discussed, after which we focus on hybrid light-atom systems where a remarkable long range photon mediated interaction can be realised. Next, we describe new and puzzling results regarding the interaction between quasiparticles in 2D semiconductors. We then discuss how mediated interactions open up ways to realise new quantum phases in atomic and hybrid atom-photon systems as well as 2D semiconductors, and the perspective ends by posing some open questions and outlook.</description>

Abstract: Toroidal classification and geometric duality in quantum spin systems is presented. Through our classification and duality, we reveal that various bipartite quantum features in magnon-systems can manifest equivalently in both bipartite ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic materials, based upon the availability of relevant Hamiltonian parameters. Additionally, the results highlight the antiferromagnetic regime as an ultra-fast dual counterpart to the ferromagnetic regime, both exhibiting identical capabilities for quantum spintronics and technological applications. Concrete illustrations are provided, demonstrating how splitting and squeezing types of two-mode magnon quantum correlations can be realized across ferro- and antiferromagnetic regimes.</description>

      <title>Contribution of Andreev reflection to the mobility of surface state electrons on superfluid $^3$He-B</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14016v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The mobility of the Wigner solid on the superfluid $^3$He is determined by the momentum transfer from the scattered $^3$He quasiparticles at the free surface. The scattering process of the quasiparticles is classified into the normal reflection and the Andreev retroreflection. Since the quasiparticles nearly conserve the momentum in the process of the Andreev retroreflection at the free surface, the Andreev reflected quasiparticles do not produce a resistive force to the Wigner solid. In this report, we have analytically calculated the contribution of the Andreev retroreflection to the mobility of the Wigner solid on superfluid $^3$He-B by employing a realistic model order parameter with the free surface. The Andreev retroreflection is lacked for quasiparticles with energy above the bulk energy gap under the model order parameter. Then, the Andreev retroreflection does not contribute to a rise in the mobility of the Wigner solid on the superfluid $^3$He-B. The present model calculation is in good agreement with the previous experimental observation. We have also discussed the Andreev retroreflection under a self-consistently calculated order parameter.</description>

      <title>Stress-Dependent Optical Extinction in LPCVD Silicon Nitride Measured by Nanomechanical Photothermal Sensing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14222v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding optical absorption in silicon nitride is crucial for cutting-edge technologies like photonic integrated circuits, nanomechanical photothermal infrared sensing and spectroscopy, and cavity optomechanics. Yet, the origin of its strong dependence on film deposition and fabrication process is not fully understood. This Letter leverages nanomechanical photothermal sensing to investigate optical extinction $\kappa_{\mathrm{ext}}$ at 632.8 nm wavelength in LPCVD SiN strings across a wide range of deposition-related tensile stresses ($200-850$ MPa). Measurements reveal a reduction in $\kappa_{\mathrm{ext}}$ from 10$^3$ to 10$^1$ ppm with increasing stress, correlated to variations in Si/N content ratio. Within the band-fluctuations framework, this trend indicates an increase of the energy bandgap with the stress, ultimately reducing absorption. Overall, this study showcases the power and simplicity of nanomechanical photothermal sensing for low absorption measurements, offering a sensitive, scattering-free platform for material analysis in nanophotonics and nanomechanics.</description>

Abstract: Non-conventional resonances, both acoustic and photonic, are found in metallic particles with a toroidal nanopropeller geometry that is generated by sweeping a three-lobed 2D-shape along a spiral with twisting angle, ${\alpha}$. For both optical and acoustic cases, spectral location of resonances experiences a red-shift as a function of ${\alpha}$. We demonstrate that the optical case can be understood as a natural evolution of resonances as the spiral length of the toroidal nanopropeller increases with ${\alpha}$, implying a huge helicity dependent absorption cross section. In the case of acoustic response, two red-shifting breathing modes are identified. Additionally, even small ${\alpha}$ allows the appearance of new low-frequency resonances, whose spectral dispersion depends on a competition between length of the generative spiral and the pitch of the toroidal nanopropeller.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14354v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent experiments in pentalayer rhombohedral graphene moir\'e superlattice have observed the quantum anomalous Hall effect at the moir\'e filling factor $\nu=1$ and various fractions. These effects result from a flat Chern band induced by electron-electron interactions. In this Letter, we show that the many-body effects at $\nu=2$ give rise to the quantum spin Hall and quantum valley Hall states, even without spin-orbit couplings or valley-dependent potentials, in addition to the quantum anomalous Hall state. These three topological states can be selectively induced by applying and tilting a magnetic field. Furthermore, we demonstrate that at $\nu=3$ and $4$, a combination of the Wigner-like crystal state and topological states can be the ground state. Consequently, the relation between states at the filling factor $\nu$ and its particle-hole counterpart $4-\nu$ breaks down, which contrasts with the conventional quantum Hall effect in graphene.</description>

Abstract: The dynamical evolution of an open quantum system can be governed by the Lindblad equation of the density matrix. In this paper, we propose to characterize the density matrix topology by the topological invariant of its modular Hamiltonian. Since the topological classification of such Hamiltonians depends on their symmetry classes, a primary issue we address is determining the requirement for the Lindbladian operators, under which the modular Hamiltonian can preserve its symmetry class during the dynamical evolution. We solve this problem for the fermionic Gaussian state and for the modular Hamiltonian being a quadratic operator of a set of fermionic operators. When these conditions are satisfied, along with a nontrivial topological classification of the symmetry class of the modular Hamiltonian, a topological transition can occur as time evolves. We present two examples of dissipation-driven topological transitions where the modular Hamiltonian lies in the AIII class with U(1) symmetry and the DIII class without U(1) symmetry. By a finite size scaling, we show that this density matrix topology transition occurs at a finite time. We also present the physical signature of this transition.</description>

Abstract: Quantum magneto-oscillations have long been a vital subject in condensed matter physics, with ubiquitous quantum phenomena and diverse underlying physical mechanisms. Here, we demonstrate the intrinsic and reproducible DC-current-driven quantum electro-oscillations with a periodicity in the inverse of the current (1/I), in quasi-one-dimensional charge-density-wave (CDW) insulators (TaSe$_4$)$_2$I and TaS$_3$ nanowires. Such oscillations manifest in the nearly infinite Fr\"ohlich conductivity region where the undamped CDW flow forms in a finite electric current, and finally disappear after the oscillation index n reaches 1. A systematic investigation on the effect of temperature and magnetic field establishes that the observed electro-oscillations are a coherent quantum phenomenon. We discuss the possibilities of the physical mechanisms, including the formation of sliding-driven inherent Floquet sidebands. Our results introduce a new member in the family of quantum oscillations, and shed light on plausible avenues to explore novel physics and potential applications of coherent density-wave condensates.</description>

Abstract: We report local time-resolved thermometry in a silicon nanowire quantum dot device designed to host a linear array of spin qubits. Using two alternative measurement schemes based on rf reflectometry, we are able to probe either local electron or phonon temperatures with $\mu$s-scale time resolution and a noise equivalent temperature of $3$ $\rm mK/\sqrt{\rm Hz}$. Following the application of short microwave pulses, causing local periodic heating, time-dependent thermometry can track the dynamics of thermal excitation and relaxation, revealing clearly different characteristic time scales. This work opens important prospects to investigate the out-of-equilibrium thermal properties of semiconductor quantum electronic devices operating at very low temperature. In particular, it may provide a powerful handle to understand heating effects recently observed in semiconductor spin-qubit systems.</description>

      <title>Heat Pulses in Electron Quantum Optics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.16748v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electron quantum optics aims to realize ideas from the quantum theory of light with the role of photons being played by charge pulses in electronic conductors. Experimentally, the charge pulses are excited by time-dependent voltages, however, one could also generate heat pulses by heating and cooling an electrode. Here, we explore this intriguing idea by formulating a Floquet scattering theory of heat pulses in mesoscopic conductors. The adiabatic emission of heat pulses leads to a heat current that in linear response is given by the thermal conductance quantum. However, we also find a high-frequency component, which ensures that the fluctuation-dissipation theorem for heat currents, whose validity has been debated, is fulfilled. The heat pulses are uncharged, and we probe their electron-hole content by evaluating the partition noise in the outputs of a quantum point contact. We also employ a Hong--Ou--Mandel setup to examine if the pulses bunch or antibunch. Finally, to generate an electric current, we use a Mach--Zehnder interferometer that breaks the electron-hole symmetry and thereby enables a thermoelectric effect. Our work paves the way for systematic investigations of heat pulses in mesoscopic conductors, and it may stimulate future experiments.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we study theoretically the electron and spectral properties of Ge1-xSnx systems, including alloys, cubic- and spherical quantum dots. The single-particle electron and hole states are calculated within the sp3d5s* tight-binding approach and used in further modeling of the optical properties. We systematically study the interplay of Sn-driven indirect-direct band-gap transition and the quantum confinement effect in systems of reduced dimensionality. We demonstrate the regime of sizes and composition, where the ground state in Ge1-xSnx quantum dot is optically active. Finally, we calculate absorbance spectra in experimentally-relevant colloidal quantum dots and demonstrate a satisfactory agreement with experimental data.</description>

      <title>Control of threshold voltages in Si/SiGe quantum devices via optical illumination</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.14011v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Optical illumination of quantum-dot qubit devices at cryogenic temperatures, while not well studied, is often used to recover operating conditions after undesired shocking events or charge injection. Here, we demonstrate systematic threshold voltage shifts in a dopant-free, Si/SiGe field effect transistor using a near infrared (780 nm) laser diode. We find that illumination under an applied gate voltage can be used to set a specific, stable, and reproducible threshold voltage that, over a wide range in gate bias, is equal to that gate bias. Outside this range, the threshold voltage can still be tuned, although the resulting threshold voltage is no longer equal to the applied gate bias during illumination. We present a simple and intuitive model that provides a mechanism for the tunability in gate bias. The model presented also explains why cryogenic illumination is successful at resetting quantum dot qubit devices after undesired charging events.</description>

      <title>Electrical Non-Hermitian Control of Topological Magnon Spin Transport</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.04967v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magnonic topological phases realize chiral edge spin waves that are protected against backscattering, potentially enabling highly efficient spin transport. Here we show that the spin transport through these magnonic chiral edge states can be electrically manipulated by non-Hermitian control. We consider the paradigmatic magnon Haldane model and show that it is transformed into an effective non-Hermitian magnon Chern insulator by including a sublattice-dependent spin-orbit torque. In linear spin-wave theory, this electrically induced torque reduces the damping of the chiral edge magnons along certain edge directions, leading to an enhancement of the spin-wave amplitude. This prediction is confirmed by numerical simulations based on the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation. For a spin-wave transport setup, in which magnons are excited by a microwave field and detected with a normal metal conductor, we find that the magnon amplification is remarkably robust against disorder, establishing non-Hermitian control as a promising avenue for topological magnonics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06040v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Materials featuring touching points, localized states, and flat bands are of great interest in condensed matter and artificial systems due to their implications in topology, quantum geometry, superconductivity, and interactions. In this theoretical study, we propose the experimental realization of the dice lattice with adjustable parameters by arranging carbon monoxide molecules on a two-dimensional electron system at a (111) copper surface. First, we develop a theoretical framework to obtain the spectral properties within a nearly free electron approximation and then compare them with tight-binding calculations. Our investigation reveals that the high mobility of Shockley state electrons enables an accurate theoretical description of the artificial lattice using a next-nearest-neighbor tight-binding model, resulting in the emergence of a touching point, a quasi-flat band, and localized lattice site behavior in the local density of states. Additionally, we present theoretical results for a long-wavelength low-energy model that accounts for next-nearest-neighbor hopping terms. Furthermore, we theoretically examine the model's behavior under an external magnetic field by employing Peierl's substitution, a commonly used technique in theoretical physics to incorporate magnetic fields into lattice models. Our theoretical findings suggest that, owing to the exceptional electron mobility, the highly degenerate eigenenergy associated with the Aharonov-Bohm caging mechanism may not manifest in the proposed experiment.</description>

      <title>Drag on Cylinders Moving in Superfluid 3He-B as the Dimension Spans the Coherence Length</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06226v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Vibrating probes when immersed in a fluid can provide powerful tools for characterising the surrounding medium. In superfluid 3He-B, a condensate of Cooper pairs, the dissipation arising from the scattering of quasiparticle excitations from a mechanical oscillator provides the basis of extremely sensitive thermometry and bolometry at sub-millikelvin temperatures. The unique properties of the Andreev reflection process in this condensate also assist by providing a significantly enhanced dissipation. While existing models for such damping on an oscillating cylinder have been verified experimentally, they are valid only for flows with scales much greater than the coherence length of 3He, which is of the order of a hundred nanometres. With our increasing proficiency in fabricating nanosized oscillators which can be readily used in this superfluid there is a pressing need for the development of new models that account for the modification of the flow around these smaller oscillators. Here we report preliminary results on measurements of the damping in superfluid 3He-B of a range of cylindrical nano-sized oscillators with radii comparable to the coherence length, and outline a model for calculating the associated drag.</description>

Abstract: The orbital Hall effect generates a current of orbital angular momentum perpendicular to a charge current. Experiments suggest that this orbital current decays on a long length scale that is of the order of the spin flip diffusion length or longer. We examine this suggestion using first-principles quantum mechanical scattering calculations to study the decay of orbital currents injected from an orbitally-polarized lead into thermally disordered bulk systems of selected transition metals. We find that the decay occurs over only a few atomic layers. On this length scale the orbital current may be converted into a spin current if the spin Hall angle is sufficiently large, as for Pt. In Cu, Cr and V with small spin Hall angles, the conversion into a spin current is negligible in the bulk and significant conversion only occurs at interfaces.</description>

Abstract: The investigation of orbital angular momentum (OAM) of delocalised Bloch electrons has advanced our understanding of magnetic, transport, and optical phenomena in crystals, drawing widespread interest across various materials science domains, from metals and semiconductors to topological and magnetic materials. Here, we review OAM dynamics in depth, focusing on key concepts and non-equilibrium systems, and laying the groundwork for the thriving field of {\it orbitronics}. We review briefly the conventional understanding of the equilibrium OAM based on the modern theory of orbital magnetisation. Following this, we explore recent theoretical and experimental developments in out-of-equilibrium systems. We focus on the generation of an OAM density via the orbital magneto-electric, or Edelstein effect, the generation of an OAM current via the orbital Hall effect, the orbital torque resulting from them, along with their reciprocal non-equilibrium counterparts -- the inverse orbital Edelstein and inverse orbital Hall effects, as well as OAM conservation. We discuss the most salient achievements and the most pressing challenges in this rapidly evolving field, and in closing we highlight the future prospects of {\it orbitronics}.</description>

      <title>Adiabatic Approximation and Aharonov-Casher Bands in Twisted Homobilayer TMDs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13455v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Topological flat moir\'e bands with nearly ideal quantum geometry have been identified in homobilayer transition metal dichalcogenide moir\'e superlattices, and are thought to be crucial for understanding the fractional Chern insulating states recently observed therein. Previous work proposed viewing the system using an adiabatic approximation that replaces the position-dependence of the layer spinor with a nonuniform periodic effective magnetic field. When the local zero-point kinetic energy of this magnetic field cancels identically against that of an effective Zeeman energy, a Bloch-band version of Aharonov-Casher zero-energy modes, which we refer to as Aharonov-Casher band, emerges leading to ideal quantum geometry. Here, we critically examine the validity of the adiabatic approximation and identify the parameter regimes under which Aharonov-Casher bands emerge. We show that the adiabatic approximation is accurate for a wide range of parameters including those realized in experiments. Furthermore, we show that while the cancellation leading to the emergence of Aharonov-Casher bands is generally not possible beyond the leading Fourier harmonic, the leading harmonic is the dominant term in the Fourier expansions of the zero-point kinetic energy and Zeeman energy. As a result, the leading harmonic expansion accurately captures the trend of the bandwidth and quantum geometry, though it may fail to quantitatively reproduce more detailed information about the bands such as the Berry curvature distribution.</description>

Abstract: In twisted bilayer semiconductors with arbitrary twisting angles, a chiral excitonic system can arise from the interlayer electron-hole Coulomb exchange interaction (F\"{o}rster coupling) that hybridizes the anisotropic intralayer excitons from individual layers. We present a general framework for the effective exciton Hamiltonian taking into account the electron-hole Coulomb exchange, using twisted homobilayer systems composed of transition metal dichalcogenides or black phosphorus as examples. We demonstrate that such chiral excitonic systems can feature unconventional Hall (Nernst) effects arising from quantum geometric properties characteristic of the layer hybridized wavefunctions under the chiral symmetry, for example, the time-reversal even layer Hall counter flow and the crossed nonlinear dynamical Hall effect, when mechanical and statistical force (temperature or density gradient) drives the exciton flow.</description>

Abstract: Neural network quantum states as ansatz wavefunctions have shown a lot of promise for finding the ground state of spin models. Recently, work has been focused on extending this idea to mixed states for simulating the dynamics of open systems. Most approaches so far have used a purification ansatz where a copy of the system Hilbert space is added which when traced out gives the correct density matrix. Here, we instead present an extension of the Restricted Boltzmann Machine which directly represents the density matrix in Liouville space. This allows the compact representation of states which appear in mean-field theory. We benchmark our approach on two different version of the dissipative transverse field Ising model which show our ansatz is able to compete with other state-of-the-art approaches.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.06550v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The phase distribution in a Bose-Einstein condensate can realize various topological states classified by distinct winding numbers. While states with different winding numbers are topologically protected in the linear Schr\"odinger equation, when nonlinearities are introduced, violations of the topological protection can occur, leading to unwinding. Exciton-polariton condensates constitute a nonlinear open-dissipative system that is well suited to studying such physics. Here we show that a one-dimensional array of exciton-polariton condensates displays a spontaneous phase unwinding from a $\pi$- to zero-state. We clarify that this collective mode transition is caused by the combined effect of nonlinearity and topological defects in the condensates. While the mode-switching phenomenon observed in our previous experiment was interpreted as the single-particle mode competition, we offer an alternative explanation in terms the collective phase unwinding and find its evidence by reanalyzing the experimental data. Our results open a route towards active control of the mode switching by manipulating the topological defects in prospective quantum polaritonic devices.</description>

      <title>Accounting for localized deformation: a simple computation of true stress in micropillar compression experiments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.06476v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Compression experiments are widely used to study the mechanical properties of materials at micro- and nanoscale. However, the conventional engineering stress measurement method used in these experiments neglects to account for the alterations in the material's shape during loading. This can lead to inaccurate stress values and potentially misleading conclusions about the material's mechanical behavior especially in the case of localized deformation. To address this issue, we present a method for calculating true stress in cases of localized plastic deformation commonly encountered in experimental settings: (i) a single band and (ii) two bands oriented in arbitrary directions with respect to the vertical axis of the pillar (either in the same or opposite directions). Our simple analytic formulas can be applied to homogeneous and isotropic materials and crystals, requiring only standard data (displacement-force curve, aspect ratio, shear band angle and elastic strain limit) obtained from experimental results and eliminating the need for finite element computations. Our approach provides a more precise interpretation of experimental results and can serve as a valuable and simple tool in material design and characterization.</description>

Abstract: We compute the quantized Hall conductance at various Landau levels by using the classic trace. The computations reduce to the single elementary one for the lowest Landau level. By using the theories of Helton-Howe-Carey-Pincus, and Toeplitz operators on the classic Fock space and higher Fock spaces, the Hall conductance is naturally identified with a Fredholm index. This brings new mathematical insights to the extraordinary precision of quantization observed in quantum Hall measurements.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.13372v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The valley degree of freedom is one of the most intriguing properties of atomically thin transition metal dichalcogenides. Together with the possibility to address this degree of freedom by valley-contrasting optical selection rules, it has the potential to enable a completely new class of future electronic and optoelectronic devices. Resonant optical nanostructures emerge as promising tools for interacting with and controlling the valley degree of freedom at the nanoscale. However, a critical understanding gap remains in how nanostructures and their nearfields affect the circular polarization properties of valley-selective emission hindering further developments in this field. In order to address this issue, our study delves into the experimental investigation of a hybrid model system where valley-specific emission from a monolayer of molybdenum disulfide is interacting with a resonant plasmonic nanosphere. Contrary to the simple intuition suggesting that a centrosymmetric nanoresonator preserves the degree of circular polarization in the forward scattered farfield by angular momentum conservation, our cryogenic photoluminescence microscopy reveals that the light emitted from the nanoparticle position is largely unpolarized, i.e. we observe depolarization. We rigorously study the nature of this phenomenon numerically considering the monolayer-nanoparticle interaction at different levels including excitation and emission. In doing so, we find that the farfield degree of polarization strongly reduces in the hybrid system when including excitons emitting from outside of the system's symmetry point, which in combination with depolarisation at the excitation level causes the observed effect. Our results highlight the importance of considering spatially distributed emitters for precise predictions of polarization responses in these hybrid systems.</description>

      <title>Tomographic Imaging of Orbital Vortex Lines in Three-Dimensional Momentum Space</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.10031v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report the experimental discovery of orbital vortex lines in the three-dimensional (3D) band structure of a topological semimetal. Combining linear and circular dichroism in soft x-ray angle-resolved photoemission (SX-ARPES) with first-principles theory, we image the winding of atomic orbital angular momentum, thereby revealing - and determining the location of - lines of vorticity in full 3D momentum space. Our observation of momentum-space vortex lines with quantized winding number establishes an analogue to real-space quantum vortices, for instance, in type-II superconductors and certain non-collinear magnets. These results establish multimodal dichroism in SX-ARPES as an approach to trace 3D orbital textures. Our present findings particularly constitute the first imaging of non-trivial quantum-phase winding at line nodes and may pave the way to new orbitronic phenomena in quantum materials</description>

      <title>Magnetic anisotropy of L1$_0$ FeNi (001), (010), and (111) ultrathin films: A first-principles study</title>

Abstract: In previous experiments, thin films of L1$\mathrm{_0}$ FeNi with different surfaces, including (001), (110) and (111), were produced and studied. Each surface defines a different alignment of the crystallographic tetragonal axis with respect to the film's plane, resulting in different magnetic anisotropies. In this study, we use density functional theory calculations to examine three series of L1$\mathrm{_0}$ FeNi films with surfaces (001), (010), and (111), and with thicknesses ranging from 0.5 to 3 nm (from 4 to 16 atomic monolayers). Our results show that films (001) have perpendicular magnetic anisotropy, while (010) favor in-plane magnetization, with a clear preference for the tetragonal axis [001]. We propose calling this type of in-plane anisotropy fixed in plane. A film with surface (111) and a thickness of four atomic monolayers has the magnetization easy axis almost perpendicular to the plane of the film. As the thickness of the (111) film increases, the direction of magnetization rotates towards a tetragonal axis [001], positioned at an angle of about 45$^{o}$ to the plane of the film. Furthermore, the magnetic moment of ultrathin films increases by a maximum of 5%, and the most significant changes in spin and orbital magnetic moments occur at a depth of about three near-surface atomic monolayers. The presented results could be useful for experimental efforts to synthesize ultrathin L1$\mathrm{_0}$ FeNi films with different surfaces. Ultrathin L1$\mathrm{_0}$ FeNi films with varying magnetic anisotropies may find applications in spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Synthetic magnetism enhanced mechanical squeezing in Brillouin optomechanical system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04508v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a scheme to generate large amount of mechanical squeezing, far beyond the $\rm{3dB}$ limit, which is based on synthetic magnetism in optomechanical system that hosts a Backward Stimulated Brillouin Scattering (BSBS) process. Our benchmark system consists of an acoustic mode coupled to two optical modes through the BSBS process, and a Duffing mechanical oscillator that couples to the same optical modes through the standard optomechanical radiation pressure. The synthetic magnetism comes from the modulation of the mechanical coupling between the acoustic and the mechanical mode. When there is no synthetic magnetism, a given amount of mechanical squeezing is generated in the system. This squeezing is mainly dependent on the BSBS process, and it is fragile against thermal noise. By switching on the synthetic magnetism, the degree of the generated squeezing is greatly enhanced and goes far beyond the limit of the $\rm{3dB}$. This large magnetism induced squeezing persists even when there is no BSBS process in the system. Moreover, this generated squeezing is robust enough against thermal noise in comparison to the one induced when the synthetic magnetism is off. Furthermore, both the mechanical variance squeezing and effective phonon number exhibit series of peaks and dips depending on the phase modulation of the mechanical coupling. This oscillatory feature is reminiscent of a sudden death and revival of squeezing phenomenon, which can be used to maintain a desired magnitude of squeezing by tuning this phase. Our proposal provides a path toward a flexible scheme that generates large amount of squeezing, far beyond the $\rm{3dB}$ limit. Such a generated squeezed states can be used for quantum applications including quantum information processing, quantum sensing and metrology, and quantum computing.</description>
