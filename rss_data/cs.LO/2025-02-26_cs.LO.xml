      <title>Abstract computation over first-order structures. Part I: Deterministic and non-deterministic BSS RAMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17539v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Most ideas about what an algorithm is are very similar. Basic operations are used for transforming objects. The evaluation of internal and external states by relations has impact on the further process. A more precise definition can lead to a model of abstract computation over an arbitrary first-order structure. Formally, the algorithms can be determined by strings. Their meaning can be described purely mathematically by functions and relations derived from the operations and relations of a first-order structure. Our model includes models of computability and derivation systems from different areas of mathematics, logic, and computer science. To define the algorithms, we use so-called programs. Since we do this independently of their executability by computers, the so-called execution of our programs can be viewed as a form of abstract computation. This concept helps to highlight common features of algorithms that are independent of the underlying structures. Here, in Part I, we define BSS RAMs step by step. In Part II, we study Moschovakis' operator which is known from a general recursion theory over first-order structures. Later, we study hierarchies defined analogously to the arithmetical hierarchy by means of quantified formulas of an infinitary logic in this framework.</description>

      <title>Restricted CSPs and F-free Digraph Algorithmics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17596v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, much attention has been placed on the complexity of graph homomorphism problems when the input is restricted to ${\mathbb P}_k$-free and ${\mathbb P}_k$-subgraph-free graphs. We consider the directed version of this research line, by addressing the questions, is it true that digraph homomorphism problems CSP$({\mathbb H})$ have a P versus NP-complete dichotomy when the input is restricted to $\vec{\mathbb P}_k$-free (resp.\ $\vec{\mathbb P}_k$-subgraph-free) digraphs? Our main contribution in this direction shows that if CSP$({\mathbb H})$ is NP-complete, then there is a positive integer $N$ such that CSP$({\mathbb H})$ remains NP-hard even for $\vec{\mathbb P}_N$-subgraph-free digraphs. Moreover, it remains NP-hard for acyclic $\vec{\mathbb P}_N$-subgraph-free digraphs, and becomes polynomial-time solvable for $\vec{\mathbb P}_{N-1}$-subgraph-free acyclic digraphs. We then verify the questions above for digraphs on three vertices and a family of smooth tournaments. We prove these results by establishing a connection between $\mathbb F$-(subgraph)-free algorithmics and constraint satisfaction theory. On the way, we introduce restricted CSPs, i.e., problems of the form CSP$({\mathbb H})$ restricted to yes-instances of CSP$({\mathbb H}')$ -- these were called restricted homomorphism problems by Hell and Ne\v{s}et\v{r}il. Another main result of this paper presents a P versus NP-complete dichotomy for these problems. Moreover, this complexity dichotomy is accompanied by an algebraic dichotomy in the spirit of the finite domain CSP dichotomy.</description>

      <title>Merge-width and First-Order Model Checking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18065v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce merge-width, a family of graph parameters that unifies several structural graph measures, including treewidth, degeneracy, twin-width, clique-width, and generalized coloring numbers. Our parameters are based on new decompositions called construction sequences. These are sequences of ever coarser partitions of the vertex set, where each pair of parts has a specified default connection, and all vertex pairs of the graph that differ from the default are marked as resolved. The radius-$r$ merge-width is the maximum number of parts reached from a vertex by following a path of at most $r$ resolved edges. Graph classes of bounded merge-width -- for which the radius-$r$ merge-width parameter can be bounded by a constant, for each fixed $r=1,2,3,\ldots$ -- include all classes of bounded expansion or of bounded twin-width, thus unifying two central notions from the Sparsity and Twin-width frameworks. Furthermore, they are preserved under first-order transductions, which attests to their robustness. We conjecture that classes of bounded merge-width are equivalent to the previously introduced classes of bounded flip-width.
  As our main result, we show that the model checking problem for first-order logic is fixed-parameter tractable on graph classes of bounded merge-width, assuming the input includes a witnessing construction sequence. This unites and extends two previous model checking results: the result of Dvo\v{r}\'{a}k, Kr\'{a}l, and Thomas for classes of bounded expansion, and the result of Bonnet, Kim, Thomass\'e, and Watrigant for classes of bounded twin-width.
  Finally, we suggest future research directions that could impact the study of structural and algorithmic graph theory, in particular of monadically dependent graph classes, which we conjecture to coincide with classes of almost bounded merge-width.</description>

      <title>Mixing Any Cocktail with Limited Ingredients: On the Structure of Payoff Sets in Multi-Objective MDPs and its Impact on Randomised Strategies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18296v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider multi-dimensional payoff functions in Markov decision processes, and ask whether a given expected payoff vector can be achieved or not. In general, pure strategies (i.e., not resorting to randomisation) do not suffice for this problem.
  We study the structure of the set of expected payoff vectors of all strategies given a multi-dimensional payoff function and its consequences regarding randomisation requirements for strategies. In particular, we prove that for any payoff for which the expectation is well-defined under all strategies, it is sufficient to mix (i.e., randomly select a pure strategy at the start of a play and committing to it for the rest of the play) finitely many pure strategies to approximate any expected payoff vector up to any precision. Furthermore, for any payoff for which the expected payoff is finite under all strategies, any expected payoff can be obtained exactly by mixing finitely many strategies.</description>

      <title>On the Unprovability of Circuit Size Bounds in Intuitionistic $\mathsf{S}^1_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11841v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that there is a constant $k$ such that Buss's intuitionistic theory $\mathsf{IS}^1_2$ does not prove that SAT requires co-nondeterministic circuits of size at least $n^k$. To our knowledge, this is the first unconditional unprovability result in bounded arithmetic in the context of worst-case fixed-polynomial size circuit lower bounds. We complement this result by showing that the upper bound $\mathsf{NP} \subseteq \mathsf{coNSIZE}[n^k]$ is unprovable in $\mathsf{IS}^1_2$.
  In order to establish our main result, we obtain new unconditional lower bounds against refuters that might be of independent interest. In particular, we show that there is no efficient refuter for the lower bound $\mathsf{NP} \nsubseteq \mathsf{i.o}\text{-}\mathsf{coNP}/\mathsf{poly}$, addressing in part a question raised by Atserias (2006).</description>

      <title>Transformer Encoder Satisfiability: Complexity and Impact on Formal Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18548v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyse the complexity of the satisfiability problem, or similarly feasibility problem, (trSAT) for transformer encoders (TE), which naturally occurs in formal verification or interpretation, collectively referred to as formal reasoning. We find that trSAT is undecidable when considering TE as they are commonly studied in the expressiveness community. Furthermore, we identify practical scenarios where trSAT is decidable and establish corresponding complexity bounds. Beyond trivial cases, we find that quantized TE, those restricted by fixed-width arithmetic, lead to the decidability of trSAT due to their limited attention capabilities. However, the problem remains difficult, as we establish scenarios where trSAT is NEXPTIME-hard and others where it is solvable in NEXPTIME for quantized TE. To complement our complexity results, we place our findings and their implications in the broader context of formal reasoning.</description>

      <title>Polytopal Stochastic Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16208v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we introduce polytopal stochastic games, an extension of two-player, zero-sum, turn-based stochastic games, in which we may have uncertainty over the transition probabilities. In these games the uncertainty over the probabilities distributions is captured via linear (in)equalities whose space of solutions forms a polytope. We give a formal definition of these games and prove their basic properties: determinacy and existence of optimal memoryless and deterministic strategies. We do this for reachability and different types of reward objectives and show that the solution exists in a finite representation of the game. We also state that the corresponding decision problems are in the intersection of NP and coNP. We motivate the use of polytopal stochastic games via a simple example. Finally, we report some experiments we performed with a prototype tool.</description>

      <title>Programming Really Is Simple Mathematics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17149v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A re-construction of the fundamentals of programming as a small mathematical theory (PRISM) based on elementary set theory. Highlights:
  $\bullet$ Zero axioms. No properties are assumed, all are proved (from standard set theory).
  $\bullet$ A single concept covers specifications and programs.
  $\bullet$ Its definition only involves one relation and one set.
  $\bullet$ Everything proceeds from three operations: choice, composition and restriction.
  $\bullet$ These techniques suffice to derive the axioms of classic papers on the "laws of programming" as consequences and prove them mechanically.
  $\bullet$ The ordinary subset operator suffices to define both the notion of program correctness and the concepts of specialization and refinement.
  $\bullet$ From this basis, the theory deduces dozens of theorems characterizing important properties of programs and programming.
  $\bullet$ All these theorems have been mechanically verified (using Isabelle/HOL); the proofs are available in a public repository.
  This paper is a considerable extension and rewrite of an earlier contribution [arXiv:1507.00723]</description>
