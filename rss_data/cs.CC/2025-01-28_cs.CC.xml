      <title>Constant Inapproximability of Pacing Equilibria in Second-Price Auctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15295v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we revisit the problem of approximating a pacing equilibrium in second-price auctions, introduced by Conitzer, Kroer, Sodomka, and Moses [Oper. Res. 2022]. We show that finding a constant-factor approximation of a pacing equilibrium is PPAD-hard, thereby strengthening previous results of Chen, Kroer, and Kumar [Math. Oper. Res. 2024], which established PPAD-hardness only for inverse-polynomial approximations.</description>

      <title>Turing in the shadows of Nobel and Abel: an algorithmic story behind two recent prizes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15312v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The 2021 Nobel Prize in physics was awarded to Giorgio Parisi ``for the discovery of the interplay of disorder and fluctuations in physical systems from atomic to planetary scales,'' and the 2024 Abel Prize in mathematics was awarded to Michel Talagrand ``for his groundbreaking contributions to probability theory and functional analysis, with outstanding applications in mathematical physics and statistics.'' What remains largely absent in the popular descriptions of these prizes, however, is the profound contributions the works of both individuals have had to the field of \emph{algorithms and computation}. The ideas first developed by Parisi and his collaborators relying on remarkably precise physics intuition, and later confirmed by Talagrand and others by no less remarkable mathematical techniques, have revolutionized the way we think algorithmically about optimization problems involving randomness. This is true both in terms of the existence of fast algorithms for some optimization problems, but also in terms of our persistent failures of finding such algorithms for some other optimization problems.
  The goal of this article is to highlight these developments and explain how the ideas pioneered by Parisi and Talagrand have led to a remarkably precise characterization of which optimization problems admit fast algorithms, versus those which do not, and furthermore to explain why this characterization holds true.</description>

      <title>Complexity of Minimal Faithful Permutation Degree for Fitting-free Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16039v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the complexity of computing the minimal faithful permutation degree for groups without abelian normal subgroups. When our groups are given as quotients of permutation groups, we establish that this problem is in $\textsf{P}$. Furthermore, in the setting of permutation groups, we obtain an upper bound of $\textsf{NC}$ for this problem. This improves upon the work of Das and Thakkar (STOC 2024), who established a Las Vegas polynomial-time algorithm for this class in the setting of permutation groups.</description>

      <title>Almost Polynomial Factor Inapproximability for Parameterized k-Clique</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.03983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2112.03983v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The k-Clique problem is a canonical hard problem in parameterized complexity. In this paper, we study the parameterized complexity of approximating the k-Clique problem where an integer k and a graph G on n vertices are given as input, and the goal is to find a clique of size at least k/F(k) whenever the graph G has a clique of size k. When such an algorithm runs in time T(k)poly(n) (i.e., FPT-time) for some computable function T, it is said to be an F(k)-FPT-approximation algorithm for the k-Clique problem.
  Although, the non-existence of an F(k)-FPT-approximation algorithm for any computable sublinear function F is known under gap-ETH [Chalermsook et al., FOCS 2017], it has remained a long standing open problem to prove the same inapproximability result under the more standard and weaker assumption, W[1]$\neq$FPT.
  In a recent breakthrough, Lin [STOC 2021] ruled out constant factor (i.e., F(k)=O(1)) FPT-approximation algorithms under W[1]$\neq$FPT. In this paper, we improve this inapproximability result (under the same assumption) to rule out every $F(k)=k^{1/H(k)}$ factor FPT-approximation algorithm for any increasing computable function H (for example $H(k)=\log^\ast k$).
  Our main technical contribution is introducing list decoding of Hadamard codes over large prime fields into the proof framework of Lin.</description>

      <title>A parameterized linear formulation of the integer hull</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02347v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $A \in \mathbb{Z}^{m \times n}$ be an integer matrix with components bounded by $\Delta$ in absolute value. Cook et al.~(1986) have shown that there exists a universal matrix $B \in \mathbb{Z}^{m' \times n}$ with the following property: For each $b \in \mathbb{Z}^m$, there exists $t \in \mathbb{Z}^{m'}$ such that the integer hull of the polyhedron $P = \{ x \in \mathbb{R}^n \colon Ax \leq b\}$ is described by $P_I = \{ x \in \mathbb{R}^n \colon Bx \leq t\}$. Our \emph{main result} is that $t$ is an \emph{affine} function of $b$ as long as $b$ is from a fixed equivalence class of the lattice $D \cdot \mathbb{Z}^m$. Here $D \in \mathbb{N}$ is a number that depends on $n$ and $\Delta$ only. Furthermore, $D$ as well as the matrix $B$ can be computed in time depending on $\Delta$ and $n$ only. An application of this result is the solution of an open problem posed by Cslovjecsek et al.~(SODA 2024) concerning the complexity of \emph{2-stage-stochastic integer programming} problems. The main tool of our proof is the classical theory of \emph{Gomory-Chv\'atal cutting planes} and the \emph{elementary closure} of rational polyhedra.</description>

      <title>Multivariate Analytic Combinatorics for Cost Constrained Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.06105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2111.06105v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Analytic combinatorics in several variables is a branch of mathematics that deals with deriving the asymptotic behavior of combinatorial quantities by analyzing multivariate generating functions. We study information-theoretic questions about sequences in a discrete noiseless channel under cost constraints. Our main contributions involve the relationship between the graph structure of the channel and the singularities of the bivariate generating function whose coefficients are the number of sequences satisfying the constraints. We use these new results to invoke theorems from multivariate analytic combinatorics to obtain the asymptotic behavior of the number of cost-limited strings that are admissible by the channel. This builds a new bridge between analytic combinatorics in several variables and labeled weighted graphs, bringing a new perspective and a set of powerful results to the literature of cost-constrained channels. Along the way, we show that the cost-constrained channel capacity is determined by a cost-dependent singularity of the bivariate generating function, generalizing Shannon's classical result for unconstrained capacity, and provide a new proof of the equivalence of the combinatorial and probabilistic definitions of the cost-constrained capacity.</description>

      <title>Diversity of Answers to Conjunctive Queries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.08848v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Enumeration problems aim at outputting, without repetition, the set of solutions to a given problem instance. However, outputting the entire solution set may be prohibitively expensive if it is too big. In this case, outputting a small, sufficiently diverse subset of the solutions would be preferable. This leads to the Diverse-version of the original enumeration problem, where the goal is to achieve a certain level d of diversity by selecting k solutions. In this paper, we look at the Diverse-version of the query answering problem for Conjunctive Queries and extensions thereof. That is, we study the problem if it is possible to achieve a certain level d of diversity by selecting k answers to the given query and, in the positive case, to actually compute such k answers.</description>

      <title>Emergence of social hierarchies in a society with two competitive groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18168v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Agent-based models describing social interactions among individuals can help to better understand emerging macroscopic patterns in societies. One of the topics which is worth tackling is the formation of different kinds of hierarchies that emerge in social spaces such as cities. Here we propose a Bonabeau-like model by adding a second group of agents. The fundamental particularity of our model is that only a pairwise interaction between agents of the opposite group is allowed. Agent fitness can thus only change by competition among the two groups, while the total fitness in the society remains constant. The main result is that for a broad range of values of the model parameters, the fitness of the agents of each group show a decay in time except for one or very few agents which capture almost all the fitness in the society. Numerical simulations also reveal a singular shift from egalitarian to hierarchical society for each group. This behaviour depends on the control parameter $\eta$, playing the role of the inverse of the temperature of the system. Results are invariant with regard to the system size, contingent solely on the quantity of agents within each group. Finally, scaling laws are provided thus showing a data collapse from different model parameters and they follow a shape which can be related to the presence of a phase transition in the model.</description>

      <title>On the time complexity analysis of numerical percolation threshold estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11874v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The main purpose of percolation theory is to model phase transitions in a variety of random systems, which is highly valuable in fields related to materials physics, biology, or otherwise unrelated areas like oil extraction or even quantum computing. Thus, one of the problems encountered is the calculation of the threshold at which such transition occurs, known as percolation threshold. Since there are no known closed forms to determine the threshold in an exact manner in systems with particular properties, it is decided to rely on numerical methods as the Monte Carlo approach, which provides a sufficiently accurate approximation to serve as a valid estimate in the projects or research where it is involved. However, in order to achieve an exact characterization of the threshold in two-dimensional systems with site percolation, in this work it is performed an analysis of the complexity, both temporal and spatial, of an algorithm that implements its computation from the aforementioned numerical method. Specifically, the conduction of an accurate analysis of the cost of such algorithm implies a deep enough knowledge about certain metrics regarding its duration, or work completed per iteration, which along with its formalization may contribute to the determination of the threshold based on these metrics. Nevertheless, as a result, various bounds are achieved for the best, average and worst cases of the execution on systems spanning several dimensions, revealing that in 1 and 2 the complexity is directly conditioned by the duration, although from 3 onwards no proof for this point has been found, notwithstanding the evidence suggesting its compliance. Furthermore, based on the average case, several methods are proposed that could be applied to characterize the threshold, although they have not been thoroughly explored beyond what is necessary for the complexity analysis.</description>

      <title>Improved Decoding of Tanner Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12293v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present improved decoding algorithms for expander-based Tanner codes.
  We begin by developing a randomized linear-time decoding algorithm that, under the condition that $ \delta d_0 &gt; 2 $, corrects up to $ \alpha n $ errors for a Tanner code $ T(G, C_0) $, where $ G $ is a $ (c, d, \alpha, \delta) $-bipartite expander with $n$ left vertices, and $ C_0 \subseteq \mathbb{F}_2^d $ is a linear inner code with minimum distance $ d_0 $. This result improves upon the previous work of Cheng, Ouyang, Shangguan, and Shen (RANDOM 2024), which required $ \delta d_0 &gt; 3 $.
  We further derandomize the algorithm to obtain a deterministic linear-time decoding algorithm with the same decoding radius. Our algorithm improves upon the previous deterministic algorithm of Cheng et al.\ by achieving a decoding radius of $ \alpha n $, compared with the previous radius of $ \frac{2\alpha}{d_0(1 + 0.5c\delta) }n$.
  Additionally, we investigate the size-expansion trade-off introduced by the recent work of Chen, Cheng, Li, and Ouyang (IEEE TIT 2023), and use it to provide new bounds on the minimum distance of Tanner codes. Specifically, we prove that the minimum distance of a Tanner code $T(G,C_0)$ is approximately $f_\delta^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{d_0} \right) \alpha n $, where $ f_\delta(\cdot) $ is the Size-Expansion Function. As another application, we improve the decoding radius of our decoding algorithms from $\alpha n$ to approximately $f_\delta^{-1}(\frac{2}{d_0})\alpha n$.</description>
