      <title>Intraseasonal synchronization of extreme rainfalls between North India and the Sahel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Indian Summer Monsoon (ISM) and the West African Monsoon (WAM) are dominant drivers of boreal summer precipitation variability in tropical and subtropical regions. Although the regional precipitation dynamics in these two regions have been extensively studied, the intraseasonal interactions between the ISM and WAM remain poorly understood. Here, we employ a climate network approach based on extreme rainfall events to uncover synchronously occurring extreme rainfall patterns across the two monsoon systems. We reveal strong synchronization of extreme rainfall events during the peak monsoon period in July and August, linking heavy rainfall over North India to that over the Sahel with a lag of around 12 days. We find that La Ni\~na-like conditions in combination with the Boreal Summer Intraseasonal Oscillation and an enhanced Tropical Easterly Jet (TEJ) foster the synchronization between the ISM and the WAM. Convective clouds are transported by an intensified TEJ from southwestern Asia toward North Africa, supporting anomalous deep convection over the Sahel region.</description>

      <title>Contributions of El Ni\~no Southern Oscillation (ENSO) Diversity to Low-Frequency Changes in ENSO Variance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.11552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.11552v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: El Ni\~no Southern Oscillation (ENSO) diversity is characterized based on the longitudinal location of maximum sea surface temperature anomalies (SSTA) and amplitude in the tropical Pacific, as Central Pacific (CP) events are typically weaker than Eastern Pacific (EP) events. SSTA pattern and intensity undergo low-frequency modulations, affecting ENSO prediction skill and remote impacts. Yet, how different ENSO types contribute to these decadal variations and long-term variance trends remain uncertain. Here, we decompose the low-frequency changes of ENSO variance into contributions from ENSO diversity categories. We propose a fuzzy clustering of monthly SSTA to allow for non-binary event category memberships. Our approach identifies two La Ni\~na and three El Ni\~no categories and shows that the shift of ENSO variance in the mid-1970s is associated with an increasing likelihood of strong La Ni\~na and extreme El Ni\~no events.</description>

      <title>Influence of temperature-dependent density inhomogeneity on the stability of atmospheric stratified fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10008v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The stability of atmospheric stratified fluids is revisited to study the influence of the temperature-dependent density inhomogeneity due to thermal expansion in the Earth's lower atmosphere (with heights $0$ to $50$ km) under the action of gravity. Previous theory in the literature [Phys. Lett. A 480 (2023) 128990] is modified and advanced. It is found that the Brunt-V{\"a}is{\"a}l{\"a} frequency associated with internal gravity waves is modified, leading to new instability conditions of vertically stratified fluids. The possibility of the onset of Rayleigh-B{\'e}nard convective instability is also discussed, and the influences of the modified Brunt-V{\"a}is{\"a}l{\"a} frequency and the density and temperature gradients on the instability growth rates are studied.</description>
