      <title>FRET-guided selection of RNA 3D structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18301v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrative biomolecular modeling of RNA relies on structural refined collections and accurate experimental data that reflect binding and folding behavior. However, the prediction of such collections remains challenging due to the rugged energy landscape and extensive conformational heterogeneity of large RNAs. To overcome these limitations, we applied a FRET-guided strategy to identify RNA conformational states consistent with single-molecule FRET (smFRET) experiments. We predicted 3D structures of a ribosomal RNA tertiary contact comprising a GAAA tetraloop and a kissing loop using three popular RNA 3D modeling tools namely RNAComposer, FARFAR2, and AlphaFold3, yielding a collection of candidate conformations. These models were structurally validated based on Watson-Crick base-pairing patterns and filtered using an eRMSD threshold. For each retained structure, we computed the accessible contact volume (ACV) of the sCy3/sCy5 dye pair using FRETraj to predict FRET distributions. These distributions were then compared and weighted against experimental smFRET data to identify conformational states compatible with the observed FRET states. Our results demonstrate that experimental transfer efficiencies can be reproduced using \textit{in silico} predicted RNA 3D structures. This FRET-guided workflow, combined with structural validation, lays the foundation for capturing the highly diverse conformational states characteristic of flexible RNA motifs.</description>

      <title>Complexity of Activity Patterns in a Bio-Inspired Hopfield-Type Network in Different Topologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18758v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural network models capable of storing memory have been extensively studied in computer science and computational neuroscience. The Hopfield network is a prototypical example of a model designed for associative, or content-addressable, memory and has been analyzed in many forms. Further, ideas and methods from complex network theory have been incorporated into artificial neural networks and learning, emphasizing their structural properties. Nevertheless, the temporal dynamics also play a vital role in biological neural networks, whose temporal structure is a crucial feature to examine. Biological neural networks display complex intermittency and, thus, can be studied through the lens of the temporal complexity (TC) theory. The TC approach look at the metastability of self-organized states, characterized by a power-law decay in the inter-event time distribution and in the total activity distribution or a scaling behavior in the corresponding event-driven diffusion processes. In this study, we present a temporal complexity (TC) analysis of a biologically-inspired Hopfield-type neural network model. We conducted a comparative assessment between scale-free and random network topologies, with particular emphasis on their global activation patterns. Our parametric analysis revealed comparable dynamical behaviors across both neural network architectures. Furthermore, our investigation into temporal complexity characteristics uncovered that seemingly distinct dynamical patterns exhibit similar temporal complexity behaviors. In particular, similar power-law decay in the activity distribution and similar complexity levels are observed in both topologies, but with a much reduced noise in the scale-free topology. Notably, most of the complex dynamical profiles were consistently observed in scale-free network configurations, thus confirming the crucial role of hubs in neural network dynamics.</description>

      <title>Chemically Active Liquid Bridges Generate Repulsive Forces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18777v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Droplets help organize cells by compartmentalizing biomolecules and by mediating mechanical interactions. When bridging two structures, such droplets generate capillary forces, which depend on surface properties and distance. While the forces exerted by passive liquid bridges are well understood, the role of active chemical reactions, which are often present in biological droplets, remains unclear. To elucidate this case, we study a single liquid bridge with continuous chemical turnover. These reactions control the bridge radius and lead to purely repulsive forces-contrasting with the typically attractive forces in passive systems. Our results reveal how chemical activity can fundamentally alter forces generated by liquid bridges, which could be exploited by cells.</description>

      <title>Active stop and go motion: a strategy to improve spatial exploration and survival</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.05647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.05647v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider active Brownian particles that intermittently switch between active and inactive states. Such behavior is ubiquitous at all scales, from bacteria to animals and in artificial active systems. We derive exact expressions for key transport properties, including velocity autocorrelations and diffusion coefficients, and demonstrate that particle dispersion is highly sensitive to minute details, such as whether the memory of active orientation is retained across a stop event. Extending the model to include minimal metabolic dynamics, we show that the average survival time of the particle is maximized at (i)~an optimal stopping frequency and (ii)~a non-trivial optimal diffusivity, which itself depends on the stopping frequency.</description>

      <title>Effective decoupling of mutations and the resulting loss of biodiversity caused by environmental change</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17913v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many biological populations exhibit diversity in their strategy for survival and reproduction in a given environment, and microbes are an example. We explore the fate of different strategies under sustained environmental change by considering a mathematical model for a large population of asexual organisms. Fitness is a bimodal function of a quantitative trait, with two local optima, separated by a local minimum, i.e., a mixture of stabilising and disruptive selection. The optima represent two locally `best' trait values. We consider regimes where, when the environment is unchanging, the equilibrium distribution of the trait is bimodal. A bimodal trait distribution generally requires, for its existence, mutational coupling between the two peaks, and it indicates two coexisting clones with distinct survival and reproduction strategies. When subject to persistent environmental change, the population adapts by utilising mutations that allow it to track the changing environment. The faster the rate of change of the environment, the larger the effect of the mutations that are utilised. Under persistent environmental change, the distribution of trait values takes two different forms. At low rates of change, the distribution remains bimodal. At higher rates, the distribution becomes unimodal. This loss of a clone/biodiversity is driven by a novel mechanism where environmental change decouples a class of mutations.</description>
