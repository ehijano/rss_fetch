      <title>Oscillatory Instabilities of a One-Spot Pattern in the Schnakenberg Reaction-Diffusion System in $3$-D Domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03921v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For an activator-inhibitor reaction-diffusion system in a bounded three-dimensional domain $\Omega$ of $O(1)$ volume and small activator diffusivity of $O(\varepsilon^2)$, we employ a hybrid asymptotic-numerical method to investigate two instabilities of a localized one-spot equilibrium that result from Hopf bifurcations: an amplitude instability leading to growing oscillations in spot amplitude, and a translational instability leading to growing oscillations of the location of the spot's center $\mathbf{x}_0 \in \Omega$. Here, a one-spot equilibrium is one in which the activator concentration is exponentially small everywhere in $\Omega$ except in a localized region of $O(\varepsilon)$ about $\mathbf{x}_0 \in \Omega$ where its concentration is $O(1)$. We find that the translation instability is governed by a $3\times 3$ nonlinear matrix eigenvalue problem. The entries of this matrix involve terms calculated from certain Green's functions, which encode information about the domain's geometry. In this nonlinear matrix eigenvalue system, the most unstable eigenvalue determines the oscillation frequency at onset, while the corresponding eigenvector determines the direction of oscillation. We demonstrate the impact of domain geometry and defects on this instability, providing analytic insights into how they select the preferred direction of oscillation. For the amplitude instability, we illustrate the intricate way in which the Hopf bifurcation threshold $\tau_H$ varies with a feed-rate parameter $A$. In particular, we show that the $\tau_H$ versus $A$ relationship possesses two saddle-nodes, with different branches scaling differently with the small parameter $\varepsilon$. All asymptotic results are confirmed by finite elements solutions of the full reaction-diffusion system.</description>

      <title>Theoretical / numerical study of modulated traveling waves in inhibition stabilized networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03613v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove a principle of linearized stability for traveling wave solutions to neural field equations posed on the real line. Additionally, we provide the existence of a finite dimensional invariant center manifold close to a traveling wave, this allows to study bifurcations of traveling waves. Finally, the spectral properties of the modulated traveling waves are investigated. Numerical schemes for the computation of modulated traveling waves are provided. We then apply these results and methods to study a neural field model in a inhibitory stabilized regime. We showcase Fold, Hopf and Bodgdanov-Takens bifurcations of traveling pulses. Additionally, we continue the modulated traveling pulses as function of the time scale ratio of the two neural populations and show numerical evidences for snaking of modulated traveling pulses.</description>

      <title>Interaction of jamitons in second-order macroscopic traffic models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03721v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Jamitons are self-sustained traveling wave solutions that arise in certain second-order macroscopic models of vehicular traffic. A necessary condition for a jamiton to appear is that the local traffic density breaks the so-called sub-characteristic condition. This condition states that the characteristic velocity of the corresponding first-order Lighthill-Whitham-Richards (LWR) model formed with the same desired speed function is enclosed by the characteristic speeds of the corresponding second-order model. The phenomenon of collision of jamitons in second-order models of traffic flow is studied analytically and numerically for the particular case of the second-order Aw-Rascle-Zhang (ARZ) traffic model [A.\ Aw, M.\ Rascle, {\it SIAM J.\ Appl.\ Math.} {\bf 60} (2000) 916--938; H.\ M.\ Zhang, {\it Transp.\ Res.\ B} {\bf 36} (2002) 275--290]. A compatibility condition is first defined to select jamitons that can collide each other. The collision of jamitons produces a new jamiton with a velocity different from the initial ones. It is observed that the exit velocities smooth out the velocity of the test jamiton and the initial velocities of the jamitons that collide. Other properties such as the amplitude of the exit jamitons, lengths, and maximum density are also explored.In the cases of the amplitude and maximum exit density it turns out that over a wide range of sonic densities, the exit values exceed or equal the input values. On the other hand, the resulting jamiton has a greater length than the incoming ones. Finally, the behavior for various driver reaction times is explored. It is obtained that some properties do not depend on that time, such as the amplitude, exit velocity, or maximum density, while the exit length does depend on driver reaction time.</description>

      <title>Revealing Physical Mechanisms of pattern formation and switching in ecosystems via Landscape and Flux</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03978v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spatial patterns are widely observed in numerous nonequilibrium natural systems, often undergoing complex transitions and bifurcations, thereby exhibiting significant importance in many physical and biological systems such as embryonic development, ecosystem desertification, and turbulence. However, how the pattern formation emerges and how the pattern switching occurs are not fully understood. Here, we developed a landscape-flux field theory via the spatial mode expansion method to uncover the underlying physical mechanism of the pattern formation and switching. We identified the landscape and flux field as the driving force for spatial dynamics and applied this theory to the critical transitions between spatial vegetation patterns in semi-arid ecosystems, revealing that the nonequilibrium flux drives transitions of spatial patterns. We uncovered how the pattern switching emerges through the optimal pathways and how fast this occurs via the speed of pattern switching. Furthermore, both the averaged flux and the entropy production rate exhibit peaks near pattern switching boundaries, revealing dynamical and thermodynamical origins for pattern transitions, and further offering early warning signals for anticipating pattern switching. Our work thus reveals physical mechanisms on spatial pattern-switching in semi-arid ecosystems and, more generally, introduces an useful approach for quantifying spatial pattern switching in nonequilibrium systems, which further offers practical applications such as early warning signals for critical transitions of spatial patterns.</description>

      <title>Energy Scalability Limits of Dissipative Solitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04297v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we apply a thermodynamical approach to elucidate the primary constraints on the energy scaling of dissipative solitons (DS). We rely on the adiabatic theory of strongly chirped DS and define the DS energy scaling in terms of dissipative soliton resonance (DSR). Three main experimentally verifiable signatures identify a transition to DSR: i) growth of a Lorentzian spike at the centrum of the DS spectrum, which resembles a spectral condensation in Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC), ii) saturation of the spectrum broadening, and iii) asymptotical DS stretching. We connect the DSR breakup with three critical factors: i) decoupling of two correlation scales inherent in strongly chirped DS, ii) resulting rise of the DS entropy with energy, which provokes its disintegration, and iii) transition to a nonequilibrium phase, which is characterized by negative temperature. The breakup results in multiple stable DSs with lower energy. Theoretical results are in good qualitative agreement with the experimental data from a Kerr-lens mode-locked Cr$^{2+}$:ZnS chirped-pulse oscillator (CPO) that paves the way for optimizing high-energy femtosecond pulse generation in solid-state CPO and all-normal-dispersion fiber lasers.</description>

      <title>Bloch Oscillations of a Soliton in a 1D Quantum Fluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04355v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The motion of a quantum system subjected to an external force often defeats our classical intuition. A celebrated example is the dynamics of a single particle in a periodic potential, which undergoes Bloch oscillations under the action of a constant force. Surprisingly, Bloch-like oscillations can also occur in one-dimensional quantum fluids without requiring the presence of a lattice. The intriguing generalization of Bloch oscillations to a weakly-bounded ensemble of interacting particles has been so far limited to the experimental study of the two-particle case, where the observed period is halved compared to the single-particle case. In this work, we observe the oscillations of the position of a mesoscopic solitonic wave packet, consisting of approximately 1000 atoms in a one-dimensional Bose gas when subjected to a constant uniform force and in the absence of a lattice potential. The oscillation period scales inversely with the atom number, thus revealing its collective nature. We demonstrate the pivotal role of the phase coherence of the quantum bath in which the wave packet moves and investigate the underlying topology of the associated superfluid currents. Our measurements highlight the periodicity of the dispersion relation of collective excitations in one-dimensional quantum systems. We anticipate that our observation of such a macroscopic quantum phenomenon will inspire further studies on the crossover between classical and quantum laws of motion, such as exploring the role of dissipation, similarly to the textbook case of macroscopic quantum tunneling in Josephson physics.</description>
