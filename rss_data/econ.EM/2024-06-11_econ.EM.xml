      <title>Causal Interpretation of Regressions With Ranks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In studies of educational production functions or intergenerational mobility, it is common to transform the key variables into percentile ranks. Yet, it remains unclear what the regression coefficient estimates with ranks of the outcome or the treatment. In this paper, we derive effective causal estimands for a broad class of commonly-used regression methods, including the ordinary least squares (OLS), two-stage least squares (2SLS), difference-in-differences (DiD), and regression discontinuity designs (RDD). Specifically, we introduce a novel primitive causal estimand, the Rank Average Treatment Effect (rank-ATE), and prove that it serves as the building block of the effective estimands of all the aforementioned econometrics methods. For 2SLS, DiD, and RDD, we show that direct applications to outcome ranks identify parameters that are difficult to interpret. To address this issue, we develop alternative methods to identify more interpretable causal parameters.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Real-time Coupon Allocation in the Online Platform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05987v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditionally, firms have offered coupons to customer groups at predetermined discount rates. However, advancements in machine learning and the availability of abundant customer data now enable platforms to provide real-time customized coupons to individuals. In this study, we partner with Meituan, a leading shopping platform, to develop a real-time, end-to-end coupon allocation system that is fast and effective in stimulating demand while adhering to marketing budgets when faced with uncertain traffic from a diverse customer base. Leveraging comprehensive customer and product features, we estimate Conversion Rates (CVR) under various coupon values and employ isotonic regression to ensure the monotonicity of predicted CVRs with respect to coupon value. Using calibrated CVR predictions as input, we propose a Lagrangian Dual-based algorithm that efficiently determines optimal coupon values for each arriving customer within 50 milliseconds. We theoretically and numerically investigate the model performance under parameter misspecifications and apply a control loop to adapt to real-time updated information, thereby better adhering to the marketing budget. Finally, we demonstrate through large-scale field experiments and observational data that our proposed coupon allocation algorithm outperforms traditional approaches in terms of both higher conversion rates and increased revenue. As of May 2024, Meituan has implemented our framework to distribute coupons to over 100 million users across more than 110 major cities in China, resulting in an additional CNY 8 million in annual profit. We demonstrate how to integrate a machine learning prediction model for estimating customer CVR, a Lagrangian Dual-based coupon value optimizer, and a control system to achieve real-time coupon delivery while dynamically adapting to random customer arrival patterns.</description>

      <title>Heterogeneous Treatment Effects in Panel Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05633v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We address a core problem in causal inference: estimating heterogeneous treatment effects using panel data with general treatment patterns. Many existing methods either do not utilize the potential underlying structure in panel data or have limitations in the allowable treatment patterns. In this work, we propose and evaluate a new method that first partitions observations into disjoint clusters with similar treatment effects using a regression tree, and then leverages the (assumed) low-rank structure of the panel data to estimate the average treatment effect for each cluster. Our theoretical results establish the convergence of the resulting estimates to the true treatment effects. Computation experiments with semi-synthetic data show that our method achieves superior accuracy compared to alternative approaches, using a regression tree with no more than 40 leaves. Hence, our method provides more accurate and interpretable estimates than alternative methods.</description>

      <title>LaLonde (1986) after Nearly Four Decades: Lessons Learned</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00827v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 1986, Robert LaLonde published an article that compared nonexperimental estimates to experimental benchmarks (LaLonde 1986). He concluded that the nonexperimental methods at the time could not systematically replicate experimental benchmarks, casting doubt on the credibility of these methods. Following LaLonde's critical assessment, there have been significant methodological advances and practical changes, including (i) an emphasis on estimators based on unconfoundedness, (ii) a focus on the importance of overlap in covariate distributions, (iii) the introduction of propensity score-based methods leading to doubly robust estimators, (iv) a greater emphasis on validation exercises to bolster research credibility, and (v) methods for estimating and exploiting treatment effect heterogeneity. To demonstrate the practical lessons from these advances, we reexamine the LaLonde data and the Imbens-Rubin-Sacerdote lottery data. We show that modern methods, when applied in contexts with sufficient covariate overlap, yield robust estimates for the adjusted differences between the treatment and control groups. However, this does not mean that these estimates are valid. To assess their credibility, validation exercises (such as placebo tests) are essential, whereas goodness of fit tests alone are inadequate. Our findings highlight the importance of closely examining the assignment process, carefully inspecting overlap, and conducting validation exercises when analyzing causal effects with nonexperimental data.</description>
