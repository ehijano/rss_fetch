      <title>BrainCodec: Neural fMRI codec for the decoding of cognitive brain states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, leveraging big data in deep learning has led to significant performance improvements, as confirmed in applications like mental state decoding using fMRI data. However, fMRI datasets remain relatively small in scale, and the inherent issue of low signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) in fMRI data further exacerbates these challenges. To address this, we apply compression techniques as a preprocessing step for fMRI data. We propose BrainCodec, a novel fMRI codec inspired by the neural audio codec. We evaluated BrainCodec's compression capability in mental state decoding, demonstrating further improvements over previous methods. Furthermore, we analyzed the latent representations obtained through BrainCodec, elucidating the similarities and differences between task and resting state fMRI, highlighting the interpretability of BrainCodec. Additionally, we demonstrated that fMRI reconstructions using BrainCodec can enhance the visibility of brain activity by achieving higher SNR, suggesting its potential as a novel denoising method. Our study shows that BrainCodec not only enhances performance over previous methods but also offers new analytical possibilities for neuroscience. Our codes, dataset, and model weights are available at https://github.com/amano-k-lab/BrainCodec.</description>

      <title>A Brain-Inspired Regularizer for Adversarial Robustness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03952v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) excel in many visual tasks, but they tend to be sensitive to slight input perturbations that are imperceptible to the human eye, often resulting in task failures. Recent studies indicate that training CNNs with regularizers that promote brain-like representations, using neural recordings, can improve model robustness. However, the requirement to use neural data severely restricts the utility of these methods. Is it possible to develop regularizers that mimic the computational function of neural regularizers without the need for neural recordings, thereby expanding the usability and effectiveness of these techniques? In this work, we inspect a neural regularizer introduced in Li et al. (2019) to extract its underlying strength. The regularizer uses neural representational similarities, which we find also correlate with pixel similarities. Motivated by this finding, we introduce a new regularizer that retains the essence of the original but is computed using image pixel similarities, eliminating the need for neural recordings. We show that our regularization method 1) significantly increases model robustness to a range of black box attacks on various datasets and 2) is computationally inexpensive and relies only on original datasets. Our work explores how biologically motivated loss functions can be used to drive the performance of artificial neural networks.</description>

      <title>Measuring and Controlling Solution Degeneracy across Task-Trained Recurrent Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03972v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Task-trained recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are versatile models of dynamical processes widely used in machine learning and neuroscience. While RNNs are easily trained to perform a wide range of tasks, the nature and extent of the degeneracy in the resultant solutions (i.e., the variability across trained RNNs) remain poorly understood. Here, we provide a unified framework for analyzing degeneracy across three levels: behavior, neural dynamics, and weight space. We analyzed RNNs trained on diverse tasks across machine learning and neuroscience domains, including N-bit flip-flop, sine wave generation, delayed discrimination, and path integration. Our key finding is that the variability across RNN solutions, quantified on the basis of neural dynamics and trained weights, depends primarily on network capacity and task characteristics such as complexity. We introduce information-theoretic measures to quantify task complexity and demonstrate that increasing task complexity consistently reduces degeneracy in neural dynamics and generalization behavior while increasing degeneracy in weight space. These relationships hold across diverse tasks and can be used to control the degeneracy of the solution space of task-trained RNNs. Furthermore, we provide several strategies to control solution degeneracy, enabling task-trained RNNs to learn more consistent or diverse solutions as needed. We envision that these insights will lead to more reliable machine learning models and could inspire strategies to better understand and control degeneracy observed in neuroscience experiments.</description>

      <title>Brain Mapping with Dense Features: Grounding Cortical Semantic Selectivity in Natural Images With Vision Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05266v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Advances in large-scale artificial neural networks have facilitated novel insights into the functional topology of the brain. Here, we leverage this approach to study how semantic categories are organized in the human visual cortex. To overcome the challenge presented by the co-occurrence of multiple categories in natural images, we introduce BrainSAIL (Semantic Attribution and Image Localization), a method for isolating specific neurally-activating visual concepts in images. BrainSAIL exploits semantically consistent, dense spatial features from pre-trained vision models, building upon their demonstrated ability to robustly predict neural activity. This method derives clean, spatially dense embeddings without requiring any additional training, and employs a novel denoising process that leverages the semantic consistency of images under random augmentations. By unifying the space of whole-image embeddings and dense visual features and then applying voxel-wise encoding models to these features, we enable the identification of specific subregions of each image which drive selectivity patterns in different areas of the higher visual cortex. We validate BrainSAIL on cortical regions with known category selectivity, demonstrating its ability to accurately localize and disentangle selectivity to diverse visual concepts. Next, we demonstrate BrainSAIL's ability to characterize high-level visual selectivity to scene properties and low-level visual features such as depth, luminance, and saturation, providing insights into the encoding of complex visual information. Finally, we use BrainSAIL to directly compare the feature selectivity of different brain encoding models across different regions of interest in visual cortex. Our innovative method paves the way for significant advances in mapping and decomposing high-level visual representations in the human brain.</description>

      <title>A mobile digital device proficiency performance test for cognitive clinical research</title>

Abstract: Mobile device proficiency is increasingly important for everyday living, including to deliver healthcare services. Human-device interactions represent a potential in cognitive neurology and aging research. Although traditional pen-and-paper evaluations serve as valuable tools within public health strategies for population-scale cognitive assessments, digital devices could amplify cognitive assessment. However, even person-centered studies often fail to incorporate measures of mobile device proficiency and research with digital mobile technology frequently neglects these evaluations. Besides that, cognitive screening, a fundamental part of brain health evaluation and a widely accepted strategy to identify high-risk individuals vulnerable to cognitive impairment and dementia, has research using digital devices for older adults in need for standardization. To address this shortfall, the DigiTAU collaborative and interdisciplinary project is creating refined methodological parameters for the investigation of digital biomarkers. With careful consideration of cognitive design elements, here we describe the open-source and performance-based Mobile Device Abilities Test (MDAT), a simple, low-cost, and reproductible open-sourced test framework. This result was achieved with a cross-sectional study population sample of 101 low and middle-income subjects aged 20 to 79 years old. Partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) was used to assess the measurement of the construct. It was possible to achieve a reliable method with internal consistency, good content validity related to digital competences, and that does not have much interference with auto-perceived global functional disability, health self-perception, and motor dexterity. Limitations for this method are discussed and paths to improve and establish better standards are highlighted.</description>

      <title>Bifurcation enhances temporal information encoding in the olfactory periphery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20135v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Living systems continually respond to signals from the surrounding environment. Survival requires that their responses adapt quickly and robustly to the changes in the environment. One particularly challenging example is olfactory navigation in turbulent plumes, where animals experience highly intermittent odor signals while odor concentration varies over many length- and timescales. Here, we show theoretically that Drosophila olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) can exploit proximity to a bifurcation point of their firing dynamics to reliably extract information about the timing and intensity of fluctuations in the odor signal, which have been shown to be critical for odor-guided navigation. Close to the bifurcation, the system is intrinsically invariant to signal variance, and information about the timing, duration, and intensity of odor fluctuations is transferred efficiently. Importantly, we find that proximity to the bifurcation is maintained by mean adaptation alone and therefore does not require any additional feedback mechanism or fine-tuning. Using a biophysical model with calcium-based feedback, we demonstrate that this mechanism can explain the measured adaptation characteristics of Drosophila ORNs.</description>

      <title>Brain-Like Replay Naturally Emerges in Reinforcement Learning Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.01467v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Replay is a powerful strategy to promote learning in artificial intelligence and the brain. However, the conditions to generate it and its functional advantages have not been fully recognized. In this study, we develop a modular reinforcement learning model that could generate replay. We prove that replay generated in this way helps complete the task. We also analyze the information contained in the representation and provide a mechanism for how replay makes a difference. Our design avoids complex assumptions and enables replay to emerge naturally within a task-optimized paradigm. Our model also reproduces key phenomena observed in biological agents. This research explores the structural biases in modular ANN to generate replay and its potential utility in developing efficient RL.</description>
