      <title>Exponential asymptotics of quantum droplets and bubbles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This research investigates the formation and stability of localized states, known as quantum droplets and bubbles, in the quadratic-cubic discrete nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation. Near a Maxwell point, these states emerge from two fronts connecting the bistable equilibria. By adjusting a control parameter, we identify a "pinning region" where multiple stable states coexist and are interconnected through homoclinic snaking. We analyze the system's behavior to uncover the underlying mechanisms under strong coupling conditions. Using exponential asymptotics, we determine the pinning region's width and its dependence on coupling strength, revealing an exponentially small relationship between them. Additionally, we employ eigenvalue counting to establish the stability of these states by computing the critical eigenvalue of their corresponding linearization operator, proving onsite fronts unstable and intersite fronts stable. These theoretical results are validated through numerical simulations, which show excellent agreement with our analytical predictions.</description>

      <title>Exponential asymptotics of dark and bright solitons in the discrete nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the existence and linear stability of solitons in the nonlinear Schr\"odinger lattices in the strong coupling regime. Focusing and defocusing nonlinearities are considered, giving rise to bright and dark solitons. In this regime, the effects of lattice discreteness become exponentially small, requiring a beyond-all-orders analysis. To this end, we employ exponential asymptotics to derive soliton solutions and examine their stability systematically. We show that only two symmetry-related soliton configurations are permissible: onsite solitons centered at lattice sites and intersite solitons positioned between adjacent sites. Although the instability of intersite solitons due to real eigenvalue pairs is known numerically, a rigorous analytical account, particularly for dark solitons, has been lacking. Our work fills this gap, yielding analytical predictions that match numerical computations with high accuracy. We also establish the linear stability of onsite bright solitons. While the method cannot directly resolve the quartet eigenvalue-induced instability of onsite dark solitons due to the continuous spectrum covering the entire imaginary axis, we conjecture an eigenvalue-counting argument that supports their instability. Overall, our application of the exponential asymptotics method shows the versatility of this approach for addressing multiscale problems in discrete nonlinear systems.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear management of the miscibility-immiscibility transition in binary Bose-Einstein condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13683v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate application of the nonlinearity management (NM, i.e., periodic variation of the strength of the inter-component repulsion) to the miscibility-immiscibility (MIM) transition across the critical point of a two-component BEC, both with and without the linear mixing (Rabi coupling, RC) between the components. To this end, we first identify, by means of a variational approximation and numerical solution, diverse stationary domain-wall (DW) structures supported by the system in the absence of the management. The approximate analytical solutions for the DWs are found to be in excellent agreement with their numerical counterparts. An analytical estimate is also produced for the upshift of the MIM transition caused by the pressure of the trapping potential in the case of a confined system. An exact DW solution is produced for the system including the P\"{o}schl-Teller potential, which is stable (unstable) if the potential is repulsive (attractive). Further, we find the spectrum of linear excitations in the spatially uniform mixed state, and thus establish parameter regions where the system is stable/unstable against demixing. In particular, RC upshifts the critical strength of the inter-component repulsion for the onset of the MIM transition. Eigenfrequencies of excitations on top of DW states are identified from numerical simulations through monitoring the evolution of perturbed states. Weak NM applied at the DW eigenfrequency reveals features of the nonlinear resonance. Stronger NM, under which the system periodically crosses the MIM-transition point, restricts the miscibility.</description>

      <title>Magnetic monopoles with an internal degree of freedom</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13879v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a class of spontaneously broken $SU(2)$ gauge theories with adjoint scalar and look for exact magnetic monopole solutions in the Bogomol'nyi--Prasad--Sommerfield (BPS) limit. We find that some of the resulting solutions exhibit a new internal degree of freedom (a moduli space parameter) that controls the energy density profile of the monopole while keeping the total energy (mass) constant.</description>
