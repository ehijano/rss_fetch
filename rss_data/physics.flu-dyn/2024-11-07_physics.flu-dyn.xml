      <title>Momentum fluxes in wind-forced breaking waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the momentum fluxes between a turbulent air boundary layer and a growing-breaking wave field by solving the air-water two-phase Navier-Stokes equations through direct numerical simulations (DNS). A fully-developed turbulent airflow drives the growth of a narrowbanded wave field, whose amplitude increases until reaching breaking conditions. The breaking events result in a loss of wave energy, transferred to the water column, followed by renewed growth under wind forcing. We revisit the momentum flux analysis in a high-wind speed regime, characterized by the ratio of the friction velocity to wave speed $u_\ast/c$ in the range $[0.3-0.9]$, through the lens of growing-breaking cycles. The total momentum flux across the interface is dominated by pressure, which increases with $u_\ast/c$ during growth and reduces sharply during breaking. Drag reduction during breaking is linked to airflow separation, a sudden acceleration of the flow, an upward shift of the mean streamwise velocity profile, and a reduction in Reynolds shear stress. We characterize the reduction of pressure stress and flow acceleration through an aerodynamic drag coefficient by splitting the analysis between growing and breaking stages, treating them as separate sub-processes. While drag increases with $u_\ast/c$ during growth, it drops during breaking. Averaging over both stages leads to a saturation of the drag coefficient at high $u_\ast/c$, comparable to what is observed at high wind speeds in laboratory and field conditions. Our analysis suggests this saturation is controlled by breaking dynamics.</description>

      <title>Analysis of thermodiffusive instabilities in hydrogen premixed flames using a tabulated flamelet model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Preferential diffusion plays a critical role in the evolution of lean premixed hydrogen flames, influencing flame surface corrugation and overall flame behavior. Simulating such flames with tabulated chemistry (TC) methods remains challenging due to the complexity of flame dynamics. A detailed assessment of flamelet-based manifolds for capturing these dynamics is still needed. This work incorporates preferential diffusion via mixture-averaged molecular diffusion within TC to study the propagation and structure of freely propagating hydrogen flames influenced by intrinsic instabilities. Model performance is evaluated against detailed chemistry (DC) calculations, focusing on linear and non-linear regimes and sensitivity to pressure and temperature variations. The impact of mesh resolution on flame response is also examined to assess the method's capabilities without subgrid models. The linear regime is analyzed through the dispersion relation, revealing that higher temperature or pressure extends the range of wave numbers accurately predicted by the model, although some overprediction of flame wrinkling in stable regions is observed. The nonlinear regime is assessed by comparing global flame parameters and flame structure to reference solutions, showing that the model captures key flame descriptors with relative errors under 20%. Overall, the model effectively reproduces key effects governing flames with thermodiffusive instabilities, offering a viable alternative to DC at a significantly reduced computational cost.</description>

      <title>Dynamic interactions between an aerodynamic flow and a flexible flat plate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Passive flow control via fluid-structure interaction (FSI) is a promising paradigm for unmanned aerial vehicles operating in vortex-dominated low Reynolds number regimes. A flexible structure has the potential to passively alter key unsteady vortex structures through its vibrations if its intrinsic modal dynamics are carefully aligned with the driving flow processes. Towards this aim, we perform high-fidelity numerical FSI simulations to study the dynamic interplay between a separated aerodynamic flow with vortex shedding (Re = 500 and angle of attack of 15$^{\circ}$) and a flexible flat plate modeled using linear Euler-Bernoulli beam theory. To isolate the natural evolution/instability mechanisms of the coupled dynamics, we start our simulations from a steady base state of the FSI system. We focus on open questions related to the coupled dynamics: (i) Do the early-time dynamics that evolve from the base state involve a coupled or flow-driven instability?; (ii) how are the flow dynamics and associated lift informed by the modal shape(s) and deformation timescales of the structural response, and how is this structural response informed by the structural parameters relative to the vortex-shedding behavior of the reference (rigid) case? For question (i), we identify that the departure from the base state arises from a flow-induced instability, suggesting that it is the vortex shedding of the aerodynamic flow that instigates structural motion. For question (ii), we further clarify how the structural mode dynamics in the FSI setting are dictated by the relationship between the vacuum fundamental frequencies of the structure and the baseline rigid-plate shedding frequency. We show that the long-time FSI dynamics can be partitioned into distinct regimes categorized by the dominant mode of the structural dynamics. The coupled dynamics in each regime are described in detail in the manuscript.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Center--Manifold for the Navier--Stokes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Center-manifold approximations for infinite-dimensional systems are treated in the context of the Navier--Stokes equations extended to include an equation for the parameter evolution. The consequences of system extension are non-trivial and are examined in detail. The extended system is reformulated via an isomorphic transformation, and the application of the center-manifold theorem to the reformulated system results in a finite set of center-manifold amplitude equations coupled with an infinite-dimensional graph equation for the stable subspace solution. General expressions for the asymptotic solution of the graph equation are then derived. The main benefit of such an approach is that the graph equation, and the subsequent asymptotic expressions are formally valid even when the system is perturbed slightly away from the bifurcation point. The derivation is then applied to two cases - the classic case of the Hopf bifurcation of the cylinder wake, and a case of flow in an open cavity which has interesting dynamical properties after bifurcation. Predictions of the angular frequencies of the reduced systems are in good agreement with those obtained for the full systems close to the bifurcation point. The Stuart-Landau equations for the two cases are also obtained. The presented methodology may easily be applied to other infinite-dimensional systems.</description>

      <title>Convergence study of multi-field singular value decomposition for turbulence fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03739v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Convergence of a matrix decomposition technique, the multi-field singular value decomposition (MFSVD) which efficiently analyzes nonlinear correlations by simultaneously decomposing multiple fields, is investigated. Toward applications in turbulence studies, we demonstrate that SVD for an artificial matrix with multi-scale structures reproduces the power-law-like distribution in the singular value spectrum with several orthogonal modes. Then, MFSVD is applied to practical turbulence field data produced by numerical simulations. It is clarified that relative errors in the reproduction of quadratic nonlinear quantities in multi-field turbulence converge remarkably faster than the single-field case, which requires thousands of modes to converge.</description>

      <title>Aerodynamic Influence Over Leading and Pursuing Motorcycles Equipped With Downforce-Generation Wings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03890v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aerodynamic influence of a wing-equipped motorcycle on a pursuing motorcycle presents critical implications for stability and performance. This study investigates the induced flow dynamics, characterized by a turbulent and complex wake that significantly affects the aerodynamic forces and moments experienced by the following motorcycle. The presence of aerodynamic appendices on the leading motorcycle intensifies these effects, generating coherent wingtip vortices that propagate downstream-a typical behavior of lift-generating devices. In this work, numerical simulations reveal that the aerodynamic consequences vary with the relative positioning of the pursuing motorcycle. A lateral offset can reduce wheelie tendencies due to beneficial flow interactions, while lateral alignment and longitudinal positioning variation may exacerbate negative aerodynamic impacts, compromising stability. Contrary to initial expectations, the simulations in this work demonstrate that the turbulent wake and the coherent vortex pair influence the pursuing motorcycle's behavior independently, persisting across all tested relative distances. While the turbulent wake usually creates a low-pressure region that facilitates drafting, the presence of coherent vortices reduces this advantage by introducing additional lift through the upwash velocity component. Conversely, specific lateral deviations can lessen wheelie effects, with downwash becoming the dominant flow component. Although difficult to be removed promptly due to being part of the overall high performance motorcycle design, it is suggested that the downforce generating aerodynamic appendices removal should be considered by the motorcycling competition governing bodies to provide better safety and racing conditions at all categories that make use of it.</description>

      <title>Drainage and lifetime of thin liquid films: the role of salinity and convective evaporation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03908v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We experimentally investigate the effect of salinity and atmospheric humidity on the drainage and lifetime of thin liquid films motivated by conditions relevant to air-sea exchanges. We show that the drainage is independent of humidity and that the effect of a change in salinity is only reflected through the associated change in viscosity. On the other hand, film lifetime displays a strong dependence on humidity, with more than a tenfold increase between low and high humidities: from a few seconds to tens of minutes. Mixing the air surrounding the film also has a very important effect on lifetime, modifying its distribution and reducing the mean lifetime of the film. From estimations of the evaporation rate, we are able to derive scaling laws that describe well the evolution of lifetime with a change of humidity. Observations of the black film, close to the top where the film ruptures, reveal that this region is very sensitive to local humidity conditions.</description>

      <title>Evolution of internal cnoidal waves with local defects in a two-layer fluid with rotation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03997v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Internal waves in a two-layer fluid with rotation are considered within the framework of Helfrich's f-plane extension of the Miyata-Choi-Camassa (MCC) model. Within the scope of this model, we develop an asymptotic procedure which allows us to obtain a description of a large class of uni-directional waves leading to the Ostrovsky equation and allowing for the presence of shear inertial oscillations and barotropic transport. Importantly, unlike the conventional derivations leading to the Ostrovsky equation, the constructed solutions do not impose the zero-mean constraint on the initial conditions for any variable in the problem formulation. Using the constructed solutions, we model the evolution of quasi-periodic initial conditions close to the cnoidal wave solutions of the Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equation but having a local amplitude and/or periodicity defect, and show that such initial conditions can lead to the emergence of bursts of large internal waves and shear currents. As a by-product of our study, we show that cnoidal waves with periodicity defects discussed in this work are weak solutions of the KdV equation and, being smoothed in numerical simulations, they behave as long-lived approximate travelling waves of the KdV equation, with the associated bursts being solely due to the effect of rotation.</description>

      <title>Role of flow topology in wind-driven wildfire propagation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04007v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wildfires propagate through intricate interactions between wind, fuel, and terrain, resulting in complex behaviors that pose challenges for accurate predictions. This study investigates the interaction between wind velocity topology and wildfire spread dynamics, aiming to enhance our understanding of wildfire spread patterns. We revisited the non-dimensionalizion of the governing combustion model by incorporating three distinct time scales. This approach revealed two new non-dimensional numbers, contrasting with the conventional non-dimensionalization that considers only a single time scale. Through scaling analysis, we analytically identified the critical determinants of transient wildfire behavior and established a state-neutral curve, indicating where initial wildfires extinguish for specific combinations of the identified non-dimensional numbers. Subsequently, a wildfire transport solver was developed using a finite difference method, integrating compact schemes and implicit-explicit Runge-Kutta methods. We explored the influence of stable and unstable manifolds in wind velocity on wildfire transport under steady wind conditions defined using a saddle-type fixed point flow, emphasizing the role of the non-dimensional numbers. Additionally, we considered the benchmark unsteady double-gyre flow and examined the effect of unsteady wind topology on wildfire propagation, and quantified the wildfire response to varying wind oscillation frequencies and amplitudes using a transfer function approach. The results were compared to Lagrangian coherent structures (LCS) used to characterize the correspondence of manifolds with wildfire propagation. The comprehensive approach of utilizing the manifolds computed from wind topology provides valuable insights into wildfire dynamics across diverse wind scenarios, offering a potential tool for improved predictive modeling and management strategies.</description>

      <title>Linking Mixing Interface Deformation to Concentration Gradients in Porous Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04099v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the pore-scale transport of a conservative scalar forming an advancing mixing front, which can be re-interpreted to predict instantaneous mixing-limited bimolecular reactions. We investigate this using a set of two-dimensional, high-resolution numerical simulations within a poly-disperse granular porous medium, covering a wide range of Peclet numbers. The aim is to show and exploit the direct link between pore-scale concentration gradients and mixing interface (midpoint concentration isocontour). We believe that such a perspective provides a complementary new lens for better understanding mixing and spreading in porous media. We develop and validate a theoretical model that quantifies the temporal elongation of the mixing interface and the upscaled reaction kinetics in mixing-limited systems accounting for pore-scale concentration fluctuations. Contrary to the classical belief that, given sufficient time, pore-scale fluctuations would eventually be washed out, we show that for $Pe&gt;1$ advection generates pore-scale concentration fluctuations more rapidly than they can be fully dissipated. For such P'eclet numbers, once incomplete mixing is established, it will persist indefinitely.</description>

      <title>Dispersion relation for the linear theory of relativistic Rayleigh Taylor instability in magnetized medium revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03347v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Rayleigh Taylor instability (RTI) occurs at the interface between two fluids of different densities, notably when a heavier fluid sits above a lighter one in an effective gravitational field. This instability is relevant to many astrophysical systems where relativistic effects are significant. We examine the linear theory of relativistic Rayleigh Taylor instability (RRTI) in a magnetized medium, allowing for relativistic fluid motion parallel to the interface. To simplify our derivations, we use an "intermediate frame" where fluids on both sides have the same Lorentz factor. Our analysis yields the dispersion relation for RRTI. We find that the instability occurs when the Atwood number $\mathcal{A}$ = $(\rho_1 h_1 - \rho_2 h_2) / (\rho_1 h_1 + \rho_2 h_2) &gt;0$, without requiring relativistic correction. Relativistic motion increases the effective inertia ($\rho \rightarrow \gamma_*^2 \rho$), weakening the magnetic field's suppression of the instability. In the laboratory frame, the instability growth rate is reduced due to time dilation. These analytical results may inform studies of instabilities in systems such as microquasars, active galactic nuclei, gamma-ray bursts, and radio pulsars.</description>

      <title>A high resolution simulation of protoplanetary disk turbulence driven by the vertical shear instability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03467v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A high resolution fourth-order Pad\'e scheme is used to simulate locally isothermal 3D disk turbulence driven by the vertical shear instability (VSI) using 268.4 M points. In the early non-linear period of axisymmetric VSI, angular momentum transport by vertical jets creates correlated N-shaped radial profiles of perturbation vertical and azimuthal velocity. This implies dominance of positive perturbation vertical vorticity layers and a recently discovered angular momentum staircase with respect to radius ($r$). These features are present in 3D in a weaker form. The 3D flow consists of vertically and azimuthally coherent turbulent shear layers with small vortices with all three components are active. Previously observed large persistent vortices in the interior of the domain driven by the Rossby wave instability are absent. We speculate that this is due to a weaker angular momentum staircase in 3D in the present simulations than in a previous simulation. The turbulent viscosity parameter $\alpha(r)$ increases linearly with $r$. At intermediate resolution, the value of $\alpha(r)$ at mid-radius is close to that of a previous simulation. The specific kinetic energy spectrum with respect to radial wavenumber has a power law region with exponent $-1.84$, close to the value $-2$ expected for shear layers. The spectrum with respect to azimuthal wavenumber has a $-5/3$ region and lacks a $-5$ region reported in an earlier study. Finally, it is found axisymmetric VSI has artifacts at late times, including a very strong angular momentum staircase, which in 3D is present weakly in the upper layers of the disk.</description>

      <title>An iterative scheme to include turbulent diffusion in advective-dominated transport of delayed neutron precursors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03788v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, the Method of Characteristics (MOC) for Delayed Neutron Precursors (DNPs) is used to solve the precursors balance equation with turbulent diffusion. The diffusivity of DNPs, significantly higher than molecular diffusivity, emerges in turbulent flows from the time-averaging of the DNPs mass balance equation. To integrate this effect within the MOC framework, the advection-reaction component of the DNPs balance equation is solved using the MOC, while the diffusive source is computed from the concentration of the previous iteration. The method is validated on a 2D recirculating pipe reactor with high Reynolds number flow, comparing the MOC with diffusion to a standard finite volume (FV) discretization of the fission products balance equation. Additionally, the impact of the diffusivity term on DNP distributions and reactor reactivity is quantified as a function of the turbulent Schmidt number.</description>

      <title>Rigorous Hydrodynamics from Linear Boltzmann Equations and Viscosity-Capillarity Balance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.14174v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An exact closure for hydrodynamic variables is rigorously derived from the linear Boltzmann kinetic equation. Our approach, based on spectral theory, structural properties of eigenvectors and the theory of slow manifolds, allows us to define a unique, optimal reduction in phase space close to equilibrium. The hydrodynamically constrained system induces a modification of entropy that ensures pure viscous dissipation on the hydrodynamic manifold, which is interpreted as a non-local variant of Korteweg's theory of viscosity-capillarity balance. The rigorous hydrodynamic equations are exemplified on the Knudsen minimum paradox in a channel flow.</description>

      <title>Informative and non-informative decomposition of turbulent flow fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.11448v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Not all the information in a turbulent field is relevant for understanding particular regions or variables in the flow. Here, we present a method for decomposing a source field into its informative $\boldsymbol{\Phi}_I(\boldsymbol{x},t)$ and residual $\boldsymbol{\Phi}_R(\boldsymbol{x},t)$ components relative to another target field. The method is referred to as informative and non-informative decomposition (IND). All the necessary information for physical understanding, reduced-order modelling, and control of the target variable is contained in $\boldsymbol{\Phi}_I(\boldsymbol{x},t)$, whereas $\boldsymbol{\Phi}_R(\boldsymbol{x},t)$ offers no substantial utility in these contexts. The decomposition is formulated as an optimisation problem that seeks to maximise the time-lagged mutual information of the informative component with the target variable while minimising the mutual information with the residual component. The method is applied to extract the informative and residual components of the velocity field in a turbulent channel flow, using the wall-shear stress as the target variable. We demonstrate the utility of IND in three scenarios: (i) physical insight of the effect of the velocity fluctuations on the wall-shear stress, (ii) prediction of the wall-shear stress using velocities far from the wall, and (iii) development of control strategies for drag reduction in a turbulent channel flow using opposition control.</description>

      <title>Stabilising nonlinear travelling waves in pipe flow using time-delayed feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15588v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate the first successful non-invasive stabilisation of nonlinear travelling waves in a straight cylindrical pipe using time-delayed feedback control (TDF) working in various symmetry subspaces. By using an approximate linear stability analysis and by analysing the frequency domain effect of the control using transfer functions, we find that solutions with well separated unstable eigenfrequencies can have narrow windows of stabilising time-delays. To mitigate this issue we employ a "multiple time-delayed feedback" (MTDF) approach, where several control terms are included to attenuate a broad range of unstable eigenfrequencies. We implement a gradient descent method to dynamically adjust the gain functions in order to reduce the need for tuning a high dimensional parameter space. This results in a novel control method where the properties of the target state are not needed in advance and speculative guesses can result in robust stabilisation. This enables travelling waves to be stabilised from generic turbulent states and unknown travelling waves to be obtained in highly symmetric subspaces.</description>

      <title>Improving propulsive efficiency using bio-inspired intermittent locomotion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14429v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many swimmers, especially small to medium-sized animals, use intermittent locomotion that differs from continuous swimming of large species. This type of locomotion, called burst-and-coast, is often associated with an energetic advantage. In this work, we investigate the intermittent locomotion inspired by fish locomotion but applied to a propeller. The energy consumption of burst-and-coast cycles is measured and compared to the continuous rotation regime. We show that a substantial drag ratio between the active and passive phases of the motion, as observed in fish, is critical for energy savings. Such a contrast can be obtained using a folding propeller that passively opens and closes as the propeller starts and stops rotating. For this reconfigurable propeller, intermittent propulsion is found to be energetically advantageous, saving up to 24% of the energy required to cruise at a given speed. Using an analytical model, we show that intermittent motion is more efficient than continuous motion when the drag reduction in the coast phase exceeds 65%. For fish-like locomotion, this threshold seems to be closer to 30%. A formal analogy allows us to explain the difference between propeller propulsion and fish locomotion.</description>

      <title>An exact analytical solution for the weakly magnetized flow around an axially symmetric paraboloid, with application to magnetosphere models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.07419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.07419v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Rotationally symmetric bodies with longitudinal cross sections of parabolic shape are frequently used to model astrophysical objects, such as magnetospheres and other blunt objects, immersed in interplanetary or interstellar gas or plasma flows. We discuss a simple formula for the potential flow of an incompressible fluid around an elliptic paraboloid whose axis of symmetry coincides with the direction of incoming flow. Prescribing this flow, we derive an exact analytical solution to the induction equation of ideal magnetohydrodynamics for the case of an initially homogeneous magnetic field of arbitrary orientation being passively advected in this flow. Our solution procedure employs Euler potentials and Cauchy's integral formalism based on the flow's stream function and isochrones. Furthermore, we use a particular renormalization procedure that allows us to generate more general analytical expressions modeling the deformations experienced by arbitrary scalar or vector-valued fields embedded in the flow as they are advected first toward and then past the parabolic obstacle. Finally, both the velocity field and the magnetic field embedded therein are generalized from incompressible to mildly compressible flow, where the associated density distribution is found from Bernoulli's principle.</description>

      <title>On the rotational invariance and hyperbolicity of shallow water moment equations in two dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.07202v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the two-dimensional extension of a recently introduced set of shallow water models based on a regularized moment expansion of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations \cite{kowalski2017moment,koellermeier2020analysis}. We show the rotational invariance of the proposed moment models with two different approaches. The first proof involves the split of the coefficient matrix into the conservative and non-conservative parts and proves the rotational invariance for each part, while the second one relies on the special block structure of the coefficient matrices. With the aid of rotational invariance, the analysis of the hyperbolicity for the moment model in 2D is reduced to the real diagonalizability of the coefficient matrix in 1D. Then we analyze the real diagonalizability by deriving the analytical form of the characteristic polynomial. We find that the moment model in 2D is hyperbolic in most cases and weakly hyperbolic in a degenerate edge case. With a simple modification to the coefficient matrices, we fix this weakly hyperbolicity and propose a new global hyperbolic model. Furthermore, we extend the model to include a more general class of closure relations than the original model and establish that this set of general closure relations retains both rotational invariance and hyperbolicity.</description>

      <title>Self-similar and Universal Dynamics in Drainage of Mobile Soap Films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.03931v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Vertical soap films drain under the influence of gravity, as indicated by the downward motion of colorful horizontal interference fringes observed on their surfaces. In this study conducted with rectangular soap films, we experimentally characterize the descent dynamics of these isothickness fringes and report its self-similar nature. We also show that this result is equivalent to thickness profiles exhibiting a separation of space and time. By integrating new measurements with data from the literature across various conditions, we validate these properties and establish the universality of the dynamics, governed by a single physical scalar. Our findings provide new insights for proposing a drainage model and understanding the mechanism of marginal regeneration at the origin of the process.</description>
