      <title>Stochastic modeling of deterministic laser chaos using generator extended dynamic mode decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05798v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, chaotic phenomena in laser dynamics have attracted much attention to its applied aspects, and a synchronization phenomenon, leader-laggard relationship, in time-delay coupled lasers has been used in reinforcement learning. In the present paper, we discuss the possibility of capturing the essential stochasticity of the leader-laggard relationship; in nonlinear science, it is known that coarse-graining allows one to derive stochastic models from deterministic systems. We derive stochastic models with the aid of the Koopman operator approach, and we clarify that the low-pass filtered data is enough to recover the essential features of the original deterministic chaos, such as peak shifts in the distribution of being the leader and a power-law behavior in the distribution of switching-time intervals. We also confirm that the derived stochastic model works well in reinforcement learning tasks, i.e., multi-armed bandit problems, as with the original laser chaos system.</description>

      <title>All-electrically controlled spintronics in altermagnetic heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05504v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent development of altermagnetic materials, supporting spin splitting without net magnetization, opens new directions for spintronics that are fundamentally distinct from conventional ferromagnetic, antiferromagnetic, or spin-orbit coupling systems. Here we investigate spin-selective quantum transport in heterostructures composed of a normal metal and a two-dimensional $d$-wave altermagnet. We focus on two types of $d$-wave altermagnets, namely, weak and strong altermagnets that support close elliptic and open hyperbolic spin-resolved Fermi surfaces, respectively. Building on these distinct electronic structures, we propose all-electrically controlled spin filter and spin valve devices, where quantum resonant tunneling enables highly spin-polarized conductance tunable via gate voltage and interface transparency. In particular, we find that strong altermagnets allow gate-tunable full spin polarization that is robust against interface scattering and can be reversed by gate control. We further demonstrate that a double-gated spin valve electrically switches between parallel and antiparallel spin configurations, analogous to magnetic junctions but without the need for external magnetic fields. Our results establish both weak and strong altermagnets as promising platforms for realizing magnetic-field-free electrically tunable spintronic functionalities.</description>

      <title>40Gbps Tri-type Quantum Random Number Generator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05627v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traditional quantum random number generators can produce only one type of random number, while the optimal distribution of random numbers for different applications is usually distinct. The typical solution to this challenge is either using different quantum phenomena for different types of random number, or converting one distribution of random numbers to another type. However, the former solution requires multiple hardware systems, while the latter one sacrifices a lot of secure bits. Here, we develop a quantum random number generator that can on-demand produce three distribution types of random numbers at over 60 Gbits/s (Gbps) raw bits by measuring the quantum vacuum noise. After randomness extraction, over 42 Gbps secure bit rate is demonstrated for uniform random numbers, and over 14 Gbps secure bit rate for Gaussian random number. Due to the lack of Rayleigh randomness extraction, only denoised Rayleigh raw bits are generated. Switching between different types of random numbers is achieved in electronics, which does not affect the generation rate. The random numbers pass NIST and Dieharder tests, and are available for various applications, which can be continuously accessed via Cisco Quantum Random Number web service.</description>

      <title>Thickness Dependence of Coercive Field in Ferroelectric Doped-Hafnium Oxide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06222v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ferroelectric hafnium oxide (${HfO_2}$) exhibits a thickness-dependent coercive field $(E_c)$ behavior that deviates from the trends observed in perovskites and the predictions of Janovec-Kay-Dunn (JKD) theory. Experiments reveal that, in thinner $HfO_2$ films ($&lt;100\,nm$), $E_c$ increases with decreasing thickness but at a slower rate than predicted by the JKD theory. In thicker films, $E_c$ saturates and is independent of thickness. Prior studies attributed the thick film saturation to the thickness-independent grain size, which limits the domain growth. However, the reduced dependence in thinner films is poorly understood. In this work, we expound the reduced thickness dependence of $E_c$, attributing it to the anisotropic crystal structure of the polar orthorhombic (o) phase of $HfO_2$. This phase consists of continuous polar layers (CPL) along one in-plane direction and alternating polar and spacer layers (APSL) along the orthogonal direction. The spacer layers decouple adjacent polar layers along APSL, increasing the energy barrier for domain growth compared to CPL direction. As a result, the growth of nucleated domains is confined to a single polar plane in $HfO_2$, forming half-prolate elliptical cylindrical geometry rather than half-prolate spheroid geometry observed in perovskites. By modeling the nucleation and growth energetics of these confined domains, we derive a modified scaling law of $E_c \propto d^{-1/2}$ for $HfO_2$ that deviates from the classical JKD dependence of $E_c \propto d^{-2/3}$. The proposed scaling agrees well with the experimental trends in coercive field across various ferroelectric $HfO_2$ samples.</description>

      <title>Identifying Switching of Antiferromagnets by Spin-Orbit Torques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15885v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Antiferromagnets are promising candidates for ultrafast spintronic applications, leveraging current-induced spin-orbit torques. However, experimentally distinguishing between different switching mechanisms of the staggered magnetization (N\'eel vector) driven by current pulses remains a challenge. In an exemplary study of the collinear antiferromagnetic compound Mn$_2$Au, we demonstrate that slower thermomagnetoelastic effects predominantly govern switching over a wide parameter range. In the regime of short current pulses in the nanosecond range, however, we observe fully N\'eel spin-orbit torque driven switching. We show that this ultrafast mechanism enables the complete directional alignment of the N\'eel vector by current pulses in device structures.</description>

      <title>Levitated macroscopic rotors with 10 hours of free spin at room temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03803v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Low-dissipation rotors with large angular momentum are essential for precision sensing and probing macroscopic quantum phenomena. To date, low dissipation can only be achieved for micro-scale rotors. Here, we report a diamagnetically levitated millimeter-scale rotor exhibiting a measured dissipation rate as low as $3.85\,\mu\mathrm{Hz}$ at room temperature, corresponding to a free spinning duration exceeding 10 hours. The rotor is levitated stably over an axisymmetric permanent magnet trap, and can be driven up to 930 RPM using contactless electrostatic actuation in high vacuum. Leveraging its low damping rate and large angular momentum, we realize a precision gyroscope with a measured sensitivity of $6.5 \times 10^{-3}\ \mathrm{^\circ/s}$ and an estimated thermal-limited stability of $5.7 \times 10^{-7}\ \mathrm{^\circ/\sqrt{h}}$. These results establish diamagnetic levitation as a promising room-temperature platform for high-performance gyroscopes.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast intrinsic optical-to-electrical conversion dynamics in graphene photodetector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.05752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.05752v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Optical-to-electrical (O-E) conversion in graphene is a central phenomenon for realizing anticipated ultrafast and low-power-consumption information technologies. However, revealing its mechanism and intrinsic time scale require uncharted terahertz (THz) electronics and device architectures. Here, we succeeded in resolving O-E conversion processes in high-quality graphene by on-chip electrical readout of ultrafast photothermoelectric current. By suppressing the RC time constant using a resistive zinc oxide top gate, we constructed a gate-tunable graphene photodetector with a bandwidth of up to 220 GHz. By measuring nonlocal photocurrent dynamics, we found that the photocurrent extraction from the electrode is instantaneous without a measurable carrier transit time across several-micrometer-long graphene, following the Shockley-Ramo theorem. The time for photocurrent generation is exceptionally tunable from immediate to &gt; 4 ps, and its origin is identified as Fermi-level-dependent intraband carrier-carrier scattering. Our results bridge the gap between ultrafast optical science and device engineering, accelerating ultrafast graphene optoelectronic applications.</description>

      <title>On-chip transfer of ultrashort graphene plasmon wavepackets using terahertz electronics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.02821v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Steering transport of ultrashort polariton wavepackets is essential for achieving on-chip integrated nanocircuits with tightly confined electromagnetic fields towards ultrafast information processing. However, conventional optical techniques have struggled to integrate the necessary components for transferring polariton signals. Here, we address this challenge by electrically generating, manipulating, and reading out terahertz graphene plasmon-polariton wavepackets on-chip. By injecting an electrical pulse into graphene via an ohmic contact, we achieve coherent conversion of the pulse into a plasmon wavepacket exhibiting a pulse duration of 1.2 ps and extreme three-dimensional spatial confinement within a volume of $2.1 \times 10^{-18} m^3$. We reveal the transport properties of plasmons along graphene ribbons in different dielectric environments, providing a basis for designing graphene plasmonic circuits. Furthermore, we find that the conversion efficiency between the electrical pulses and plasmon wavepackets reaches ~30% thanks to the absence of a momentum mismatch. With unprecedented controllability, our platform represents a significant advance in on-chip handling of plasmonic signals in various van der Waals heterostructures.</description>

      <title>Unlocking the hybrid piezo and pyroelectric nanogenerators performance by SiO2 nanowires confinement in poly(vinylidene fluoride)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01580v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report on the development of a novel flexible piezo/pyro-electric nanogenerator (PPNG) that combines a uniform film of poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) infiltrated over vertically supported SiO2 nanowires (NWs) to enhance both piezoelectric and pyroelectric energy harvesting capabilities. The synthetic procedure involves a low-temperature multi-step approach, including the soft-template formation of SiO2 NWs on a flexible substrate, followed by the infiltration of a PVDF thin film (TF). The plasma-enabled fabrication of SiO2 NWs facilitated vertical alignment and precise control over the surface microstructure, density, and thickness of the confined nanostructures. These strategic structural systems promote the development of the most favourable electroactive \b{eta}- and {\gamma}-phases in the PVDF matrix. Notably, the electrical poling plays a major role in aligning the random dipoles of the PVDF macromolecular chain in a more ordered fashion to nucleate the amplified electroactive phases. As a proof-of-concept, the fabricated PPNG exhibited a significant improvement in the instantaneous piezoelectric output power density (P), ~ 9-fold amplification relative to its bare PVDF TF counterpart. Analogously, the pyroelectric coefficient (p) demonstrated a 4-fold superior performance with referenced PVDF TF based PPNG. Thus, the engineered system of SiO2 NWs@PVDF comprising PPNG offers a promising pathway toward multisource energy harvesting capabilities through efficient energy transduction at mechanical excitation frequencies of 10-12 Hz and across a temperature difference ({\Delta}T) of 9 to 22 K.</description>
