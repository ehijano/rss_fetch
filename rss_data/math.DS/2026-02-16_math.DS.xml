      <title>Sharkovskiis theorem under small random perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12397v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a Sharkovskii-type theorem for a class of discrete random dynamical systems via the random Conley index. Using the continuation property of the Conley index, we extend classical forcing results to random systems obtained from small random perturbations of one-dimensional maps. In contrast to earlier measure-theoretic results, which are typically subject to an inherent period-doubling ambiguity (realizing period $n$ or $2n$), our topological approach allows us to detect random periodic points and orbits with precise minimal periods. This yields realisation results for arbitrary finite tails of the Sharkovskii ordering. These results are illustrated by constructing random periodic orbits for perturbed versions of the tent map and the logistic map.</description>

      <title>Periodic Shadowing for Set-Valued Maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12399v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study shadowing-type properties for set-valued dynamical systems. In particular, we investigate the periodic shadowing property and its relationship with expansivity and chain transitivity. We establish that for positively expansive set-valued maps on compact metric spaces, the shadowing property implies the periodic shadowing property. Furthermore, we show that for chain transitive maps, periodic shadowing implies both shadowing and topological transitivity. We also present a general construction of set-valued maps with shadowing arising from single-valued systems admitting an isometric involution. Several examples, including systems from symbolic dynamics, are provided to illustrate the theory.</description>

      <title>Metastability of random maps: a resolvent approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.12400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a general framework to study the metastability of random perturbations of dynamical systems. It integrates techniques from the theory of Markov processes, in particular the resolvent approach to metastability, with the spectral analysis of transfer operators associated to the dynamics. The proposed framework is applied to study the metastability of one-dimensional dynamical systems generated by a map randomly perturbed by sub-Gaussian noise.</description>

      <title>Effects of Heterogeneity in Two-Cell Feedforward Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the need for higher performance from biological and electronic sensors continues to outpace current technologies, new strategies for designing, developing, and implementing novel sensor systems are emerging. A recently introduced feedforward network-based approach can simultaneously enhance a signal while steering a radiating beam in radio frequency communication systems. Furthermore, the approach is also model-independent, thus making it suitable for other applications. In this work, we aim to understand the effects of inhomogeneities in feedforward arrays, which are inevitable in real-world implementations. We investigate a collection of two-cell feedforward networks composed of pitch-fork cells and Stuart-Landau oscillators and quantify the effects of parameter inhomogeneities using system reduction, analytical and computational bifurcation analyses, and a singularity theory approach. Contrary to common intuition, inhomogeneity in the excitation parameter can be exploited to enhance the network output growth rate. While frequency inhomogeneity in Stuart-Landau networks primarily has an adverse effect on signal amplification, phase locking persists over a surprisingly broad range of inhomogeneity.</description>

      <title>On a stable torus in a 3D system with a saddle-focus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12451v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a conceptual model for the onset of a stable torus near a saddle-focus equilibrium. This bifurcation scenario is typical of slow-fast systems that generate elliptic bursting in a variety of neuronal models in mathematical neuroscience. Variants of the model also capture other dynamical regimes recurring in a neighborhood of the saddle-focus. We also discuss homoclinic bifurcations for which the model assumptions are feasible.</description>

      <title>State dependent delay differential equations with distributed memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12467v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate state dependent delay differential equations with distributed memory, combining discrete state dependent delays and a convolution type memory operator. Under Lipschitz type assumptions on the delay, kernel, and nonlinear term, we establish local well posedness using a fixed point argument in a Banach space of histories. The distributed memory operator is shown to be locally Lipschitz, ensuring existence and uniqueness. As a benchmark, we analyze a logistic model with a Gamma distributed memory kernel of order two. The convolution term is reduced to a finite dimensional form, yielding an explicit characteristic equation and closed form Hopf bifurcation threshold and frequency. The results show that higher order memory kernels may induce oscillatory dynamics, unlike purely exponential memory, and provide a rigorous framework for stability and bifurcation analysis in delay systems with state dependent memory.</description>

      <title>Nonholonomic billiards and bounded motion in cylinders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A widely used mathematical model for the bouncing motion of an ideally elastic ball -- referred to in previous work by the first two authors and collaborators as a {\em no-slip billiard} system -- exhibits some notable dynamical behavior that is not well-understood. For example, under certain initial conditions, the axial component of the position of the center of the ball moving inside a vertical solid cylinder under constant gravitational force does not accelerate downward as might be expected but remains bounded. There is not as yet, as far as we know, any analytical study of the bouncing ball dynamics, under gravity, in general cylinders (not necessarily having a circular cross-section) in $\mathbb{R}^3$. In this paper, we propose an approach by comparing the no-slip system with a smooth approximation of it that we call {\em nonholonomic billiards}. It consists of a $4$-dimensional ball rolling on the solid $3$-dimensional cylinder.
  We first review earlier work on no-slip billiards and their connection with nonholonomic (rolling) systems, explain how nonholonomic billiards approximate the no-slip kind (after work by the first two authors and B. Zhao), and illustrate the relationship with a few numerical case studies that demonstrate the utility of the soft (nonholonomic) system as a helpful tool for exploring the dynamics of no-slip billiard systems.</description>

      <title>Turing patterns in Matrix-Weighted Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13080v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion-driven instability is a fundamental mechanism underlying pattern formation in spatially extended systems. In almost all existing works, diffusion across the links of the underlying network is modeled through scalar weights, possibly complemented by cross-diffusion terms that are homogeneous across links. In this work, we investigate the emergence of Turing patterns on Matrix Weighted Networks (MWNs), a recently introduced framework in which each edge is associated with a matrix weight. Focusing on the class of coherent MWNs, we provide a novel characterization of coherence in terms of node-dependent orthonormal matrices, showing that link transformations can be written as relative rotations between nodes. This representation allows us to deal with coherent MWNs of any size and to introduce an orthonormal change of variables capable to reduce diffusion on a coherent MWN to diffusion on a standard weighted network with scalar weights. Building on this, we extend the classical Turing instability analysis to MWNs and derive the conditions under which a homogeneous equilibrium of the local dynamics loses stability due to matrix-weighted diffusion. Our results show how network topology, scalar weights, and inter-node transformations jointly shape pattern formation, and provide a constructive framework to analyze and design Turing patterns on matrix-weighted and higher-order networked systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03586v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study (topological) pseudo-Anosov flows from the perspective of the associated group actions on their orbit spaces and boundary at infinity. We extend the definition of Anosov-like action from [BFM22] from the transitive to the general non-transitive context and show that one can recover the basic sets of a flow, the Smale order on basic sets, and their essential features, from such general group actions. Using these tools, we prove that a pseudo-Anosov flow in a $3$ manifold is entirely determined by the associated action of the fundamental group on the boundary at infinity of its orbit space. We also give a proof that any topological pseudo-Anosov flow on an atoroidal 3-manifold is necessarily transitive, and prove that density of periodic orbits implies transitivity, in the topological rather than smooth case.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we study substitutions on $A^\mathbb{Z}$ where $A$ is a finite alphabet. We precisely characterize the minimal components of substitution subshifts, give an optimal bound for their number and describe their dynamics. The explicitness of these results provides a method to algorithmically compute and count the minimal components of a given substitution subshift.</description>

      <title>Pseudo-Anosov Flows: A Plane Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15375v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this text we (re)-tell the theory of pseudo-Anosov flows on 3-manifolds with the orbit space as the central character; via a streamlined framework called {\em Anosov-like group actions}. This brings a simplified and unified perspective, and allows for the import of tools from 1- and 2-dimensional topological dynamics. In so doing, we are able to give a relatively efficient presentation (or re-presentation) of foundational results in the field which appeared over several decades and many papers.
  We hope that the reader, whether a beginning or more advanced topologist or dynamicist, finds this a welcoming invitation to the rich theory of pseudo-Anosov flows.</description>

      <title>Parametrized complexity of relations between multidimensional subshifts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24343v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the parametrized complexity of fundamental relations between multidimensional subshifts, such as equality, conjugacy, inclusion, and embedding, for subshifts of finite type (SFTs) and effective subshifts. We build on previous work of E. Jeandel and P. Vanier on the complexity of these relations as two-input problems, by fixing one subshift as parameter and taking the other subshift as input. We study the impact of various dynamical properties related to periodicity, minimality, finite type, etc. on the computational properties of the parameter subshift, which reveals interesting differences and asymmetries.
  Among other notable results, we find choices of parameter that reach the maximum difficulty for each problem; we find nontrivial decidable problems for multidimensional SFT, where most properties are undecidable; and we find connections with recent work relating having computable language and being minimal for some property, showing in particular that this property may not always be chosen conjugacy-invariant.</description>

      <title>First variation of flat traces on negatively curved surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12230v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a closed negatively curved surface $(X,g)$ the flat trace of the geodesic Koopman operators $V_g^\tau f=f\circ G_g^\tau$ is the periodic orbit distribution \[ \mathrm{Tr}^{\flat} V_{g}(\tau)=\sum_{\gamma}\frac{L_\gamma^{\#}}{\lvert\det(I-P_\gamma)\rvert}\,\delta(\tau-L_\gamma), \qquad \tau&gt;0, \] supported on the length spectrum and weighted by the linearized Poincar\'e maps $P_\gamma$. For a smooth family of negatively curved metrics $g_t$ we compute the first variation $\partial_t\vert_{0}\,\mathrm{Tr}^{\flat} V_{g_t}$ as a distribution. At an isolated length $\ell$ the leading singularity is a multiple of $\delta'(\tau-\ell)$, and its coefficient is an explicit linear functional of the length variations $\dot L_{\gamma^m}$ of the closed geodesics with $L_{\gamma^m}=\ell$. This transport coefficient forces the marked lengths to be locally constant along any deformation with constant flat trace. As an application, if $\mathrm{Tr}^{\flat} V_{g_t}=\mathrm{Tr}^{\flat} V_{g_0}$ for all $t$ then $g_t$ is isometric to $g_0$ for all $t$. Together with Sunada-type constructions of non isometric pairs with equal flat traces, this shows that the flat trace is globally non-unique yet locally complete along smooth families.</description>

      <title>Counting geodesics on expander surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.07938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.07938v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study properties of typical closed geodesics on expander surfaces of high genus, i.e. closed hyperbolic surfaces with a uniform spectral gap of the Laplacian. Under an additional systole lower bound assumption, we show almost every geodesic of length much greater than $\sqrt{g}\log g$ is non-simple. And we prove almost every closed geodesic of length much greater than $g (\log g)^2$ is filling, i.e. each component of the complement of the geodesic is a topological disc. Our results apply to Weil-Petersson random surfaces, random covers of a fixed surface, and Brooks-Makover random surfaces, since these models are known to have uniform spectral gap asymptotically almost surely.
  Our proof technique involves adapting Margulis' counting strategy to work at low length scales.</description>

      <title>On Lagrangian formulations for (ir)reducible mixed-antisymmetric higher integer spin fields in Minkowski spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.09490v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We extend the results of Lagrangian formulations study to construct gauge-invariant Lagrangians for (ir)reducible integer higher-spin massless and massive representations of the Poincare group with a Young tableau $Y[\hat{s}_1,\hat{s}_2,\hat{s}_3]$ in $d$-dimensional flat space-time (as the probable candidates to describe the Dark Matter problem beyond the SM). These particles are described within a metric-like formulation by tensor fields with 3 groups of antisymmetric Lorentz indices $\Phi_{\mu^1[{\hat{s}_1}],\mu^2[{\hat{s}_2}], \mu^3[{\hat{s}_3}]}$ on a basis of the
  BRST method with complete, $Q$, and incomplete, $Q_c$, BRST operators. We found unconstrained (with $Q$) and constrained (with $Q_c$ and off-shell BRST invariant holonomic constraints) gauge Lagrangian formulations with different configuration spaces and reducibility stages. The deformation procedure to construct interacting gauge model with mixed-antisymmetric fields is proposed.</description>

      <title>On the Ginzburg-Landau approximation for quasilinear pattern forming reaction-diffusion-advection systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16145v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that the Ginzburg-Landau equation correctly predicts the dynamics of quasilinear pattern-forming reaction-diffusion-advection systems, close to the first instability. We present a simple theorem which is easily applicable for such systems and relies on key maximal regularity results. The theorem is applied to the Gray-Scott-Klausmeier vegetation-water interaction model and its application to general reaction-diffusion-advection systems is discussed.</description>

      <title>Selfless reduced $C^{*}$-algebras of linear groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10616v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is shown that the reduced C*-algebra of a nontrivial linear group $\Gamma&lt;GL_{d}(k)$ with trivial amenable radical is selfless. Thus selflessness and simplicity coincide for reduced C*-algebras of linear groups. Similar results are obtained for twisted reduced group C*-algebra.</description>
