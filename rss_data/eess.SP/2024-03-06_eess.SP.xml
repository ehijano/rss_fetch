      <title>A Tunable Reflection Surface with Independently Variable Phase and Slope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) is an essential component in the architecture of the next generation of wireless communication systems. An RIS is deployed to provide a controllability to the multi-path environment between the transmitter and the receiver, which becomes critical when the line-of-sight signal between them is blocked. In this work, we design an electrically tunable linearly polarized RIS at 2.5 GHz that yields a controllable reflection phase and phase-frequency slope; in other words, we add tunability of the phase-frequency slope to the tunability of the resonance center frequency. The proposed design consists of two layers of unit cells placed over a ground plane, with dog-bone-shaped elements in the top layer and patch elements in the bottom layer. Each patch and dog-bone element is loaded with a varactor, whose reverse bias voltage is controlled to provide a phase-frequency profile with a slope value of 9 degrees/MHz or 0.95 degrees/MHz, and a phase shift range of 320 degrees.</description>

      <title>Deep Cooperation in ISAC System: Resource, Node and Infrastructure Perspectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02565v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the mobile communication system evolving into 6th-generation (6G), the Internet of Everything (IoE) is becoming reality, which connects human, big data and intelligent machines to support the intelligent decision making, reconfiguring the traditional industries and human life. The applications of IoE require not only pure communication capability, but also high-accuracy and large-scale sensing capability. With the emerging integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) technique, exploiting the mobile communication system with multi-domain resources, multiple network elements, and large-scale infrastructures to realize cooperative sensing is a crucial approach to satisfy the requirements of high-accuracy and large-scale sensing in IoE. In this article, the deep cooperation in ISAC system including three perspectives is investigated. In the microscopic perspective, namely, within a single node, the cooperation at the resource-level is performed to improve sensing accuracy by fusing the sensing information carried in the time-frequency-space-code multi-domain resources. In the mesoscopic perspective, the sensing accuracy could be improved through the cooperation of multiple nodes including Base Station (BS), User Equipment (UE), and Reconfigurable Intelligence Surface (RIS), etc. In the macroscopic perspective, the massive number of infrastructures from the same operator or different operators could perform cooperative sensing to extend the sensing coverage and improve the sensing continuity. This article may provide a deep and comprehensive view on the cooperative sensing in ISAC system to enhance the performance of sensing, supporting the applications of IoE.</description>

      <title>Human Activity Recognition with Low-Resolution Infrared Array Sensor Using Semi-supervised Cross-domain Neural Networks for Indoor Environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low-resolution infrared-based human activity recognition (HAR) attracted enormous interests due to its low-cost and private. In this paper, a novel semi-supervised crossdomain neural network (SCDNN) based on 8 $\times$ 8 low-resolution infrared sensor is proposed for accurately identifying human activity despite changes in the environment at a low-cost. The SCDNN consists of feature extractor, domain discriminator and label classifier. In the feature extractor, the unlabeled and minimal labeled target domain data are trained for domain adaptation to achieve a mapping of the source domain and target domain data. The domain discriminator employs the unsupervised learning to migrate data from the source domain to the target domain. The label classifier obtained from training the source domain data improves the recognition of target domain activities due to the semi-supervised learning utilized in training the target domain data. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves 92.12\% accuracy for recognition of activities in the target domain by migrating the source and target domains. The proposed approach adapts superior to cross-domain scenarios compared to the existing deep learning methods, and it provides a low-cost yet highly adaptable solution for cross-domain scenarios.</description>

      <title>Over-The-Air Double-Threshold Deep Learner for Jamming Detection in 5G RF domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02645v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the evolution of 5G wireless communications, the Synchronization Signal Block (SSB) plays a critical role in the synchronization of devices and accessibility of services. However, due to the predictable nature of SSB transmission, including the Primary and Secondary Synchronization Signals (PSS and SSS), jamming attacks are critical threats. By leveraging RF domain knowledge, this work presents a novel deep learning-based technique for detecting jammers in 5G networks. Unlike the existing jamming detection algorithms that mostly rely on network parameters, we introduce a double threshold deep learning jamming detector by focusing on the SSB. The detection method is focused on RF domain features and improves the robustness of the network without requiring integration with the pre-existing network infrastructure. By integrating a preprocessing block that extracts PSS correlation and energy per null resource elements (EPNRE) characteristics, our method distinguishes between normal and jammed received signals with high precision. Additionally, by incorporation of Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT), the efficacy of training and detection are optimized. A double threshold double Deep Neural Network (DT-DDNN) is also introduced to the architecture complemented by a deep cascade learning model to increase the sensitivity of the model to variations of signal to jamming noise ratio (SJNR). Results show that the proposed method achieves 96.4% detection rate in extra low jamming power, i.e., SJNR between 15 to 30 dB which outperforms the single threshold DNN design with 86.0% detection rate and unprocessed IQ sample DNN design with 83.2% detection rate. Ultimately, performance of DT-DDNN is validated through the analysis of real 5G signals obtained from a practical testbed, demonstrating a strong alignment with the simulation results.</description>

      <title>Learning at the Speed of Wireless: Online Real-Time Learning for AI-Enabled MIMO in NextG</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02651v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integration of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) into the air interface has been envisioned as a key technology for next-generation (NextG) cellular networks. At the air interface, multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) and its variants such as multi-user MIMO (MU-MIMO) and massive/full-dimension MIMO have been key enablers across successive generations of cellular networks with evolving complexity and design challenges. Initiating active investigation into leveraging AI/ML tools to address these challenges for MIMO becomes a critical step towards an AI-enabled NextG air interface. At the NextG air interface, the underlying wireless environment will be extremely dynamic with operation adaptations performed on a sub-millisecond basis by MIMO operations such as MU-MIMO scheduling and rank/link adaptation. Given the enormously large number of operation adaptation possibilities, we contend that online real-time AI/ML-based approaches constitute a promising paradigm. To this end, we outline the inherent challenges and offer insights into the design of such online real-time AI/ML-based solutions for MIMO operations. An online real-time AI/ML-based method for MIMO-OFDM channel estimation is then presented, serving as a potential roadmap for developing similar techniques across various MIMO operations in NextG.</description>

      <title>An Optimal Baseband Delay-Based Beam Squint Removal Scheme across a Range of Steering Angles for Digital Wideband Beamformers in Radars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02679v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is an attempt to mitigate the beam squint happening due to frequency-dependent phase shifts in the wideband beamforming scenario, specifically in radar applications. The estimation of the direction of arrival is significant for precise target detection in radars. The undesirable beam squint effect due to the phase shift-only mechanism in conventional phased array systems, which becomes exacerbated when dealing with wide bandwidth signals, is analyzed for a large set of steering angles in this paper. An optimum baseband delay combined with the phase shift technique is proposed for wideband radar beamforming to mitigate beam squint effectively. This technique has been demonstrated to function properly with 1-GHz carrier frequency for signals with wide bandwidths of up to +/-250MHz and for steering angles ranging from 0 to 90 degrees.</description>

      <title>STAR-RIS Assisted Wireless-Powered and Backscattering Mobile Edge Computing Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02854v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wireless powered and backscattering mobile edge computing (WPB-MEC) network is a novel network paradigm to supply energy supplies and computing resource to wireless sensors (WSs). However, its performance is seriously affected by severe attenuations and inappropriate assumptions of infinite computing capability at the hybrid access point (HAP). To address the above issues, in this paper, we propose a simultaneously transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent surface (STAR-RIS) aided scheme for boosting the performance of WPB-MEC network under the constraint of finite computing capability. Specifically, energy-constrained WSs are able to offload tasks actively or passively from them to the HAP. In this process, the STAR-RIS is utilized to improve the quantity of harvested energy and strengthen the offloading efficiency by adapting its operating protocols. We then maximize the sum computational bits (SCBs) under the finite computing capability constraint. To handle the solving challenges, we first present interesting results in closed-form and then design a block coordinate descent (BCD) based algorithm, ensuring a near-optimal solution. Finally, simulation results are provided to confirm that our proposed scheme can improve the SCBs by 9.9 times compared to the local computing only scheme.</description>

      <title>DIFNet: SAR RFI suppression based on domain invariant features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02894v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Synthetic aperture radar is a high-resolution two-dimensional imaging radar, however, during the imaging process, SAR is susceptible to intentional and unintentional interference, with radio frequency interference (RFI) being the most common type, leading to a severe degradation in image quality. Although inpainting networks have achieved excellent results, their generalization is unclear, and whether they still work effectively in cross-sensor experiments needs further verification. Through time-frequency analysis of interference signals, we find that interference holds domain invariant features between different sensors. Therefore, this paper reconstructs the loss function and extracts the domain invariant features to improve the generalization. Ultimately, this paper proposes a SAR RFI suppression method based on domain invariant features, and embeds the RFI suppression into SAR imaging process. Compared to traditional notch filtering methods, the proposed approach not only removes interference but also effectively preserves strong scattering targets. Compared to PISNet, our method can extract domain invariant features and holds better generalization ability, and even in the cross-sensor experiment, our method can still achieve excellent results.</description>

      <title>Loss Design for Single-carrier Joint Communication and Neural Network-based Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02929v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We evaluate the influence of multi-snapshot sensing and varying signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) on the overall performance of neural network (NN)-based joint communication and sensing (JCAS) systems. To enhance the training behavior, we decouple the loss functions from the respective SNR values and the number of sensing snapshots, using bounds of the sensing performance. Pre-processing is done through conventional sensing signal processing steps on the inputs to the sensing NN. The proposed method outperforms classical algorithms, such as a Neyman-Pearson-based power detector for object detection and ESPRIT for angle of arrival (AoA) estimation for quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) at low SNRs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02992v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An integrate-and-fire time-encoding machine (IF-TEM) is an effective asynchronous sampler that translates amplitude information into non-uniform time sequences. In this work, we propose a novel Adaptive IF-TEM (AIF-TEM) approach. This design dynamically adjusts the TEM's sensitivity to changes in the input signal's amplitude and frequency in real-time. We provide a comprehensive analysis of AIF-TEM's oversampling and distortion properties. By the adaptive adjustments, AIF-TEM as we show can achieve significant performance improvements in practical finite regime, in terms of sampling rate-distortion. We demonstrate empirically that in the scenarios tested AIF-TEM outperforms classical IF-TEM and traditional Nyquist (i.e., periodic) sampling methods for band-limited signals. In terms of Mean Square Error (MSE), the reduction reaches at least 12dB (fixing the oversampling rate).</description>

      <title>Neural Codebook Design for Network Beam Management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03053v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Obtaining accurate and timely channel state information (CSI) is a fundamental challenge for large antenna systems. Mobile systems like 5G use a beam management framework that joins the initial access, beamforming, CSI acquisition, and data transmission. The design of codebooks for these stages, however, is challenging due to their interrelationships, varying array sizes, and site-specific channel and user distributions. Furthermore, beam management is often focused on single-sector operations while ignoring the overarching network- and system-level optimization. In this paper, we proposed an end-to-end learned codebook design algorithm, network beamspace learning (NBL), that captures and optimizes codebooks to mitigate interference while maximizing the achievable performance with extremely large hybrid arrays. The proposed algorithm requires limited shared information yet designs codebooks that outperform traditional codebooks by over 10dB in beam alignment and achieve more than 25% improvements in network spectral efficiency.</description>

      <title>Distributed MIMO Measurements for Integrated Communication and Sensing in an Industrial Environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02430v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many concepts for future generations of wireless communication systems use coherent processing of signals from many distributed antennas. The aim is to improve communication reliability, capacity, and energy efficiency and provide possibilities for new applications through integrated communication and sensing. The large bandwidths available in the higher bands have inspired much work regarding sensing in the mmWave and sub-THz bands; however, the sub-6 GHz cellular bands will still be the main provider of wide cellular coverage due to the more favorable propagation conditions. In this paper, we present a measurement system and results of sub-6 GHz distributed MIMO measurements performed in an industrial environment. From the measurements, we evaluated the diversity for both large-scale and small-scale fading and characterized the link reliability. We also analyzed the possibility of multistatic sensing and positioning of users in the environment, with the initial results showing a mean-square error below 20 cm on the estimated position. Further, the results clearly showed that new channel models are needed that are spatially consistent and deal with the nonstationary channel properties among the antennas.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02529v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Revealing expressions of secret-key capacity (SKC) based on data sets from Gaussian MIMO channel probing are presented. It is shown that Maurer's upper and lower bounds on SKC coincide when the used data sets are produced from one-way channel probing. As channel coherence time increases, SKC in bits per probing channel use is always lower bounded by a positive value unless eavesdropper's observations are noiseless, which is unlike SKC solely based on reciprocal channels.</description>

      <title>Spatially Non-Stationary XL-MIMO Channel Estimation: A Three-Layer Generalized Approximate Message Passing Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02633v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, channel estimation problem for extremely large-scale multi-input multi-output (XL-MIMO) systems is investigated with the considerations of the spherical wavefront effect and the spatially non-stationary (SnS) property. Due to the diversities of SnS characteristics among different propagation paths, the concurrent channel estimation of multiple paths becomes intractable. To address this challenge, we propose a two-phase channel estimation scheme. In the first phase, the angles of departure (AoDs) on the user side are estimated, and a carefully designed pilot transmission scheme enables the decomposition of the received signal from different paths. In the second phase, the subchannel estimation corresponding to different paths is formulated as a three-layer Bayesian inference problem. Specifically, the first layer captures block sparsity in the angular domain, the second layer promotes SnS property in the antenna domain, and the third layer decouples the subchannels from the observed signals. To efficiently facilitate Bayesian inference, we propose a novel three-layer generalized approximate message passing (TL-GAMP) algorithm based on structured variational massage passing and belief propagation rules. Simulation results validate the convergence and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, showcasing its robustness to different channel scenarios.</description>

      <title>Time Weaver: A Conditional Time Series Generation Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02682v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Imagine generating a city's electricity demand pattern based on weather, the presence of an electric vehicle, and location, which could be used for capacity planning during a winter freeze. Such real-world time series are often enriched with paired heterogeneous contextual metadata (weather, location, etc.). Current approaches to time series generation often ignore this paired metadata, and its heterogeneity poses several practical challenges in adapting existing conditional generation approaches from the image, audio, and video domains to the time series domain. To address this gap, we introduce Time Weaver, a novel diffusion-based model that leverages the heterogeneous metadata in the form of categorical, continuous, and even time-variant variables to significantly improve time series generation. Additionally, we show that naive extensions of standard evaluation metrics from the image to the time series domain are insufficient. These metrics do not penalize conditional generation approaches for their poor specificity in reproducing the metadata-specific features in the generated time series. Thus, we innovate a novel evaluation metric that accurately captures the specificity of conditional generation and the realism of the generated time series. We show that Time Weaver outperforms state-of-the-art benchmarks, such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), by up to 27% in downstream classification tasks on real-world energy, medical, air quality, and traffic data sets.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we consider the time-varying channel estimation in millimeter wave (mmWave) multiple-input multiple-output MIMO systems with hybrid beamforming architectures. Different from the existing contributions that considered single-carrier mmWave systems with high mobility, the wideband orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) system is considered in this work. To solve the channel estimation problem under channel double selectivity, we propose a pilot transmission scheme based on 5G OFDM, and the received signals are formed as a fourth-order tensor, which fits the low-rank CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (CP) model. By further exploring the Vandermonde structure of factor matrix, a tensor-subspace decomposition based channel estimation method is proposed to solve the CP decomposition, where the uniqueness condition is analyzed. Based on the decomposed factor matrices, the channel parameters, including angles of arrival/departure, delays, channel gains and Doppler shifts are estimated, and the Cram\'{e}r-Rao bound (CRB) results are derived as performance metrics. Simulation results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method over other benchmarks. Furthermore, the channel estimation methods are tested based on the channel parameters generated by Wireless InSites, and simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed method in practical scenarios.</description>

      <title>Opportunistic User Scheduling for Secure RIS-aided Wireless Communications</title>

Abstract: In this paper, we provide expressions for the secrecy outage probability (SOP) for suboptimal and optimal opportunistic scheduling schemes in a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) aided system with multiple eavesdroppers in approximate closed form. A suboptimal scheduling (SS) scheme is analyzed, which is used when the channel state information (CSI) of the eavesdropping links is unavailable, and the optimal scheduling (OS) scheme is also analyzed, which is used when the global CSI is available. For each scheme, we provide a simplified expression for the SOP in the high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime to demonstrate its behavior as a function of the key system parameters. At high SNR, the SOP saturates to a constant level which decreases exponentially with the number of RIS elements in the SS scheme and with the product of the number of RIS elements and the number of users in the OS scheme. We compare the performance of the opportunistic user scheduling schemes with that of a non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) based scheduling scheme which chooses a pair of users in each time slot for scheduling and we show that the opportunistic schemes outperform the NOMA-based scheme. We also derive a closed-form expression for the SOP of a decode-and-forward (DF) relay-aided scheduling scheme in order to compare it with that of the RIS-aided system. It is found that the RIS-aided system outperforms the relay-aided systems when the number of RIS elements is sufficiently large. An increased number of RIS elements is required to outperform the relay-aided system at higher operating frequencies.</description>

      <title>Low Complexity Channel Estimation for RIS-Assisted THz Systems with Beam Split</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03015v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To support extremely high data rates, reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted terahertz (THz) communication is considered to be a promising technology for future sixth-generation networks. However, due to the typical employment of hybrid beamforming architecture in THz systems, as well as the passive nature of RIS which lacks the capability to process pilot signals, obtaining channel state information (CSI) is facing significant challenges. To accurately estimate the cascaded channel, we propose a novel low-complexity channel estimation scheme, which includes three steps. Specifically, we first estimate full CSI within a small subset of subcarriers (SCs). Then, we acquire angular information at base station and RIS based on the full CSI. Finally, we derive spatial directions and recover full-CSI for the remaining SCs. Theoretical analysis and simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme can achieve superior performance in terms of normalized mean-square-error and exhibit a lower computational complexity compared with the existing algorithms.</description>

      <title>Deep-Learned Compression for Radio-Frequency Signal Classification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.03150v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Next-generation cellular concepts rely on the processing of large quantities of radio-frequency (RF) samples. This includes Radio Access Networks (RAN) connecting the cellular front-end based on software defined radios (SDRs) and a framework for the AI processing of spectrum-related data. The RF data collected by the dense RAN radio units and spectrum sensors may need to be jointly processed for intelligent decision making. Moving large amounts of data to AI agents may result in significant bandwidth and latency costs. We propose a deep learned compression (DLC) model, HQARF, based on learned vector quantization (VQ), to compress the complex-valued samples of RF signals comprised of 6 modulation classes. We are assessing the effects of HQARF on the performance of an AI model trained to infer the modulation class of the RF signal. Compression of narrow-band RF samples for the training and off-the-site inference will allow for an efficient use of the bandwidth and storage for non-real-time analytics, and for a decreased delay in real-time applications. While exploring the effectiveness of the HQARF signal reconstructions in modulation classification tasks, we highlight the DLC optimization space and some open problems related to the training of the VQ embedded in HQARF.</description>

      <title>Remote sensing of soil moisture using Rydberg atoms and satellite signals of opportunity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03175v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spaceborne radar remote sensing of the earth system is essential to study natural and man-made changes in the ecosystem, water and energy cycles, weather and air quality, sea level, and surface dynamics. A major challenge with current approaches is the lack of broad spectrum tunability due to narrow band microwave electronics, that limit systems to specific science variable retrievals. This results in a significant limitation in studying dynamic coupled earth system processes such as surface and subsurface hydrology, where broad spectrum radar remote sensing is needed to sense multiple variables simultaneously. Rydberg atomic sensors are highly sensitive broad-spectrum quantum detectors that can be dynamically tuned to cover micro-to-millimeter waves with no requirement for band-specific electronics. Rydberg atomic sensors can use existing transmitted signals such as navigation and communication satellites to enable remote sensing. We demonstrate remote sensing of soil moisture, an important earth system variable, via ground-based radar reflectometry with Rydberg atomic systems. To do this, we sensitize the atoms to XM satellite radio signals and use signal correlations to demonstrate use of these satellite signals for remote sensing of soil moisture. Our approach provides a step towards satellite-based broad-spectrum Rydberg atomic remote sensing.</description>

      <title>Sequence Selection with Dispersion-Aware Metric for Long-Haul Transmission Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.13780v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a novel sign-dependent metric: the energy dispersion index (EDI) of sequences that endured chromatic dispersion, denoted as D-EDI, which exhibits a more accurate opposite variations with the transmission performance compared to the standard EDI metric. Then, by applying D-EDI and EDI to the sequence selection (SS) process, %with enumerative sphere shaping (ESS) for $M$-QAM signaling, we present two signaling approaches denoted as D-SS and E-SS respectively. These approaches are designed to minimize rate loss and enhance transmission performance in nonlinear optical fiber transmission systems, catering to both short-distance and long-haul scenarios. With enumerative sphere shaping (ESS) as distribution matcher (DM), our simulation results reveal significant performance gains over ESS without sequence selection (SS), with improvements up to $0.4$~bits/4D-symbol. These improvements were observed over a $205$-km single-span standard single mode fiber link in WDM transmission, with five dual-polarization channels, each operating at a net rate of $400$~Gbit/s. Furthermore, we demonstrate that D-SS surpasses ESS without SS by $0.03$~bits/4D-symbol in achievable information rate over a $30\times80$~km link in a single-wavelength, with 8 discrete multi-band (DMB) transmission, and an $880$~Gbit/s net rate. Notably, our proposed D-SS scheme achieves similar performance to a sequence selection based on a full split-step Fourier method (SSFM) simulation and it consistently delivers throughput enhancements across various block lengths and selected sequence lengths.</description>

      <title>Fabrication uncertainty guided design optimization of a photonic crystal cavity by using Gaussian processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.09420v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a fabrication uncertainty aware and robust design optimization approach that can be used to obtain robust design estimates for nonlinear, nonconvex, and expensive model functions. It is founded on Gaussian processes and a Monte Carlo sampling procedure, and assumes knowledge about the uncertainties associated with a manufacturing process. The approach itself is iterative. First, a large parameter domain is sampled in a coarse fashion. This coarse sampling is used primarily to determine smaller candidate regions to investigate in a second, more refined sampling pass. This finer step is used to obtain an estimate of the expected performance of the found design parameter under the assumed manufacturing uncertainties. We apply the presented approach to the robust optimization of the Purcell enhancement of a photonic crystal nanobeam cavity. We obtain a predicted robust Purcell enhancement of $\overline{F}_{\mathrm{P}} \approx 3.3$. For comparison we also perform an optimization without robustness. We find that an unrobust optimum of $F_{\mathrm{P}} \approx 256.5$ dwindles to only $\overline{F}_{\mathrm{P}} \approx 0.7$ when fabrication uncertainties are taken into account. We thus demonstrate that the presented approach is able to find designs of significantly higher performance than those obtained with conventional optimization.</description>

      <title>Array Coupling in Terms of Characteristic Modes and Generalized Scattering Matrices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02046v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modeling of mutual coupling in antenna arrays using generalized scattering matrices in terms of characteristic modes is proposed. Potential applications of this model are diverse. On the one hand, the proposed model can be used as a basis for mutual coupling calculation methods. On the other hand, the parameters introduced by the model provide a new intermediate level to understand coupling phenomena at a higher and more abstract level. After introducing the model, the question of how to describe the degrees of freedom of an antenna in this model is addressed. For this purpose, a formalism to synthesize antennas from a predefined geometry with still undefined ports is mathematically formulated. Furthermore, three exemplary applications of the model are given. A first example illustrates the accuracy of the model and the validity of the implementation. A second example illustrates the intuitiveness of the model based on a simple application, and a third example shows the application to a complex real-world design problem of a circularly polarized patch antenna array.</description>

      <title>Application of Transformers for Nonlinear Channel Compensation in Optical Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.13119v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a new nonlinear optical channel equalizer based on Transformers. By leveraging parallel computation and attending directly to the memory across a sequence of symbols, we show that Transformers can be used effectively for nonlinear equalization in coherent long-haul transmission. For this application, we present an implementation of the encoder part of the Transformer and analyze its performance over a wide range of different hyper-parameters. It is shown that by processing blocks of symbols at each iteration and carefully selecting subsets of the encoder's output to be processed together, an efficient nonlinear compensation can be achieved for different complexity constraints. We also propose the use of a physic-informed mask inspired by nonlinear perturbation theory for reducing the computational complexity of the attention mechanism.</description>

      <title>An Effective Universal Polynomial Basis for Spectral Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.18177v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spectral Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), also referred to as graph filters have gained increasing prevalence for heterophily graphs. Optimal graph filters rely on Laplacian eigendecomposition for Fourier transform. In an attempt to avert the prohibitive computations, numerous polynomial filters by leveraging distinct polynomials have been proposed to approximate the desired graph filters. However, polynomials in the majority of polynomial filters are predefined and remain fixed across all graphs, failing to accommodate the diverse heterophily degrees across different graphs. To tackle this issue, we first investigate the correlation between polynomial bases of desired graph filters and the degrees of graph heterophily via a thorough theoretical analysis. Afterward, we develop an adaptive heterophily basis by incorporating graph heterophily degrees. Subsequently, we integrate this heterophily basis with the homophily basis, creating a universal polynomial basis UniBasis. In consequence, we devise a general polynomial filter UniFilter. Comprehensive experiments on both real-world and synthetic datasets with varying heterophily degrees significantly support the superiority of UniFilter, demonstrating the effectiveness and generality of UniBasis, as well as its promising capability as a new method for graph analysis.</description>

      <title>Power Allocation and Beamforming Design for IRS-aided Secure Directional Modulation Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.15504v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the aim of boosting the security of the conventional directional modulation (DM) network, a secure DM network assisted by intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) is investigated in this paper. To maximize the secrecy rate (SR), we jointly optimize the power allocation (PA) factor, confidential message (CM) beamforming, artificial noise (AN) beamforming, and IRS reflected beamforming. To tackle the formulated problem, a maximizing SR with high-performance (Max-SR-HP) scheme is proposed, where the PA factor, CM beamforming, AN beamforming, and IRS phase shift matrix are derived by the derivative operation, generalized Rayleigh-Ritz, generalized power iteration, and semidefinite relaxation criteria, respectively. Given that the high complexity of the above scheme, a maximizing SR with low-complexity (Max-SR-LC) scheme is proposed, which employs the generalized leakage and successive convex approximation algorithms to derive the variables. Simulation results show that both the proposed schemes can significantly boost the SR performance, and are better than the equal PA, no IRS and random phase shift IRS schemes.</description>
