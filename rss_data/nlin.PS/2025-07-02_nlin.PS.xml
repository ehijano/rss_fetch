      <title>Soliton Synchronization with Randomness: Rogue Waves and Universality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01253v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider an $N$-soliton solution of the focusing nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger equations. We give conditions for the synchronous collision of these $N$ solitons. When the solitons velocities are well separated and the solitons have equal amplitude, we show that the local wave profile at the collision point scales as the $\operatorname{sinc}(x)$ function. We show that this behaviour persists when the amplitudes of the solitons are i.i.d. sub-exponential random variables. Namely the central collision peak exhibits universality: its spatial profile converges to the $\operatorname{sinc}(x)$ function, independently of the distribution. We derive Central Limit Theorems for the fluctuations of the profile in the near-field regime (near the collision point) and in the far-regime.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Models for Two Nonreciprocally Coupled Fields: A Microscopic Derivation for Zero, One, and Two Conservation Laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01105v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct the dynamic models governing two nonreciprocally coupled fields for cases with zero, one, and two conservation laws. Starting from two microscopic nonreciprocally coupled Ising models, and using the mean-field approximation, we obtain closed-form evolution equations for the spatially resolved magnetization in each lattice. For single spin-flip dynamics, the macroscopic equations in the thermodynamic limit are closely related to the nonreciprocal Allen-Cahn equations, i.e. conservation laws are absent. Likewise, for spin-exchange dynamics within each lattice, the thermodynamic limit yields equations similar to the nonreciprocal Cahn-Hilliard model, i.e. with two conservation laws. In the case of spin-exchange dynamics within and between the two lattices, we obtain two nonreciprocally coupled equations that add up to one conservation law. For each of these cases, we systematically map out the linear instabilities that can arise. Our results provide a microscopic foundation for a broad class of nonreciprocal field theories, establishing a direct link between non-equilibrium statistical mechanics and macroscopic continuum descriptions.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of a dark soliton in a curved 1D Bose-Einstein condensate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01157v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the nonlinear dynamics of dark solitons in a one-dimensional Bose-Einstein condensate confined to a curved geometry. Using the Gross-Pitaevskii equation in curvilinear coordinates and a perturbative expansion in the local curvature, we derive a set of coupled evolution equations for the soliton velocity and the curvature. For the case of constant curvature, such as circular geometries, the soliton dynamics is governed solely by the initial velocity and curvature. Remarkably, the soliton travels a nearly constant angular trajectory across two orders of magnitude in curvature, suggesting an emergent conserved quantity, independent of its initial velocity. We extend our analysis to elliptical trajectories with spatially varying curvature and show that soliton dynamics remain determined by the local curvature profile. In these cases, the model of effective constant curvature describes accurately the dynamics given the local curvature has smooth variation. When the soliton crosses regions of rapid curvature variation and/or non-monotonic behavior, the model fails to describe to soliton dynamics, although the overall behavior can still be fully mapped to the curvature profile. Our results provide a quantitative framework for understanding the role of geometry in soliton dynamics and pave the way for future studies of nonlinear excitations in curved quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Rapidly Rotating Wall-Mode Convection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20541v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the rapidly rotating limit, we derive a balanced set of reduced equations governing the strongly nonlinear development of the convective wall-mode instability in the interior of a general container. The model illustrates that wall-mode convection is a multiscale phenomenon where the dynamics of the bulk interior diagnostically determine the small-scale dynamics within Stewartson boundary layers at the sidewalls. The sidewall boundary layers feedback on the interior via a nonlinear lateral heat-flux boundary condition, providing a closed system. Outside the asymptotically thin boundary layer, the convective modes connect to a dynamical interior that maintains scales set by the domain geometry. In many ways, the final system of equations resembles boundary-forced planetary geostrophic baroclinic dynamics coupled with barotropic quasi-geostrophic vorticity. The reduced system contains the results from previous linear instability theory but captured in an elementary fashion, providing a new avenue for investigating wall-mode convection in the strongly nonlinear regime. We also derive the dominant Ekman-flux correction to the onset Rayleigh number for large Taylor number, $\textit{Ra} \approx 31.8 \,\textit{Ta}^{1/2} - 4.43 \,\textit{Ta}^{5/12} + \mathcal{O}(\textit{Ta}^{1/3})$ for no-slip boundaries. However, we find that the linear onset in a finite cylinder differs noticeably compared to a Cartesian channel. We demonstrate some of the reduced model's nonlinear dynamics with numerical simulations in a cylindrical container.</description>

      <title>The formation of a soliton gas condensate for the focusing Nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14749v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we carry out a rigorous analysis of a multi-soliton solution of the focusing nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger equation as the number, $N$, of solitons grows to infinity. We discover configurations of $N$-soliton solutions which exhibit the formation (as $N \to \infty$) of a soliton gas condensate. Specifically, we show that when the eigenvalues of the Zakharov - Shabat operator for the NLS equation accumulate on two bounded horizontal segments in the complex plane with norming constants bounded away from $0$, then, asymptotically, the solution is described by a rapidly oscillatory elliptic-wave with constant velocity, on compact subsets of $(x,t)$. We then consider more complex solutions with an extra soliton component, and provide rigorous justification of the predictions of the kinetic theory of solitons in this deterministic setting. This is to be distinguished from previous analyses of soliton gasses where the norming constants were tending to zero with $N$, and the asymptotic description only included elliptic waves in the long-time asymptotics.</description>

      <title>Pattern Formation as a Resilience Mechanism in Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20909v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mathematical and computational modelling in oncology has played an increasingly important role in not only understanding the impact of various approaches to treatment on tumour growth, but in optimizing dosing regimens and aiding the development of treatment strategies. However, as with all modelling, only an approximation is made in the description of the biological and physical system. Here we show that tissue-scale spatial structure can have a profound impact on the resilience of tumours to immunotherapy using a classical model incorporating IL-2 compounds and effector cells as treatment parameters. Using linear stability analysis, numerical continuation, and direct simulations, we show that diffusing cancer cell populations can undergo pattern-forming (Turing) instabilities, leading to spatially-structured states that persist far into treatment regimes where the corresponding spatially homogeneous systems would uniformly predict a cancer-free state. These spatially-patterned states persist in a wide range of parameters, as well as under time-dependent treatment regimes. Incorporating treatment via domain boundaries can increase this resistance to treatment in the interior of the domain, further highlighting the importance of spatial modelling when designing treatment protocols informed by mathematical models. Counter-intuitively, this mechanism shows that increased effector cell mobility can increase the resilience of tumours to treatment. We conclude by discussing practical and theoretical considerations for understanding this kind of spatial resilience in other models of cancer treatment, in particular those incorporating more realistic spatial transport.</description>
