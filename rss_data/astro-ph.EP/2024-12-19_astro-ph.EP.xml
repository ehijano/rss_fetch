      <title>The Hottest Neptunes Orbit Metal-Rich Stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13245v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Neptune desert is no longer empty. A handful of close-in planets with masses between those of Neptune and Saturn have now been discovered, and their puzzling properties have inspired a number of interesting theories on the formation and evolution of desert-dwellers. While some studies suggest that Neptune desert planets form and evolve similarly to longer-period Neptunes, others argue that they are products of rare collisions between smaller planets, or that they are the exposed interiors of giant planets (i.e., ``hot Jupiters gone wrong''). These origin stories make different predictions for the metallicities of Neptune desert host stars. In this paper, we use the homogeneous catalog of stellar metallicities from Gaia Data Release 3 to investigate the origins of Neptune desert-dwellers. We find that planets in the Neptune desert orbit stars that are significantly more metal-rich than the hosts of longer-period Neptunes ($p = 0.0016$) and smaller planets ($p = 0.00014$). In contrast, Neptune desert host star metallicities are statistically indistinguishable from those of hot Jupiter host stars ($p = 0.55$). Therefore, we find it relatively unlikely that Neptune desert planets formed and evolved similarly to longer-period Neptunes, or that they resulted from collisions between smaller planets, at least without another metallicity-selective process involved. A more straightforward explanation for this result is that planets in the desert truly are the exposed interiors of larger planets. Atmospheric spectroscopy of Neptune desert worlds may therefore provide a rare glimpse into the interiors of giant exoplanets.</description>

      <title>Quantifying spectroscopic Ca II exocomet transit occurrence in two decades of HARPS data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13253v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The field of exocomets has been built around the unmatched number of detections made in the circumstellar disc of the archetypal star Beta Pictoris. An exocomet detection in spectroscopy is identified by variable atomic absorption features in a stellar spectrum, associated with transiting gas in and trailing an exocomet coma. This paper presents the largest spectroscopic search for exocomet transits to date, which overcomes the limitations of biased samples of stars with debris discs, and instead looks through the $\approx$7500 stars in the HARPS archive for signs of exocomets in the CaII doublet (H:396.847nm and K:393.366nm). The search resulted in 155 candidate stars, which after filtering for false positives (e.g. binaries, stellar activity, etc.), were cut down to 22 stars. These 22 stars are classified into Tier1, 2, and 3 exocomet candidates, reflecting the confidence level of their exocomet detection. Our two best candidates (Tier1: Beta Pictoris, HD172555) and four lower confidence candidates (Tier2: Gl1, HIP5158, HD94771, HR1996) are discussed, yielding a detection rate of 0.03% (Tier1 only) and 0.1% (Tier1 &amp; 2) in the HARPS sample. Both Tier1 stars are known exocomet host stars. These two young A-type stars correspond to 0.4% of all A-types in the sample, suggesting that detecting signs of exocomet transits using CaII is more likely around young A-type stars. Reanalysing a past HARPS study, we found no evidence to support the previously claimed four exocomet detections, indicating either that those detections are not robust or that we are only sensitive to the strongest signals.</description>

      <title>Evolution of orbits of trans-Neptunian bodies at the 2:3 resonance with Neptune</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13297v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The results of the numerical investigations of the evolution of orbits of trans-Neptunian bodies at the 2 : 3 resonance with Neptune are presented. The gravitational influence of the four giant planets was taken into account. For identical initial values of the semimajor axes, eccentricities, and inclinations, but for different initial orbital orientations and initial positions in orbits, we obtained different types of variations in the difference {\Delta}{\Omega}={\Omega}-{\Omega}_N in the ascending-node longitudes of the body and Neptune, and in the perihelion argument {\omega}. When {\Delta}{\Omega} decreases and {\omega} increases during evolution, then most of the bodies leave the resonance in 20 Myr. In the case of an increase in {\Delta}{\Omega} and a decrease in {\omega}, the bodies stay in the resonance for a much longer time. Regions of eccentricities and inclinations, for which some bodies were in the {\eta}_18 secular resonance ({\Delta}{\Omega} is almost constant) and in the Kozai resonance ({\omega} is almost constant), were obtained to be larger than those predicted for small variations in the critical angle. Some bodies can at the same time be in both these resonances.</description>

      <title>Streaming Torque with Turbulent Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13448v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fast type-I migration of (proto)planets poses a challenging problem for the core accretion formation scenario. We found that the dust-induced ``Streaming Torque (ST)'' may slow down or even reverse the planet migration in \cite{Hou2024}. But in realistic protoplanetary disks, dust diffusion induced by gas turbulence may have important influences on ST. We perform linear analysis to investigate the effects of dust diffusion on ST. The dependence of ST on the dust diffusion may provide better constraints on the turbulence strength and the stopping time $\tau$. We derive the dispersion relation for all the wave modes in the two-fluid system. The dust diffusion will smooth the short-wavelength structure of the the quasi-drift mode and split it into two predominant D-drift modes with opposite directions. The outgoing D-drift mode will contribute to a negative torque on planets, particularly when $\tau \sim 0.1$, which slightly shifts the zero-torque turning point. We explore how ST depends on the regimes of aerodynamic drag, dust mass fraction and disk scale height. We compare the radial wavenumbers of D-drift modes under different formulations of dust diffusion and find qualitative agreement. In all cases, $\tau$ at the zero-torque turning point, which determines the direction of planetary migration, consistently remains on the order of $\sim 0.1$, corresponding to large pebble-sized dust grains. This suggests that rapid dust coagulation can inhibit the inward migration of planets, implying that weak gas turbulence may enhance the survival of protoplanets.</description>

      <title>Short-Term Evolution and Risks of Debris Cloud Stemming from Collisions in Geostationary Orbit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13586v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing population of objects in geostationary orbit has raised concerns about the potential risks posed by debris clouds resulting from fragmentation. The short-term evolution and associated hazards of debris generated by collisions in the geostationary region is investigated in this study. The initial distribution of two debris clouds is modeled using a single probability density function. The combined distribution of the evolved clouds is determined by solving boundary value problems. The risks associated with these debris clouds are evaluated by calculating the instantaneous impact rate and cumulative collision probability. The probability of collisions with millimeter-sized fragments may increase to 1% within 36 hours, while the probability of collisions with fragments 5 cm or larger is approximately $10^{-5}$. These findings underscore the vulnerability of the geostationary region to space traffic accidents.</description>

      <title>Experimental heating of complex organic matter at Titan's interior conditions supports contributions to atmospheric N2 and CH4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Titan's abundant atmospheric N2 and CH4 gases are notable characteristics of the moon that may help constrain its origins and evolution. Previous work suggests that atmospheric CH4 is lost on geologically short timescales and may be replenished from an interior source. Isotopic and noble gas constraints indicate that N2 may derive from a mixture of NH3 ice and heating of organic matter. Here, we report experimental results from hydrothermal alteration of insoluble organic matter from the Murchison meteorite and analog insoluble organic matter at temperatures and pressures that are relevant to Titan's interior. Our results indicate both CH4 and CO2 are formed, with the ratio between the two depending on a multitude of factors, particularly temperature and, to a lesser degree, the dielectric constant of water and carbonyl abundance in the starting material. Sufficient CH4 is produced to source Titan's atmospheric reservoir if temperatures are greater than 250{\deg}C. Nitrogen is volatilized, primarily in the form of NH3, in sufficient abundances to source at least 50% of Titan's atmospheric N2. The isotopic characteristics of volatilized material relative to the starting organics are consistent with current constraints for the nature of the accreted complex organics and Titan's evolved atmosphere.</description>

      <title>Ohmic heating in the upper atmosphere of hot exoplanets The influence of a time-varying magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14072v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exoplanets on close-in orbit are subject to intense X-ray and ultraviolet (XUV) irradiation from their star. Their atmosphere therefore heats up, sometimes to the point where it thermally escapes from the gravitational potential of the planet. Nonetheless, XUV is not the only source of heating in such atmospheres. Indeed, close-in exoplanets are embedded in a medium (the stellar wind) with strong magnetic fields that can significantly vary along the orbit. The variations of this magnetic field can induce currents in the upper atmosphere, which dissipate and locally heat it up through Ohmic heating. The aim of this work is to quantify Ohmic heating in the upper atmosphere of hot exoplanets due to an external time-varying magnetic field, and to compare it to the XUV heating. Ohmic heating depends strongly on the conductivity properties of the upper atmosphere. A 1D formalism is developed to assess the level and the localization of Ohmic heating depending on the conductivity profile, and applied to the specific cases of Trappist-1 b and $\pi$ Men c. Ohmic heating can reach values up to 10$^{-3}$ erg s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-3}$ in the upper atmospheres of hot exoplanets. It is expected to be stronger the closer the planet is and the lower the central star mass is, as these conditions maximize the strength of the ambient magnetic field around the planet. We confirm that Ohmic heating can play an important role in setting the thermal budget of the upper atmosphere of hot exoplanets, and can even surpass the XUV heating in the most favorable cases. When it is strong, a corollary is that the upper atmosphere screens efficiently time-varying external magnetic fields, preventing them to penetrate deeper in the atmosphere or inside the planet itself. We find that both Trappist-1b and $\pi$ Men c are likely subject to intense Ohmic heating.</description>

      <title>Precise and efficient modeling of stellar-activity-affected solar spectra using SOAP-GPU</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13500v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the main obstacles in exoplanet detection when using the radial velocity (RV) technique is the presence of stellar activity signal induced by magnetic regions. In this context, a realistic simulated dataset that can provide photometry and spectroscopic outputs is needed for method development. The goal of this paper is to describe two realistic simulations of solar activity obtained from SOAP-GPU and to compare them with real data obtained from the HARPS-N solar telescope. We describe two different methods of modeling solar activity using SOAP-GPU. The first models the evolution of active regions based on the spot number as a function of time. The second method relies on the extraction of active regions from the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) data. The simulated spectral time series generated with the first method shows a long-term RV behavior similar to that seen in the HARPS-N solar observations. The effect of stellar activity induced by stellar rotation is also well modeled with prominent periodicities at the stellar rotation period and its first harmonic. The comparison between the simulated spectral time series generated using SDO images and the HARPS-N solar spectra shows that SOAP-GPU can precisely model the RV time series of the Sun to a precision better than 0.9 m/s. By studying the width and depth variations of each spectral line in the HARPS-N solar and SOAP-GPU data, we find a strong correlation between the observation and the simulation for strong spectral lines, therefore supporting the modeling of the stellar activity effect at the spectral level. These simulated solar spectral time series serve as a useful test bed for evaluating spectral-level stellar activity mitigation techniques.</description>

      <title>Irregular Fixation: I. Fixed points and librating orbits of the Brown Hamiltonian</title>

Abstract: In hierarchical triple systems, the inner binary is slowly perturbed by a distant companion, giving rise to large-scale oscillations in eccentricity and inclination, known as von-Zeipel-Lidov-Kozai (ZLK) oscillations. Stable systems with a mild hierarchy, where the period ratio is not too small, require an additional corrective term, known as the Brown Hamiltonian, to adequately account for their long-term evolution. Although the Brown Hamiltonian has been used to accurately describe the highly eccentric systems on circulating orbits where the periapse completes a complete revolution, the analysis near its elliptical fixed points had been overlooked. We derive analytically the modified fixed points including the Brown Hamiltonian and analyse its librating orbits (where the periapse motion is limited in range). We compare our result to the direct three-body integrations of millions of orbits and discuss the regimes of validity. We numerically discover the regions of orbital instability, allowed and forbidden librating zones with a complex, fractal, structure. The retrograde orbits, where the mutual inclination is $\iota &gt; 90\ \rm deg$, are more stable and allowed to librate for larger areas of the parameter space. We find numerical fits for the librating-circulating boundary. Finally, we discuss the astrophysical implications for systems of satellites, stars and compact objects. In a companion paper (paper II), we apply our formalism to the orbits of irregular satellites around giant planets.</description>

      <title>Reliable Detections of Atmospheres on Rocky Exoplanets with Photometric JWST Phase Curves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04386v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The prevalence of atmospheres on rocky planets is one of the major questions in exoplanet astronomy, but there are currently no published unambiguous detections of atmospheres on any rocky exoplanets. The MIRI instrument on JWST can measure thermal emission from tidally locked rocky exoplanets orbiting small, cool stars. This emission is a function of their surface and atmospheric properties, potentially allowing detections of atmospheres. One way to find atmospheres is to search for lower day-side emission than would be expected for a black body planet. Another technique is to measure phase curves of thermal emission to search for night-side emission due to atmospheric heat redistribution. Here, we compare strategies for detecting atmospheres on rocky exoplanets. We simulate secondary eclipse and phase curve observations in the MIRI F1500W and F1280W filters, for a range of surfaces (providing our open access albedo data) and atmospheres on thirty exoplanets selected for their F1500W signal-to-noise ratio. We show that secondary eclipse observations are more degenerate between surfaces and atmospheres than suggested in previous work, and that thick atmospheres can support emission consistent with a black body planet in these filters. These results make it difficult to unambiguously detect or rule out atmospheres using their photometric day-side emission alone. We suggest that an F1500W phase curve could instead be observed for a similar sample of planets. While phase curves are time-consuming and their instrumental systematics can be challenging, we suggest that they allow the only unambiguous detections of atmospheres by night-side thermal emission.</description>

      <title>A sub-Earth-mass planet orbiting Barnard's star: No evidence of transits in TESS photometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.00577v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A sub-Earth-mass planet orbiting Barnard's star, designated as Barnard b, has been recently announced. At almost the same time, the first photometric data of Barnard's star by the Transit Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) was released in Sector 80. We explore the possibility of emergent transits of Barnard b in TESS photometry. The detrended 2 min light curve appears to be flat, with a flux root mean square of 0.411 parts per thousand. Attempts of blind and informed transit-curve model inference suggest no evidence of transiting Barnard b, or any other body. This provides a 3$\sigma$ upper bound of 87.9 degrees for the orbital inclination of Barnard b.</description>

      <title>The First JWST View of a 30-Myr-old Protoplanetary Disk Reveals a Late-stage Carbon-rich Phase</title>

Abstract: We present a JWST MIRI/MRS spectrum of the inner disk of WISE J044634.16$-$262756.1B (hereafter J0446B), an old ($\sim$34 Myr) M4.5 star but with hints of ongoing accretion. The spectrum is molecule-rich and dominated by hydrocarbons. We detect 14 molecular species (H$_2$, CH$_3$, CH$_4$, C$_2$H$_2$, $^{13}$CCH$_2$, C$_2$H$_4$, C$_2$H$_6$, C$_3$H$_4$, C$_4$H$_2$, C$_6$H$_6$, HCN, HC$_3$N, CO$_2$ and $^{13}$CO$_2$) and 2 atomic lines ([Ne II] and [Ar II]), all observed for the first time in a disk at this age. The detection of spatially unresolved H$_2$ and Ne gas strongly supports that J0446B hosts a long-lived primordial disk, rather than a debris disk. The marginal H$_2$O detection and the high C$_2$H$_2$/CO$_2$ column density ratio indicate that the inner disk of J0446B has a very carbon-rich chemistry, with a gas-phase C/O ratio $\gtrsim$2, consistent with what have been found in most primordial disks around similarly low-mass stars. In the absence of significant outer disk dust substructures, inner disks are expected to first become water-rich due to the rapid inward drift of icy pebbles, and evolve into carbon-rich as outer disk gas flows inward on longer timescales. The faint millimeter emission in such low-mass star disks implies that they may have depleted their outer icy pebble reservoir early and already passed the water-rich phase. Models with pebble drift and volatile transport suggest that maintaining a carbon-rich chemistry for tens of Myr likely requires a slowly evolving disk with $\alpha-$viscosity $\lesssim10^{-4}$. This study represents the first detailed characterization of disk gas at $\sim$30 Myr, strongly motivating further studies into the final stages of disk evolution.</description>

Abstract: Stellar flares offer invaluable insights into stellar magnetic activity and exoplanetary environments. Automated flare detection enables exploiting vast photometric datasets from missions like Kepler. This paper presents FCN4Flare, a deep learning approach using fully convolutional networks (FCN) for precise point-to-point flare prediction regardless of light curve length. Key innovations include the NaN Mask to handle missing data automatedly, and the Mask Dice loss to mitigate severe class imbalance. Experimental results show that FCN4Flare significantly outperforms previous methods, achieving a Dice coefficient of 0.64 compared to the state-of-the-art of 0.12. Applying FCN4Flare to Kepler-LAMOST data, we compile a catalog of 30,285 high-confidence flares across 1426 stars. Flare energies are estimated and stellar/exoplanet properties analyzed, identifying pronounced activity for an M-dwarf hosting a habitable zone planet. This work overcomes limitations of prior flare detection methods via deep learning, enabling new scientific discoveries through analysis of photometric time-series data.
