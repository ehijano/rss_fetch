      <title>Precision Unitarity Calculations in Inflationary Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit perturbative unitarity in scalar field inflation with a nonminimal coupling, with Higgs inflation serving as the most prominent example. Although such models are phenomenologically successful, it is critical to examine whether or not unitarity violations spoil their theoretical self-consistency. The analysis of these issues has so far typically relied on order-of-magnitude estimates of scattering amplitudes, which are appropriate for generic parameters. It is not evident that these methods apply to scenarios relying on a near-critical inflationary potential, for which an interplay of both small scalar self-couplings and nonminimal couplings could partially alleviate the unitarity issues. To allow for an exploration of this possibility, we consider the full $S$-matrix for the relevant scattering processes, taking into account important phase space volume factors, leading to a precise evaluation of the cut-off scale. In the single-field case, we demonstrate that near-criticality raises the cut-off scale considerably, compared to previous estimates. In the multifield case, momentum-dependent self-interactions in the kinetic sector lower the cut-off compared to the single-field case to a value comparable to but slightly larger than previous estimates. We carefully study both the single-field and multifield cases in metric and metric-affine (Palatini) formulations of gravity, as well as introduce a new phenomenologically viable model with a canonical kinetic term and a significantly raised cut-off, and discuss the importance of background field effects.</description>

      <title>Dispersion relation of the neutrino plasma: Unifying fast, slow, and collisional instabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20389v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In neutrino-dense astrophysical environments, these particles exchange flavor through a coherent weak field, forming a collisionless neutrino plasma with collective flavor dynamics. Instabilities, which grow and affect the environment, may arise from neutrino-neutrino refraction alone (fast limit), vacuum energy splittings caused by masses (slow limit), or neutrino-matter scattering (collisional limit). We present a comprehensive analytical description of the dispersion relation governing these unstable modes. Treating vacuum energy splittings and collision rates as small perturbations, we construct a unified framework for fast, slow, and collisional instabilities. We classify modes into gapped, where collective excitations are already present in the fast limit but rendered unstable by slow or collisional effects, and gapless, which are purely generated by these effects. For each class, we derive approximate dispersion relations for generic energy and angle distributions, which reveal the order of magnitude of the growth rates and the nature of the instabilities without solving directly the dispersion relation. This approach confirms that slow and collisionally unstable waves generally grow much more slowly than they oscillate. Consequently, the common fast-mode approximation of local evolution within small boxes is unjustified. Even for fast modes, neglecting large-distance propagation of growing waves, as usually done, may be a poor approximation. Our unified framework provides an intuitive understanding of the linear phase of flavor evolution across all regimes and paves the way for a quasi-linear treatment of the instability's nonlinear development.</description>

      <title>Solving the strong CP problem in string-inspired theories with modular invariance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20395v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that solutions to the strong CP problem based on modular invariance can be extended to incorporate features that appear in string compactifications: quarks with mostly positive modular weights and non-trivial gauge kinetic functions. This requires assuming that singularities and zeroes only appear at special points, such as decompactification limits. We discuss the impact of these assumptions on string gauge unification.</description>

      <title>The role of unitarisation on dark-matter freeze-out via metastable bound states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20443v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In many Abelian and non-Abelian theories, standard calculations of radiative bound-state formation violate partial-wave unitarity - even at arbitrarily small couplings - when capture into excited states is considered. Recent work demonstrated that unitarity can be restored by the proper resummation of squared inelastic processes in the self-energy of the incoming state. We examine how unitarisation affects dark-matter thermal decoupling, given that the formation and decay of metastable dark-matter bound states are critical in determining the relic abundance, especially for multi-TeV dark matter. We consider an Abelian model featuring bound-state formation via emission of a light scalar that carries a conserved charge, whose dynamics also emulates relevant aspects of non-Abelian theories. Incorporating capture into excited states, we show that, without proper treatment, unitarity violation is so severe as to prevent freeze-out. Resumming the squared bound-state formation processes restores unitarity and ensures freeze-out, while capture into excited levels still significantly depletes dark matter. We further discuss the impact of higher partial waves, both within and beyond the present model. Finally, we point out the intriguing possibility of late dark-matter decoupling that can affect structure formation.</description>

      <title>Searching for Axion Dark Matter Near Relaxing Magnetars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20450v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Axion dark matter passing through the magnetospheres of magnetars can undergo hyper-efficient resonant mixing with low-energy photons, leading to the production of narrow spectral lines that could be detectable on Earth. Since this is a resonant process triggered by the spatial variation in the photon dispersion relation, the luminosity and spectral properties of the emission are highly sensitive to the charge and current densities permeating the magnetosphere. To date, a majority of the studies investigating this phenomenon have assumed a perfectly dipolar magnetic field structure with a near-field plasma distribution fixed to the minimal charge-separated force-free configuration. While this {may} be a reasonable treatment for the closed field lines of conventional radio pulsars, the strong magnetic fields around magnetars are believed to host processes that drive strong deviations from this minimal configuration. In this work, we study how realistic magnetar magnetospheres impact the electromagnetic emission produced from axion dark matter. Specifically, we construct charge and current distributions that are consistent with magnetar observations, and use these to recompute the prospective sensitivity of radio and sub-mm telescopes to axion dark matter. We demonstrate that the two leading models yield vastly different predictions for the frequency and amplitude of the spectral line, indicating systematic uncertainties in the plasma structure are significant. Finally, we discuss various observational signatures that can be used to differentiate the local plasma loading mechanism of an individual magnetar, which will be necessary if there is hope of using such objects to search for axions.</description>

      <title>A new probe of the quartic Higgs self-coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We calculate the corrections to the Higgs wave-function renormalization constant arising from modified cubic, quartic, and quintic Higgs self-couplings up to the two-loop level. Using our analytic results, we derive two-dimensional constraints on the modifications of the considered Higgs self-interactions that could potentially be set from precision measurements of single-Higgs production processes at the high-luminosity Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and a Future Circular Collider. Our novel constraints are compared to those that might be set by searches for multi-Higgs production at the same facilities. In view of the first LHC results on triple-Higgs production, we also review the current status of Higgs self-coupling determinations after LHC Run 2.</description>

      <title>One-loop renormalization of quark TMD in the light-cone gauge: CSS evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20467v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We calculate the one-loop corrections to the quark TMD in the light-cone gauge using the background field formalism, with the Mandelstam-Leibbrandt (ML) prescription for the extra singularity present in the light-cone gauge propagator. We use the pure rapidity regulator for rapidity divergences. The Collins-Soper-Sterman (CSS) evolution equations are indeed obtained from the one loop renormalization of the quark TMD. In this setup, the double log contribution to the CSS resummation is found to come from the ghost-like zero-mode from the ML prescription, in the diagrams with a gluon propagator ending on the transverse part of the gauge link at infinity.</description>

      <title>Mapping the transverse spin sum rule in position space</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.20468v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss in detail the relativistic spatial distribution of transverse angular momentum, including both orbital and intrinsic spin contributions. Using the quantum phase-space formalism, we begin with the definition of the three-dimensional spatial distributions of transverse orbital angular momentum and intrinsic spin in a generic Lorentz frame. By integrating these three-dimensional spatial distributions over the longitudinal axis, we derive for the first time the relativistic spatial distributions of transverse orbital angular momentum, intrinsic spin, and total angular momentum for spin-0 and spin-1/2 targets in the transverse plane. We verify the transverse spin sum rule for spin-0 and spin-1/2 systems, and find that the transverse total angular momentum distribution is nontrivial, even for spin-0 targets. We also show how the distributions of transverse orbital angular momentum, intrinsic spin, and total angular momentum change with the target momentum.</description>

      <title>Factorial growth in perturbation theory, power corrections: precise extraction of quark masses and $\alpha_\text{s}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: These proceedings summarize a newly found connection between the factorial growth of coefficients in perturbative QCD and power corrections to the perturbation series, discussed in refs. [1-4]. The improved convergence is shown for three quantities four which four terms in the series are available: the static energy, the quark pole mass, and the polarized Bjorken sum rule. Prospects for determinations of $\alpha_\text{s}$ with controlled truncation uncertainties are discussed, as was found earlier in quark-mass determinations [3,5].</description>

      <title>Study of $B_c \to \chi_{cJ}\ (P, V)$ decays in the improved perturbative QCD formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20605v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the recent LHCb measurements of the ratios between the branching ratios (BRs), $R_{\chi_{c2}/J/\psi} \equiv {\rm BR}(B_c^+ \to \chi_{c2} \pi^+)/{\rm BR}(B_c^+ \to J/\psi \pi^+)$ and $R_{\chi_{c1}/\chi_{c2}} \equiv {\rm BR}(B_c^+ \to \chi_{c1} \pi^+)/{\rm BR}(B_c^+ \to \chi_{c2} \pi^+)$, we analyze the decays $B_c^+ \to \chi_{cJ} (P, V)^+$ in the improved perturbative QCD (iPQCD) formalism, where $\chi_{cJ}$ denotes the $p$-wave charmonia with $J=0, 1, 2$, and $P (V)$ denotes the pseudoscalars $\pi$ and $K$ (the vectors $\rho$ and $K^*$). Our results $R_{\chi_{c2}/J/\psi} = 0.32 \pm 0.05$ and $R_{\chi_{c1}/\chi_{c2}}= 0.11 \pm 0.01$ at leading order in the strong coupling $\alpha_s$ agree well with the data within uncertainties. The result $R_{\chi_{c0}/J/\psi} \equiv {\rm BR}(B_c^+ \to \chi_{c0} \pi^+)/{\rm BR}(B_c^+ \to J/\psi \pi^+) = 0.17 \pm 0.02$ is lower than $1.41^{+0.50}_{-0.45}$ inferred by the $B_c^+ \to \chi_{c0} \pi^+$ measurement. The large longitudinal polarization fractions imply that these components dominate the $B_c^+ \to \chi_{c1,c2} \rho^+$ BRs. A peculiar constructive (destructive) interference between the twist-2 and twist-3 contributions is identified in the $B_c^+\to \chi_{c1} \rho^+$ ($B_c^+\to \chi_{c1} \pi^+$) mode, but not in the corresponding ones with $\chi_{c0,c2}$ mesons. Inputting the BRs of the strong decays $\chi_{c0,c2} \to \pi^+ \pi^- / K^+ K^-$ and $\chi_{cJ} \to \pi^+\pi^-(\pi^+ \pi^-/K^+K^-)$ reported by the BESIII Collaboration, we obtain those of $B_c^+ \to \chi_{cJ} (\rho, \pi)^+$ followed by secondary decay chains under the narrow-width approximation. All the above iPQCD predictions can be confronted by more precise experiments in the future to deepen our understanding of QCD dynamics in $B_c\to\chi_{cJ}$ transitions.</description>

      <title>Form Factors for $B_c^*\to \eta_c+l\nu_l$ at NLO in QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20682v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the Non-Relativistic QCD (NRQCD) calculations at the next-to-leading order (NLO) of $\alpha_s$ for $B_c^*\to \eta_c$ vector, axial-vector, tensor and axial-tensor form factors, and obtain complete analytical expressions for the form factors, along with their asymptotic forms in the hierarchical heavy quark limit. Our results show that the NLO corrections are both sizable and well-behaved in the low squared transfer momentum $(q^2)$ region. Using the NRQCD + lattice + $z$-series method, we further provide theoretical predictions for $B_c^*\to \eta_c$ form factors across the full physical $q^2$ range. Based on these predicted form factors, we finally compute the decay widths and branching fractions for the semileptonic decays $B_c^*\to \eta_c+l{\nu_l}$.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic tomography of radial flow in the quark-gluon plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel multimessenger approach to extract the effective radial flow of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) by jointly analyzing thermal photon and dilepton spectra in heavy-ion collisions. A key feature of this method is that it circumvents the need for an unmeasurable reference -- the temperature extracted from the photon spectrum in the absence of flow -- by establishing a linear correlation between it and the dilepton-inferred temperature within a calibrated framework. By leveraging the complementary sensitivities of photons and dileptons, we define an effective radial flow observable that reflects early-time collectivity and expansion dynamics. We find that this observable exhibits a strong correlation with the spacetime-averaged radial velocity of the QGP, providing it with clear physical meaning as a measure of collective expansion. Together with previous results linking dilepton temperatures to initial QGP conditions, our work establishes a consistent framework for electromagnetic tomography of the QGP, offering direct access to its early-time dynamics.</description>

      <title>Probing $\Delta L=2$ lepton number violating SMEFT operators at the same-sign muon collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20936v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate lepton number violation (LNV) induced by $\Delta L = 2$ dimension-seven Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) operators in the context of same-sign muon colliders. Specifically, we study $\mu^+ \mu^+ \rightarrow W^+W^+/\;W^+qq'$ production at the $\mu$TRISTAN at $\sqrt{s} =$ 2 TeV with an integrated luminosity of 1 ab$^{-1}$, using the final-state signature comprising two fat jets. This process is sensitive to eight distinct SMEFT operators, providing a unique avenue for testing LNV beyond the Standard Model. We determine the maximal sensitivity to these operators and compare our results with existing LHC constraints and future projections from the FCC. Our findings highlight the potential of same-sign muon colliders to serve as powerful probes of LNV and New Physics (NP) at the TeV scale.</description>

      <title>Semileptonic decay of double strangeness heavy flavor baryons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20978v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the double strangeness heavy-flavor baryons $\Omega_c^0$ and $\Omega_b^-$, which contain two strange quarks. Using QCD light-cone sum rules (LCSRs), we calculate the form factors for the Cabibbo-suppressed processes $\Omega_c^0\to\Xi^-$ and $\Omega_b^-\to\Xi^0$, corresponding to the heavy-quark transitions $c\to d$ and $b\to u$, respectively. Combining these with the helicity amplitude formalism for semileptonic decay differential widths, we computed the branching fractions of their corresponding semileptonic decay processes. Our analysis reveals significant discrepancies between two versions of QCD LCSRs: one using the light-cone distribution amplitudes (LCDAs) of the final-state $\Xi$ baryon and the other using the LCDAs of the initial-state double strangeness heavy-flavor baryons. The results obtained with the $\Xi$ baryon's LCDAs show excellent agreement with other theoretical calculations. However, when using the LCDAs of the double strangeness heavy-flavor baryons, the results differ by orders of magnitude, warranting further investigation.</description>

Abstract: It has been claimed in a number of publications that neutrinos can exhibit chirality oscillations. In this note we discuss the notion of chirality and show that chiral neutrino oscillations in vacuum do not occur. We argue that the incorrect claims to the contrary resulted from a failure to clearly discriminate between quantum fields, states and wave functions. We also emphasize the role played in the erroneous claims on the possibility of chirality oscillations by the widely spread misconceptions about negative energies.</description>

      <title>Entanglement negativity of general $2 \times (2n+1)$ qubit-qudit system</title>

Abstract: The presence of negative eigenvalue(s) in the spectrum of the partially transposed density matrix confirms the entanglement of the quantum state. The negative eigenvalue(s) also quantify the amount of entanglement through novel entanglement measures, $e.g.$, negativity. In this paper, we have presented a complete characterization of the spectrum of the partially transposed density matrix for the pure bipartite quantum state acting on a generic ${\cal H}_s (dim~2) \otimes {\cal{H}}_l (dim~2l+1)$ Hilbert space ($e.g.$, spin - orbital angular momentum space). We found that the spectrum contains only one negative eigenvalue. Its magnitude, and hence the negativity of the quantum correlation, equals the square root of the determinant of the reduced density matrix (traced over the $l$-space). We have also shown that entanglement entropy, negativity, concurrence of the density matrix, purity of the reduced density matrix, all scale with the single variable, determinant of the reduced density matrix. Finally, we computed the negativity for the spin-orbit correlations of partons in polarized and unpolarized hadrons.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.21193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The charm quark density-density correlation is calculated for $1S$ and $1P$ conventional charmonia and $J^{PC}=1^{-+},0^{+-}$ charmoniumlike states from lattice QCD and are interpreted as spatial wave functions of these states with some approximations. The angular distributions of $c\bar{c}$ in conventional charmonia are found to be in accordance with the expectation of two-body systems, while that of the $1^{-+}$ state exhibits an $S$-wave feature. However, the $c\bar{c}$ radial distributions turn out to be strikingly different from the non-relativistic quark model and can be understood by the Dirac theory of two-body bound states. These results provide the first gauge invariant and model-independent three-dimensional portraits of charmonium(like) states.</description>

      <title>Prominent enhancement of axion thermalization rate from axion-kaon interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21276v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The axion thermalization rate is a crucial input to determine the hot dark matter bound of axions, resulting from the scattering processes in the thermal bath of early Universe. We demonstrate that the commonly employed axion thermalization rate by including the $a\pi \leftrightarrow \pi\pi$ channel alone is significantly underestimated for the temperature $T$ above 100~MeV. This is obtained through the systematical calculation of the axion-light flavor meson scattering amplitudes within the framework of the chiral unitarization approach, paying special attention to the $a K \leftrightarrow \pi K$ reaction. Hadron resonances appearing in $a K \leftrightarrow \pi K$ amplitudes significantly enlarge the cross sections, which turn out to be much bigger than that of $a\pi \leftrightarrow\pi\pi$. The axion thermalization rate is then substantially enhanced by the $a K \leftrightarrow \pi K$ channel for $T\gtrsim 100$~MeV. Especially at $T\simeq 130$~MeV, the contribution from the $a K \leftrightarrow\pi K$ reaction to the axion thermalization rate exceeds the $a\pi\leftrightarrow\pi\pi$ one. Obviously more stringent constraints on the axion parameters are obtained, when confronting the number of extra relativistic degrees of freedom $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$ from Planck$'$18.</description>

      <title>On the equivalence of Flavor SU(3) analyses of $B\to PP$ decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In Ref. [1], an SU(3) analysis of $B\to PP$ decays based on reduced matrix elements (RMEs) with $P$ being a light pseudoscalar meson excluding $\eta^{(\prime)}$ is conducted. We point out that as a complete basis there are in total ten, not seven, RMEs for the involved decay modes, and the equivalence with the other two realizations of flavor SU(3) symmetry in $B\to PP$ decays can be established. Three RMEs arise from the contributions from electroweak penguins. When the $O_{7,8}$ operators are neglected, these three RMEs can be incorporated into other amplitudes according to the EWP-tree relations. Under the QCD factorization framework, we also give an explicit verification of the EWP-tree relations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.21292v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this manuscript we examine the high energy channeling radiation data sets from the CERN-NA63 experiment using ultra relativistic synchrotron emission. To incorporate recoil, we examine the standard quasi-classical formalism as well as develop a formalism which includes the Unruh effect by utilizing a hyperbolic recoil acceleration, based on conservation of momentum, in the classical synchrotron trajectory. We also perform an asymptotic radiation time scale analysis which predicts a photon energy threshold, beyond which the Unruh effect dominates. We then compare the classical, quasi-classical, and Unruh synchrotron theories to the data. We find that above threshold, the Unruh effect saturates the spectrum of all data sets.</description>

      <title>Concurrent Exploration of Axion-Like Particle Interactions with Gauge Bosons at the LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21305v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Axion-like particles (ALPs) are pseudo Nambu-Goldstone bosons associated with spontaneously broken global symmetries incorporated in the Standard Model (SM) Lagrangian in many models beyond the SM. The existence of a light ALP is plausible due to the long-standing problems that the SM has not been able to address, such as the dark matter (DM) problem and the observed matter-antimatter asymmetry. There are many proposals in recent decades considering the ALP as a solution to some of these shortcomings. Motivated by such potential, we search for ALPs with a mass of 1 MeV at the LHC in a model-independent fashion. We explore two complementary production modes: ALP production in association with a pair of electroweak gauge bosons ($ZZ$ or $WW$) and ALP production in association with a single gauge boson ($W$ or $Z$) plus jets. For the $VV+a$ final state, signal and dominant SM backgrounds are generated, and a realistic detector response simulation is performed. A multivariate analysis is employed to discriminate the $VV+a$ signal from background processes, and the expected $95\%$ confidence level (CL) exclusion limits in two-dimensional parameter spaces involving the ALP couplings are subsequently derived. The $V$+jets channel is interpreted using LHC measurements in regimes where the ALP escapes detection, appearing as missing energy. The two analyses are complementary: both the $VV+a$ and the $V$+jets channels probe simultaneously the ALP couplings to gluons and to electroweak gauge bosons. While the $VV+a$ channel offers clean multi-lepton final states and direct reconstruction of the $ZZ$ or $WW$ system, the $V$+jets channel benefits from larger production cross sections, enabling stronger constraints in certain regions of the parameter space.</description>

      <title>Charmed $\Lambda_c^+$ baryon decays into light scalar mesons in the topological $SU(3)_f$ framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using the topological-diagram approach based on $SU(3)$ flavor symmetry, we investigate two-body $\Lambda_c^+\to {\bf B}S$ decays, where $\Lambda_c^+$ is a member of the anti-triplet charmed baryons (${\bf B}_c$), ${\bf B}$ denotes a final-state baryon, and $S$ refers to a light scalar meson, such as $f_0/f_0(980)$, $a_0/a_0(980)$, $\sigma_0/f_0(500)$, or $\kappa/K_0^*(700)$. Our analysis demonstrates that short-distance contributions, represented by the topological amplitudes, play a dominant role in these decays. In particular, this framework naturally accounts for the experimentally observed branching ratio ${\cal B}(\Lambda_c^+ \to \Lambda a_0^+)$, which exceeds predictions based solely on long-distance effects by an order of magnitude. Considering the light scalar mesons as tentraquark states, we predict ${\cal B}(\Lambda_c^+\to p f_0,p\sigma_0) =(1.7\pm 0.6,0.02\pm0.01)\times 10^{-3}$ and ${\cal B}(\Lambda_c^+\to \Sigma^{+} f_0,\Sigma^{+} \sigma_0) =(0.7\pm 0.5, 1.5\pm 0.7)\times 10^{-2}$. In addition, the decay $\Lambda_c^+ \to \Xi^0 \kappa^+$, which proceeds via a single $W$-exchange diagram, is found to have a branching fraction of $(4.9 \pm 0.9) \times 10^{-2}$. These results suggest that the branching ratios of ${\bf B}_c \to {\bf B} S$ are generally comparable to those of ${\bf B}_c \to {\bf B}M$, where $M$ denotes a pseudoscalar meson. The predicted rates are sufficiently large to be probed in current experiments at BESIII, Belle II, and LHCb, offering promising opportunities to explore the internal structure of light scalar mesons.</description>

      <title>Automation of a Matching On-Shell Calculator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce $\texttt{mosca}$, a $\texttt{Mathematica}$ package designed to facilitate on-shell calculations in effective field theories (EFTs). This initial release focuses on the reduction of Green's bases to physical bases, as well as transformations between arbitrary operator bases. The core of the package is based on a diagrammatic on-shell matching procedure, grounded in the equivalence of physical observables derived from both redundant and non-redundant Lagrangians. $\texttt{mosca}$ offers a complete set of tools for performing basis transformations, diagram isomorphism detection, numerical substitution of kinematic configurations, and symbolic manipulation of algebraic expressions. Planned future developments include extension to one-loop computations, thus providing support for EFT renormalization directly in a physical basis and automated computation of one-loop finite matching, including contributions from evanescent operators. The package, along with example notebooks and documentation, is available at: https://gitlab.com/matchingonshell/mosca.</description>

      <title>$D\to P \ell^+\ell^-$ decays assisted by QCD light-cone sum rules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21369v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We suggest a new method to analyse the rare $D_{(s)}\to P \ell^+\ell^-$ decays ($P=\pi,K$), combining QCD light-cone sum rules (LCSR) with hadronic dispersion relations. As our main study case, we consider the $D^+\to\pi^+\ell^+\ell^-$ mode which attracts much of interest from the point of view of GIM cancellation and potential new sources of the FCNC $c\to u$ transitions. The hadronic amplitude of this decay is dominated by the combination of weak annihilation with the emission of a virtual photon. This $D^+\to \pi^+\gamma^*$ amplitude is calculated at spacelike photon virtualities, $-q^2 \gg \Lambda_{QCD}^2$, using LCSR with pion distribution amplitudes. The LCSR results are then fitted to the hadronic dispersion relation in the variable $q^2$. The fit allows us to determine relative phases of the $\rho$-,$\omega$- and $\phi$-meson terms and to estimate the contributions of heavier hadronic states. The latter are parameterized in two different ways: first, with a $z$-expansion and second, using a model with excited vector-meson resonances. The resulting $D^+\to\pi^+\ell^+\ell^-$ width obtained from the LCSR-assisted dispersion relation is not much smaller than the current upper bound measured by LHCb collaboration. In comparison with our result for the dominant $D^+\to \pi^+\gamma^*$ transition, the contribution induced by the short distance $c\to u \ell^+\ell^-$ quark transition generated by the effective $O_9$ operator in Standard Model turns out to be practically invisible. To detect its effect, one readily needs a enhancement of the coefficient $C_9$ from non-standard effects by many orders of magnitude. We also establish new $U$-spin symmetry relations between the amplitudes of $D\to P \ell^+\ell^-$ decays and apply our method to the Cabibbo-favoured modes $D^+_s\to\pi^+\ell^+\ell^-$ and $D^0\to\bar{K}^0\ell^+\ell^-$ which proceed via the same weak annihilation mechanism.</description>

      <title>The $\Lambda_c^+\to\Lambda\pi^+\pi^+\pi^-$ reaction, and a triangle singularity producing the $\Sigma^*(1430)$ state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21403v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the decay $\Lambda_c^+ \to \Lambda \pi^+ \pi^+ \pi^-$, focusing on the production of the $\Sigma^*(1430)$ resonance observed by the Belle Collaboration. Interpreted as a dynamically generated state from meson-baryon interactions in the chiral unitary approach, the $\Sigma^*(1430)$ signal is shown to be enhanced by a triangle singularity involving intermediate $K^{*-}$, $p$, and $\bar K^0$ states. This mechanism leads to a sharp peak near 1434 MeV in the $\pi^+ \Lambda$ invariant mass distribution, in agreement with the experimental observations, and predicts a secondary peak around 1875 MeV in the $\pi^- \Sigma^*(1430)$ spectrum tied to the triangle singularity. We also estimate the branching ratio of $\Lambda_c^+ \to \pi^+ \pi^- \Sigma^*(1430)$ to be about $3.5 \times 10^{-4}$. The results for the branching ratio and the $\pi^- \Sigma^*(1430)$ mass distributions are predictions of the theoretical approach, which could be tested with reanalysis of existing data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.21405v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the presence of a finite modular flavour symmetry, fermion mass hierarchies may be generated by a slight deviation of the modulus from a symmetric point. We point out that this small parameter governing charged-lepton mass hierarchies may also be responsible for the breaking of lepton number in a symmetry-protected low-scale seesaw, sourcing active neutrino masses and the mass splitting of a pseudo-Dirac pair of heavy neutrinos. We look into the phenomenological implications of this mechanism.</description>

      <title>The anomalous magnetic moment of the muon in the Standard Model: an update</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the current Standard Model (SM) prediction for the muon anomalous magnetic moment, $a_\mu$, updating the first White Paper (WP20) [1]. The pure QED and electroweak contributions have been further consolidated, while hadronic contributions continue to be responsible for the bulk of the uncertainty of the SM prediction. Significant progress has been achieved in the hadronic light-by-light scattering contribution using both the data-driven dispersive approach as well as lattice-QCD calculations, leading to a reduction of the uncertainty by almost a factor of two. The most important development since WP20 is the change in the estimate of the leading-order hadronic-vacuum-polarization (LO HVP) contribution. A new measurement of the $e^+e^-\to\pi^+\pi^-$ cross section by CMD-3 has increased the tensions among data-driven dispersive evaluations of the LO HVP contribution to a level that makes it impossible to combine the results in a meaningful way. At the same time, the attainable precision of lattice-QCD calculations has increased substantially and allows for a consolidated lattice-QCD average of the LO HVP contribution with a precision of about 0.9\%. Adopting the latter in this update has resulted in a major upward shift of the total SM prediction, which now reads $a_\mu^\text{SM} = 116\,592\,033(62)\times 10^{-11}$ (530 ppb). When compared against the current experimental average based on the E821 experiment and runs 1-3 of E989 at Fermilab, one finds $a_\mu^\text{exp} - a_\mu^\text{SM} =26(66)\times 10^{-11}$, which implies that there is no tension between the SM and experiment at the current level of precision. The final precision of E989 is expected to be around 140 ppb, which is the target of future efforts by the Theory Initiative. The resolution of the tensions among data-driven dispersive evaluations of the LO HVP contribution will be a key element in this endeavor.</description>

      <title>Across the Universe: Dark Matter and Galaxy Cross-Correlations with the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20383v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO) will be a ground-based Cherenkov telescope performing wide-sky surveys, ideal for anisotropy studies such as cross-correlations with tracers of the cosmic large-scale structure. Cross-correlations can shed light on high-energy $\gamma$-ray sources and potentially reveal exotic signals from particle dark matter. In this work, we investigate CTAO sensitivity to cross-correlation signals between $\gamma$-ray emission and galaxy distributions. We find that by using dense, low-redshift catalogs like 2MASS, and for integration times around 50 hours, this technique achieves sensitivities to both annihilating and decaying dark matter signals that are competitive with those from dwarf galaxy and cluster analyses.</description>

      <title>Cosmological impact of $\nu$DM interactions enhanced in narrow redshift ranges</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.20396v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The impact of dark matter-neutrino ($\nu$DM) interactions on cosmological perturbations has regained attention, spurred by indications of non-zero couplings from high-multipole cosmic microwave background data, weak lensing, and Lyman-$\alpha$ observations. We demonstrate that a similar observational preference is obtained if $\nu$DM interactions are primarily enhanced during a specific epoch, $z\sim (10^4-10^5)$, leading to $&gt;3\sigma$ preference for a non-zero interaction in the combined Atacama Cosmology Telescope and cosmic shear data. This redshift-limited enhancement circumvents other cosmological and astrophysical bounds and can be achieved within a neutrino portal dark matter framework incorporating resonantly enhanced scattering rates.</description>

      <title>Quantum computation of hadron scattering in a lattice gauge theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.20408v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a digital quantum computation of two-hadron scattering in a $Z_2$ lattice gauge theory in 1+1 dimensions. We prepare well-separated single-particle wave packets with desired momentum-space wavefunctions, and simulate their collision through digitized time evolution. Multiple hadronic wave packets can be produced using the efficient, systematically improvable algorithm of this work, achieving high fidelity with the target initial state. Specifically, employing a trapped-ion quantum computer (IonQ Forte), we prepare up to three meson wave packets using 11 and 27 system qubits, and simulate collision dynamics of two meson wave packets for the smaller system. Results for local observables are consistent with numerical simulations at early times, but decoherence effects limit evolution into long times. We demonstrate the critical role of high-fidelity initial states for precision measurements of state-sensitive observables, such as $S$-matrix elements. Our work establishes the potential of quantum computers in simulating hadron-scattering processes in strongly interacting gauge theories.</description>

      <title>Constraints on the symmetric mass generation paradigm for lattice chiral gauge theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20436v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Within the symmetric mass generation (SMG) approach to the construction of lattice chiral gauge theories, one attempts to use interactions to render mirror fermions massive without symmetry breaking, thus obtaining the desired chiral massless spectrum. If successful, the gauge field can be turned on, and thus a chiral gauge theory can be constructed in the phase in which SMG takes place. In this paper we argue that the zeros that often replace the mirror poles of fermion two-point functions in an SMG phase are ``kinematical'' singularities, which can be avoided by choosing an appropriate set of interpolating fields that contains both elementary and composite fields. This allows us to apply general constraints on the existence of a chiral fermion spectrum which are valid in the presence of (non-gauge) interactions of arbitrary strength, including in any SMG phase. Using a suitably constructed one-particle lattice hamiltonian describing the fermion spectrum, we discuss the conditions for the applicability of the Nielsen-Ninomiya theorem to this hamiltonian. If these conditions are satisfied, the massless fermion spectrum must be vector-like. We add some general observations on the strong coupling limit of SMG models. Finally, we elaborate on the qualitative differences between four-dimensional and two-dimensional theories that limit the lessons that can be drawn from two-dimensional models.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Structural Properties of Anisotropic Dark Matter-Admixed Quark Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20545v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate anisotropic compact stars comprising two non-interacting fluids: quark matter and condensed dark matter. Using the MIT Bag model equation of state for quark matter and Bose-Einstein Condensate equation of state for dark matter, we numerically compute interior solutions for those two-fluid component spherical configurations. Varying the initial central density ratio of dark matter to quark matter, we examine how different proportions of these components influence the mass-radius profile, the factor of compactness as well as the quark mass fraction. Recent studies suggest that quark matter may exist in the cores of massive neutron stars, significantly affecting their structure and stability. We calculate the factor of compactness for both negative and positive anisotropy cases explored in this article. Our findings demonstrate that dark matter-admixed quark stars are more compact yet less massive compared to pure quark matter stars, aligning with recent theoretical predictions and gravitational wave observations.</description>

      <title>Strong coupling and instabilities in singularity-free inflation from an infinite sum of curvature corrections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20586v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Four-dimensional gravitational theories derived from an infinite sum of Lovelock curvature invariants, combined with a conformal rescaling of the metric, are equivalent to a subclass of shift-symmetric Horndeski theories that possess a single scalar degree of freedom. Under the assumption of a homogeneous and isotropic cosmological background, the theory admits an inflationary solution that replaces the Big Bang singularity. This can be achieved by a solution where the Hubble expansion rate $H$ is equal to the time derivative of the scalar field $\dot{\phi}$. We show that the solution $H=\dot{\phi}$ suffers from a strong coupling problem, characterized by the vanishing kinetic term of linear scalar perturbations at all times. Consequently, nonlinear scalar perturbations remain uncontrolled from the onset of inflation throughout the subsequent cosmological evolution. Moreover, tensor perturbations are generally subject to Laplacian instabilities during inflation. This instability in the tensor sector also persists under background initial conditions where $H \neq \dot{\phi}$. In the latter case, both the coefficient of the kinetic term for scalar perturbations and the scalar sound speed diverge at the onset of inflation. Thus, the dominance of inhomogeneities in this theory renders the homogeneous background solution illegitimate.</description>

      <title>Inflationary power spectrum from the Lanczos algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20595v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The generalized Lanczos algorithm can provide a universal method for constructing the wave function under the group structure of Hamiltonian. Based on this fact, we obtain an open two-mode squeezed state as the quantum origin for the curvature perturbation. In light of this wave function in the open system, we successfully develop a new method to calculate its corresponding power spectrum by using the Bogoliubov transformation. Unlike traditional approaches, we explicitly retain the Bogoliubov coefficients in terms of the squeezing amplitude \( r_k \) and the squeezing rotation angle \( \phi_k \). As a result, the power spectrum of the open two-mode squeezed state will match that of the Bunch-Davies vacuum numerically. Furthermore, the derivation of the open two-mode squeezed state relies on the second kind Meixner polynomial (equivalent to the generalized Lanczos algorithm) and the symmetry of the Hamiltonian. Therefore, our research may offer a new insight into the calculation of the correlation functions through a group-theoretic perspective.</description>

      <title>Integrable Non-Holonomic Constraints and Gauge Fixing in Classical Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20684v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show how the usual derivation of the equations of motion for a classical field theory with non-holonomic constraints, constraints that depend on the derivatives of the field, fails. As a result, the usual method for gauge fixing in classical and quantum field theories fails for general gauges that depend on the derivatives of the fields, such as the Coulomb and Lorenz gauges. The point of failure occurs at the use of the transposition rule, $\delta(\partial_\nu A^\mu)=\partial_\nu(\delta A^\mu)$, in the derivation of the equations of motion from the extremization of the action; we show that the transposition rule does not hold for general non-holonomic constraints. We define the concept of integrability of non-holonomic constraints in field theory and prove that the usual transposition rule holds for theories with these constraints. We are thus able to recover the usual treatment of gauge fixing for gauges of this type. We apply our formalism to the specific examples of the Coulomb and Lorenz gauges.</description>

      <title>Slowly Rotating and Tidal Deformation of Nonlocal Modified Tolman VII Star</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20886v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the moment of inertia, quadrupole deformation, and tidal deformation within the framework of nonlocal gravity, utilizing the exact modified Tolman-VII (NEMTVII) density model with an isotropic perfect fluid. The Love number~$(k_{2})$ is derived using standard even-parity perturbation theory. Additionally, we explore the observational implications by analyzing the tidal deformability parameter~$( \lambda_{\textrm{tid}} )$ in comparison with the constraints from GW170817, GW190425, PSR J0348+0432, and PSR J0740+6620. We found that the results are consistent with the tidal constraint when $\alpha \gtrsim 1.6$ with the small $\beta$. For slowly rotating object, the dimensionless moment of inertia~$( \bar{I} )$, rotational Love parameter~$( \bar{\lambda}_{\textrm{rot}} )$, and quadrupole moment~$( \bar{Q} )$ are fully determined by the perturbed metric. Our findings reveal that the nonlocal parameter~$( \beta )$ significantly affects the star radius. For a fixed $\beta$ and varying $\alpha$, the $I$-Love-$Q$ relations are found to be universal. For varying $\beta$, the $I$-Love-$Q$ relations become non-universal.</description>

      <title>Parameter inference of microlensed gravitational waves using neural spline flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20996v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When gravitational waves (GWs) propagate near massive objects, they undergo gravitational lensing that imprints lens model dependent modulations on the waveform. This effect provides a powerful tool for cosmological and astrophysical studies. However, conventional Bayesian parameter inference methods for GWs are computationally expensive, especially for lensed events with additional lens parameters, necessitating more efficient approaches. In this work, we explore the use of neural spline flows (NSFs) for posterior inference of microlensed GWs, and successfully apply NSFs to the inference of 13-dimensional lens parameters. Our results demonstrate that compared with traditional methods like Bilby dynesty that rely on Bayesian inference, the NSF network we built not only achieves inference accuracy comparable to traditional methods for the main parameters, but also can reduce the inference time from approximately 3 days to 0.8 s on average. Additionally, the network exhibits strong generalization for the spin parameters of GW sources. It is anticipated to become a powerful tool for future low-latency searches for lensed GW signals.</description>

      <title>Polaron formation as the vertex function problem: From Dyck's paths to self-energy Feynman diagrams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21054v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel iterative method for generating all self-energy Feynman diagrams of any given order for the single polaron problem. This approach offers an effective tool for circumventing the sign problem that often arises in approximation-free numerical summations of Feynman diagrams. Each iterative step begins by rigorously listing all noncrossing diagrams using the graphical Dyck path representation of Stieltjes-Rogers polynomials, which exactly encode the Feynman diagram series. In the second phase, the Ward-Takahashi identity is used to uniquely identify the complete subset of vertex function contributions from the self-energy diagrams obtained in the previous iterative step. Finally, the noncrossing diagrams and vertex function contributions are combined to construct the full set of Feynman diagrams at a given order of the diagrammatic expansion, determining the number of diagrams of various types. This approach establishes a systematic procedure for generating the total sum of diagrams in a given order, enabling significant sign cancellation and making it broadly suitable for numerical summation techniques involving Feynman diagrams.</description>

      <title>Dyons in higher-dimensional gauge theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21158v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss the 't Hooft-Polyakov (TP) monopole and then dyon in the framework of the higher dimensional gauge theories, such as the gauge-Higgs unification models. First, we point out that the Bogomol'nyi-Prasad-Sommerfield (BPS) monopole is nothing but a self-dual gauge field in the 4-dimensional (4D) space including the extra dimension. This property is argued to have an inevitable remarkable consequence that the mass of the BPS monopole $M_{{\rm TPM}}$ and therefore the vacuum expectation value (VEV) of the Higgs field are topologically quantized. Next, the argument is generalized to the case of dyon.The mass of the BPS dyon, $M_{{\rm BPS}}$, is still proportional to the quantized Higgs VEV, though it also depends on a parameter $\mu$, denoting the ratio of the electric and magnetic charges of the dyon. In this paper, we propose a novel mechanism to quantize the parameter $\mu$ too. We demonstrate that in the 5D gauge theories the Chern-Simons term is induced at the quantum level, which, after the extra space component of the gauge field is replaced by its VEV, produces the $\theta$ term. Here again the VEV is quantized and through the Witten effect we reach to a remarkable conclusion that the electric charge of the dyon, and therefore the parameter $\mu$ is discretized. This means that $M_{{\rm BPS}}$ is also discretized. In addition, we propose a numerical method to obtain the field configurations and the mass of the non-BPS dyons by use of ``modified" gradient flow equations. We find that the obtained field configurations of non-BPS dyon and its mass are rather close to those of the BPS dyon.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.21256v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We set up and perform collision rate simulations between dark matter in the form of asteroid-mass primordial black holes (PBHs) and white dwarf stars. These encounters trigger prompt detonations and could be the key to solving the ignition mystery of type Ia supernovae. Our framework is flexible enough to cover the full range of progenitor white dwarf masses, host galaxy stellar masses, galactocentric radial offsets, and cosmic time. The rate distribution pattern is consistent with exhaustive literature observational determinations for a slightly extended log-normal PBH mass spectrum. Most strikingly, the so far unexplained brightness distribution comes out without finetuning.

      <title>Dark-matter-induced transients over cosmic time: The role of star formation history profiles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21260v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dark matter (DM) conundrum is one of the most intriguing due to its resistance in direct detection experiments. In recent years, attempts to identify non-gravitational signatures as the result of DM traversing or accumulating within stars have attracted a lot of attention. These calculations are usually evaluated at the order-of-magnitude level for stellar populations where the DM density is highest, such as galactic centers. However, if the signature implies the destruction of the host star, their population could have been diminished over a Hubble time in the most DM-dense regions, unless replenished by star formation. This circumstance exemplifies the need for galactic star formation history profiles when deriving DM-induced transient rates, in particular for predicting the host-offset distribution. Here, we combine theoretical and empirical scaling relations of galaxy structure, star formation, and stellar initial mass function to construct a simple and efficient framework that permits us to estimate the target population formation rate and mass function within galactocentric radial zones across galaxy stellar masses and cosmic time. In a companion paper, we apply the framework to the hypothesis that DM in the form of primordial black holes accounts for the ignition of normal type Ia supernovae when colliding with white dwarf stars.</description>

      <title>Generalized Collective Coordinate Quantization of Solitons with Topological Terms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21345v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the $\theta+$ pentaquark does not exist in the Skyrme model. For the solitons of the theory with topological terms, the standard collective coordinate quantization does not construct the proper low energy effective theory. In the presence of topological terms, zero modes are classified into three groups: dynamical zero modes with constant velocity, cyclotron zero modes in a circular orbit, and static constraint zero modes. According to the mode expansion, the topological term contributes to the moduli metric of the dynamical zero modes. In addition, constraint zero modes do not have the kinetic term and produce constraints that strongly restrict the spectrum instead. In this paper, we propose a generalized collective coordinate quantization method and apply it to the SU(3) Skyrmion with the Wess- Zumino-Witten term. We find five constraints. These reproduce the results of [1], eliminating all the SU(3) multiplets except the nucleon octet and $\Delta$ baryon decuplet from the baryon spectrum.</description>

      <title>Non-minimal light-curvature couplings and black-hole imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21431v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-minimal couplings between the electromagnetic field strength and the spacetime curvature are part of the effective field theory of gravity and matter. They alter the local propagation of light in a significant way if the ratio of spacetime curvature to the non-minimal coupling is of order one. Spacetime curvature can become appreciable around black holes, and yet the effect of non-minimal couplings on electromagnetic observations of black holes remains underexplored. A particular feature of the non-minimal coupling between the electromagnetic field-strength and the Riemann tensor is that it generates two distinct photon rings for different polarizations. Working within the paradigm of lensing bands, and focusing on the $n=1$ photon ring, we investigate which values of the non-minimal coupling can be robustly excluded.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.21489v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this Letter, we study scalar wave perturbations of arbitrary frequency to the 5D Schwarzschild-Tangherlini black hole (STBH) within general relativity. For the first time, we derive a closed formula for the 5D partial wave gravitational Raman scattering amplitude applicable to a broad class of boundary conditions, expressed in terms of the Nekrasov-Shatashvili (NS) function for the reduced confluent Heun problem. Furthermore, up to $O(G^2)$ we compute the dynamical $\ell=0$, and the static $\ell=1$, scalar tidal Love numbers of the STBH by matching an effective field theory description for a scalar wave scattering off the black hole, to our novel ultraviolet-NS solutions. The matched Love numbers do not vanish and present renormalization group running behavior.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.11079v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive the Leading Order DGLAP evolution of gluon distribution function in the target light cone gauge starting from its standard operator definition. The derivation is performed using the background field formalism also employed in the Color Glass Condensate effective theory of small $x$ QCD. We adopt Mandelstam-Leibbrandt prescription to regulate in an unambiguous way the spurious singularity appearing in the light-cone gauge Feynman propagator. UV divergences are regulated via dimensional regularization. The methods introduced in this paper represent the first steps in the construction of a unified framework for QCD evolution, which could address collinear physics as well as small $x$ physics and gluon saturation.</description>

      <title>A New Determination of the (Z,A) Dependence of Coherent Muon-to-Electron Conversion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.15025v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Should muon-to-electron conversion in the field of a nucleus be found in the current generation of experiments, the measurement of the atomic number dependence of the process will become an important experimental goal. We present a new treatment of the (Z,A) dependence of coherent muon-to-electron conversion in 236 isotopes. Our approach differs from previous treatments in several ways. Firstly, we include the effect of permanent quadrupole deformation on the charged lepton flavor violating matrix elements, using the method of Barrett moments. This method also enables the addition of muonic X-ray nuclear size and shape determinations of the charge distribution to the electron scattering results used previously. Secondly, we employ a Hartree-Bogoliubov model to calculate neutron-related matrix elements for even-even nuclei. This takes into account the quadrupole deformation of the neutron distributions and the fact that neutrons are, in general, in different shell model orbits than protons. The calculated conversion rates differ from previous calculations, particularly in the region of large permanent quadrupole deformation. Finally, we propose an alternative normalization of the muon-to-electron conversion rated, which related more closely to what a given experiment acturally measures, and better separate lepton physics from nuclear physics effects.</description>

      <title>Charm and Bottom Hadrons in Hot Hadronic Matter</title>

Abstract: Heavy quarks, and the hadrons containing them, are excellent probes of the QCD medium formed in high-energy heavy-ion collisions, as they provide essential information on the transport properties of the medium and how quarks color-neutralize into hadrons. Large theoretical and phenomenological efforts have been dedicated thus far to assess the diffusion of charm and bottom quarks in the quark-gluon plasma and their subsequent hadronization into heavy-flavor (HF) hadrons. However, the fireball formed in heavy-ion collisions also features an extended hadronic phase, and therefore any quantitative analysis of experimental observables needs to account for the rescattering of charm and bottom hadrons. This is further reinforced by the presence of a QCD cross-over transition and the notion that the interaction strength is maximal in the vicinity of the pseudo-critical temperature. We review existing approaches for evaluating the interactions of open HF hadrons in a hadronic heat bath and the pertinent results for scattering amplitudes, spectral functions and transport coefficients. While most of the work to date has focused on $D$-mesons, we also discuss excited states as well as HF baryons and the bottom sector. Both the HF hadro-chemistry and bottom observables will play a key role in future experimental measurements. We also conduct a survey of transport calculations in heavy-ion collisions that have included effects of hadronic HF diffusion and assess its impact on various observables.</description>

      <title>Polarized $W^+W^-$ pairs at the LHC: Effects from bottom-quark induced processes at NLO QCD+EW</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06396v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the effects of the bottom-quark induced processes on the doubly polarized cross sections of $W^+W^-$ pair production at the LHC. The method to extract the on-shell single-top contribution is provided. Results for phenomenological and experimental analyses are given at next-to-leading order (NLO) QCD+EW accuracy, with the leading contribution from the gluon-gluon and photon-photon fusion included. We found that the contribution of the bottom-quark induced processes, after the subtraction of the on-shell $tW$ channel, is largest for the doubly longitudinal polarization. At the integrated cross section level, using a fiducial ATLAS cut with a jet veto, the effect is $9\%$ compared to the NLO value of the light-quark contribution. It increases to $13\%$ after removing the jet veto. A bound of the $tW$ interference is calculated for various kinematic distributions, showing that this interference effect is, in general, smaller for the no jet veto case. Relevant scale uncertainties are calculated to help us decide on the importance of this interference.</description>

      <title>Extension of the integrated HydroKinetic Model to BES RHIC and GSI-FAIR nuclear collision energies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00458v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The work presented is devoted to developing the integrated hydrokinetic approach (iHKM) for relativistic nucleus-nucleus collisions. While the previous cycle of works on this topic focused on ultra-relativistic collisions at the top RHIC and different LHC energies, the current work addresses relativistic collisions at lower energies, specifically ranging from approximately 1 to 50 GeV per nucleon pair in the center-of-mass colliding system. The formation times for the initial state of dense matter in such collisions can be up to three orders of magnitude longer than those in ultra-relativistic collisions. This reflects a fundamentally different nature and formation process, particularly concerning the possible stages of initial state evolution, including thermalization (which may be only partial at very low collision energies), subsequent hydrodynamic expansion, and the final transition of matter evolution into a hadronic cascade. These stages, which are fully realized in ultra-relativistic reactions, can also occur within the energy range of BES RHIC, albeit with distinct time scales. This publication not only advances the theoretical development of iHKM (referred to, if necessary, as the extended version of integrated Hydrokinetic Model, iHKMe), but also provides examples of model applications for calculating observables. A systematic description across a wide range of experimental energies, which is preliminary yet quite satisfactory, for spectra, flow, and femtoscopy, will follow this work.</description>

      <title>An EWPD SMEFT likelihood for the LHC -- and how to improve it with measurements of W and Z boson properties</title>

Abstract: This paper presents a computer code for analyzing electroweak precision data (EWPD) in the framework of the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT), highlights the importance of recent ATLAS and CMS precision measurements, and introduces a novel analysis of the forward-backward asymmetry at the LHC. The computer code provides the likelihood of SMEFT Wilson coefficients based on precision measurements of $W$ and $Z$ pole observables, interpolation formulas for Standard Model predictions, and modular SMEFT parametrizations. SMEFT predictions including next-to-leading-order (NLO) effects in perturbative and SMEFT expansion are available and five alternative electroweak input parameter schemes are supported. The likelihood addresses shortcomings of previous formulations in the treatment of parametric uncertainties and can be straightforwardly included in SMEFT fits of LHC data. The input parameter scheme dependence and role of NLO corrections is studied for the EWPD fit in the SMEFT. Furthermore, the impact of recent ATLAS and CMS measurements - of the $W$ boson mass and width, of the lepton flavour universality (LFU) of $W$ branching fractions, and the effective leptonic weak mixing angle - is analyzed. A test of LFU that surpasses the precision of existing measurements is proposed based on the weak mixing angle measurement. Finally, an ATLAS Drell-Yan triple-differential cross-section measurement is reinterpreted in the SMEFT and combined with the EWPD likelihood. This analysis demonstrates the feasibility of the LFU precision test, improves constraints on muon couplings with respect to the world average, and determines a combination of the quark-coupling asymmetry parameters $A_u$ and $A_d$ with a precision comparable to that of the heavy flavour parameters $A_c$ and $A_b$.</description>

      <title>keV sterile neutrino dark matter and associated phenomenology in doublet left-right symmetric model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.18869v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Considering the fact that no Standard Model (SM) particle can account as a suitable dark matter candidate in the relevant studies, several Beyond Standard Model (BSM) frameworks incorporate within itself some extra fields depending upon the model taken into account. Left-Right Symmetric Model (LRSM) is one such BSM framework which can successfully explain the origin of neutrino masses and also give an elaborative elucidation of the associated phenomenology like Neutrinoless Double Beta Decay $(0\nu\beta\beta)$, Lepton Flavor Violation (LFV), baryogenesis via leptogenesis etc. However, in spite of the presence of several new fields within the model, none of them can stand as a suitable dark matter candidate. This compels us to extend LRSM with extra scalars or fermions depending upon the type of study to be taken into account. In the current work, we extend LRSM with a sterile fermion per generation and the lightest of which acts as the Dark Matter (DM) candidate. The realization of the model has been done using modular symmetry, where we have used modular group $\Gamma(3)$ of weight 2 which is isomorphic to non-abelian discrete symmetry group $A_{4}$. We have then calculated the relic abundance as well the decay rate of the corresponding DM candidate and also studied $0\nu\beta\beta$ and LFV within the model and the results have been discussed in detail within the manuscript.</description>

Abstract: We investigate potential hadronic molecular states in the $D^{(*)}\bar D^{(*)}$ and $B^{(*)}\bar B^{*}$ systems using light meson exchange interactions. Our analysis focuses on coupled-channel systems with spin-parity quantum numbers $J^{PC}=0^{++}$, $1^{+\pm}$ and $2^{++}$, examining how the $\delta(r)$ potential affects states near threshold. Using coupled-channel analysis, we reproduce the $X(3872)$ mass with a given cutoff for the $(I)J^{PC}=(0)1^{++}$ state, finding a minimal impact from the $\delta(r)$ term. At this cutoff, both the $(0)0^{++}$ state near the $D\bar D$ threshold and the $(0)1^{+-}$ state near the $D\bar D^*$ threshold show less sensitivity to the $\delta(r)$ term compared to the three states-$(0)0^{++}$, $(0)1^{+-}$, and $(0)2^{++}$-near the $D^*\bar D^*$ threshold. As anticipated, the $B^{(*)}\bar B^{*}$ systems exhibit similar behavior but with stronger binding due to their larger reduced mass. These findings suggest promising directions for future experimental searches, particularly in the isoscalar sector, which could substantially advance our understanding of exotic tetraquark states.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.09720v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using recent lattice QCD results for gravitational form factors, we show that the Wigner-Weyl transform of the QCD energy-momentum tensor is of exotic type IV (in the Hawking-Ellis classification) in the interior of the proton, implying that in this region: (i) it has no causal eigenvectors, (ii) it violates all (linear, point-wise) energy conditions, (iii) there are local Lorentz frames in which its energy density is zero. This occurs because of the nonzero $T^{0i}$ flux associated with the angular momentum form factor $J(t)$. The energy-momentum tensor turns into a type I tensor, characteristic of ``ordinary matter", at radial distances of $1-2$ proton Compton wavelengths. This transition point defines a ``gravitational radius" for the proton, whose precise determination requires accurate knowledge of QCD form factors for momentum transfer beyond $-t=2$ GeV$^2$. Imposing the validity of the averaged null energy condition (ANEC) of gravity, we derive a new model-independent inequality for the GFFs of the proton in QCD.</description>

      <title>Radiative B to tensor meson decays at NLO in SCET</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.18624v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The radiative $B$ to tensor $\left(K_2^*(1430),\; f_2(1270),\; a_2(1230)\right)$ meson decays are studied at next-to-leading order (NLO) in soft-collinear effective theory (SCET). The SCET allows the systematic treatment of factorizable and non-factorizable contributions along with the resummation of large perturbative logarithms. We performed a two step matching and determined the soft-overlap function $\zeta^\perp_{T}$ and branching ratios for these $B$ to tensor meson decays. In the case of $B\to K_2^*(1430)\gamma$, the numerical value of the branching ratio lies close to its experimental measurements. The estimated values of the branching ratios of CKM suppressed decays $B \to \left(a_2(1230),\; f_2(1270)\right)\gamma$ are significant small compared to that of $B\to K_2^*(1430)\gamma$, but still could be measured in some ongoing and future $B$ physics experiments.</description>

      <title>Covariant Electromagnetism in Past-Light-Cone Formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05481v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a manifestly covariant formulation of relativistic electromagnetism, focusing on the computation of electromagnetic fields from moving charges in a manifestly Lorentz-covariant manner. The electromagnetic field at a given spacetime point is determined by the motion of point charges at the intersection of their worldlines with the past light cone of the spacetime point, ensuring causal consistency. This formalism provides a manifestly covariant generalization of the Li\'enard-Wiechert potentials and allows direct implementation on computers. We compare our formulation with standard textbook approaches and analyze its behavior in various physical limits.</description>

      <title>Probing Lorentz invariance with a high-energy neutrino flare</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15949v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Time-of-flight measurements of high-energy astrophysical neutrinos can be used to probe Lorentz invariance, a pillar of modern physics. If Lorentz-invariance violation (LIV) occurs, it could cause neutrinos to slow down, with the delay scaling linearly or quadratically with their energy. We introduce non-parametric statistical methods designed to detect LIV-induced distortions in the temporal structure of a high-energy neutrino flare as it travels to Earth from a distant astrophysical source, independently of the intrinsic timing properties of the source. Our approach, illustrated using the 2014/2015 TeV-PeV neutrino flare from the blazar TXS 0506+056 detected by IceCube, finds that the LIV energy scale must exceed 10^{14} GeV (linear) or 10^9 GeV (quadratic). Our methods provide a robust means to investigate LIV by focusing solely on a neutrino flare, without relying on electromagnetic counterparts, and account for realistic energy and directional uncertainties. For completeness, we compare our limits inferred from TXS 0506+056 to the sensitivity inferred from multi-messenger detection of tentative coincidences between neutrinos and electromagnetic emission from active galactic nuclei and tidal disruption events.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17738v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study symmetry-breaking inflation within the framework of metric-affine gravity. By introducing a non-minimal coupling, $\beta(\phi)\tilde{\cal R}$, between the Holst invariant and the inflaton, both small-field and large-field inflationary predictions can be brought into agreement with the latest observational constraints. Remarkably, even for sub-Planckian vacuum expectation values, appropriately chosen values of $\beta(\phi)$ enable viable inflation, a scenario previously considered unattainable.</description>

      <title>Cosmological scenario based on the first and second laws of thermodynamics: Thermodynamic constraints on a generalized cosmological model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19032v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The first and second laws of thermodynamics should lead to a consistent scenario for discussing the cosmological constant problem. In the present study, to establish such a thermodynamic scenario, cosmological equations in a flat Friedmann-Lema\^{i}tre-Robertson-Walker universe were derived from the first law, using an arbitrary entropy $S_{H}$ on a cosmological horizon. Then, the cosmological equations were formulated based on a general formulation that includes two extra driving terms, $f_{\Lambda}(t)$ and $h_{\textrm{B}}(t)$, which are usually used for, e.g., time-varying $\Lambda (t)$ cosmology and bulk viscous cosmology, respectively. In addition, thermodynamic constraints on the two terms are examined using the second law of thermodynamics, extending a previous analysis [Phys. Rev. D 99, 043523 (2019) (arXiv:1810.11138)]. It is found that a deviation $S_{\Delta}$ of $S_{H}$ from the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy plays important roles in the two terms. The second law should constrain the upper limits of $f_{\Lambda}(t)$ and $h_{\textrm{B}}(t)$ in our late Universe. The orders of the two terms are likely consistent with the order of the cosmological constant $\Lambda_{\textrm{obs}}$ measured by observations. In particular, when the deviation $S_{\Delta}$ is close to zero, $h_{\textrm{B}}(t)$ and $f_{\Lambda}(t)$ should reduce to zero and a constant value (consistent with the order of $\Lambda_{\textrm{obs}}$), respectively, as if a consistent and viable scenario could be obtained from thermodynamics.</description>

      <title>Search for continuous gravitational wave signals from luminous dark photon superradiance clouds with LVK O3 observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02052v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Superradiance clouds of kinetically-mixed dark photons around spinning black holes can produce observable multi-messenger electromagnetic and gravitational wave signals. The cloud generates electric fields of up to a Teravolt-per-meter, which lead to a cascade production of charged particles, yielding a turbulent quasi-equilibrium plasma around the black hole, and resulting in electromagnetic fluxes ranging from supernova to pulsar-like luminosities. For stellar mass black holes, such systems resemble millisecond pulsars and are expected to emit pulsating radio waves and continuous gravitational waves (CWs) within the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) sensitivity band. We select 44 sources with approximately coincident frequencies or positive frequency drifts from existing pulsar catalogs as potential candidates of long-lasting superradiance clouds around old galactic black holes. For a subset of 34 sources that are well measured and have not been previously targeted, we perform the first search for CW emission in LVK data from the third observing run. We find no evidence of a CW signal and place 95% confidence level upper limits on the emitted strain amplitude. We interpret these results, together with limits from previous searches, in terms of the underlying dark photon theory by performing an analysis of the expected signals from superradiance clouds from galactic black holes. We find that, even for moderately spinning black holes, the absence of an observed CW signal disfavors a discrete set of dark photon masses between about $10^{-13}$ $\rm{eV}/c^2$ and $10^{-12}$ $\rm{eV}/c^2$ and kinetic mixing couplings in the range of $10^{-9}$-$10^{-7}$, subject to assumptions about the properties of the black hole population and the cloud's electromagnetic emission.</description>

      <title>Constraints on New Physics with Light Mediators and Generalized Neutrino Interactions via Coherent Elastic Neutrino Nucleus Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20007v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate new physics effects on the framework of Coherent Elastic Neutrino Nucleus Scattering (CE$\nu$NS) from Non-Standard Interactions (NSI) of neutrinos and generalized neutrino interactions (GNI) as well as the possibility of light mediators from simplified model which includes all possible Lorentz-invariant interactions of vector (V), axialvector (A), scalar (S), pseudoscalar (P), and tensor (T) type. The constraints and the allowed regions at $90\%$ C.L. for masses and couplings in each new physics scenario are derived from the analysis of TEXONO data, including two datasets from 2016 with a high purity $n$-type point-contact (nPC) germanium (Ge) detector and from 2024 with an advanced $p$-type point-contact (pPC) Ge detector. The results are presented in comparison with the current data of COHERENT with CsI and LAr detectors to highlight the complementarity of reactor- and accelerator-based neutrino experiments.</description>

      <title>Angular momentum of glasma</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.07324v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The earliest phase of an ultrarelativistic heavy ion collision can be described as a highly populated system of gluons called glasma. We study some glasma characteristics related to the system's angular momentum. The first one is the global angular momentum perpendicular to the reaction plane, which is spanned by the beam axis and impact parameter vector. We show that only a small fraction of the enormous initial angular momentum of the colliding ultrarelativistic nuclei is transferred to the glasma. Our main focus is the glasma angular momentum directed along the beam axis. This quantity has a local character and results from the inhomogeneous velocity field generated in the glasma. We calculate the vorticity and local angular momentum which show noticeably different behaviour. The results are analyzed in detail and discussed in the context of existing experimental data. We argue that neither vorticity nor thermal vorticity but instead the local angular momentum controls the polarization of final-state hadrons.</description>

      <title>Impact of ACT DR6 and DESI DR2 for Early Dark Energy and the Hubble tension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08051v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The data release six of the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT DR6) and the second data release from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI DR2) recently became available. In light of these data, we update constraints on the Early Dark Energy (EDE) resolution to the Hubble tension. While ACT DR6 does not favor EDE over the core cosmological model $\Lambda$CDM, it allows for a significantly larger maximum contribution of EDE, $f_{\rm EDE}$, in the pre-recombination era than the latest analysis of {\it Planck} NPIPE despite increased precision at small angular scales. Moreover, EDE rises the value of $H_0r_s$, improving consistency between CMB and DESI DR2 data. We find a residual tension with SH0ES of $\sim 2 \sigma$ for the combination of {\it Planck} at $\ell &lt;1000$ + ACT DR6 + lensing + Pantheon-plus + DESI DR2, a significant decrease from $3.7 \sigma$ for analyses that use NPIPE and SDSS BAO data. A profile likelihood analysis reveals significant prior-volume effects in Bayesian analyses which do not include SH$0$ES, with confidence intervals of $f_{\rm EDE}=0.09\pm 0.03$ and $H_0= 71.0\pm1.1$ km/s/Mpc. When including DESI data, the EDE model with $H_0=73$ km/s/Mpc provides a better fit than the $\Lambda$CDM model with $H_0=68.4$ km/s/Mpc. The inclusion of SH$0$ES data rises the preference well above $5\sigma$, with $\Delta\chi^2=-35.4$. Our work demonstrates that after ACT DR6 and DESI DR2, EDE remains a potential resolution to the Hubble tension.</description>

      <title>Graviton-photon conversion in stochastic magnetic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10926v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study graviton-photon conversion in the presence of stochastic magnetic fields. Assuming Gaussian magnetic fields that may possess nontrivial helicity, and unpolarized gravitational waves (GWs) as the initial state, we obtain expressions for the intensity and linear/circular polarizations of GWs after propagation over a finite distance. We calculate both the expectation values and variances of these observables, and find their nontrivial dependence on the typical correlation length of the magnetic field, the propagation distance, and the photon plasma mass. Our analysis reveals that an observationally favorable frequency range with narrower variance can emerge for the intensity, while a peak structure appears in the expectation value of the circular polarization when the magnetic field has nonzero helicity. We also identify a consistency relation between the GW intensity and circular polarization.</description>

      <title>Comparative study of the butterfly velocity in holographic QCD models at finite temperature and chemical potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15357v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we study quantum chaos in a variety of holographic QCD models at finite temperature and chemical potentials. This includes the 1 R-Charge black hole (1RCBH) model, the 2 R-Charge black hole (2RCBH) model, a potential reconstruction-based analytic bottom-up model, and a numerical bottom-up model. All these models are different avatars of the Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton gravity action, distinguished by their specific choices of dilaton potentials and gauge-kinetic coupling functions. We focus on computing the chaos parameter, the butterfly velocity, using three distinct methods: entanglement wedge reconstruction, out-of-time-ordered correlators (OTOCs), and pole-skipping. We show that all three methods yield identical results for the butterfly velocity across all the holographic QCD models considered, further establishing the equivalence between the three approaches. Furthermore, we analyze in detail the behavior of the butterfly velocity as a function of chemical potential and temperature. Interestingly, a universal trend emerges across all models: the butterfly velocity increases/decreases with temperature/chemical potential for thermodynamically stable phases. Additionally, in the high-temperature limit, the butterfly velocity in all models approaches that of the chargeless plasma.</description>
