      <title>Robust Full Waveform Inversion with deep Hessian deblurring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17518v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Full Waveform Inversion (FWI) is a technique widely used in geophysics to obtain high-resolution subsurface velocity models from waveform seismic data. Due to its large computation cost, most flavors of FWI rely only on the computation of the gradient of the loss function to estimate the update direction, therefore ignoring the contribution of the Hessian. Depending on the level of computational resources one can afford, an approximate of the inverse of the Hessian can be calculated and used to speed up the convergence of FWI towards the global (or a plausible local) minimum. In this work, we propose to use an approximate Hessian computed from a linearization of the wave-equation as commonly done in Least-Squares Migration (LSM). More precisely, we rely on the link between a migrated image and a doubly migrated image (i.e., an image obtained by demigration-migration of the migrated image) to estimate the inverse of the Hessian. However, instead of using non-stationary compact filters to link the two images and approximate the Hessian, we propose to use a deep neural network to directly learn the mapping between the FWI gradient (output) and its Hessian (blurred) counterpart (input). By doing so, the network learns to act as an approximate inverse Hessian: as such, when the trained network is applied to the FWI gradient, an enhanced update direction is obtained, which is shown to be beneficial for the convergence of FWI. The weights of the trained (deblurring) network are then transferred to the next FWI iteration to expedite convergence. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach on two synthetic datasets and a field dataset.</description>

      <title>Bright traveling breathers in media with long-range, nonconvex dispersion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.09001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.09001v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The existence and properties of envelope solitary waves on a periodic, traveling wave background, called traveling breathers, are investigated numerically in representative nonlocal dispersive media. Using a fixed point computational scheme, a space-time boundary value problem for bright traveling breather solutions is solved for the weakly nonlinear Benjamin-Bona-Mahony equation, a nonlocal, regularized shallow water wave model, and the strongly nonlinear conduit equation, a nonlocal model of viscous core-annular flows. Curves of unit-mean traveling breather solutions within a three-dimensional parameter space are obtained. Resonance due to nonconvex, rational linear dispersion leads to a nonzero oscillatory background upon which traveling breathers propagate. These solutions exhibit a topological phase jump, so act as defects within the periodic background. For small amplitudes, traveling breathers are well-approximated by bright soliton solutions of the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation with a negligibly small periodic background. These solutions are numerically continued into the large amplitude regime as elevation defects on cnoidal or cnoidal-like periodic traveling wave backgrounds. This study of bright traveling breathers provides insight into systems with nonconvex, nonlocal dispersion that occur in a variety of media such as internal oceanic waves subject to rotation and short, intense optical pulses.</description>
