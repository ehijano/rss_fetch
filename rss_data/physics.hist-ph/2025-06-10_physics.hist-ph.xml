      <title>An elementary method to determine the critical mass of a sphere of fissile material based on a separation of neutron transport and nuclear reaction processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A simplified method to calculate the critical mass of a fissile material sphere is presented. This is a purely pedagogical study, in part to elucidate the historical evolution of criticality calculations. This method employs only elementary calculus and straightforward statistical arguments by formulating the problem in terms of the threshold condition that the number of neutrons in the sphere does not change with time; the average neutron path length in the material must be long enough to produce enough fission neutrons to balance losses by absorption due to nuclear reactions and leakage through the surface. This separates the nuclear reaction part of the problem from the geometry and mechanics of neutron transport, the only connection being the total path length which together with the distance between scatterings determines the sphere radius. This leads to an expression for the critical radius without the need to solve the diffusion equation. Comparison with known critical masses shows agreement at the few-percent level. The analysis can also be applied to impure materials, isotopically or otherwise, and can be extended to general neutronics estimations as a design guide or for order-of-magnitude checking of Monte Carlo N-Particle (MCNP) simulations. A comparison is made with the Oppenheimer-Bethe criticality formula, with the results of other calculations, and with the diffusion equation approach via a new treatment of the boundary conditions.</description>

      <title>Rules and Meaning in Quantum Mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.14634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.14634v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This book concerns the metasemantics of quantum mechanics (QM). Roughly, it pursues an investigation at the intersection of philosophy of physics and philosophy of language, and it offers a critical analysis of rival explanations of the semantic facts of standard QM. Two problems for such explanations are discussed: categoricity and permanence. New results include 1) a reconstruction of Einstein's incompleteness argument, which concludes that a local, separable, and categorical QM cannot exist, 2) a reinterpretation of Bohr's principle of correspondence, grounded in the principle of permanence, 3) a meaning-variance argument for quantum logic, which follows a line of critical reflections initiated by Weyl, and 4) an argument for semantic indeterminacy leveled against inferentialism about QM, inspired by Carnap's work in the philosophy of classical logic.</description>

      <title>Typical Quantum States of the Universe are Observationally Indistinguishable</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16860v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish three new impossibility results regarding our knowledge of the quantum state of the universe -- a central object in quantum theory. We show that, if the universal quantum state is a typical unit vector from a high-dimensional subspace H_0 of Hilbert space H (such as the one defined by a low-entropy macro-state as prescribed by the Past Hypothesis), then no observation can determine or just significantly narrow down which vector it is. In other words, the overwhelming majority of possible state vectors are observationally indistinguishable from each other (and from the density matrix of H_0). Moreover, we show that for any observation that isn't too unlikely and most pairs of unit vectors from H_0, the observation will not significantly favor one vector over the other. We further show that the uniform distribution over the unit sphere in H_0, after Bayesian updating in the light of any observation that isn't too unlikely, is still extremely close to uniform. Our arguments rely on a typicality theorem from quantum statistical mechanics. We also discuss how theoretical considerations beyond empirical evidence might inform our understanding of this fact and our knowledge of the universal quantum state.</description>

      <title>Old Quantum Mechanics by Bohr and Sommerfeld from a Modern Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00408v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We review Bohr's atomic model and its extension by Sommerfeld from a mathematical perspective of wave mechanics. The derivation of quantization rules and energy levels is revisited using semiclassical methods. Sommerfeld-type integrals are evaluated by elementary techniques, and connections with the Schr\"{o}dinger and Dirac equations are established. Historical developments and key transitions from classical to quantum theory are discussed to clarify the structure and significance of the old quantum mechanics.</description>
