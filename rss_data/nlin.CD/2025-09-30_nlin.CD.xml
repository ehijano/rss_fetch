      <title>The Stochastic-Dissipative St\"{o}rmer Problem-Trajectories and Radiation Patterns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25888v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a generalization of the classical nonrelativistic St\"{o}rmer problem, describing the motion of charged particles in a purely magnetic dipole field, by taking into account the effects of the dissipation, assumed to be of friction type, proportional to the velocity of the particle, and of the presence of stochastic forces. In the presence of dissipative/stochastic effects, the motion of the particle in the magnetic dipole field can be described by a generalized Langevin type equation, which generalizes the standard Lorentz force equation. We perform a detailed numerical analysis of the dynamical behavior of the particles in a magnetic dipolar field in the presence of dissipative and stochastic forces, as well as of the electromagnetic radiation patterns emitted during the motion. The effects of the dissipation coefficient and of the stochastic force on the particle motion and on the emitted electromagnetic power are investigated, and thus a full description of the spectrum of the magnetic dipole type electromagnetic radiation and of the physical properties of the motion is also obtained. The power spectral density of the emitted electromagnetic power is also obtained for each case, and, for all considered St\"{o}rmer type models, it shows the presence of peaks in the radiation spectrum, corresponding to certain intervals of the frequency.</description>

      <title>Basic Cycle Ratio: Cost-Effective Ranking of Influential Spreaders from Local and Global Perspectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26220v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spreading processes are fundamental to complex networks. Identifying influential spreaders with dual local and global roles presents a crucial yet challenging task. To address this, our study proposes a novel method, the Basic Cycle Ratio (BCR), for assessing node importance. BCR leverages basic cycles and the cycle ratio to uniquely capture a node's local significance within its immediate neighborhood and its global role in maintaining network cohesion. We evaluated BCR on six diverse real-world social networks. Our method outperformed traditional centrality measures and other cycle-based approaches, proving more effective at selecting powerful spreaders and enhancing information diffusion. Besides, BCR offers a cost-effective and practical solution for social network applications.</description>

      <title>Natural convection in a vertical channel. Part 3. Bifurcations of many (additional) unstable periodic orbits and their dynamical relevance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05524v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Vertical thermal convection system exhibits weak turbulence and spatio-temporally chaotic behaviour. In this system, we report seven equilibria and 26 periodic orbits, all new and linearly unstable. These orbits, together with four previously studied in Zheng et al. (2024b) bring the number of periodic orbit branches computed so far to 30, all solutions to the fully non-linear three-dimensional Navier--Stokes equations. These new invariant solutions capture intricate spatio-temporal flow patterns including straight, oblique, wavy, skewed and distorted convection rolls, as well as bursts and defects in rolls. These interesting and important fluid mechanical processes in a small flow unit are shown to appear locally and instantaneously in a chaotic simulation in a large domain. Most of the solution branches show rich spatial and/or spatio-temporal symmetries. The bifurcation-theoretic organisation of these solutions is discussed; the bifurcation scenarios include Hopf, pitchfork, saddle--node, period-doubling, period-halving, global homoclinic and heteroclinic bifurcations, as well as isolas. These orbits are shown to be able to reconstruct statistically the core part of the attractor, and these results may pave the way to quantitatively describing transitional fluid turbulence using periodic orbit theory.</description>
