      <title>Artificial moir\'{e} engineering for an ideal BHZ model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08540v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate that (001) grown Cd3As2 thin films with a superlattice-patterned gate can potentially realize the moir\'e Bernevig-Hughes-Zhang (BHZ) model. Our calculations identify the parameterization region necessary to achieve topological flat mini-bands with a C4z symmetric and a C6z symmetric potential. Additionally, we show that a spin-polarized state can serve as the minimal platform for hosting the moir\'e induced quantum anomalous Hall effect, supported by Hartree Fock interaction kernel analysis and self-consistent mean field calculations.</description>

      <title>Photon Number Coherence in Quantum Dot-Cavity Systems can be Enhanced by Phonons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semiconductor quantum dots are a versatile source of single photons with tunable properties to be used in quantum-cryptographic applications. A crucial figure of merit of the emitted photons is photon number coherence (PNC), which impacts the security of many quantum communication protocols. In the process of single-photon generation, the quantum dot as a solid-state object is subject to an interaction with phonons, which can therefore indirectly affect the PNC. In this paper, we elaborate on the origin of PNC in optically excited quantum dots and how it is affected by phonons. In contrast to the expectation that phonons always deteriorate coherence, PNC can be increased in a quantum dot-cavity system due to the electron-phonon interaction.</description>

      <title>Time-domain braiding of anyons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08685v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Contrary to fermions and bosons, anyons are quasiparticles that keep a robust memory of particle exchanges via a braiding phase factor. This provides them with unique dynamical properties so far unexplored. When an anyon excitation is emitted toward a quantum point contact (QPC) in a fractional quantum Hall (FQH) fluid, this memory translates into tunneling events that may occur long after the anyon excitation has exited the QPC. Here, we use triggered anyon pulses incident on a QPC in a $\nu= 1/3$ FQH fluid to investigate anyon tunneling in the time domain. We observe that braiding increases the tunneling timescale, which is set by the temperature and the anyon scaling dimension that characterizes the edge state dynamics. This contrasts with the electron behavior where braiding is absent and the tunneling timescale is set by the temporal width of the generated electron pulses. Our experiment introduces time-domain measurements for characterizing the braiding phase and scaling dimension of anyons.</description>

      <title>Valley separation of photoexcited carriers in bilayer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08807v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive the angular generation density of photoexcited carriers in gapless and gapped Bernal bilayer graphene. Exploiting the strong anisotropy of the band structure of bilayer graphene at low energies due to trigonal warping, we show that charge carriers belonging to different valleys propagate to different sides of the light spot upon photoexcitation. Importantly, in this low-energy regime, inter-valley electron-phonon scattering is suppressed, thereby protecting the valley index. This optically induced valley polarisation can be further enhanced via momentum alignment associated with linearly-polarised light. We then consider gapped bilayer graphene (for example with the gap induced by external top- and back-gates) and show that it exhibits valley-dependent optical selection rules with circularly-polarised light analogous to other gapped Dirac materials, such as transition metal dichalcogenides. Consequently, gapped bilayer graphene can be exploited to optically detect valley polarisation. Thus, we predict an optical valley Hall effect - the emission of two different circular polarisations from different sides of the light spot, upon linearly-polarised excitation. We also propose two realistic experimental setups in gapless and gapped bilayer graphene as a basis for novel optovalleytronic devices operating in the elusive terahertz regime.</description>

      <title>Theory of phonon angular momentum transport across smooth interfaces between crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the spatial profile of phonon angular momentum in a junction between a chiral crystal and a non-chiral (achiral) crystal with a smooth, flat contact at low temperatures. In this junction, the angular momentum is generated by an imbalance in non-equilibrium distributions between transverse acoustic modes. We incorporate the Fresnel coefficients for elastic waves to establish a boundary condition for the phonon distributions, for which we also provide a proof. We demonstrate that the spin angular momentum of phonon induced by a thermal gradient in the chiral crystal diffuses into the adjacent achiral crystal. This diffusion is accompanied by a finite orbital angular momentum stemming from acoustic analog of the Imbert--Fedorov shift in reflected/transmitted wave packets. Concerning angular momentum fluxes that are polarized normal to the interface, the sum of the spin and orbital components is continuous at the interface. This continuity confirms the conservation law of total phonon angular momentum.</description>

      <title>Vanishing bulk heat flow in the nu=0 quantum Hall ferromagnet in monolayer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08878v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Under high perpendicular magnetic field and at low temperatures, graphene develops an insulating state at the charge neutrality point. This state, dubbed $\nu=0$, is due to the interplay between electronic interactions and the four-fold spin and valley degeneracies in the flat band formed by the $n=0$ Landau level. Determining the ground state of $\nu=0$, including its spin and valley polarization, has been a theoretical and experimental undertaking for almost two decades. Here, we present experiments probing the bulk thermal transport properties of monolayer graphene at $\nu=0$, which directly probe its ground state and collective excitations. We observe a vanishing bulk thermal transport, in contradiction with the expected ground state, predicted to have a finite thermal conductance even at very low temperature. Our result highlight the need for further investigations on the nature of $\nu=0$.</description>

      <title>Full minimal coupling Maxwell-TDDFT: an ab initio QED framework beyond the dipole approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08959v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the first ab initio, non-relativistic QED method that couples light and matter self-consistently beyond the electric dipole approximation and without multipolar truncations. This method is based on an extension of the known Maxwell-Pauli-Kohn-Sham approach for the use of a full minimal coupling Hamiltonian, where the space- and time-dependent vector potential is coupled to the matter system, and its back-reaction to the radiated fields is generated by the full current density. The implementation in the open-source Octopus code is designed for massively-parallel multiscale simulations considering different grid spacings for the Maxwell and matter subsystems. Here, we show the first applications of this framework to simulate renormalized Cherenkov radiation of an electronic wavepacket, magnetooptical effects with non-chiral light in non-chiral molecular systems, and renormalized plasmonic modes in a nanoplasmonic dimer. We show that in some cases the beyond-dipole effects can not be captured by a multipolar expansion Hamiltonian in length gauge. Finally, we discuss further opportunities enabled by the framework in the field of twisted light and orbital angular momentum, inelastic light scattering and strong field physics.</description>

      <title>Enigmatic 2+6/13 Filling Factor: A Prototype Intermittent Topological State</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Observation of filling factor 6/13 is one of the surprising fractional quantum Hall states in the second Landau level because, in contrast to the standard wisdom, the fractions ($\nu &lt; 1/2$) with lower numerators, namely 4 and 5, have not yet been observed. We find that a state indeed forms at $\nu=6/13$ as an intermittent topological state between two prominent states at $\nu =1/2$ and $\nu = 2/5$ with lower numerators. Also, we predict that a state forms at $\nu=5/13$ as an intermittent to $\nu = 2/5$ and $\nu =3/8$. Our proposed wave functions for $\nu =6/13$ and $5/13$ have excellent overlaps with the corresponding exact ground state wave functions. The Chern-Simons coupling matrices deduced from the form of these wave functions are analyzed to predict the topological properties, which may be experimentally verified.</description>

      <title>Inverse Spin Hall Effect in Nonequilibrium Dirac Systems Induced by Anomalous Flow Imbalance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09025v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study Dirac fermions in the presence of a space-dependent chiral gauge field and thermodynamic gradients, establishing a connection to the inverse spin Hall effect. The chiral gauge field induces a chiral magnetic field, resulting in a surface Fermi arc state and a chiral Landau level state which, although is delocalized in the bulk, we show to be more robust against impurities. By applying chemical potential and temperature gradients, we achieve nonzero charge currents, with each gradient leading to distinct Fermi level dependencies, both of which have been observed in a recent experiment. Unlike the conventional mixed axial-gravitational anomaly, our currents require a noncollinear chiral magnetic field and thermodynamic gradient. We further derive low-energy transport formulas and demonstrate the importance of carefully treating the ultraviolet cutoff for understanding our lattice calculations.</description>

      <title>An interpretable formula for lattice thermal conductivity of crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04489v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lattice thermal conductivity (kL) is a crucial physical property of crystals with applications in thermal management, such as heat dissipation, insulation, and thermoelectric energy conversion. However, accurately and rapidly determining kL poses a considerable challenge. In this study, we introduce an formula that achieves high precision (mean relative error=8.97%) and provides fast predictions, taking less than one minute, for kL across a wide range of inorganic binary and ternary materials. Our interpretable, dimensionally aligned and physical grounded formula forecasts kL values for 4,601 binary and 6,995 ternary materials in the Materials Project database. Notably, we predict undiscovered high kL values for AlBN2 (kL=101 W/ m/ K) and the undetectedlow kL Cs2Se (kL=0.98 W/ m/ K) at room temperature. This method for determining kL streamlines the traditionally time-consuming process associated with complex phonon physics. It provides insights into microscopic heat transport and facilitates the design and screening of materials with targeted and extreme kL values through the application of phonon engineering. Our findings offer opportunities for controlling and optimizing macroscopic transport properties of materials by engineering their bulk modulus, shear modulus, and Gruneisen parameter.</description>

      <title>Quantum metric induced hole dispersion and emergent particle-hole symmetry in topological flat bands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08324v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The emergent hole dispersion in flat bands is an invaluable platform to study the interplay of quantum geometry and electron-electron interaction with a relatively simple setting. In this work, we find that the hole dispersion in ideal bands has a linear relationship with the trace of the quantum geometry tensor at every $\boldsymbol{k}$-point for a wide range of interactions to a good approximation. Next, we give a microscopic analysis on the hole dispersion and show that the linear relationships for short-range and long-range interactions in $\boldsymbol{k}$-space have different origins. Moreover, we show how to exploit this observation to engineer particle-hole symmetry in a Chern band with fluctuating quantum geometry. Our results will be useful for further studying the physics in particle-hole symmetric flat bands both in theory and in experiment.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08327v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the theory of the longitudinal spin Seebeck effect between a Heisenberg spin-1/2 chain and a conductor. The effect consists of the generation of a spin current across the spin chain-conductor interface in response to the temperature difference between the two systems. In this setup, the current is given by the convolution of the local spin susceptibilities of the spin chain and the conductor. We find the spin current to be fully controlled, both in the magnitude and the sign, by the backscattering interaction between spinons, fractionalized spin excitations of the Heisenberg chain. In particular, it vanishes when the spinons form a non-interacting spinon gas. Our analytical results for the local spin susceptibility at the open end of the spin chain are in excellent agreement with numerical DMRG simulations.</description>

      <title>Toward Phonon-Limited Transport in Two-Dimensional Electronics by Oxygen-Free Fabrication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08453v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Future electronics require aggressive scaling of channel material thickness while maintaining device performance. Two-dimensional (2D) semiconductors are promising candidates, but despite over two decades of research, experimental performance still lags theoretical expectations. Here, we develop an oxygen-free approach to push the electrical transport of 2D field-effect transistors toward the theoretical phonon-limited intrinsic mobility. We achieve record carrier mobilities of 91 (132) cm2V-1s-1 for mono- (bi-) layer MoS2 transistors on SiO2 substrate. Statistics from over 60 devices confirm that oxygen-free fabrication enhances key figures of merit by more than an order of magnitude. While previous studies suggest that 2D transition metal dichalcogenides such as MoS2 and WS2 are stable in air, we show that short-term ambient exposure can degrade their device performance through irreversible oxygen chemisorption. This study emphasizes the criticality of avoiding oxygen exposure, offering guidance for device manufacturing for fundamental research and practical applications of 2D materials.</description>

      <title>Thickness-Dependent Polaron Crossover in Tellurene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08458v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Polarons, quasiparticles arising from electron-phonon coupling, are crucial in understanding material properties such as high-temperature superconductivity and colossal magnetoresistance. However, scarce studies have been performed to investigate the formation of polarons in low-dimensional materials with phonon polarity and electronic structure transitions. In this work, we studied polarons of tellurene that are composed of chiral chains of tellurium atoms. The frequency and linewidth of the A1 phonon, which becomes increasingly polar for thinner tellurene, exhibit an abrupt change when the thickness of tellurene is below 10 nm. Meanwhile, the field effect mobility of tellurene drops rapidly as the thickness is smaller than 10 nm. These phonon and transport signatures, combined with the calculated phonon polarity and band structure, suggest a crossover from large polarons for bulk tellurium to small polarons for few-layer tellurene. Effective field theory considers the phonon renormalization in the strong coupling (small polaron) regime, and semi-quantitatively reproduces the observed phonon hardening and broadening effects in few-layer tellurene. This polaron crossover stems from the quasi-1D nature of tellurene where modulation of the interchain distance reduces the dielectric screening and promotes electron-phonon coupling. Our work provides valuable insights into the influence of polarons on phononic, electronic, and structural properties in low-dimensional materials.</description>

      <title>Role of material-dependent properties in THz field-derivative-torque-induced nonlinear magnetization dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08541v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The traditional Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (LLG) equation has often delineated the linear and nonlinear magnetization dynamics, even at ultrashort timescales e.g., femtoseconds. In contrast, several other non-relativistic and relativistic spin torques have been reported as an extension of the LLG spin dynamics. Here, we explore the contribution of the relativistic field-derivative torque (FDT) in the nonlinear THz magnetization dynamics response applied to ferrimagnets with high Gilbert damping and exchange magnon frequency. Our findings suggest that the FDT plays a significant role in magnetization dynamics in both linear and nonlinear regimes, bridging the gap between the traditional LLG spin dynamics and experimental observations. We find that the coherent THz magnon excitation amplitude is enhanced with the field-derivative torque. Furthermore, a phase shift in the magnon oscillation is induced by the FDT term. This phase shift is almost 90 for the antiferromagnet, while it is almost zero for the ferrimagnet under our investigation. Analyzing the dual THz excitation and their FDT, we find that the nonlinear signals can not be distinctly observed without the FDT terms. However, the inclusion of the FDT terms produces distinct nonlinear signals which matches extremely well with the previously reported experimental results.</description>

Abstract: We propose a variational approach to explore quasiparticle excitations in interacting quantum many-body systems, motivated by the potential in leveraging near-term noisy intermediate scale quantum devices for quantum state preparation. By exploiting translation invariance and potentially other abelian symmetries of the many-body Hamiltonian, we extend the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) approach to construct spatially localized quasiparticle states that encode information on the whole excited band, allowing us to achieve quantum parallelism. We benchmark the proposed algorithm via numerical simulations performed on the one-dimension transverse field Ising chain. We show that VQE can capture both the magnon quasiparticles of the paramagnetic phase, and the topologically non-trivial domain wall excitations in the ferromagnetic regime. We show that the localized quasiparticle states constructed with VQE contain accessible information on the full band of quasiparticles, and provide valuable insight into the way interactions renormalize the bare spin flip or domain wall excitations of the simple, trivially solvable limits of the model. These results serve as important theoretical input towards utilizing quantum simulators to directly access the quasiparticles of strongly interacting quantum systems, as well as to gain insight into crucial experimentally measured properties directly determined by the nature of these quasiparticles.</description>

      <title>Distinguishing different stackings in WSe2 bilayers grown Using Chemical Vapor Deposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08617v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The stacking order of two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) is attracting tremendous interest as an essential component of van der Waals heterostructures. A common and fast approach to distinguish between the AAprime (2H) and AB (3R) configurations uses the relative edge orientation of each triangular layer (theta) from optical images. Here, we highlight that this method alone is not sufficient to fully identify the stacking order. Instead we propose a model and methodology to accurately determine the bilayer configuration of WSe2 using second harmonic generation (SHG) and Raman spectroscopy. We demonstrate that the SHG response of the AB phase (theta = 0) deg layers is more intense than the signal from the single layer structure. However, the SHG totally vanishes in the AAprime and ABprime phases (theta = 60 deg) and 0 deg respectively) of homo-bilayer WSe2. Also, several optical features of homo-bilayer WSe2 are found to depend on the details of the stacking order, with the difference being the clearest in the low frequency (LF) Raman frequencies, as confirmed by DFT simulation. This allows unambiguous, high-throughput, nondestructive identification of stacking order in TMDs, which is not robustly addressed in this emerging research area.</description>

Abstract: Finding a quantum battery model that displays a genuine quantum advantage, while being prone to experimental fabrication, is an extremely challenging task. In this Letter we propose a deceptively simple quantum battery model that displays a genuine quantum advantage, saturating the quantum speed limit. It consists of two harmonic oscillators (the charger and the battery), coupled during the non-equilibrium charging dynamics by a non-linear interaction. We first present the model, then certify the genuine quantum advantage, and finally briefly discuss how the battery can be fabricated through the use of superconducting circuits.</description>

      <title>Efficient Pseudomode Representation and Complexity of Quantum Impurity Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08816v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Out-of-equilibrium fermionic quantum impurity models (QIM), describing a small interacting system coupled to a continuous fermionic bath, play an important role in condensed matter physics. Solving such models is a computationally demanding task, and a variety of computational approaches are based on finding approximate representations of the bath by a finite number of modes. In this paper, we formulate the problem of finding efficient bath representations as that of approximating a kernel of the bath's Feynman-Vernon influence functional by a sum of complex exponentials, with each term defining a fermionic pseudomode. Under mild assumptions on the analytic properties of the bath spectral density, we provide an analytic construction of pseudomodes, and prove that their number scales polylogarithmically with the maximum evolution time $T$ and the approximation error $\varepsilon$. We then demonstrate that the number of pseudomodes can be significantly reduced by an interpolative matrix decomposition (ID). Furthermore, we present a complementary approach, based on constructing rational approximations of the bath's spectral density using the ``AAA'' algorithm, followed by compression with ID. The combination of two approaches yields a pseudomode count scaling as $N_\text{ID} \sim \log(T)\log(1/\varepsilon)$, and the agreement between the two approches suggests that the result is close to optimal. Finally, to relate our findings to QIM, we derive an explicit Liouvillian that describes the time evolution of the combined impurity-pseudomodes system. These results establish bounds on the computational resources required for solving out-of-equilibrium QIMs, providing an efficient starting point for tensor-network methods for QIMs.</description>

      <title>Domain-wall Skyrmion phase of QCD in magnetic field: Gauge field dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08841v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ground state of QCD in sufficiently strong magnetic field at finite baryon density is an inhomogeneous state consisting of an array of solitons, called the chiral soliton lattice (CSL). It is, however, replaced in a region with higher density and/or magnetic field by the so-called domain-wall Skyrmion(DWSk) phase where Skyrmions are created on top of the CSL. This was previously proposed within the Bogomol'nyi-Prasad-Sommerfield (BPS) approximation neglecting a gauge field dynamics and taking into account its effect by a flux quantization condition. In this paper, by taking into account dynamics of the gauge field, we show that the phase boundary between the CSL and DWSk phases beyond the BPS approximation is identical to the one obtained in the BPS approximation. We also find that domain-wall Skyrmions are electrically charged with the charge one as a result of the chiral anomaly.</description>

      <title>Remote Entangling Gates for Spin Qubits in Quantum Dots using an Offset-Charge-Sensitive Transmon Coupler</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08915v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a method to realize microwave-activated CZ gates between two remote spin qubits in quantum dots using an offset-charge-sensitive transmon coupler. The qubits are longitudinally coupled to the coupler, so that the transition frequency of the coupler depends on the logical qubit states; a capacitive network model using first-quantized charge operators is developed to illustrate this. Driving the coupler transition then implements a conditional phase shift on the qubits. Two pulsing schemes are investigated: a rapid, off-resonant pulse with constant amplitude, and a pulse with envelope engineering that incorporates dynamical decoupling to mitigate charge noise. We develop non-Markovian time-domain simulations to accurately model gate performance in the presence of $1/f^\beta$ charge noise. Simulation results indicate that a CZ gate fidelity exceeding 90% is possible with realistic parameters and noise models.</description>

Abstract: The observation of the Sagnac effect for massive material particles offers a significant enhancement in sensitivity when compared to optical interferometers with equal area and angular rotation velocity. For this reason, there have been suggestions to employ solid-state interferometers that rely on semiconductors and graphene. We investigate the Sagnac effect in Dirac materials governed by the relativisticlike quasiparticle dispersion law and show that the fringe shift is still determined by the mass of a free electron. This confirms that graphene is indeed a promising material for creating solid-state Sagnac interferometers. Considering monolayer graphene with its linear dispersion law and comparing it with light provides a deeper understanding of the Sagnac effect.</description>

      <title>Evidence for correlated electron pairs and triplets in quantum Hall interferometers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.14767v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Pairing of electrons is ubiquitous in electronic systems featuring attractive inter-electron interactions, as exemplified in superconductors. Counter-intuitively, it can also be mediated in certain circumstances by the repulsive Coulomb interaction alone. Quantum Hall (QH) Fabry-P\'erot interferometers (FPIs) tailored in two-dimensional electron gas under a perpendicular magnetic field has been argued to exhibit such unusual electron pairing seemingly without attractive interaction. Here, we show evidence in graphene QH FPIs revealing not only a similar electron pairing at bulk filling factor nu=2 but also an unforeseen emergence of electron tripling characterized by a fractional Aharonov-Bohm flux period h/3e (h is the Planck constant and e the electron charge) at nu=3. Leveraging a novel plunger-gate spectroscopy, we demonstrate that electron pairing (tripling) involves correlated charge transport on two (three) entangled QH edge channels. This spectroscopy indicates a quantum interference flux-periodicity determined by the sum of the phases acquired by the distinct QH edge channels having slightly different interfering areas. While recent theory invokes the dynamical exchange of neutral magnetoplasmons -- dubbed neutralons -- as mediator for electron pairing, our discovery of three entangled QH edge channels with apparent electron tripling defies understanding and introduces a new three-body problem for interacting fermions.</description>

      <title>Dissipative frequency converter: from Lindblad dynamics to non-Hermitian topology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07991v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A topological frequency converter represents a dynamical counterpart of the integer quantum Hall effect, where a two-level system enacts a quantized time-averaged power transfer between two driving modes of incommensurate frequency. Here, we investigate as to what extent temporal coherence in the quantum dynamics of the two-level system is important for the topological quantization of the converter. To this end, we consider dissipative channels corresponding to spontaneous decay and dephasing in the instantaneous eigenbasis of the Hamiltonian as well as spontaneous decay in a fixed basis. The dissipation is modelled using both a full Lindblad and an effective non-Hermitian (NH) Hamiltonian description. For all three dissipation channels we find a transition from the unperturbed dynamics to a quantum watchdog effect, which destroys any power transfer in the strong coupling limit. This is striking because the watchdog effect leads to perfectly adiabatic dynamics in the instantaneous eigenbasis, at first glance similar to the unperturbed case. Furthermore, it is found that dephasing immediately leads to an exponential decay of the power transfer in time due to loss of polarisation in the mixed quantum state. Finally, we discuss the appearance in the effective NH trajectory description of non-adiabatic processes, which are suppressed in the full Lindblad dynamics.</description>

Abstract: In cavity magnomechanical systems, magnetic excitations couple simultaneously with mechanical vibrations and microwaves, incorporating the tunability of magnetism and the long lifetimes of mechanical modes. Applications of such systems, such as thermometry and sensing, require precise measurement of the mechanical degree-of-freedom. In this paper, we propose a scheme for realizing backaction evading measurements of the mechanical vibrations in cavity magnomechanics. Our proposal involves driving the microwave cavity with two tones separated by twice the phonon frequency and with amplitudes satisfying a balance relation. We show that the minimum added imprecision noise is obtained for drives centered around the lower frequency magnon-microwave polaritons, which can beat the standard quantum limit at modest drive amplitudes. Our scheme is a simple and flexible way of engineering backaction evasion measurements that can be further generalized to other multimode systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18566v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We numerically study the relaxation dynamics of impurity-host systems, focusing on the presence of long-lived metastable states in the non-equilibrium dynamics after an initial excitation of the impurities. In generic systems, an excited impurity coupled to a large bath at zero temperature is expected to relax and approach its ground state over time. However, certain exceptional cases exhibit metastability, where the system remains in an excited state on timescales largely exceeding the typical relaxation time. We study this phenomenon for three prototypical impurity models: a tight-binding quantum model of independent spinless fermions on a lattice with two stub impurities, a classical-spin Heisenberg model with two weakly coupled classical impurity spins, and a tight-binding quantum model of independent electrons with two classical impurity spins. Through numerical integration of the fundamental equations of motion, we find that all three models exhibit similar qualitative behavior: complete relaxation for nearest-neighbor impurities and incomplete or strongly delayed relaxation for next-nearest-neighbor impurities. The underlying mechanisms leading to this behavior differ between models and include impurity-induced bound states, emergent approximately conserved local observables, and exact cancellation of local and nonlocal dissipation effects.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07603v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Altermagnets is a class of antiferromagnetic materials which has electron bands with lifted spin degeneracy in momentum space but vanishing net magnetization and no stray magnetic fields. Because of these properties, altermagnets have attracted much attention for potential use in spintronics. We here show that despite the absence of bulk magnetization, the itinerant electrons in altermagnets can generate a magnetization close to edges and vacuum interfaces. We find that surface-induced magnetization can also occur for conventional antiferromagnets with spin-degenerate bands, where the magnetization from the itinerant electrons originates from a subtle yet nonvanishing redistribution of the probability density on the unit-cell level. An intuitive explanation of this effect in a phenomenological model is provided. In the altermagnetic case, the induced magnetization has a different spatial dependence than in the antiferromagnetic case due to the anisotropy of the spin-polarized Fermi surfaces, causing the edge-induced Friedel oscillations of the spin-up and -down electron densities to have different periods. We employ both a low-energy effective continuum model and lattice tight-binding calculations. Our results have implications for the usage of altermagnets and antiferromagnets in nanoscale spintronic applications.</description>

Abstract: Electrical tuning of magnetism is crucial for developing fast, compact, ultra-low power electronic devices. Multiferroics offer significant potential due to their ability to control magnetic via an electric field through magnetoelectric coupling, especially in layered ferroelectric/ferromagnet heterostructures. A key challenge is achieving reversible and stable switching between distinct magnetic states using a voltage control. In this work, we present ferroelectric tuning of room-temperature magnetism in a 2D layered ferromagnet. The energy-efficient control consumes less than 1 fJ per operation which is normally in the order of several aJ, resulting in a ~43% change in magnetization. This tunable multiferroic interface and associated devices provide promising opportunities for next-generation reconfigurable communication systems, spintronics, sensors and memories.</description>

Abstract: Temperature constraints are highly desirable in the experimental setup when seeking the synthesis of new carbon structures. Fluctuations of the Dirac field result in temperature-dependent corrections to the Helfrich-Canham formulation, which governs the classical elasticity of the graphene membrane at equilibrium. Here, we examine the emergent shapes allowed by the effective model up to quadratic order in Ricci curvature and discuss the constraints required to observe them. We determine the mechanical stability conditions and provide a phase diagram characterized by the appearance of a critical temperature $T_c$ that distinguishes between carbon nanotube and fullerene phases. The observation of minimal and developable surfaces is anticipated, respectively, at the high- and low-temperature regimes. Additionally, a Beltrami trumpet surface is forecasted when the membrane is subjected to an external source balancing out internal Helfrich stresses.</description>

      <title>Obstruction to Broken Symmetries in Topological Flat Bands</title>

Abstract: Motivated by the abundance of symmetry breaking states in magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene and other two-dimensional materials, we study superconducting (SC) and charge orders in two-dimensional topological flat bands in the strong correlation regime. By relating the half-filled 2D topological flat bands to the surface states of 3D topological insulators in symmetry class AIII, we reveal the topological obstruction to the formation of gapped SC and inter-valley charge orders without intrinsic topological orders, in the presence of the anti-unitary particle-hole symmetry at half filling. This is a generalization of the Li-Haldane arguments for nodal superconductivity to strongly interacting electrons. In contrast to the $\mathbb{Z}$-valued obstruction derived from the non-interacting band topology, the topological obstruction of interacting electrons in half-filled flat bands has a $\mathbb{Z}_{8}$ classification, depending on the charge (valley) Chern number of the superconducting (inter-valley charge) orders. This is demonstrated by an interacting Hamiltonian for half-filled flat bands with a net Chern number $C=4$, where superconductivity and $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological order coexist in a gapped ground state with particle-hole symmetry.</description>

      <title>An effective and reliable approach to the phase problem in single-shot single-particle Coherent Diffraction Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07413v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Coherent Diffraction Imaging (CDI) is an experimental technique to get images of isolated structures by recording the light scattered off the sample. Thanks to the extremely bright and short coherent light pulses provided by X-ray Free Electron Lasers, CDI makes it possible to study nanostructures in the gas phase and get time-resolved snapshots of their ultrafast dynamics with unprecedented resolution. In principle, the sample density can be recovered from the scattered light field through a straightforward Fourier Transform operation. However, only the amplitude of the field is recorded, while the phase is lost during the measurement process and has to be retrieved by means of suitable, well-established, phase retrieval algorithms. We present the Memetic Phase Retrieval (MPR) method, an improved approach to the phase retrieval problem, which makes use of a combination of existing phase retrieval algorithms and evolutionary algorithms to mitigate the shortcomings of conventional approaches. We benchmark the method on experimental data acquired in two experimental campaigns at SwissFEL and European XFEL. Imaging results on isolated nanostructures reveal considerable stability of the algorithm's behavior on the input parameters, as well as the capability of identifying the solution in challenging conditions. A user-friendly implementation of the MPR method is released as open-source software, aiming at being a reference tool for the FEL imaging community.</description>
