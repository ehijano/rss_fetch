      <title>Bridging Cloud Convenience and Protocol Transparency: A Hybrid Architecture for Ethereum Node Operations on Amazon Managed Blockchain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18774v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As blockchain technologies are increasingly adopted in enterprise and research domains, the need for secure, scalable, and performance-transparent node infrastructure has become critical. While self-hosted Ethereum nodes offer operational control, they often lack elasticity and require complex maintenance. This paper presents a hybrid, service-oriented architecture for deploying and monitoring Ethereum full nodes using Amazon Managed Blockchain (AMB), integrated with EC2-based observability, IAM-enforced security policies, and reproducible automation via the AWS Cloud Development Kit. Our architecture supports end-to-end observability through custom EC2 scripts leveraging Web3.py and JSON-RPC, collecting over 1,000 real-time data points-including gas utilization, transaction inclusion latency, and mempool dynamics. These metrics are visualized and monitored through AWS CloudWatch, enabling service-level performance tracking and anomaly detection. This cloud-native framework restores low-level observability lost in managed environments while maintaining the operational simplicity of managed services. By bridging the simplicity of AMB with the transparency required for protocol research and enterprise monitoring, this work delivers one of the first reproducible, performance-instrumented Ethereum deployments on AMB. The proposed hybrid architecture enables secure, observable, and reproducible Ethereum node operations in cloud environments, suitable for both research and production use.</description>

      <title>Resolving Indirect Calls in Binary Code via Cross-Reference Augmented Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18801v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Binary code analysis is essential in scenarios where source code is unavailable, with extensive applications across various security domains. However, accurately resolving indirect call targets remains a longstanding challenge in maintaining the integrity of static analysis in binary code. This difficulty arises because the operand of a call instruction (e.g., call rax) remains unknown until runtime, resulting in an incomplete inter-procedural control flow graph (CFG). Previous approaches have struggled with low accuracy and limited scalability. To address these limitations, recent work has increasingly turned to machine learning (ML) to enhance analysis. However, this ML-driven approach faces two significant obstacles: low-quality callsite-callee training pairs and inadequate binary code representation, both of which undermine the accuracy of ML models. In this paper, we introduce NeuCall, a novel approach for resolving indirect calls using graph neural networks. Existing ML models in this area often overlook key elements such as data and code cross-references, which are essential for understanding a program's control flow. In contrast, NeuCall augments CFGs with cross-references, preserving rich semantic information. Additionally, we leverage advanced compiler-level type analysis to generate high-quality callsite-callee training pairs, enhancing model precision and reliability. We further design a graph neural model that leverages augmented CFGs and relational graph convolutions for accurate target prediction. Evaluated against real-world binaries from GitHub and the Arch User Repository on x86_64 architecture, NeuCall achieves an F1 score of 95.2%, outperforming state-of-the-art ML-based approaches. These results highlight NeuCall's effectiveness in building precise inter-procedural CFGs and its potential to advance downstream binary analysis and security applications.</description>

      <title>How to Copy-Protect Malleable-Puncturable Cryptographic Functionalities Under Arbitrary Challenge Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A quantum copy-protection scheme (Aaronson, CCC 2009) encodes a functionality into a quantum state such that given this state, no efficient adversary can create two (possibly entangled) quantum states that are both capable of running the functionality. There has been a recent line of works on constructing provably-secure copy-protection schemes for general classes of schemes in the plain model, and most recently the recent work of \c{C}akan and Goyal (IACR Eprint, 2025) showed how to copy-protect all cryptographically puncturable schemes with pseudorandom puncturing points. In this work, we show how to copy-protect even a larger class of schemes. We define a class of cryptographic schemes called malleable-puncturable schemes where the only requirement is that one can create a circuit that is capable of answering inputs at points that are unrelated to the challenge in the security game but does not help the adversary answer inputs related to the challenge. This is a flexible generalization of puncturable schemes, and can capture a wide range of primitives that was not known how to copy-protect prior to our work. Going further, we show that our scheme is secure against arbitrary high min-entropy challenge distributions whereas previous work has only considered schemes that are punctured at pseudorandom points.</description>

      <title>Virtual local area network over HTTP for launching an insider attack</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19055v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Computers and computer networks have become integral to virtually every aspect of modern life, with the Internet playing an indispensable role. Organizations, businesses, and individuals now store vast amounts of proprietary, confidential, and personal data digitally. As such, ensuring the security of this data from unauthorized access is critical. Common security measures, such as firewalls, intrusion detection systems (IDS), intrusion prevention systems (IPS), and antivirus software, are constantly evolving to safeguard computer systems and networks. However, these tools primarily focus on defending against external threats, leaving systems vulnerable to insider attacks. Security solutions designed to mitigate risks originating from within the organization are relatively limited and often ineffective. This paper demonstrates how a Local Area Network (LAN) can be covertly exposed to the Internet via an insider attack. Specifically, it illustrates how an external machine can gain access to a LAN by exploiting an unused secondary IP address of the attacked LAN, effectively bypassing existing security mechanisms by also exploiting Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP). Despite the presence of robust external protections, such as firewalls and IDS, this form of insider attack reveals significant vulnerabilities in the way internal threats are addressed.</description>

      <title>PurpCode: Reasoning for Safer Code Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce PurpCode, the first post-training recipe for training safe code reasoning models towards generating secure code and defending against malicious cyberactivities. PurpCode trains a reasoning model in two stages: (i) Rule Learning, which explicitly teaches the model to reference cybersafety rules to generate vulnerability-free code and to avoid facilitating malicious cyberactivities; and (ii) Reinforcement Learning, which optimizes model safety and preserves model utility through diverse, multi-objective reward mechanisms. To empower the training pipelines with comprehensive cybersafety data, we conduct internal red-teaming to synthesize comprehensive and high-coverage prompts based on real-world tasks for inducing unsafe cyberactivities in the model. Based on PurpCode, we develop a reasoning-based coding model, namely PurpCode-32B, which demonstrates state-of-the-art cybersafety, outperforming various frontier models. Meanwhile, our alignment method decreases the model overrefusal rates in both general and cybersafety-specific scenarios, while preserving model utility in both code generation and common security knowledge.</description>

      <title>PrompTrend: Continuous Community-Driven Vulnerability Discovery and Assessment for Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Static benchmarks fail to capture LLM vulnerabilities emerging through community experimentation in online forums. We present PrompTrend, a system that collects vulnerability data across platforms and evaluates them using multidimensional scoring, with an architecture designed for scalable monitoring. Cross-sectional analysis of 198 vulnerabilities collected from online communities over a five-month period (January-May 2025) and tested on nine commercial models reveals that advanced capabilities correlate with increased vulnerability in some architectures, psychological attacks significantly outperform technical exploits, and platform dynamics shape attack effectiveness with measurable model-specific patterns. The PrompTrend Vulnerability Assessment Framework achieves 78% classification accuracy while revealing limited cross-model transferability, demonstrating that effective LLM security requires comprehensive socio-technical monitoring beyond traditional periodic assessment. Our findings challenge the assumption that capability advancement improves security and establish community-driven psychological manipulation as the dominant threat vector for current language models.</description>

      <title>On the Security of a Code-Based PIR Scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19295v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Private Information Retrieval (PIR) schemes allow clients to retrieve files from a database without disclosing the requested file's identity to the server. In the pursuit of post-quantum security, most recent PIR schemes rely on hard lattice problems. In contrast, the so called CB-cPIR scheme stands out as a pioneering effort to base PIR schemes on hard problems in coding theory, thereby contributing significantly to the diversification of security foundations. However, our research reveals a critical vulnerability in CB-cPIR, substantially diminishing its security levels. Moreover, a comparative analysis with state-of-the-art PIR schemes shows that CB-cPIR's advantages are reduced, making it less competitive in terms of the communication cost. Nevertheless, our findings highlight the importance of continued research into code-based PIR schemes, as they have the potential to provide a valuable alternative to lattice-based approaches.</description>

      <title>Empowering IoT Firmware Secure Update with Customization Rights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19367v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Firmware updates remain the primary line of defense for IoT devices; however, the update channel itself has become a well-established attack vector. Existing defenses mainly focus on securing monolithic firmware images, leaving module-level customization -a growing user demand-largely unprotected and insufficiently explored. To address this gap, we conduct a pilot study on the update workflows of 200 Linux-based IoT devices across 23 vendors, uncovering five previously undocumented vulnerabilities caused by customization practices. A broader analysis of update-related CVEs from 2020 to 2024 reveals that over half originate from customization-induced issues. These findings highlight a critical yet underexamined reality: as customization increases, so does the attack surface, while current defenses fail to keep pace. We propose IMUP (Integrity-Centric Modular Update Platform), the first framework to address two key challenges: constructing a trustworthy cross-module integrity chain and scaling update performance under mass customization. IMUP combines three techniques: per-module chameleon hashing for integrity, server-side proof-of-work offloading to reduce device overhead, and server-side caching to reuse module combinations, minimizing rebuild costs. Security analysis shows that even when 95 percent of secret keys are exposed, forging a valid image incurs over 300 times the cost of the legitimate server. Experiments on heterogeneous IoT devices demonstrate that IMUP reduces server-side generation time by 2.9 times and device downtime by 5.9 times compared to a package-manager baseline.</description>

      <title>Transcript Franking for Encrypted Messaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19391v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Message franking is an indispensable abuse mitigation tool for end-to-end encrypted (E2EE) messaging platforms. With it, users who receive harmful content can securely report that content to platform moderators. However, while real-world deployments of reporting require the disclosure of multiple messages, existing treatments of message franking only consider the report of a single message. As a result, there is a gap between the security goals achieved by constructions and those needed in practice. Our work introduces transcript franking, a new type of protocol that allows reporting subsets of conversations such that moderators can cryptographically verify message causality and contents. We define syntax, semantics, and security for transcript franking in two-party and group messaging. We then present efficient constructions for transcript franking and prove their security. Looking toward deployment considerations, we provide detailed discussion of how real-world messaging systems can incorporate our protocols.</description>

      <title>Running in CIRCLE? A Simple Benchmark for LLM Code Interpreter Security</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19399v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) increasingly integrate native code interpreters, they enable powerful real-time execution capabilities, substantially expanding their utility. However, such integrations introduce potential system-level cybersecurity threats, fundamentally different from prompt-based vulnerabilities. To systematically evaluate these interpreter-specific risks, we propose CIRCLE (Code-Interpreter Resilience Check for LLM Exploits), a simple benchmark comprising 1,260 prompts targeting CPU, memory, and disk resource exhaustion. Each risk category includes explicitly malicious ("direct") and plausibly benign ("indirect") prompt variants. Our automated evaluation framework assesses not only whether LLMs refuse or generates risky code, but also executes the generated code within the interpreter environment to evaluate code correctness, simplifications made by the LLM to make the code safe, or execution timeouts. Evaluating 7 commercially available models from OpenAI and Google, we uncover significant and inconsistent vulnerabilities. For instance, evaluations show substantial disparities even within providers - OpenAI's o4-mini correctly refuses risky requests at 7.1%, notably higher rates compared to GPT-4.1 at 0.5%. Results particularly underscore that indirect, socially-engineered prompts substantially weaken model defenses. This highlights an urgent need for interpreter-specific cybersecurity benchmarks, dedicated mitigation tools (e.g., guardrails), and clear industry standards to guide safe and responsible deployment of LLM interpreter integrations. The benchmark dataset and evaluation code are publicly released to foster further research.</description>

      <title>VGS-ATD: Robust Distributed Learning for Multi-Label Medical Image Classification Under Heterogeneous and Imbalanced Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18657v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, advanced deep learning architectures have shown strong performance in medical imaging tasks. However, the traditional centralized learning paradigm poses serious privacy risks as all data is collected and trained on a single server. To mitigate this challenge, decentralized approaches such as federated learning and swarm learning have emerged, allowing model training on local nodes while sharing only model weights. While these methods enhance privacy, they struggle with heterogeneous and imbalanced data and suffer from inefficiencies due to frequent communication and the aggregation of weights. More critically, the dynamic and complex nature of clinical environments demands scalable AI systems capable of continuously learning from diverse modalities and multilabels. Yet, both centralized and decentralized models are prone to catastrophic forgetting during system expansion, often requiring full model retraining to incorporate new data. To address these limitations, we propose VGS-ATD, a novel distributed learning framework. To validate VGS-ATD, we evaluate it in experiments spanning 30 datasets and 80 independent labels across distributed nodes, VGS-ATD achieved an overall accuracy of 92.7%, outperforming centralized learning (84.9%) and swarm learning (72.99%), while federated learning failed under these conditions due to high requirements on computational resources. VGS-ATD also demonstrated strong scalability, with only a 1% drop in accuracy on existing nodes after expansion, compared to a 20% drop in centralized learning, highlighting its resilience to catastrophic forgetting. Additionally, it reduced computational costs by up to 50% relative to both centralized and swarm learning, confirming its superior efficiency and scalability.</description>

      <title>AEDR: Training-Free AI-Generated Image Attribution via Autoencoder Double-Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18988v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of image-generation technologies has made it possible for anyone to create photorealistic images using generative models, raising significant security concerns. To mitigate malicious use, tracing the origin of such images is essential. Reconstruction-based attribution methods offer a promising solution, but they often suffer from reduced accuracy and high computational costs when applied to state-of-the-art (SOTA) models. To address these challenges, we propose AEDR (AutoEncoder Double-Reconstruction), a novel training-free attribution method designed for generative models with continuous autoencoders. Unlike existing reconstruction-based approaches that rely on the value of a single reconstruction loss, AEDR performs two consecutive reconstructions using the model's autoencoder, and adopts the ratio of these two reconstruction losses as the attribution signal. This signal is further calibrated using the image homogeneity metric to improve accuracy, which inherently cancels out absolute biases caused by image complexity, with autoencoder-based reconstruction ensuring superior computational efficiency. Experiments on eight top latent diffusion models show that AEDR achieves 25.5% higher attribution accuracy than existing reconstruction-based methods, while requiring only 1% of the computational time.</description>

      <title>How Much Do Large Language Model Cheat on Evaluation? Benchmarking Overestimation under the One-Time-Pad-Based Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19219v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Overestimation in evaluating large language models (LLMs) has become an increasing concern. Due to the contamination of public benchmarks or imbalanced model training, LLMs may achieve unreal evaluation results on public benchmarks, either intentionally or unintentionally, which leads to unfair comparisons among LLMs and undermines their realistic capability assessments. Existing benchmarks attempt to address these issues by keeping test cases permanently secret, mitigating contamination through human evaluation, or repeatedly collecting and constructing new samples. However, these approaches fail to ensure reproducibility, transparency, and high efficiency simultaneously. Moreover, the extent of overestimation in current LLMs remains unquantified. To address these issues, we propose ArxivRoll, a dynamic evaluation framework inspired by one-time pad encryption in cryptography. ArxivRoll comprises two key components: \emph{i) SCP (Sequencing, Cloze, and Prediction)}, an automated generator for private test cases, and \emph{ii) Rugged Scores (RS)}, metrics that measure the proportion of public benchmark contamination and training bias. Leveraging SCP, ArxivRoll constructs a new benchmark every six months using recent articles from ArXiv and employs them for one-time evaluations of LLM performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate the high quality of our benchmark, and we provide a systematic evaluation of current LLMs. The source code is available at https://github.com/liangzid/ArxivRoll/.</description>

      <title>SILS: Strategic Influence on Liquidity Stability and Whale Detection in Concentrated-Liquidity DEXs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19411v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traditional methods for identifying impactful liquidity providers (LPs) in Concentrated Liquidity Market Makers (CLMMs) rely on broad measures, such as nominal capital size or surface-level activity, which often lead to inaccurate risk analysis. The SILS framework offers a significantly more detailed approach, characterizing LPs not just as capital holders but as dynamic systemic agents whose actions directly impact market stability. This represents a fundamental paradigm shift from the static, volume-based analysis to a dynamic, impact-focused understanding. This advanced approach uses on-chain event logs and smart contract execution traces to compute Exponential Time-Weighted Liquidity (ETWL) profiles and apply unsupervised anomaly detection. Most importantly, it defines an LP's functional importance through the Liquidity Stability Impact Score (LSIS), a counterfactual metric that measures the potential degradation of the market if the LP withdraws. This combined approach provides a more detailed and realistic characterization of an LP's impact, moving beyond the binary and often misleading classifications used by existing methods. This impact-focused and comprehensive approach enables SILS to accurately identify high-impact LPs-including those missed by traditional methods and supports essential applications like a protective oracle layer and actionable trader signals, thereby significantly enhancing DeFi ecosystem. The framework provides unprecedented transparency into the underlying liquidity structure and associated risks, effectively reducing the common false positives and uncovering critical false negatives found in traditional models. Therefore, SILS provides an effective mechanism for proactive risk management, transforming how DeFi protocols safeguard their ecosystems against asymmetric liquidity behavior.</description>

      <title>Improving Count-Mean Sketch as the Leading Locally Differentially Private Frequency Estimator for Large Dictionaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03785v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper identifies that a group of latest locally-differentially-private (LDP) algorithms for frequency estimation, including all the Hadamard-matrix-based algorithms, are equivalent to the private Count-Mean Sketch (CMS) algorithm with different parameters. Therefore, we revisit the private CMS, correct errors in the original CMS paper regarding expectation and variance, modify the CMS implementation to eliminate existing bias, and optimize CMS using randomized response (RR) as the perturbation method. The optimized CMS with RR is shown to outperform CMS variants with other known perturbations in reducing the worst-case mean squared error (MSE), $l_1$ loss, and $l_2$ loss. Additionally, we prove that pairwise-independent hashing is sufficient for CMS, reducing its communication cost to the logarithm of the cardinality of all possible values (i.e., a dictionary). As a result, the optimized CMS with RR is proven theoretically and empirically as the leading algorithm for reducing the aforementioned loss functions when dealing with a very large dictionary. Furthermore, we demonstrate that randomness is necessary to ensure the correctness of CMS, and the communication cost of CMS, though low, is unavoidable despite the randomness being public or private.</description>

      <title>KGV: Integrating Large Language Models with Knowledge Graphs for Cyber Threat Intelligence Credibility Assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08088v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cyber threat intelligence (CTI) is a crucial tool to prevent sophisticated, organized, and weaponized cyber attacks. However, few studies have focused on the credibility assessment of CTI, and this work still requires manual analysis by cybersecurity experts. In this paper, we propose Knowledge Graph-based Verifier (KGV), the first framework integrating large language models (LLMs) with simple structured knowledge graphs (KGs) for automated CTI credibility assessment. Unlike entity-centric KGs, KGV constructs paragraph-level semantic graphs where nodes represent text segments connected through similarity analysis, which effectively enhances the semantic understanding ability of the model, reduces KG density and greatly improves response speed. Experimental results demonstrate that our KGV outperforms state-of-the-art fact reasoning methods on the CTI-200 dataset, achieving a 5.7\% improvement in F1. Additionally, it shows strong scalability on factual QA and fake news detection datasets. Compared to entity-based knowledge graphs (KGs) for equivalent-length texts, our structurally simple KG reduces node quantities by nearly two-thirds while boosting precision by 1.7\% and cutting response time by 46.7\%. In addition, we have created and publicly released the first CTI credibility assessment dataset, CTI-200. Distinct from CTI identification datasets, CTI-200 refines CTI summaries and key sentences to focus specifically on credibility assessment.</description>

      <title>VENENA: A Deceptive Visual Encryption Framework for Wireless Semantic Secrecy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10699v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Eavesdropping has been a long-standing threat to the security and privacy of wireless communications, since it is difficult to detect and costly to prevent. As networks evolve towards Sixth Generation (6G) and semantic communication becomes increasingly central to next-generation wireless systems, securing semantic information transmission emerges as a critical challenge. While classical physical layer security (PLS) focuses on passive security, the recently proposed concept of physical layer deception (PLD) offers a semantic encryption measure to actively deceive eavesdroppers. Yet the existing studies of PLD have been dominantly information-theoretical and link-level oriented, lacking considerations of system-level design and practical implementation.
  In this work we propose a novel artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled framework called Visual ENcryption for Eavesdropping NegAtion (VENENA), which combines the techniques of PLD, visual encryption, and image poisoning, into a comprehensive mechanism for deceptive secure semantic transmission in future wireless networks. By leveraging advanced vision transformers and semantic codecs, VENENA demonstrates how semantic security can be enhanced through the synergy of physical layer techniques and artificial intelligence, paving the way for secure semantic communication in 6G networks.</description>

      <title>Model Tampering Attacks Enable More Rigorous Evaluations of LLM Capabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05209v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Evaluations of large language model (LLM) risks and capabilities are increasingly being incorporated into AI risk management and governance frameworks. Currently, most risk evaluations are conducted by designing inputs that elicit harmful behaviors from the system. However, this approach suffers from two limitations. First, input-output evaluations cannot fully evaluate realistic risks from open-weight models. Second, the behaviors identified during any particular input-output evaluation can only lower-bound the model's worst-possible-case input-output behavior. As a complementary method for eliciting harmful behaviors, we propose evaluating LLMs with model tampering attacks which allow for modifications to latent activations or weights. We pit state-of-the-art techniques for removing harmful LLM capabilities against a suite of 5 input-space and 6 model tampering attacks. In addition to benchmarking these methods against each other, we show that (1) model resilience to capability elicitation attacks lies on a low-dimensional robustness subspace; (2) the success rate of model tampering attacks can empirically predict and offer conservative estimates for the success of held-out input-space attacks; and (3) state-of-the-art unlearning methods can easily be undone within 16 steps of fine-tuning. Together, these results highlight the difficulty of suppressing harmful LLM capabilities and show that model tampering attacks enable substantially more rigorous evaluations than input-space attacks alone.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Ensemble and Deep Learning Models for Static Malware Detection with Dimensionality Reduction Using the EMBER Dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16952v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study investigates the effectiveness of several machine learning algorithms for static malware detection using the EMBER dataset, which contains feature representations of Portable Executable (PE) files. We evaluate eight classification models: LightGBM, XGBoost, CatBoost, Random Forest, Extra Trees, HistGradientBoosting, k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and TabNet, under three preprocessing settings: original feature space, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA). The models are assessed on accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and AUC to examine both predictive performance and robustness. Ensemble methods, especially LightGBM and XGBoost, show the best overall performance across all configurations, with minimal sensitivity to PCA and consistent generalization. LDA improves KNN performance but significantly reduces accuracy for boosting models. TabNet, while promising in theory, underperformed under feature reduction, likely due to architectural sensitivity to input structure. The analysis is supported by detailed exploratory data analysis (EDA), including mutual information ranking, PCA or t-SNE visualizations, and outlier detection using Isolation Forest and Local Outlier Factor (LOF), which confirm the discriminatory capacity of key features in the EMBER dataset. The results suggest that boosting models remain the most reliable choice for high-dimensional static malware detection, and that dimensionality reduction should be applied selectively based on model type. This work provides a benchmark for comparing classification models and preprocessing strategies in malware detection tasks and contributes insights that can guide future system development and real-world deployment.</description>

      <title>Layer-Aware Representation Filtering: Purifying Finetuning Data to Preserve LLM Safety Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18631v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With rapid advancement and increasing accessibility of LLMs, fine-tuning aligned models has become a critical step for adapting them to real-world applications, which makes the safety of this fine-tuning process more important than ever. However, recent studies have highlighted a critical challenge: even when fine-tuning with seemingly benign downstream datasets, the safety of aligned LLMs can be compromised, making them more susceptible to malicious instructions.
  In this paper, we show that fine-tuning datasets often contain samples with safety-degrading features that are not easily identifiable on the surface. These samples can significantly degrade the safety alignment of LLMs during fine-tuning. To address this issue, we propose LARF, a Layer-Aware Representation Filtering method. This method identifies safety-sensitive layers within the LLM and leverages their representations to detect which data samples in the post-training dataset contain safety-degrading features.
  Experimental results demonstrate that LARF can effectively identify benign data with safety-degrading features. After removing such data, the safety alignment degradation caused by fine-tuning is mitigated. Please see our code at https://github.com/LLLeoLi/LARF.</description>

      <title>Noise Contrastive Estimation-based Matching Framework for Low-Resource Security Attack Pattern Recognition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.10337v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Tactics, Techniques and Procedures (TTPs) represent sophisticated attack patterns in the cybersecurity domain, described encyclopedically in textual knowledge bases. Identifying TTPs in cybersecurity writing, often called TTP mapping, is an important and challenging task. Conventional learning approaches often target the problem in the classical multi-class or multilabel classification setting. This setting hinders the learning ability of the model due to a large number of classes (i.e., TTPs), the inevitable skewness of the label distribution and the complex hierarchical structure of the label space. We formulate the problem in a different learning paradigm, where the assignment of a text to a TTP label is decided by the direct semantic similarity between the two, thus reducing the complexity of competing solely over the large labeling space. To that end, we propose a neural matching architecture with an effective sampling-based learn-to-compare mechanism, facilitating the learning process of the matching model despite constrained resources.</description>

      <title>Estimation of conditional average treatment effects on distributed confidential data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.02672v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The estimation of conditional average treatment effects (CATEs) is an important topic in many scientific fields. CATEs can be estimated with high accuracy if data distributed across multiple parties are centralized. However, it is difficult to aggregate such data owing to confidentiality or privacy concerns. To address this issue, we propose data collaboration double machine learning, a method for estimating CATE models using privacy-preserving fusion data constructed from distributed sources, and evaluate its performance through simulations. We make three main contributions. First, our method enables estimation and testing of semi-parametric CATE models without iterative communication on distributed data, providing robustness to model mis-specification compared to parametric approaches. Second, it enables collaborative estimation across different time points and parties by accumulating a knowledge base. Third, our method performs as well as or better than existing methods in simulations using synthetic, semi-synthetic, and real-world datasets.</description>

      <title>Secret Collusion among AI Agents: Multi-Agent Deception via Steganography</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.07510v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent capability increases in large language models (LLMs) open up applications in which groups of communicating generative AI agents solve joint tasks. This poses privacy and security challenges concerning the unauthorised sharing of information, or other unwanted forms of agent coordination. Modern steganographic techniques could render such dynamics hard to detect. In this paper, we comprehensively formalise the problem of secret collusion in systems of generative AI agents by drawing on relevant concepts from both AI and security literature. We study incentives for the use of steganography, and propose a variety of mitigation measures. Our investigations result in a model evaluation framework that systematically tests capabilities required for various forms of secret collusion. We provide extensive empirical results across a range of contemporary LLMs. While the steganographic capabilities of current models remain limited, GPT-4 displays a capability jump suggesting the need for continuous monitoring of steganographic frontier model capabilities. We conclude by laying out a comprehensive research program to mitigate future risks of collusion between generative AI models.</description>

      <title>T2ISafety: Benchmark for Assessing Fairness, Toxicity, and Privacy in Image Generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.12612v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) models have rapidly advanced, enabling the generation of high-quality images from text prompts across various domains. However, these models present notable safety concerns, including the risk of generating harmful, biased, or private content. Current research on assessing T2I safety remains in its early stages. While some efforts have been made to evaluate models on specific safety dimensions, many critical risks remain unexplored. To address this gap, we introduce T2ISafety, a safety benchmark that evaluates T2I models across three key domains: toxicity, fairness, and bias. We build a detailed hierarchy of 12 tasks and 44 categories based on these three domains, and meticulously collect 70K corresponding prompts. Based on this taxonomy and prompt set, we build a large-scale T2I dataset with 68K manually annotated images and train an evaluator capable of detecting critical risks that previous work has failed to identify, including risks that even ultra-large proprietary models like GPTs cannot correctly detect. We evaluate 12 prominent diffusion models on T2ISafety and reveal several concerns including persistent issues with racial fairness, a tendency to generate toxic content, and significant variation in privacy protection across the models, even with defense methods like concept erasing. Data and evaluator are released under https://github.com/adwardlee/t2i_safety.</description>

      <title>Blind Spot Navigation: Evolutionary Discovery of Sensitive Semantic Concepts for LVLMs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.15265v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Adversarial attacks aim to generate malicious inputs that mislead deep models, but beyond causing model failure, they cannot provide certain interpretable information such as ``\textit{What content in inputs make models more likely to fail?}'' However, this information is crucial for researchers to specifically improve model robustness. Recent research suggests that models may be particularly sensitive to certain semantics in visual inputs (such as ``wet,'' ``foggy''), making them prone to errors. Inspired by this, in this paper we conducted the first exploration on large vision-language models (LVLMs) and found that LVLMs indeed are susceptible to hallucinations and various errors when facing specific semantic concepts in images. To efficiently search for these sensitive concepts, we integrated large language models (LLMs) and text-to-image (T2I) models to propose a novel semantic evolution framework. Randomly initialized semantic concepts undergo LLM-based crossover and mutation operations to form image descriptions, which are then converted by T2I models into visual inputs for LVLMs. The task-specific performance of LVLMs on each input is quantified as fitness scores for the involved semantics and serves as reward signals to further guide LLMs in exploring concepts that induce LVLMs. Extensive experiments on seven mainstream LVLMs and two multimodal tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Additionally, we provide interesting findings about the sensitive semantics of LVLMs, aiming to inspire further in-depth research.</description>

      <title>CLIP-Guided Backdoor Defense through Entropy-Based Poisoned Dataset Separation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05113v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are susceptible to backdoor attacks, where adversaries poison training data to implant backdoor into the victim model. Current backdoor defenses on poisoned data often suffer from high computational costs or low effectiveness against advanced attacks like clean-label and clean-image backdoors. To address them, we introduce CLIP-Guided backdoor Defense (CGD), an efficient and effective method that mitigates various backdoor attacks. CGD utilizes a publicly accessible CLIP model to identify inputs that are likely to be clean or poisoned. It then retrains the model with these inputs, using CLIP's logits as a guidance to effectively neutralize the backdoor. Experiments on 4 datasets and 11 attack types demonstrate that CGD reduces attack success rates (ASRs) to below 1% while maintaining clean accuracy (CA) with a maximum drop of only 0.3%, outperforming existing defenses. Additionally, we show that clean-data-based defenses can be adapted to poisoned data using CGD. Also, CGD exhibits strong robustness, maintaining low ASRs even when employing a weaker CLIP model or when CLIP itself is compromised by a backdoor. These findings underscore CGD's exceptional efficiency, effectiveness, and applicability for real-world backdoor defense scenarios. Code: https://github.com/binyxu/CGD.</description>

      <title>Pulse-Level Simulation of Crosstalk Attacks on Superconducting Quantum Hardware</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16181v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hardware crosstalk in multi-tenant superconducting quantum computers poses a severe security threat, allowing adversaries to induce targeted errors across tenant boundaries by injecting carefully engineered pulses. We present a simulation-based study of active crosstalk attacks at the pulse level, analyzing how adversarial control of pulse timing, shape, amplitude, and coupling can disrupt a victim's computation. Our framework models the time-dependent dynamics of a three-qubit system in the rotating frame, capturing both always-on couplings and injected drive pulses. We examine two attack strategies: attacker-first (pulse before victim operation) and victim-first (pulse after), and systematically identify the pulse and coupling configurations that cause the largest logical errors. Protocol-level experiments on quantum coin flip and XOR classification circuits show that some protocols are highly vulnerable to these attacks, while others remain robust. Based on these findings, we discuss practical methods for detection and mitigation to improve security in quantum cloud platforms.</description>
