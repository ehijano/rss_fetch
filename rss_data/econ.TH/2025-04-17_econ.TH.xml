      <title>Efficient Major Transition Exchange under Distributional and Dual Priority-respecting Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many real matching markets encounter distributional and fairness constraints. Motivated by the Chinese Major Transition Program (CMT), this paper studies the design of exchange mechanisms within a fresh framework of both distributional and dual priority-respecting constraints. Specifically, each student has an initial assigned major and applies to transfer to a more desirable one. A student can successfully transfer majors only if they obtain eligibility from both their initial major and the applied major. Each major has a dual priority: a strict priority over current students who wish to transfer out and a strict priority over students from other majors who wish to transfer in. Additionally, each major faces a ceiling constraint and a floor constraint to regulate student distribution. We show that the existing mechanisms of CMT result in avoidable inefficiencies, and propose two mechanisms that can match students to majors in an efficient way as well as respecting each major's distributional and dual priority. The efficient mechanisms are based on a proposed solution concept: eligibility maximization (EM), and two processes for identifying improvement cycles--specifically, transfer-in exchangeable cycles and transfer-out exchangeable cycles.</description>

      <title>Improvable Students in School Choice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12871v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Deferred Acceptance algorithm (DA) frequently produces Pareto inefficient allocations in school choice problems. While a number of efficient mechanisms that Pareto-dominate DA are available, a normative question remains unexplored: which students should benefit from efficiency enhancements? We address it by introducing the concept of \emph{maximally improvable students}, who benefit in every improvement over DA that includes as many students as possible in set-inclusion terms. 
We prove that common mechanisms such as Efficiency-Adjusted DA (EADA) and Top Trading Cycles applied to DA (DA+TTC) can fall significantly short of this benchmark. These mechanisms may only improve two maximally-improvable students when up to $n-1$ could benefit. Addressing this limitation, we develop the Maximum Improvement over DA mechanism (MIDA), which generates an efficient allocation that maximises the number of students improved over DA. We show that MIDA can generate fewer blocking pairs than EADA and DA+TTC, demonstrating that its distributional improvements need not come at the cost of high justified envy.</description>

      <title>Pattern formation by advection-diffusion in new economic geography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05804v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies spatial patterns formed by a proximate population migration driven by real wage gradients and other idiosyncratic factors. The model consists of a tractable core-periphery model incorporating a quasi-linear log utility function and an advection-diffusion equation expressing population migration. It is found that diffusion stabilizes a homogeneous stationary solution when transport costs are sufficiently low, and it also inhibits the monotonic facilitation of agglomeration caused by lower transport costs in some cases. When the homogeneous stationary solution is unstable, numerical simulations show spatial patterns having multiple urban areas. Insights into the relation between agglomeration and control parameters (transport costs and preference for variety of consumers) gained from the large-time behavior of solutions confirm the validity of the analysis of linearized equations.</description>

      <title>Differentially Private Sequential Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19525v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a differentially private sequential learning setting, agents introduce endogenous noise into their actions to maintain privacy. Applying this to a standard sequential learning model leads to different outcomes for continuous vs. binary signals. For continuous signals with a nonzero privacy budget, we introduce a novel smoothed randomized response mechanism that adapts noise based on distance to a threshold, unlike traditional randomized response, which applies uniform noise. This enables agents' actions to better reflect both private signals and observed history, accelerating asymptotic learning speed to $\Theta_{\epsilon}(\log(n))$, compared to $\Theta(\sqrt{\log(n)})$ in the non-private regime where privacy budget is infinite. Moreover, in the non-private setting, the expected stopping time for the first correct decision and the number of incorrect actions diverge, meaning early agents may make mistakes for an unreasonably long period. In contrast, under a finite privacy budget $\epsilon \in (0,1)$, both remain finite, highlighting a stark contrast between private and non-private learning. Learning with continuous signals in the private regime is more efficient, as smooth randomized response enhances the log-likelihood ratio over time, improving information aggregation. Conversely, for binary signals, differential privacy noise hinders learning, as agents tend to use a constant randomized response strategy before an information cascade forms, reducing action informativeness and hampering the overall process.</description>
