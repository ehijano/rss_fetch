      <title>Super-resolution of turbulent velocity and scalar fields using different scalar distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08834v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, sub-grid models for turbulent mixing have been developed by data-driven methods for large eddy simulation (LES). Super-resolution is a data-driven deconvolution technique in which deep convolutional neural networks are trained using direct numerical simulation (DNS) data to learn mappings between the input data from a low resolution domain to the super-resolved high resolution output domain. While the technique has been of a great success in a-priori tests, the assessment of its generalization capabilities is required for further a-posteriori applications. In this study we assess the generalization capability of a super-resolution generative adversarial network (GAN) in reconstructing scalars with different distributions. Forced turbulence mixing DNS data with a fixed Reynolds number but different bulk scalar distributions, are generated and used as training/testing datasets. The results show that the velocity vector field can be reconstructed well, but the model fails to super-resolve the scalars from out-of-sample distributions. Including two extreme mixture fraction distributions, namely double Pareto and semi-Gaussian, in the training dataset significantly improves the performance of the model, not only for those distributions, but also for previously unseen bimodal distributions.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamics in a villi-patterned channel due to pendular-wave activity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08852v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inspired by the motility of small intestine, we investigate the flow generated by a propagating pendular-wave along the walls of a symmetric 2D channel lined with elongated villi-like microstructures. The rigid villi follow simple harmonic axial motion, but with a phase lag to their neighbours, resulting in travelling intervillous contractions. We use lattice Boltzmann simulations to resolve the flow around the villi and the luminal channel space, sampling small to moderate Womersley numbers. We analyse an emergent `mixing' boundary layer in the lumen, separating two distinct flow regions. A mixing region is formed above the villi, characterised by semi-vortical flow patterns, which travel along with the wave. In the channel centre, unidirectional axial flow emerges, flowing opposite to the imposed wave direction, even in the Stokes flow regime. This behaviour contrasts with canonical wave driven peristaltic flow (Jaffrin &amp; Shapiro 1971). The fluid trapped in the intervillous gaps is forced to take a non-reciprocal path due to the travelling pendular-wave, which breaks time-symmetry in the Stokes regime. We propose an effective velocity boundary condition, incorporating perturbations due to the presence of the villi. In the inertial regime, the boundary layer shrinks due to dynamic flow confinement arising from increased oscillatory flow inertia. We identify the Stokes to inertial transition, and find phenomenological scaling laws for the boundary layer decay and axial and radial fluid fluxes. Our results not only advance the understanding of transport within the gut but also suggest a novel way for microfluidic flow control in confined channels.</description>

      <title>An aerodynamic measurement system to improve the efficiency of wind turbine rotor blades</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08860v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The wind energy sector is growing rapidly with the installation of wind turbines with long, slender blades in a diverse range of locations. To enhance the operational performance under specific wind conditions and to validate the aerodynamic design of flexible blades, it is crucial to obtain comprehensive data on the aerodynamic behaviour of the blades in the field, such as time-resolved pressure distributions, local inflow conditions and dynamic responses of the blade. However, published field measurements are scarce for large-scale rotor blades due to the complex and costly installation of the requisite measurement systems. In recent work, we developed a wireless and self-sufficient aerodynamic measurement system, named Aerosense, which is less complex and costly than conventional aerodynamic measurement systems. The Aerosense system uses Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS) sensors to obtain local aerodynamic pressures, blade motions, and inflow conditions. In this paper, we demonstrate the value of Aerosense in understanding the aerodynamic behaviour of rotor blades, using a 7kW wind turbine operating in the field. After a thorough calibration and correction process, we demonstrate, for example, that the pressure distribution can vary significantly during one rotation of the blade, even under stable wind conditions. These variations are found to be due to the misalignment of the wind direction with the wind turbine's rotational axis. We therefore conclude that the Aerosense measurement system is valuable for understanding the aerodynamic loading on rotor blades as well as the influence of the inflow conditions on wind turbine performance.</description>

      <title>Taylor-Couette flow with split endcaps: preparatory hydrodynamic study for upcoming DRESDYN-MRI experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08875v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetorotational instability (MRI) is of great importance in astrophysical disks, driving angular momentum transport and accretion of matter onto a central object. A Taylor-Couette (TC) flow between two coaxial cylinders subject to an axial magnetic field is a preferred setup for MRI-experiments. A main challenge in those experiments has been to minimize the effects of axial boundaries, or endcaps, which substantially alter the flow structure compared to the axially unbounded idealized case. Understanding the influence of endcaps on the flow stability is crucial for the unambiguous experimental identification of MRI. In this paper, we examine the hydrodynamic evolution of a TC flow in the presence of split endcap rims up to Reynolds number $Re =$ $2\times 10^5$. At this $Re$, the flow deviates from the ideal TC flow profile, resulting in about $15\%$ deviation in angular velocity at the mid-height of the cylinders. Aside from turbulent fluctuations caused by shearing instability at the endcaps, the bulk flow remains axially independent and exhibits Rayleigh stability. We characterize the scaling of the Ekman and Stewartson boundary layer thickness with respect to $Re$. We also study the effect of changing the rotation ratio of the cylinders $\mu$ on the flow at large $Re$ and show that TC experiments can be conducted for larger $\mu \sim 0.5$ to safely ensure the hydrodynamic stability of the flow in the upcoming DRESDYN-MRI experiment. In all configurations considered, the modification of the flow profile by the endcaps further decreases the required critical threshold for the onset of MRI that can facilitate its detection in future experiments.</description>

      <title>Coherent Structures and Lattice-Boltzmann Hydrodynamics in Turbulent Pipe Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08940v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coherent structures (CS) are known to be part of the foundations of turbulent flow dynamics. For a long time, their appearance was believed to be chaotic and unorganized. However, it has been demonstrated through numerical simulations and experiments that a high degree of organization of CS could be attributed to the constitution of a turbulent state. Understanding these organizational dynamics promises to bring valuable theoretical and applied predictions, such as the average lifetime of turbulent structures and understanding the role of CS in particulate transport.
  The identification of CS was achieved by selecting the most energetic mode in the flow direction within a specified reference shell. Furthermore, the transition dynamics between the identified CS was investigated as a stochastic process, revealing a non-Markovian effect through an algebraic decay of the temporal self-correlation of the identified CS. Finally, the non-Markovian behavior observed between the transitions of CS was reproduced by a low-level Markovian model, which takes into account the degeneracy effects in the definition of the identified CS.
  In order to obtain an algorithm capable of simulating the quasi-static regime in magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) flows a multiple-relaxation-time (MRT) model and a distance-dependent boundary condition were introduced for the lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) associated with the induction equation for MHD flows. Finally, a turbulent pipe flow simulation was performed by the LBM with a MRT model for hydrodynamic distributions. The identification of CS revealed a non-trivial memory effect with respect to the force that triggered the turbulent state. The transition dynamics of CS revealed a Markovian behavior for finely resolved time data, indicating that experimental behavior could be recovered for larger time separations and, consequently, a larger dataset.</description>

      <title>Large-scale multifractality and lack of self-similar decay for Burgers and 3D Navier-Stokes turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08983v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study decaying turbulence in the 1D Burgers equation (Burgulence) and 3D Navier-Stokes (NS) turbulence. We first investigate the decay in time $t$ of the energy $E(t)$ in Burgulence, for a fractional Brownian initial potential, with Hurst exponent $H$, and demonstrate rigorously a self-similar time-decay of $E(t)$, previously determined heuristically. This is a consequence of the nontrivial boundedness of the energy for any positive time. We define a spatially forgetful \textit{oblivious fractional Brownian motion} (OFBM), with Hurst exponent $H$, and prove that Burgulence, with an OFBM as initial potential $\varphi_0(x)$, is not only intermittent, but it also displays, a hitherto unanticipated, large-scale bifractality or multifractality; the latter occurs if we combine OFBMs, with different values of $H$. This is the first rigorous proof of genuine multifractality for turbulence in a nonlinear hydrodynamical partial differential equation. We then present direct numerical simulations (DNSs) of freely decaying turbulence, capturing some aspects of this multifractality. For Burgulence, we investigate such decay for two cases: (A) $\varphi_0(x)$ a multifractal random walk that crosses over to a fractional Brownian motion beyond a crossover scale $\mathcal{L}$, tuned to go from small- to large-scale multifractality; (B) initial energy spectra $E_0(k)$, with wavenumber $k$, having one or more power-law regions, which lead, respectively, to self-similar and non-self-similar energy decay. Our analogous DNSs of the 3D NS equations also uncover self-similar and non-self-similar energy decay. Challenges confronting the detection of genuine large-scale multifractality, in numerical and experimental studies of NS and MHD turbulence, are highlighted.</description>

      <title>Towards a Generalized SA Model: Symbolic Regression-Based Correction for Separated Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09225v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study focuses on the numerical simulation of high Reynolds number separated flows and proposes a data-driven approach to improve the predictive capability of the SA turbulence model. First, data assimilation was performed on two typical airfoils with high angle-of-attack separated flows to obtain a high-fidelity flow field dataset. Based on this dataset, a white-box model was developed using symbolic regression to modify the production term of the SA model. To validate the effectiveness of the modified model, multiple representative airfoils and wings, such as the SC1095 airfoil, DU91-W2-250 airfoil, and ONERA-M6 wing, were selected as test cases. A wide range of flow conditions was considered, including subsonic to transonic regimes, Reynolds numbers ranging from hundreds of thousands to tens of millions, and angles of attack varying from small to large. The results indicate that the modified model significantly improves the prediction accuracy of separated flows while maintaining the predictive capability for attached flows. It notably enhances the reproduction of separated vortex structures and flow separation locations, reducing the mean relative error in lift prediction at stall angles by 69.2% and improving computational accuracy by more than three times. Furthermore, validation using a zero-pressure-gradient flat plate case confirms the modified model's ability to accurately predict the turbulent boundary layer velocity profile and skin friction coefficient distribution. The findings of this study provide new insights and methodologies for the numerical simulation of high Reynolds number separated flows, contributing to more accurate modeling of complex flow phenomena in engineering applications.</description>

      <title>Yield-Stress Fluid Mixing: Localization Mechanisms and Regime Transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09359v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the mechanisms and regimes of mixing in yield-stress fluids by simulating the stirring of an infinite, two-dimensional domain filled with a Bingham fluid. A cylindrical stirrer moves along a circular path at constant speed to stir the fluid, with an initially quiescent domain marked by a passive dye in the lower half, facilitating the analysis of dye interface evolution and mixing dynamics. We first examine the mixing process in Newtonian fluids, identifying three key mechanisms: interface stretching and folding around the stirrer's path, diffusion across streamlines, and dye advection and interface stretching due to vortex shedding. Introducing yield stress into the system leads to notable localization effects in mixing, manifesting through three mechanisms: advection of vortices within a finite distance of the stirrer, vortex entrapment near the stirrer, and complete suppression of vortex shedding at high yield stresses. Based on these mechanisms, we classify three distinct mixing regimes in yield-stress fluids: (i) Regime SE, where shed vortices escape the central region, (ii) Regime ST, where shed vortices remain trapped near the stirrer, and (iii) Regime NS, where no vortex shedding occurs. These regimes are quantitatively distinguished through spectral analysis of energy oscillations, revealing transitions and the critical Bingham and Reynolds numbers. The transitions are captured through effective Reynolds numbers, supporting a hypothesis that mixing regime transitions in yield-stress fluids share fundamental characteristics with bluff-body flow dynamics. The findings provide a mechanistic framework for understanding and predicting mixing behaviors in yield-stress fluids, suggesting that the localization mechanisms and mixing regimes observed here are archetypal for stirred-tank applications.</description>

      <title>Experimental study of the convection in a thin cylindrical gas layer with imposed bottom and top fluxes and imposed side temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09461v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate convection in a thin cylindrical gas layer with an imposed flux at the bottom and a fixed temperature along the side, using a combination of direct numerical simulations and laboratory experiments. The experimental approach allows us to extend by two orders of magnitude the explored range in terms of flux Rayleigh number. We identify a scaling law governing the root-mean-square horizontal velocity and explain it through a dimensional analysis based on heat transport in the turbulent regime. Using particle image velocimetry, we experimentally confirm, for the most turbulent regimes, the presence of a drifting persistent pattern consisting of radial branches, as identified by Rein et al. (2023, J. Fluid Mech. 977, A26). We characterise the angular drift frequency and azimuthal wavenumber of this pattern as functions of the Rayleigh number. The system exhibits a wide distribution of heat flux across various time scales, with the longest fluctuations attributed to the branch pattern and the shortest to turbulent fluctuations. Consequently, the branch pattern must be considered to better forecast important wall heat flux fluctuations, a result of great relevance in the context of nuclear safety, the initial motivation for our study.</description>

      <title>Direct Flow Simulations with Implicit Neural Representation of Complex Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08724v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Implicit neural representations have emerged as a powerful approach for encoding complex geometries as continuous functions. These implicit models are widely used in computer vision and 3D content creation, but their integration into scientific computing workflows, such as finite element or finite volume simulations, remains limited. One reason is that conventional simulation pipelines require explicit geometric inputs (meshes), forcing INR-based shapes to be converted to meshes--a step that introduces approximation errors, computational overhead, and significant manual effort. Immersed boundary methods partially alleviate this issue by allowing simulations on background grids without body-fitted meshes. However, they still require an explicit boundary description and can suffer from numerical artifacts, such as sliver cut cells. The shifted boundary method (SBM) eliminates the need for explicit geometry by using grid-aligned surrogate boundaries, making it inherently compatible with implicit shape representations. Here, we present a framework that directly couples neural implicit geometries with SBM to perform high-fidelity fluid flow simulations without any intermediate mesh generation. By leveraging neural network inference, our approach computes the surrogate boundary and distance vectors required by SBM on-the-fly directly from the INR, thus completely bypassing traditional geometry processing. We demonstrate this approach on canonical 2D and 3D flow benchmarks (lid-driven cavity flows) and complex geometries (gyroids, the Stanford bunny, and AI-generated shapes), achieving simulation accuracy comparable to conventional mesh-based methods. This work highlights a novel pathway for integrating AI-driven geometric representations into computational physics, establishing INRs as a versatile and scalable tool for simulations and removing a long-standing bottleneck in geometry handling.</description>

      <title>From Models To Experiments: Shallow Recurrent Decoder Networks on the DYNASTY Experimental Facility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08907v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Shallow Recurrent Decoder networks are a novel paradigm recently introduced for state estimation, combining sparse observations with high-dimensional model data. This architecture features important advantages compared to standard data-driven methods including: the ability to use only three sensors (even randomly selected) for reconstructing the entire dynamics of a physical system; the ability to train on compressed data spanned by a reduced basis; the ability to measure a single field variable (easy to measure) and reconstruct coupled spatio-temporal fields that are not observable and minimal hyper-parameter tuning. This approach has been verified on different test cases within different fields including nuclear reactors, even though an application to a real experimental facility, adopting the employment of in-situ observed quantities, is missing. This work aims to fill this gap by applying the Shallow Recurrent Decoder architecture to the DYNASTY facility, built at Politecnico di Milano, which studies the natural circulation established by internally heated fluids for Generation IV applications, especially in the case of Circulating Fuel reactors. The RELAP5 code is used to generate the high-fidelity data, and temperature measurements extracted by the facility are used as input for the state estimation. The results of this work will provide a validation of the Shallow Recurrent Decoder architecture to engineering systems, showing the capabilities of this approach to provide and accurate state estimation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04517v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Anthropogenic climate change has increased the probability, severity, and duration of heat waves and droughts, subsequently escalating the risk of wildfires. Mathematical and computational models can enhance our understanding of wildfire propagation dynamics. In this work, we present a simplified Advection-Diffusion-Reaction (ADR) model that accounts for the effect of fuel moisture, and also considers wind, local radiation, natural convection and topography. The model explicitly represents fuel moisture effects by means of the apparent calorific capacity method, distinguishing between live and dead fuel moisture content. Using this model, we conduct exploratory simulations and present theoretical insights into various modeling decisions in the context of ADR-based models. We aim to shed light on the interplay between the different modeled mechanisms in wildfire propagation to identify key factors influencing fire spread and to estimate the model's predictive capacity.</description>

      <title>Non-unique self-similar blowups in shell models: insights from dynamical systems and machine-learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07377v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Strong numerical hints exist in favor of a universal blowup scenario in the Sabra shell model, a popular cascade model of 3D turbulence, which features complex velocity variables on a geometric progression of scales $\ell_n \propto \lambda ^{-n}$. The blowup is thought to be of self-similar type and characterized by the finite-time convergence towards a universal profile with non-Kolmogorov (anomalous) small-scale scaling $\propto \ell_n^{x}$. Solving the underlying nonlinear eigenvalue problem has however proven challenging, and prior insights mainly used the Dombre-Gilson renormalization scheme, transforming self-similar solutions into solitons propagating over infinite rescaled time horizon. Here, we further characterize Sabra blowups by implementing two strategies targeting the eigenvalue problem. The first involves formal expansion in terms of the bookkeeping parameter $\delta = (1-x)\log \lambda$, and interpretes the self-similar solution as a (degenerate) homoclinic bifurcation. Using standard bifurcation toolkits, we show that the homoclinic bifurcations identified under finite-truncation of the series converge to the observed Sabra solution. The second strategy uses machine-learning optimization to solve directly for the Sabra eigenvalue. It reveals an intricate phase space, with the presence of a continuous family of non-universal blowup profiles, characterized by various number $N$ of pulses and exponents $x_N\ge x$.</description>

      <title>A global similarity correction for the RANS modeling of natural convection in unstably stratified flows</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.12973v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study proposes a global similarity correction for Reynolds-averaged Navier--Stokes (RANS) modeling of buoyancy effects in unstably stratified flows. Conventional two-equation RANS models (e.g., the $k$-$\varepsilon$ model) lack a clear criterion for incorporating unstable buoyancy effects in their scale-determining equations (e.g., $\varepsilon$-equation). To address this gap, a global correction function is introduced, derived from a generalized algebraic formulation that incorporates available potential energy as an additional parameter. This function reproduces a global similarity law commonly observed in natural convection flows--for instance, the correlation among the Nusselt, Rayleigh, and Prandtl numbers, which can be approximately expressed as a single power law over a wide parameter range. A calibration method is proposed in which an approximate analytical solution for Rayleigh--B\'enard convection is obtained via equilibrium analysis, confirming that the proposed model captures similarity relations not addressed by conventional one-point closures. Numerical results show significantly improved agreement with experimental data, accurately reproducing Nusselt number dependencies over broad ranges of Rayleigh and Prandtl numbers in unstably stratified flows, such as Rayleigh--B\'enard convection and two types of internally heated convection. The method remains fully compatible with standard RANS frameworks and reverts to traditional turbulence treatments in shear-driven flows where buoyant effects are negligible. By introducing only a single, simple, algebraic global function in the conventional $\varepsilon$-equation, this approach significantly enhances the accuracy and robustness of buoyancy-driven turbulence simulations.</description>

      <title>Emergent turbulence and coarsening arrest in active-spinner fluids</title>

Abstract: We uncover activity-driven crossover from phase separation to a new turbulent state in a two-dimensional system of counter-rotating spinners. We study the statistical properties of this active-rotor turbulence using the active-rotor Cahn-Hilliard-Navier-Stokes model, and show that the vorticity $\omega \propto \phi$, the scalar field that distinguishes regions with different rotating states. We explain this intriguing proportionality theoretically, and we characterize power-law energy and concentration spectra, intermittency, and flow-topology statistics. We suggest biological implications of such turbulence.</description>

      <title>Mean resolvent analysis of periodic flows</title>

Abstract: The mean resolvent operator predicts, in the frequency domain, the mean linear response to forcing, and, as such, it provides the optimal LTI approximation of the input-output dynamics of flows in the statistically steady regime (Leclercq &amp; Sipp 2023). In this paper, we aim at providing numerical frameworks to extract optimal forcings and responses of the mean resolvent, also known as mean resolvent modes. For periodic flows, we rewrite the mean resolvent operator in terms of a harmonic resolvent operator (Wereley &amp; Hall 1990; Padovan &amp; Rowley 2022) to obtain reference mean resolvent modes. Successively, we propose a projection algorithm approximating those modes within a subspace of mean-flow resolvent modes. The projected problem is directly solved in the frequency domain, but we also discuss a time-stepper version that can bypass the explicit construction of the operator without recurring to direct-adjoint looping. We evaluate the algorithms on an incompressible axisymmetric laminar jet periodically forced at the inlet. For a weakly unsteady case, the mean-flow resolvent correctly approximates the main receptivity peak of the mean resolvent, but completely fails to capture a secondary receptivity peak. For a strongly unsteady case, even the main receptivity peak of the mean resolvent is incorrectly captured by the mean-flow resolvent. Although the present algorithms are currently restricted to periodic flows, input projection may be a key ingredient to extend mean resolvent analysis to more complex statistically steady flows.</description>
