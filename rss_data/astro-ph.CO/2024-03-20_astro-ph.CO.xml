      <title>Compatibility of JWST results with exotic halos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13068v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is unveiling astounding results about the first few hundred million years of life of the Universe, delivering images of galaxies at very high redshifts. Here, we develop a UV luminosity function model for high-redshift galaxies, considering parameters such as the stellar formation rate, dust extinction, and halo mass function. Calibration of this luminosity function model using UV luminosity data at redshifts z = 4-7 yields optimal parameter values. Testing the model against data at higher redshifts reveals successful accommodation of the data at z = 8-9, but challenges emerge at z~13. Our findings suggest a negligible role of dust extinction at the highest redshifts, prompting a modification of the stellar formation rate to incorporate a larger fraction of luminous objects per massive halo, consistently with similar recent studies. This effect could be attributed to mundane explanations such as unknown evolution of standard astrophysics at high redshift or to the existence of exotic objects at high redshift. We comment on this latter possibility.</description>

      <title>Cosmic microwave background constraints on extended dark matter objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13072v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Primordially formed extended dark objects would accrete baryonic matter and impact the ionisation history of the Universe. Insisting on consistency with the anisotropies of the cosmic microwave background, we derive constraints on the dark matter fraction for various classes of objects, of different sizes. We introduce a novel scaling technique to speed up numerical calculations and release our calculation framework in the form of a Mathematica notebook. Conservatively, we focus on spherical accretion and collisional ionisation. We find strong constraints limiting the dark matter fraction to subpercent level for objects of up to $10^4$ AU in size.</description>

      <title>Phenomenology of Horndeski Gravity under Positivity Bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A set of conditions that any effective field theory needs to satisfy in order to allow for the existence of a viable UV completion has recently gained attention in the cosmological context under the name of $\textit{positivity bounds}$. In this paper we revisit the derivation of such bounds for Horndeski gravity and translate them into a complete set of viability conditions in the language of effective field theory of dark energy. We implement the latter into $\texttt{EFTCAMB}$ and explore the large scale structure phenomenology of Horndeski gravity under positivity bounds. We build a statistically significant sample of viable Horndeski models, and derive the corresponding predictions for the background evolution, in terms of $w_{\rm DE}$, and the dynamics of linear perturbations, in terms of the phenomenological functions $\mu$ and $\Sigma$, associated to clustering and weak lensing, respectively. We find that the addition of positivity bounds to the traditional no-ghost and no-gradient conditions considerably tightens the theoretical constraints on all these functions. The most significant feature is a strengthening of the correlation $\mu\simeq\Sigma$, and a related tight constraint on the luminal speed of gravitational waves $c^2_T\simeq1$. In anticipation of a more complete formulation of positivity conditions in cosmology, this work demonstrates the strong potential of such bounds in shaping the viable parameter space of scalar-tensor theories.</description>

      <title>Primordial extreme mass-ratio inspirals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13278v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The coalescence of stellar-mass primordial black holes (PBHs) might explain some of the gravitation waves (GWs) events detected by LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA. On the other hand, observational hints for supermassive PBHs (SMPBHs) have been accumulated. Thus it can be expected that stellar-mass PBHs might be gravitationally bounded to SMPBHs ($\sim10^{6}-10^9M_\odot$) in the early Universe, and both constituted primordial extreme mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs). In this work, we initiate the study of the merger rate for primordial EMRIs. The corresponding intrinsic EMRI rate at low redshift may be comparable to that of astrophysical model, $10-10^4$yr$^{-1}$, which the space-based detector LISA has the capability to detect, but significantly raises with redshift. Though equal mass binaries also inevitably form, we find that under certain conditions the primordial EMRIs can be the most prevalent GW sources, and thus potentially a new probe to PBH.</description>

      <title>Constraint on magnetized galactic outflows from LOFAR rotation measure data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13418v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Outflows from galaxies, driven by active galactic nuclei and star formation activity, spread magnetic fields into the intergalactic medium. Importance of this process can be assessed using cosmological magneto-hydrodynamic numerical modelling of the baryonic feedback on the Large Scale Structure, like that of Illustris-TNG simulations. We use the Faraday Rotation Measure data of LOFAR Two-Meter Sky Survey (LOTSS) to test the Illustris-TNG baryonic feedback model. We show that the Illustris-TNG over-predicts the root-mean-square of the residual Rotation Measure in LOTSS. This suggests that the "pollution" of the intergalactic medium by the magnetized outflows from galaxies is less important than the estimate from the Illustris-TNG. This fact provides a support to the hypothesis that the volume-filling large scale magnetic fields found in the voids of the Large Scale Structure are likely of cosmological origin.</description>

      <title>Primordial Black Holes from Effective Field Theory of Stochastic Single Field Inflation at NNNLO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13484v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a study of the Effective Field Theory (EFT) generalization of stochastic inflation in a model-independent single-field framework and its impact on primordial black hole (PBH) formation. We show how the Langevin equations for the "soft" modes in quasi de Sitter background is described by the Infra-Red (IR) contributions of scalar perturbations, and the subsequent Fokker-Planck equation driving the probability distribution for the stochastic duration ${\cal N}$, significantly modify in the present EFT picture. An explicit perturbative analysis of the distribution function by implementing the stochastic-$\delta N$ formalism is performed up to the next-to-next-to-next-to-leading order (NNNLO) for both the classical-drift and quantum-diffusion dominated regimes. In the drift-dominated limit, we perturbatively analyse the local non-Gaussianity parameters $(f_{\rm NL}, g_{\rm NL}, \tau_{\rm NL})$ with the EFT-induced modifications. In the diffusion-dominated limit, we numerically compute the probability distribution featuring exponential tails at each order of perturbative treatment.</description>

      <title>Accurate Power Spectrum Estimation toward Nyquist limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13561v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The power spectrum, as a statistic in Fourier space, is commonly numerically calculated using the fast Fourier transform method to efficiently reduce the computational costs. To alleviate the systematic bias known as aliasing due to the insufficient sampling, the interlacing technique was proposed. We derive the analytical form of the shot noise under the interlacing technique, which enables the exact separation of the Poisson shot noise from the signal in this case. Thanks to the accurate shot noise subtraction, we demonstrate an enhancement in the accuracy of power spectrum estimation, and compare with the other widely used estimators in community. The good performance of our estimation allows an abatement in the computational cost by using low resolution and low order mass assignment scheme in the analysis for huge surveys and mocks.</description>

      <title>A novel PBH production mechanism from non-Abelian gauge fields during inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the case of axion-like particles (ALPs) during inflation. When coupled to a non-Abelian gauge sector via a Chern-Simons term, ALPs support an intriguing, testable, phenomenology with very distinctive features including chiral primordial gravitational waves. For sufficiently small values of the gauge vev and coupling, scalar perturbations in the gauge sector exhibit a known instability. We harness the power of such instability for primordial black hole (PBH) generation. In the case of an axion-inflaton, one is dynamically driven into a strong-backreaction regime that crosses the instability band thereby sourcing a peaked scalar spectrum leading to PBH production and the related scalar-induced gravitational waves. Remarkably, this dynamics is largely insensitive to the initial conditions and the shape of the potential, highlighting the universal nature of the sourcing mechanism. In the case of spectator ALPs one can identify the parameter space that sets off the strong backreaction regime and the ensuing features. We show that spectator ALP models may also access the scalar instability region without triggering strong backreaction.</description>

      <title>New measurements of $E_G$: Testing General Relativity with the Weyl potential and galaxy velocities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13709v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We combine measurements of galaxy velocities from galaxy surveys with measurements of the Weyl potential from the Dark Energy Survey to test the consistency of General Relativity at cosmological scales. Taking the ratio of two model-independent observables - the growth rate of structure and the Weyl potential - we obtain new measurements of the $E_G$ statistic with precision of $5.8-10.7\%$ at four different redshifts. These measurements provide a considerable improvement to past measurements of $E_G$. They confirm the validity of General Relativity at three redshifts, while displaying a tension of $2.5\sigma$ at $z=0.47$ as a consequence of the tension found in the measurements of the Weyl potential. Contrary to conventional methods that rely on a common galaxy sample with spectroscopic resolution to measure two types of correlations, we directly combine two observables that are independent of the galaxy bias. This provides a novel approach to testing the relation between the geometry of our Universe and the motion of galaxies with improved precision.</description>

      <title>Sensitivity of Bayesian 21 cm power spectrum estimation to foreground model errors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13767v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Power spectrum estimators are an important tool in efforts to detect the 21 cm brightness temperature fluctuations from neutral hydrogen at early times. An initial detection will likely be statistical in nature, meaning that it will not be possible to make a coherent map of the brightness temperature fluctuations; instead, only their variance will be measured against a background of noise and residual systematic effects. Optimal Quadratic Estimator (OQE)-based methods often apply an inverse covariance weighting to the data. However, inaccurate covariance modelling can lead to reduced sensitivity and, in some cases, severe signal loss. We recently proposed a Bayesian method to jointly estimate the 21 cm fluctuations, their power spectrum, and foreground emission. Instead of requiring a fixed a priori estimate of the covariance, we estimate the covariance as part of the inference. Choices of parametrization, particularly of the foregrounds, are subject to model errors and could lead to biases and other ill effects if not properly controlled. In this paper, we investigate the effects of inaccurate foreground models on 21 cm power spectrum recovery. Using simulated visibilities, we find that, even in the most extreme scenarios tested, our approach is capable of recovering 21 cm delay power spectrum estimates consistent with a known input signal for delays $\gtrsim300$ ns ($\sim$88\% of the available Fourier modes). This is true even when using foreground models derived from modified foreground catalogs containing spatial and spectral perturbations at the quoted level of uncertainty on our foreground catalogs.</description>

      <title>Disentangling the anisotropic radio sky: Fisher forecasts for 21cm arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13768v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The existence of a radio synchrotron background (RSB) is implied by a number of measurements, including excess emission seen by the ARCADE2 and LWA experiments. Highly sensitive wideband radio arrays, of the kind used to measure the cosmic 21-cm signal, provide a promising way to further constrain the RSB through its anisotropy, providing additional insight into its origin. We present a framework for evaluating the potential of 21-cm arrays to disentangle different components of the diffuse radio sky based on the combination of their frequency spectrum and angular power spectrum (APS). The formalism is designed to calculate uncertainties due to the intrinsic cosmic variance alone or together with instrumental noise. In particular, we predict the potential for measuring the anisotropy of a broad generalised class of excess radio background models using the low-frequency HERA array as an example. We find that a HERA-like array can distinguish an RSB from other sky components based on its angular clustering and spectral dependence, even if these are quite similar to one or more of the other components -- but only in the case that the RSB is relatively bright.</description>

      <title>Cosmic shear with small scales: DES-Y3, KiDS-1000 and HSC-DR1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13794v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a cosmological analysis of the combination of the DES-Y3, KiDS-1000 and HSC-DR1 weak lensing samples under a joint harmonic-space pipeline making use of angular scales down to $\ell_{\rm max}=4500$, corresponding to significantly smaller scales ($\delta\theta\sim2.4'$) than those commonly used in cosmological weak lensing studies. We are able to do so by accurately modelling non-linearities and the impact of baryonic effects using Baccoemu. We find $S_8\equiv\sigma_8\sqrt{\Omega_{\rm m}/0.3}=0.795^{+0.015}_{-0.017}$, in relatively good agreement with CMB constraints from Planck (less than $\sim1.8\sigma$ tension), although we obtain a low value of $\Omega_{\rm m}=0.212^{+0.017}_{-0.032}$, in tension with Planck at the $\sim3\sigma$ level. We show that this can be recast as an $H_0$ tension if one parametrises the amplitude of fluctuations and matter abundance in terms of variables without hidden dependence on $H_0$. Furthermore, we find that this tension reduces significantly after including a prior on the distance-redshift relationship from BAO data, without worsening the fit. In terms of baryonic effects, we show that failing to model and marginalise over them on scales $\ell\lesssim2000$ does not significantly affect the posterior constraints for DES-Y3 and KiDS-1000, but has a mild effect on deeper samples, such as HSC-DR1. This is in agreement with our ability to only mildly constrain the parameters of the Baryon Correction Model with these data</description>

      <title>A cosmological sandwiched window for lepton-number breaking scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.13492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.13492v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A singlet majoron can arise from the seesaw framework as a pseudo-Goldstone boson when the heavy Majorana neutrinos acquire masses via the spontaneous breaking of global ${\rm U}(1)_L$ symmetry. The resulting cosmological impacts are usually derived from the effective majoron-neutrino interaction, and the majoron abundance is accumulated through the freeze-in neutrino coalescence. However, a primordial majoron abundance can be predicted in a minimal setup and lead to distinctive cosmological effects. In this work, we consider such a primordial majoron abundance from relativistic freeze-out and calculate the modification to the effective neutrino number $N_{\rm eff}$. We demonstrate that the measurements of $N_{\rm eff}$ will constrain the parameter space from a primordial majoron abundance in an opposite direction to that from neutrino coalescence. When the contributions from both the primordial abundance and the freeze-in production coexist, the ${\rm U}(1)_L$-breaking scale (seesaw scale) $f$ will be pushed into a ''sandwiched window''. Remarkably, for majoron masses below 1 MeV and above the eV scale, the future CMB-S4 experiment will completely close such a low-scale seesaw window for $f\in [1,10^5]~{\rm GeV}$. We highlight that any new light particle with a primordial abundance that couples to SM particles may lead to a similar sandwiched window, and such a general phenomenon deserves careful investigation.</description>

      <title>Calculating quasinormal modes of extremal and non-extremal Reissner-Nordstr\"om black holes with the continued fraction method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13074v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use the numerical continued fraction method to investigate quasinormal mode spectra of extremal and non-extremal Reissner-Nordstr\"om black holes in the low and intermediate damping regions. In the extremal case, we develop techniques that significantly expand the calculated spectrum from what had previously appeared in the literature. This allows us to determine the asymptotic behavior of the extremal spectrum in the high damping limit, where there are conflicting published results. Our investigation further supports the idea that the extremal limit of the non-extremal case, where the charge approaches the mass of the black hole in natural units, leads to the same vibrational spectrum as in the extremal case despite the qualitative differences in their topology. In addition, we numerically explore the quasinormal mode spectrum for a Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole in the small charge limit.</description>

      <title>Galaxy Triplets Alignment in Large-scale Filaments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13273v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Leveraging the datasets of galaxy triplets and large-scale filaments obtained from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, we scrutinize the alignment of the three sides of the triangles formed by galaxy triplets and the normal vectors of the triplet planes within observed large-scale filaments. Our statistical investigation reveals that the longest and median sides of the galaxy triplets exhibit a robust alignment with the spines of their host large-scale filaments, while the shortest sides show no or only weak alignment with the filaments. Additionally, the normal vectors of triplets tend to be perpendicular to the filaments. The alignment signal diminishes rapidly with the increasing distance from the triplet to the filament spine, and is primarily significant for triplets located within distances shorter than $0.2$~Mpc$/h$, with a confidence level exceeding $20\sigma$. Moreover, in comparison to compact galaxy triplets, the alignment signal is more conspicuous among the loose triplets. This alignment analysis contributes to the formulation of a framework depicting the clustering and relaxation of galaxies within cosmological large-scale filament regimes, providing deeper insights into the intricate interactions between galaxies and their pivotal role in shaping galaxy groups.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13285v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the discovery of a unique Lyman-continuum (LyC) emitter at z=3.088. The LyC emission were detected using the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) WFC3/UVIS F336W filter, covering a rest-frame wavelength range of 760-900 Angstrom. The peak signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of LyC emission is 3.9 in a r=0.24'' aperture and is spatially offset by 0.29''+/-0.04'' (~ 2.2+/-0.3 kpc) from the rest-UV emission peak (F606W). By combining imaging and spectroscopic data from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) JADES, FRESCO and JEMS surveys, along with VLT/MUSE data from the MXDF survey, we estimate that the probability of random alignment with an interloper galaxy causing the LyC emission is less than 6x10^-5. The interstellar medium (ISM) conditions in the galaxy are similar to other LyC emitters at high redshift (12+log(O/H)=7.79+/-0.06, logU =-3.27+/-0.14, O32 = 3.65+/-0.22), although the single-peaked Lyman-alpha profile and lack of rest-UV emission lines suggest an optically thick ISM. We think that LyC photons are leaking through a narrow cone of optically thin neutral ISM, most likely created by a past merger (as evidenced by medium-band F210M and F182M images). Using the escape fraction constraints from individual leakers and a simple model, we estimate that the opening half-angle of ionization cones can be as low as 16^deg (2% ionised fraction) to reproduce some of the theoretical constraints on the average escape fraction for galaxies. The narrow opening angle required can explain the low number density of confirmed LyC leakers.</description>

      <title>Improved modelling for dark photon detection with dish antennas</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13448v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A vector dark matter candidate, also known as dark photon, would induce an oscillating electric field through kinetic mixing. One detection strategy uses a spherical reflector to focus the induced emission at its center of curvature. On one hand, we investigate the effects of diffraction in this type of experiment from an analytical standpoint, making use of the Kirchhoff integral theorem in the low-curvature dish limit. On the other hand, we estimate the impact of mode-matching, in the case of detection by a pyramidal horn antenna. We show that the expected signal intensity can be significantly reduced compared to usual estimates. Our method is applied to the re-interpretation of the SHUKET experiment data, the results of which are shown to be degraded by a factor of $\sim$~50 due to both diffraction and mode-matching. The analytical method allows optimizing some experimental parameters to gain sensitivity in future runs. Our results can be applied to any dish antenna experiment using a low curvature reflector.</description>

      <title>Non-fluid like Boltzmann code architecture for early times f(T) cosmologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13708v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There have been several works that have studied scalar cosmological perturbations in $f(T)$ teleparallel gravity theories to understand early cosmic times dynamics. In this direction, the perturbations presented have been performed by considering $f(T)$ extensions as an effective fluid-like scheme, where the equation-of-state contains extra terms due to the torsion. In this work, we discuss introducing a non-fluid-like approach as a direct consequence of $f(T)$ extensions, particularly for $f(T)$ power law model scenarios. This approach will be compared using CMB constraints data from Planck 2018 and SDSS catalogs, showing a change in about 17% in $C_{l}$ at $l&lt; 10^{1}$ from the ones reported in the literature as a fluid-like approach, which will bring significant changes in the analysis on cosmological tensions at early cosmic times.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13753v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this thesis, we aim to investigate the mechanisms underlying the genesis of magnetic fields in the Universe and explore their potential in addressing the matter-antimatter asymmetry. We construct consistent models that generate the helical magnetic field consistent with observations. We also develop an effective field theory approach to magnetogenesis, where the choice of EFT parameters describes the magnetogenesis scenario in the early Universe, and different choices of parameters correspond to different models. Our EFT explicitly shows that generating primordial magnetic fields requires two necessary conditions: conformal invariance breaking and causal propagation. Furthermore, we establish that the presence of a strong magnetic field near compact objects, such as neutron stars, aids in understanding the phenomenon of Fast radio bursts through the conversion of gravitational waves to electromagnetic waves in the background of a strong transverse magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Statistical estimation of full-sky radio maps from 21cm array visibility data using Gaussian Constrained Realisations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13766v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An important application of next-generation wide-field radio interferometers is making high dynamic range maps of radio emission. Traditional deconvolution methods like CLEAN can give poor recovery of diffuse structure, prompting the development of wide-field alternatives like Direct Optimal Mapping and $m$-mode analysis. In this paper, we propose an alternative Bayesian method to infer the coefficients of a full-sky spherical harmonic basis for a drift-scan telescope with potentially thousands of baselines. The can precisely encode the uncertainties and correlations between the parameters used to build the recovered image. We use Gaussian Constrained Realisations (GCR) to efficiently draw samples of the spherical harmonic coefficients, despite the very large parameter space and extensive sky-regions of missing data. Each GCR solution provides a complete, statistically-consistent gap-free realisation of a full-sky map conditioned on the available data, even when the interferometer's field of view is small. Many realisations can be generated and used for further analysis and robust propagation of statistical uncertainties. In this paper, we present the mathematical formalism of the spherical harmonic GCR-method for radio interferometers. We focus on the recovery of diffuse emission as a use case, along with validation of the method against simulations with a known diffuse emission component.</description>

      <title>Towards Precision Cosmology With Improved PNLF Distances Using VLT-MUSE II. A Test Sample from Archival Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.11603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.11603v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Thanks to the MUSE integral field spectrograph on the VLT, extragalactic distance measurements with the [O III] 5007 A planetary nebula luminosity function (PNLF) are now possible out to approx. 40 Mpc. Here we analyze the VLT/MUSE data for 20 galaxies from the ESO public archive to identify the systems' planetary nebulae (PNe) and determine their PNLF distances. Three of the galaxies do not contain enough PNe for a robust measure of the PNLF, and the results for one other system are compromised by the galaxy's internal extinction. However, we obtain robust PNLF distances for the remaining 16 galaxies, two of which are isolated and beyond 30 Mpc in a relatively unperturbed Hubble flow. From these data, we derive a Hubble Constant of 74.2 +/- 7.2 (stat) +/-3.7 (sys) km/s/Mpc, a value that is very similar to that found from other quality indicators (e.g., Cepheids, the tip of the red giant branch, and surface brightness fluctuations). At present, the uncertainty is dominated by the small number of suitable galaxies in the ESO archival and their less than ideal observing conditions and calibrations. Based on our experience with these systems, we identify the observational requirements necessary for the PNLF to yield a competitive value for H0 that is independent of the SN Ia distance scale, and help resolve the current tension in the Hubble constant.</description>

      <title>Revisiting kink-like parametrization and constraints using OHD/Pantheon+/BAO samples</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.06464v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We reexamine the kink-like parameterization of the deceleration parameter to derive constraints on the transition redshift from cosmic deceleration to acceleration. This is achieved using observational Hubble data, Type Ia Supernovae Pantheon+ samples and Baryon acoustic oscillations. In this parametrization, the value of the initial $q$ parameter is $q_{i}$, the final value is $q_f$, the present value is denoted by $q_{0}$, and the transition duration is given by $\alpha$. We perform our calculations using the Monte Carlo Markov Chain method, utilizing the emcee package. Under the assumption of a flat geometry, we constrain the range of possible values for three scenarios: when $q_{f}$ is unrestricted, when $q_{f}$ is equal to $-1$, and when $\alpha$ is $1/3$. This is done assuming that $q_{i}=1/2$. Here, we achieve that the $SN$ data fixes the free parameters tightly as in the flat $\Lambda$CDM for unrestricted $q_{f}$. In addition, if we fix $q_{f}=-1$, the model behaves well as the $\Lambda$CDM for the combined dataset. We also acquire the current value of the deceleration parameter, which is consistent with the latest results that assume the $\Lambda$CDM model. Furthermore, we observe a deviation from the standard $\Lambda$CDM model in the current model based on the evolution of $j(z)$, and it is evident that the universe transitions from deceleration to acceleration and will eventually reach the $\Lambda$CDM model in the near future.</description>

      <title>candl: Cosmic Microwave Background Analysis with a Differentiable Likelihood</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.13433v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present candl, an automatically differentiable python likelihood for analysing cosmic microwave background (CMB) power spectrum measurements. candl is powered by JAX, which makes it fast and easy to calculate derivatives of the likelihood. This facilitates, for example, robust Fisher matrices without finite-difference methods. We show the benefits of candl through a series of example calculations, covering forecasting, robustness tests, and gradient-based Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling. These also include optimising the band power bin width to minimise parameter errors of a realistic mock data set. Moreover, we calculate the correlation of parameter constraints from correlated and partially overlapping subsets of the SPT-3G 2018 $TT/TE/EE$ data release. In a traditional analysis framework, these tasks are slow and require careful fine-tuning to obtain stable results. As such, a fully differentiable pipeline allows for a higher level of scrutiny; we argue that this is the paradigm shift required to leverage incoming data from ground-based experiments, which will significantly improve the cosmological parameter constraints from the Planck mission. candl comes with the latest primary and lensing power spectrum data from the South Pole Telescope and Atacama Cosmology Telescope collaborations and will be used as part of the upcoming SPT-3G $TT/TE/EE$ and $\phi\phi$ data releases. Along with the core code, we release a series of auxiliary tools, which simplify common analysis tasks and interface the likelihood with other cosmological software. candl is pip-installable and publicly available at https://github.com/Lbalkenhol/candl .</description>

      <title>Beyond (and back to) Palatini quadratic gravity and inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.11869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.11869v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study single-field slow-roll inflation embedded in Palatini $F(R)$ gravity where $F(R)$ grows faster than $R^2$. Surprisingly, the consistency of the theory requires the Jordan frame inflaton potential to be unbounded from below. Even more surprisingly, this corresponds to an Einstein frame inflaton potential bounded from below and positive definite. We prove that for all such Palatini $F(R)$'s, there exists a universal strong coupling limit corresponding to a quadratic $F(R)$ with the wrong sign for the linear term and a cosmological constant in the Jordan frame. In such a limit, the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ does not depend on the original inflaton potential, while the scalar spectral index $n_s$ does. Unfortunately, the system is ill-defined out of the slow-roll regime. A possible way out is to upgrade to a $F(R,X)$ model, with $X$ the Jordan frame inflaton kinetic term. Such a modification essentially leaves the inflationary predictions unaffected.</description>

      <title>f(R) Gravity in an Ellipsoidal Universe</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.02914v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a new model of cosmology based on an anisotropic background and a specific $f(R)$ theory of gravity. It is shown that field equations of $f(R)$ gravity in a Bianchi type I background give rise to a modified Friedmann equation. This model contains two important parameters: $\gamma$ and $\delta$. We, thus, simply call our model $\gamma\delta$CDM. It is distinguished in two important aspects from the $\Lambda$CDM model: firstly, the contribution of different energy densities to the Hubble parameter are weighted with different weights, and then, dependence of energy densities to redshift is modified as well. This unorthodox relation of energy content to Hubble parameter brings forth a new way of interpreting the cosmological history. This solution does not allow the existence of a cosmological constant component, however, a dark energy contribution with dependence on redshift is possible. We tested observational relevance of the new solution by best fitting to different data sets. We found that our model could accommodate the idea of cosmological coupling of black holes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.04090v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the enhancement of the power spectra in models with multiple scalar fields large enough to produce primordial black holes. We present analytic solutions for the perturbations in the case of constant turns without the need for an effective field theory for the first time and clarify the role of the Hubble friction that has been overlooked previously. For an arbitrary number of fields we derive the criteria that can lead to an exponential amplification of the curvature perturbation on subhorizon scales, while leaving the perturbations stable on superhorizon scales. Finally, we apply our results on a three-field generalization of the "ultra-light" scenario and show how the presence of field-space torsion can yield distinct observables compared to the two-field case.</description>

      <title>An analytic description of substructure-induced gravitational perturbations in stellar systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.13338v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Perturbations to stellar systems can reflect the gravitational influence of dark matter substructures. On scales much smaller than the size of a stellar system, we point out analytic connections between the stellar and dark matter distributions. In particular, the density and velocity power spectra of the stars are proportional to the density power spectrum of the perturbing dark matter, scaled by $k^{-4}$. This relationship allows easy evaluation of the suitability of a stellar system for detecting dark substructure. As examples, we show that the Galactic stellar halo is expected to be sensitive to cold dark matter substructure at wavenumbers $k\lesssim 0.3$ kpc$^{-1}$, and the Galactic disk might be sensitive to substructure at wavenumbers $k\sim 4$ kpc$^{-1}$. The perturbations considered in this work are short-lived, being rapidly erased by the stellar velocity dispersion, so it may be possible to attribute a detection to dark matter substructure without ambiguity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11301v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In view to scrutinize the idea that nonlocal modifications of General Relativity could dynamically address the dark energy problem, we investigate the evolution of the Universe at infrared scales as an Infinite Derivative Gravity model of the Ricci scalar, without introducing the cosmological constant $\Lambda$ or any scalar field. The accelerated expansion of the late Universe is shown to be compatible with the emergence of nonlocal gravitational effects at sufficiently low energies. A technique for circumventing the mathematical complexity of the nonlocal cosmological equations is developed and, after drawing a connection with the Starobinsky gravity, verifiable predictions are considered, like a possible decreasing in the strength of the effective gravitational constant. In conclusion, the emergence of nonlocal gravity corrections at given scales could be an efficient mechanism to address the dark energy problem.</description>
