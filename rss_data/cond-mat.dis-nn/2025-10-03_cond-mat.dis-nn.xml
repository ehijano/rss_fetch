      <title>Combining complex Langevin dynamics with score-based and energy-based diffusion models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01328v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Theories with a sign problem due to a complex action or Boltzmann weight can sometimes be numerically solved using a stochastic process in the complexified configuration space. However, the probability distribution effectively sampled by this complex Langevin process is not known a priori and notoriously hard to understand. In generative AI, diffusion models can learn distributions, or their log derivatives, from data. We explore the ability of diffusion models to learn the distributions sampled by a complex Langevin process, comparing score-based and energy-based diffusion models, and speculate about possible applications.</description>

      <title>Quantum-inspired Benchmark for Estimating Intrinsic Dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01335v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning models can generalize well on real-world datasets. According to the manifold hypothesis, this is possible because datasets lie on a latent manifold with small intrinsic dimension (ID). There exist many methods for ID estimation (IDE), but their estimates vary substantially. This warrants benchmarking IDE methods on manifolds that are more complex than those in existing benchmarks. We propose a Quantum-Inspired Intrinsic-dimension Estimation (QuIIEst) benchmark consisting of infinite families of topologically non-trivial manifolds with known ID. Our benchmark stems from a quantum-optical method of embedding arbitrary homogeneous spaces while allowing for curvature modification and additive noise. The IDE methods tested were generally less accurate on QuIIEst manifolds than on existing benchmarks under identical resource allocation. We also observe minimal performance degradation with increasingly non-uniform curvature, underscoring the benchmark's inherent difficulty. As a result of independent interest, we perform IDE on the fractal Hofstadter's butterfly and identify which methods are capable of extracting the effective dimension of a space that is not a manifold.</description>

      <title>Quantum Signatures of Strange Attractors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01416v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In classical mechanics, driven systems with dissipation often exhibit complex, fractal dynamics known as strange attractors. This paper addresses the fundamental question of how such structures manifest in the quantum realm. We investigate the quantum Duffing oscillator, a paradigmatic chaotic system, using the Caldirola-Kanai (CK) framework, where dissipation is integrated directly into a time-dependent Hamiltonian. By employing the Husimi distribution to represent the quantum state in phase space, we present the first visualization of a quantum strange attractor within this model. Our simulations demonstrate how an initially simple Gaussian wave packet is stretched, folded, and sculpted by the interplay of chaotic dynamics and energy loss, causing it to localize onto a structure that beautifully mirrors the classical attractor. This quantum "photograph" is inherently smoothed, blurring the infinitely fine fractal details of its classical counterpart as a direct consequence of the uncertainty principle. We supplement this analysis by examining the out-of-time-ordered correlator (OTOC), which shows that stronger dissipation clarifies the exponential growth associated with the classical Lyapunov exponent, thereby confirming the model's semiclassical behavior. This work offers a compelling geometric perspective on open chaotic quantum systems and sheds new light on the quantum-classical transition.</description>

      <title>Precise Dynamics of Diagonal Linear Networks: A Unifying Analysis by Dynamical Mean-Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01930v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diagonal linear networks (DLNs) are a tractable model that captures several nontrivial behaviors in neural network training, such as initialization-dependent solutions and incremental learning. These phenomena are typically studied in isolation, leaving the overall dynamics insufficiently understood. In this work, we present a unified analysis of various phenomena in the gradient flow dynamics of DLNs. Using Dynamical Mean-Field Theory (DMFT), we derive a low-dimensional effective process that captures the asymptotic gradient flow dynamics in high dimensions. Analyzing this effective process yields new insights into DLN dynamics, including loss convergence rates and their trade-off with generalization, and systematically reproduces many of the previously observed phenomena. These findings deepen our understanding of DLNs and demonstrate the effectiveness of the DMFT approach in analyzing high-dimensional learning dynamics of neural networks.</description>

      <title>Effective-medium theory for elastic systems with correlated disorder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02090v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Correlated structures are intimately connected to intriguing phenomena exhibited by a variety of disordered systems such as soft colloidal gels, bio-polymer networks and colloidal suspensions near a shear jamming transition. The universal critical behavior of these systems near the onset of rigidity is often described by traditional approaches as the coherent potential approximation - a versatile version of effective-medium theory that nevertheless have hitherto lacked key ingredients to describe disorder spatial correlations. Here we propose a multi-purpose generalization of the coherent potential approximation to describe the mechanical behavior of elastic networks with spatially-correlated disorder. We apply our theory to a simple rigidity-percolation model for colloidal gels and study the effects of correlations in both the critical point and the overall scaling behavior. We find that although the presence of spatial correlations (mimicking attractive interactions of gels) shifts the critical packing fraction to lower values, suggesting sub-isostatic behavior, the critical coordination number of the associated network remains isostatic. More importantly, we discuss how our theory can be employed to describe a large variety of systems with spatially-correlated disorder.</description>

      <title>Emergent multi-loop nested point gap in a non-Hermitian quasiperiodic lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04469v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a geometric series modulated non-Hermitian quasiperiodic lattice model, and explore its localization and topological properties. The results show that with the ever-increasing summation terms of the geometric series, multiple mobility edges and non-Hermitian point gaps with high winding number can be induced in the system. The point gap spectrum of the system has a multi-loop nested structure in the complex plane, resulting in a high winding number. In addition, we analyze the limit case of summation of infinite terms. The results show that the mobility edges merge together as only one mobility edge when summation terms are pushed to the limit. Meanwhile, the corresponding point gaps are merged into a ring with winding number equal to one. Through Avila's global theory, we give an analytical expression for mobility edges in the limit of infinite summation, reconfirming that mobility edges and point gaps do merge and will result in a winding number that is indeed equal to one.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic theory of in-context learning by linear attention</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.11751v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Transformers have a remarkable ability to learn and execute tasks based on examples provided within the input itself, without explicit prior training. It has been argued that this capability, known as in-context learning (ICL), is a cornerstone of Transformers' success, yet questions about the necessary sample complexity, pretraining task diversity, and context length for successful ICL remain unresolved. Here, we provide a precise answer to these questions in an exactly solvable model of ICL of a linear regression task by linear attention. We derive sharp asymptotics for the learning curve in a phenomenologically-rich scaling regime where the token dimension is taken to infinity; the context length and pretraining task diversity scale proportionally with the token dimension; and the number of pretraining examples scales quadratically. We demonstrate a double-descent learning curve with increasing pretraining examples, and uncover a phase transition in the model's behavior between low and high task diversity regimes: In the low diversity regime, the model tends toward memorization of training tasks, whereas in the high diversity regime, it achieves genuine in-context learning and generalization beyond the scope of pretrained tasks. These theoretical insights are empirically validated through experiments with both linear attention and full nonlinear Transformer architectures.</description>

      <title>Dynamically generated concatenated codes and their phase diagrams</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.13801v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We formulate code concatenation as the action of a unitary quantum circuit on an expanding tree geometry and find that for certain classes of gates, applied identically at each node, a binary tree circuit encodes a single logical qubit with code distance that grows exponentially in the depth of the tree. When there is noise in the bulk or at the end of this encoding circuit, the system undergoes a phase transition between a coding phase, where an optimal decoder can successfully recover logical information, and a non-coding phase. Leveraging the tree structure, we combine the formalism of "tensor enumerators" from quantum coding theory with standard recursive techniques for classical spin models on the Bethe lattice to explore these phases. In the presence of bulk errors, the coding phase is a type of spin glass, characterized by a distribution of failure probabilities. When the errors are heralded, the recursion relation is exactly solvable, giving us an analytic handle on the phase diagram.</description>

      <title>State-space kinetic Ising model reveals task-dependent entropy flow in sparsely active nonequilibrium neuronal dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15440v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neuronal ensemble activity, including coordinated and oscillatory patterns, exhibits hallmarks of nonequilibrium systems with time-asymmetric trajectories to maintain their organization. However, assessing time asymmetry from neuronal spiking activity remains challenging. The kinetic Ising model provides a framework for studying the causal, nonequilibrium dynamics in spiking recurrent neural networks. Recent theoretical advances in this model have enabled time-asymmetry estimation from large-scale steady-state data. Yet, neuronal activity often exhibits time-varying firing rates and coupling strengths, violating the steady-state assumption. To overcome these limitations, we developed a state-space kinetic Ising model that accounts for non-stationary and nonequilibrium properties of neural systems. This approach incorporates a mean-field method for estimating time-varying entropy flow, a key measure for maintaining the system's organization by dissipation. Applying this method to mouse visual cortex data revealed greater variability in causal couplings during task engagement despite the reduced neuronal activity with increased sparsity. Moreover, higher-performing mice exhibited increased coupling-related entropy flow per spike during task engagement, suggesting economical computation in the higher-performing mice. These findings underscore the model's utility in uncovering intricate asymmetric causal dynamics in neuronal ensembles and linking them to behavior through the thermodynamic underpinnings of neural computation.</description>

      <title>Emergent scattering regimes in disordered metasurfaces near critical packing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02244v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Disordered metasurfaces provide a versatile platform for harnessing near- and far-field scattered light. Most research has focused on either particulate topologies composed of individual, well-identified metaatoms or, to a lesser extent, semi-continuous aggregate topologies without well identified inclusions. Here, we uncover an intermediate critical packing regime characterized by metasurface morphologies in which a significant fraction of metaatoms begin to connect. We experimentally demonstrate that, at this threshold, the properties of the scattered light abruptly change and, via a statistical quasinormal mode analysis, interpret this change as a marked transition in the statistics of the photon density of states. Unlike percolation in semicontinuous metal films, this transition affects not only the specular but also the diffuse components of the scattered light in a profound way. Our results introduce critical packing topologies as a novel design strategy for manipulating the spectral and angular characteristics of light using ultrathin optical coatings. Emergent functionalities include colour shifts in diffuse light driven by multiple scattering and surface whitening, with potential applications in display technologies, for example, to reduce glare in electronic screens.</description>

      <title>Beyond Fragmented Dopant Dynamics in Quantum Spin Lattices: Robust Localization and non-Gaussian Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16042v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The motion of dopants in magnetic spin lattices has received tremendous attention for at least four decades due to its connection to high-temperature superconductivity. Despite these efforts, we lack a complete understanding of their behavior, especially out-of-equilibrium and at nonzero temperatures. In this Article, we take a significant step towards a much deeper understanding based on state-of-the-art matrix-product-state calculations. In particular, we investigate the non-equilibrium dynamics of a dopant in two-leg $t$-$J$ ladders with antiferromagnetic XXZ spin interactions. In the Ising limit, we find that the dopant is \emph{localized} for all investigated \emph{nonzero} temperatures due to an emergent disordered potential, with a localization length controlled by the underlying correlation length of the spin lattice, which increases exponentially with decreasing temperature. The dopant, hereby, only delocalizes asymptotically in the zero temperature limit. This greatly generalizes the localization effect discovered recently in Hilbert space fragmented models. In the presence of spin-exchange processes at rate $\alpha$, the dopant diffuses with a diffusion coefficient, $D_h$, depending non-monotonically on $\alpha$. It initially increases linearly as $D_h \propto \alpha$ for $\alpha \ll 1$ before dropping off as $\alpha^{-1}$ for $\alpha &gt; 1$. Moreover, we show that the underlying spin dynamics at infinite temperature behaves qualitatively the same, albeit with important quantitative differences. We substantiate these findings by showing that the dynamics features self-similar scaling behavior, which strongly deviates from the Gaussian behavior of regular diffusion, especially for weak spin exchange. Finally, we show that the diffusion coefficient $D_h$ follows an Arrhenius relation at high temperatures, whereby it is exponentially suppressed upon cooling.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.23689v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that global properties of an unknown quantum network, such as the average degree, hub density, and the number of closed paths of fixed length, can be inferred from strictly local quantum measurements. In particular, we demonstrate that a malicious agent with access to only a small subset of nodes can initialize quantum states locally and, through repeated short-time measurements, extract sensitive structural information about the entire network. The intrusion strategy is inspired by extreme learning and quantum reservoir computing and combines short-time quantum evolution with a non-iterative linear readout with trainable weights. These results suggest new strategies for intrusion detection and structural diagnostics in future quantum Internet infrastructures.</description>
