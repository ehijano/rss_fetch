      <title>A comparison of low-n Mercier unstable Wendelstein stellarators and quasi-interchange modes in tokamaks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03987v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mercier's criterion is typically enforced as a hard operational limit in stellarator design. At the same time, past experimental and numerical studies have shown that this limit may often be surpassed, though the exact mechanism behind this nonlinear stability is not well understood. This work aims to contribute to our current understanding by comparing the nonlinear evolution of Mercier unstable Wendelstein stellarators to that of nonlinearly stable quasi-interchange modes in tokamaks. A high mirror, very low $\iota$, W7-X-like configuration is first simulated. A second case is then considered using experimental reconstructions of intermediate $\beta$ W7-AS discharges, where saturated low-n modes were observed experimentally, with sustained MHD signatures over tens of milliseconds. The possible reasons for the discrepancies between experiment and simulation, and the observation of partial reconnection in contrast to flux pumping are discussed, in view of reproducing and designing for operation of stellarators beyond the Mercier stability limit.</description>

      <title>Impact of Radio Frequency Power on Columnar and Filamentary Modes in Atmospheric Pressure Very Low Frequency Plasma within Pores</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The impact of radio frequency (RF) power on columnar and filamentary modes of very low frequency (VLF) plasma within pores is investigated in this work. The 12.5 kHz VLF discharge under various RF powers (13.56 MHz) was analyzed using optical photography and current-voltage measurements. Two-dimensional electron densities were derived using optical emission spectroscopy combined with collisional radiation modeling methods. It is found that RF power and very low frequency voltage (VVLF) significantly influence the plasma and its discharge modes within the 200 {\mu}m pore. Under low VVLF conditions, the plasma is more intense within the pore, and the discharge mode is columnar discharge. With increasing RF power, the reciprocal motion of electrons counteracts the local enhancement effect of columnar discharge, the discharge transforms into RF discharge, the pore is completely wrapped by the sheath, and the plasma inside is gradually quenched. Under high VVLF conditions, the electron density within the pore is low and the discharge mode is filamentary discharge. RF introduction reduces plasma intensity within the pores firstly. As RF power increases, more ion trapping in the pore increases the field strength distortion and enhances the plasma intensity inside the pore, this enhancement effects becomes more obvious with increasing RF power. In addition, the above effects were observed for all pore widths from 100 um to 1000 um. These findings provide key insights for controlling plasma in pores and offer new methodologies for plasma technology applications.</description>

      <title>Omnigenous umbilic stellarators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04211v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To better understand the dependence of the magnetic field structure in the plasma edge due to plasma boundary shape, we define and develop umbilic stellarators. These equilibria are characterized by a single continuous high-curvature edge on the plasma boundary that goes around multiple times toroidally before meeting itself. We develop a technique that allows us to simultaneously optimize the plasma boundary along with a curve lying on the boundary on which we impose a high curvature while imposing omnigenity -- a property of the magnetic field that ensures trapped particle confinement throughout the plasma volume. After generating omnigenous umbilic stellarators, we design coil sets for some of these equilibria and calculate and understand the field line structure in the edge. Finally, we propose an experiment to modify an existing tokamak to a stellarator using this technique and explore a potential way to convert a limited tokamak into a diverted stellarator.</description>

      <title>Computational Model for Photoionization in Pure SF6 Streamer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04216v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photoionization plays a crucial role in achieving spatial numerical convergence and accurate quantitative predictions in SF6 streamer simulations, but accurate models for SF6 photoionization remains limited, motivating this paper. First, we develop a computational model for SF6 photoionization and provide the detailed modeling process. Then, we perform comparative studies against simplified approaches. The results demonstrate that the proposed model effectively captures the non-local effects of SF6 photoionization, enhancing both the spatial numerical convergence and the accuracy of the streamer structure. Finally, we perform comparative studies by artificially increasing the photoionization intensity through multiplying the photoionization source term Sph by a factor of 10 (10*Sph) relative to the baseline intensity. Regarding breakdown voltage prediction, 10*Sph leads to a significant underestimation of the breakdown voltage for positive streamers, introducing errors greater than 0.5 kV, while exerting a relatively small impact on negative streamers. Regarding streamer propagation dynamics, 10*Sph reduces the contraction at the positive streamer head and significantly lowers the local field by more than 700 Td, thereby slowing down its speed. In contrast, 10*Sph has little impact on the morphology of the negative streamers and slightly enhances the local field by less than 200 Td, thereby consistently accelerating its propagation.</description>

      <title>Neural-network-based longitudinal electric field prediction in nonlinear plasma wakefield accelerators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Plasma wakefield acceleration holds remarkable promise for future advanced accelerators. The design and optimization of plasma-based accelerators typically require particle-in-cell simulations, which can be computationally intensive and time consuming. In this study, we train a neural network model to obtain the on-axis longitudinal electric field distribution directly without conducting particle-in-cell simulations for designing a two-bunch plasma wakefield acceleration stage. By combining the neural network model with an advanced algorithm for achieving the minimal energy spread, the optimal normalized charge per unit length of a trailing beam leading to the optimal beam-loading can be quickly identified. This approach can reduce computation time from around 7.6 minutes in the case of using particle-in-cell simulations to under 0.1 seconds. Moreover, the longitudinal electric field distribution under the optimal beam-loading can be visually observed. Utilizing this model with the beam current profile also enables the direct extraction of design parameters under the optimal beam-loading, including the maximum decelerating electric field within the drive beam, the average accelerating electric field within the trailing beam and the transformer ratio. This model has the potential to significantly improve the efficiency of designing and optimizing the beam-driven plasma wakefield accelerators.</description>

      <title>Normal mode analysis within relativistic massive transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04444v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we address the normal mode analysis on the linearized Boltzmann equation for massive particles in the relaxation time approximation. One intriguing feature of massive transport is the coupling of the secular equations between the sound and heat channels. This coupling vanishes as the mass approaches zero. By utilizing the argument principle in complex analysis, we determine the existence condition for collective modes and find the onset transition behavior of collective modes previously observed in massless systems. We numerically determine the critical wavenumber for the existence of each mode under various values of the scaled mass. Within the range of scaled masses considered, the critical wavenumbers for the heat and shear channels decrease with increasing scaled mass, while that of the sound channel exhibits a non-monotonic dependence on the scaled mass. In addition, we analytically derive the dispersion relations for these collective modes in the long-wavelength limit. Notably, kinetic theory also incorporates collisionless dissipation effects, known as Landau damping. We find that the branch cut structure responsible for Landau damping differs significantly from the massless case: whereas the massless system features only two branch points, the massive system exhibits an infinite number of such points forming a continuous branch cut.</description>

      <title>Effect of interplanetary shock waves on turbulence parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04450v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have performed an extensive statistical investigation of how interplanetary fast forward shocks affect certain turbulence parameters, namely, the cross-helicity, $\sigma_c$, residual energy, $\sigma_r$, and magnetic helicity, $\sigma_m$. A total of 371 shocks detected by Wind at 1 au and seven shocks by Solar Orbiter at 0.3-0.5 au have been analysed. We explore how the aforementioned turbulence parameters and their variation across the shock depend on shock characteristics including the gas compression ratio, upstream plasma beta, velocity jump and shock angle. In the shock vicinity, fluctuations tend on average to show antisunward imbalance (measured as $\sigma_c&gt;0$ when rectified to the Parker spiral direction), a dominance of magnetic energy ($\sigma_r&lt;0$) and zero $\sigma_m$, all being typical solar wind properties . Antisunward imbalance and equipartition ($\sigma_r \sim0$) in the upstream is increasingly prevalent with increasing shock velocity jump and decreasing upstream beta and shock angle. Shocks with large velocity jumps and gas compression ratios have considerably more balanced ($\sigma_c\sim0$) and more magnetically dominated fluctuations downstream than upstream. From upstream to downstream, we also find that the occurrence of time periods fulfilling strict criteria for Alfv\'enic fluctuations (AFs) usually decreases, while those meeting the criteria for small-scale flux ropes (SFRs) increases. The occurrence of AF periods peaks for quasi-parallel shocks with large velocity jumps and small upstream beta. The occurrence of SFRs increases with increasing gas compression ratio and upstream beta. The shocks observed by Solar Orbiter below 0.5 au display similar distributions of turbulence parameters and upstream-to-downstream changes to those detected at 1 au. These results are relevant for understanding turbulence and charged-particle acceleration at collisionless shocks.</description>

      <title>A disturbance in the force. How force fluctuations hinder dynamical friction and induce core stalling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04505v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dynamical friction is an important phenomena in stellar dynamics resulting in the slowing down of a test particle upon many two-body scatters with background particles. Chandrasekhar's original formulation, developed for idealized infinite and homogeneous systems, has been found to be sufficiently accurate even in models of finite extent and radially dependent density profiles. However, in some cases $N-$body simulations evidenced a breakdown of Chandrasekhar's formalism. In particular, in the case of cored stellar systems, the analytical predictions underestimate the rate of in-fall of the test particle. Several explanations for such discrepancy have been proposed so far, in spite of this it remains unclear whether the origin is a finite N effect or an effect arising from the resonance of the orbits of the test and field particles, which is independent on $N$, such as dynamical buoyancy. Here we aim at shedding some light on this issue with tailored numerical experiments. We perform ad hoc simulations of a massive tracer initially placed on a low eccentricity orbit in spherical equilibrium models with increasing resolution. We use an $N-$body code where the self-consistent interaction among the background particles can be substituted with the effect of the static smooth potential of the system's continuum limit, so that the higher order contributions to the dynamical friction arising from the formation of a wake can be neglected if needed. We find that, contrary to what reported in the previous literature, a suppression of dynamical friction happens in both cuspy and cored models. When neglecting the interaction among field particles we observe in both cases a clear $N^{-1/2}$ scaling of the radius at which dynamical friction ceases to be effective. This hints towards a granularity-induced origin of the so-called core-stalling of the massive tracer in cored models.</description>

      <title>Ponderomotive-expulsion: toward creating an electron-free volume</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04582v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We describe a demonstration of a prototype approach to clear the laser focal volume of free electrons and disable their atomic and molecular sources. Employing two temporally separated, copropagating pulses, we exploited a pump-probe setup in our experiment. The pump ionized a low-density gas and expelled free and nascent electrons from its focal volume. The probe, traversing the same focal volume, expelled any remaining free and probe-induced nascent electrons. We gauged the effectiveness of the approach by capturing the spatial distribution of ejected electrons with image plates while we varied the relative intensity and time delay between the pump and probe. When we injected the pump 300 fs before the probe, we found the electron spatial distribution significantly altered and the yield suppressed, proving ponderomotive expulsion works. However, the yield was enhanced when we set the temporal spacing between the pump and probe to 150 fs. Simulations show the enhancement is due to Airy rings of the focused pump expelling electrons inward toward the propagation axis. Our results show that the complete removal of focal-volume electrons was inhibited by spatial overlap fluctuations and the stronger probe generating ionization outside the cleared-volume of the pump. We discuss ways to mitigate these impediments and propose alternate two-beam arrangements to achieve more efficient focal-volume clearing.</description>

      <title>Broadband coherent XUV light from $e^-/e^+$ microbunching in an intense laser pulse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17631v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Attosecond pulses of coherent extreme ultraviolet (XUV) light are instrumental for investigating subatomic dynamics and can be produced using a free-electron laser (FEL). It has been suggested that an optical FEL, which employs a laser pulse in place of a conventional undulator, could enable a dramatically more compact implementation of such a light source. Yet, the high electron density and subsequent high emittance implied by an optical FEL makes this concept challenging to realize with an electron beam. There has been impressive progress in recent years producing collimated dense and relativistic beams of electrons and positrons in the laboratory. The inherent stability of a quasi-neutral electron-positron beam mitigates Coulomb expansion, and renders it a promising alternative source of coherent light, as we demonstrate here. Specifically, we show via computer simulations that broadband coherent light in the XUV domain, which takes the form of 8-as pulses at 92-as intervals, can be generated by microbunching of relativistic electrons and positrons in a laser pulse. This process occurs over a sub-millimeter length scale, enabling the development of orders-of-magnitude more compact light sources that could be employed in physics, chemistry, biology, and industry.</description>

      <title>Experiments and modeling of dust particle heating resulting from changes in polarity switching in the PK-4 microgravity laboratory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12248v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the presence of gravity, the micron-sized charged dust particles in a complex (dusty) plasma are compressed into thin layers. However, under the microgravity conditions of the Plasma Kristall-4 (PK-4) experiment on the International Space Station (ISS), the particles fill the plasma, allowing us to investigate the properties of a three-dimensional (3D) multi-particle system. This paper examines the change in the spatial ordering and thermal state of the particle system created when dust particles are stopped by periodic oscillations of the electric field, known as polarity switching, in a dc glow discharge plasma.
  Data from the ISS is compared against experiments performed using a ground-based reference version of PK-4 and numerical simulations. Initial results show substantive differences in the velocity distribution functions between experiments on the ground and in microgravity. There are also differences in the motion of the dust cloud, in microgravity there is an expansion of the dust cloud at the application of polarity switching which is not seen in the ground-based experiments. It is proposed that the dust cloud in microgravity gains thermal energy at the application of polarity switching due to this expansion. Simulation results suggest that this may be due to a modification in the effective screening length of the dust at the onset of polarity switching, which arises from a configuration energy between the charged particles. Experimental measurements and simulations show that an extended time (much greater than the Epstein drag decay) is required to dissipate this energy.</description>
