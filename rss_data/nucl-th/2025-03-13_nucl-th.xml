      <title>Effects of symmetry energy on the properties of hadron-quark mixed phase in hybrid stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09965v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study how the nuclear symmetry energy slope affects the properties of hadron-quark pasta phases and their sizes in massive hybrid stars ($&gt; 2 M_{\odot}$). We utilize the relativistic mean-field model with a density-dependent isovector coupling constant fitted by varying values of the symmetry energy slope $L$ to describe the hadronic matter, while the quark matter is described by a modified MIT bag model with vector interactions. We construct the hadron-quark phase transition using the energy minimization (EM) method and compare with the Gibbs construction (GC) in the hybrid star. We find that the massive hybrid stars generally tend to have a hadron-quark pasta phase core rather than a pure quark core for most values of $L$, except in some special cases where they have a small pure quark core. Furthermore, we show that the mass and size of the pasta phase core are strongly influenced by the symmetry energy. The radius associated with the onset of pasta phases is also influenced by the symmetry energy. Additionally, we also evaluate the effects of the surface tension $\sigma$, the bag constant $B$, and the vector interaction $G_{V}$.</description>

      <title>$\beta^-$-decay half-lives of even-even nuclei using the recently introduced phase space recipe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the beta decay half-lives calculation for selected even even nuclei that decay through electron emission. The kinematical portion of the half-life calculation was performed using a recently introduced technique for computation of phase space factors (PSFs). The dynamical portion of our calculation was performed within the proton neutron quasiparticle random phase approximation (pn QRPA) model. Six nuclei (20O, 24Ne, 34Si, 54Ti, 62Fe, and 98Zr) were selected for the present calculation. We compare the calculated PSFs for these cases against the traditionally used recipe. In our new approach, the Dirac equation was numerically solved employing a Coulomb potential. This potential was adopted from a more realistic proton distribution of the daughter nucleus. Thus, the finite size of the nucleus and the diffuse nuclear surface corrections are taken into account. Moreover, a screened Coulomb potential was constructed to account for the effect of atomic screening. The power series technique was used for the numerical solution. The calculated values of half-lives, employing the recently developed method for computation of PSFs, were in good agreement with the experimental data.</description>

      <title>Non-perturbative quarkonium dissociation rates in strongly coupled quark-gluon plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Heavy quarks and quarkonia are versatile probes of the transport properties of the hot QCD medium produced in ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions (URHICs). A robust description of heavy-flavor transport coefficients requires a microscopic approach that treats the open and hidden heavy-flavor sectors on the same footing. Here, we employ the quantum many-body $T$-matrix formalism to evaluate the dissociation rates of heavy quarkonia in the quark-gluon plasma (QGP). The basic ingredient is the heavy-light $T$-matrix, which utilizes a nonperturbative driving kernel constrained by lattice-QCD data. Its resummation in a ladder series provides a much enhanced interaction strength compared to previously used perturbative coupling to the quasiparticle partons in the QGP. The in-medium quarkonium properties, particularly their temperature-dependent binding energies, are evaluated self-consistently using the same interaction kernel, including interference effects (also referred to as the imaginary part of the heavy-quark potential) as well as off-shell parton spectral functions. We systematically investigate the interplay of these effects and elaborate on the connections to the dipole approximation used in effective field theory.</description>

      <title>$\gamma W$-exchange contributions in neutron $\beta$ decay in the forward-angle limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, the contributions from $\gamma W$-exchange in neutron $\beta$ decay are estimated at the amplitude level. Using a general form for the electromagnetic (EM) form factors (FFs) of the proton, the EM FFs of the neutron, and the weak FFs of the $Wnp$ interaction as inputs, we present analytical expressions for the inner part of the $\gamma W$-exchange amplitude under the forward angle limit. The differences and relations between our method and those used in the references are discussed. To compare our numerical results with those provided in the references, we consider three types of FFs as examples. The numerical results show that when the favored EM FFs are used, our result for the contribution from the Fermi part is consistent with those reported in the references, while our results for the Gamow-Teller parts are about 7\% and 13\% larger than those reported in Ref.~\cite{Hayen-2021}.</description>

      <title>Bayesian analysis of a (3+1)D hybrid approach with initial conditions from hadronic transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10181v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study aims to apply statistical learning, specifically Bayesian inference, to the (3+1)D SMASH-vHLLE-hybrid model using initial conditions generated by the SMASH transport code itself, with the objective of constraining model parameters and gaining deeper insight on the temperature and baryochemical potential dependence of both the shear and the bulk viscosity. This study is performed in the hybrid approach SMASH-vHLLE, composed of the hadronic transport approach SMASH and the (3+1)D viscous hydrodynamic code vHLLE. A Bayesian framework is employed, utilizing Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling to explore the parameter space. The analysis compares model predictions against experimental observables, including particle yields, momentum and flow coefficients both at midrapidity as well as in forward and backward direction. We find that the SMASH-vHLLE-hybrid framework, using hadronic initial conditions for Au+Au collisions at different beam energies, can reproduce a variety of experimental observables at midrapidity and forward/backward rapidities. Notably, the preferred posterior distribution suggests a near-vanishing specific shear viscosity in the high-temperature QGP phase, combined with moderate-to-large bulk viscosity around the phase transition region, although the constraints on baryochemical potential dependence are weak. Our findings reveal that a hadronic initial condition constrains the evolution more strictly at intermediate energies, making parameters such as the hydrodynamic onset time highly sensitive. Intriguingly, the extracted shear viscosity differs substantially from previous Bayesian analyses, motivating further systematic studies with higher-statistics data sets and refined modeling assumptions.</description>

      <title>Nuclear matter in relativistic Brueckner-Hartree-Fock theory with local and nonlocal covariant chiral interactions at leading order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The simultaneous description for nuclear matter and finite nuclei has been a long-standing challenge in nuclear ab initio theory. With the success for nuclear matter, the relativistic Brueckner-Hartree-Fock (RBHF) theory with covariant chiral interactions is a promising ab initio approach to describe both nuclear matter and finite nuclei. In the description of the finite nuclei with the current RBHF theory, the covariant chiral interactions have to be localized to make calculations feasible. In order to examine the reliability and validity, in this letter, the RBHF theory with local and nonlocal covariant chiral interactions at leading order are applied for nuclear matter. The low-energy constants in the covariant chiral interactions determined with the local regularization are close to those with the nonlocal regularization. Moreover, the RBHF theory with local and nonlocal covariant chiral interactions provide equally well description of the saturation properties of nuclear matter. The present work paves the way for the implementation of covariant chiral interactions in RBHF theory for finite nuclei.</description>

      <title>Explanation of the observed violation of isospin symmetry in relativistic nucleus-nucleus reactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10493v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The violation of isospin symmetry in nucleus-nucleus reactions, as shown in the ratio ${R_K=(K^++K^-)/(K^0+\bar{K}^0)}$ presented by NA61/SHINE, can be understood by introducing results from color-string fragmentation in $e^+e^-$ to nuclear reactions. This novel input allows for a consistent description of the $e^+e^-$ data, proton+proton data and finally nucleus-nucleus data at all investigated energies. We conclude that the observed isospin violation in nucleus-nucleus reactions is explained by asymmetric production of up- and down-quarks in the elementary color field fragmentation process.</description>

      <title>Apparent teleportation of indistinguishable particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10565v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Teleportation, introduced in science fiction literature, is an instantaneous change of the position of a microscopic object. Two teleportation-like phenomena were predicted by quantum mechanics: quantum teleportation and, recently, quantum particle teleportation. The former is investigated experimentally and has applications in quantum communication and computing.
  Here, we introduced the third teleportation-like phenomenon - an apparent teleportation. It seems to be a natural consequence of elementary particles and antiparticles of the Standard Model being indistinguishable. We give an example of a process leading to the apparent teleportation within a toy model of boson-like particles. It utilizes the local transport of particles and antiparticles and the local creation and annihilation of particle-antiparticle pairs. Furthermore, we suggest a method to observe the apparent teleportation in nucleus-nucleus collisions at properly selected collision energy. The method requires the measurement of correlations between momenta of charm and anticharm hadrons in collisions with a single $c\bar{c}$ pair being produced. The ultimate prediction following the apparent teleportation hypothesis is the uncorrelated emission of charm and anticharm hadrons. It can be tested by contemporary experiments.
  Observing the apparent teleportation would uncover the basic transport properties of indistinguishable particles. In particular, the apparent teleportation may explain the rapid thermalisation of the system created in collisions of two atomic nuclei. Theoretical and experimental efforts are needed to observe the apparent teleportation processes and study their properties.</description>

      <title>High-energy Coulomb scattering of spatially extended particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09154v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze pure Coulomb high-energy elastic scattering of charged particles (hadrons or nuclei), discarding their strong interactions. We distinguish three scattering modes, determined by the magnitude of the momentum transfer, in which particles behave as point-like, structureless extended, and structured composite objects. The results are compared in the potential and QFT approaches of the eikonal model. In the case of proton Coulomb scattering at the LHC the difference between these two approaches is significant. This indicates the unsuitability of the potential approach. However, in the case of Coulomb scattering of heavy nuclei, the leading one is the optical approximation, which formally reproduces the prescription of the potential approach.</description>

      <title>Dominance of gluonic scale anomaly in confining pressure inside nucleon and D-term</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09686v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the confining pressure inside the nucleon and the related gravitational form factor referred to as the D-term, using the skyrmion approach based on the scale-invariant chiral perturbation theory, where the skyrmion is described as the nucleon and a scalar meson couples to the scale anomaly through the low energy theorem. Within this model framework, the current quark mass and gluonic quantum contributions to the scale anomaly can be described by the pion and scalar meson masses, respectively, through matching with the underlying QCD. By considering the decomposition of the energy momentum tensor of nucleon, we examine the role of the scale anomaly contributions in the pressure inside the nucleon. As a result, the gluonic scale anomaly is found to dominate the confining pressure. Compared to the result based on the conventional chiral perturbation theory in the chiral limit, our result for the total pressure is capable of qualitatively improving the alignment with lattice QCD observations. Moreover, the pressure from the gluonic scale anomaly is widely distributed in position space, leading to its substantial contribution to the D-term.</description>

      <title>Improved Honeycomb and Hyper-Honeycomb Lattice Hamiltonians for Quantum Simulations of Non-Abelian Gauge Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09688v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Improved Kogut-Susskind Hamiltonians for quantum simulations of non-Abelian Yang-Mills gauge theories are developed for honeycomb (2+1D) and hyper-honeycomb (3+1D) spatial tessellations. This is motivated by the desire to identify lattices for quantum simulations that involve only 3-link vertices among the gauge field group spaces in order to reduce the complexity in applications of the plaquette operator. For the honeycomb lattice, we derive a classically ${\cal O}(b^2)$-improved Hamiltonian, with $b$ being the lattice spacing. Tadpole improvement via the mean-field value of the plaquette operator is used to provide the corresponding quantum improvements. We have identified the (non-chiral) hyper-honeycomb as a candidate spatial tessellation for 3+1D quantum simulations of gauge theories, and determined the associated ${\cal O}(b)$-improved Hamiltonian.</description>

      <title>Signs of Non-Monotonic Finite-Volume Corrections to $g_A$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09891v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study finite-volume (FV) corrections to determinations of $g_A$ via lattice quantum chromodynamics (QCD) using analytic results and numerical analysis. We observe that $SU(2)$ Heavy Baryon Chiral Perturbation Theory does not provide an unambiguous prediction for the sign of the FV correction, which is not surprising when one also considers large-$N_c$ constraints on the axial couplings. We further show that non-monotonic FV corrections are naturally allowed when one considers either including explicit $\Delta$-resonance degrees of freedom or one works to higher orders in the chiral expansion. We investigate the potential impact of these FV corrections with a precision study of $g_A$ using models of FV corrections that are monotonic and non-monotonic. Using lattice QCD data that is approximately at the 1% level of precision, we do not see significant evidence of non-monotonic corrections. Looking forward to the next phase of lattice QCD calculations, we estimate that calculations that are between the 0.1%-1%-level of precision may be sensitive to these FV artifacts. Finally, we present an update of the CalLat prediction of $g_A$ in the isospin limit with sub-percent precision, $g_A^{\rm QCD} = 1.2674(96)$.</description>

Abstract: The study of the spectrum of excited states of the nucleon is vital to our understanding of how QCD is realized in the baryon spectrum. Using a simultaneous analysis of the pion nucleon scattering data up to 2 GeV as well as the results of lattice QCD calculations, we obtain new insight into the nature of the Roper resonance as well as the excited states around 1.9 GeV.</description>

      <title>Exploring the multiplicity dependence of the flavor hierarchy for hadron productions in high energy pp collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10157v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we perform a systematic study on the multiplicity dependence of hadron productions at mid-rapidity ($|y|&lt;0.5$), ranging from the light to the charm sector in pp collisions at $\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV. This study utilizes a multi-phase transport model (AMPT) coupled with PYTHIA8 initial conditions. We have investigated the baryon to meson ratios as well as the strange to non-strange meson ratios varying with the charged particle density. By tuning the coalescence parameters, the AMPT model provides a reasonable description to the experimental data for inclusive productions of both light and charm hadrons, comparable to the string fragmentation model calculations with color reconnection effects. Additionally, we have analyzed the relative production of hadrons by examining self-normalized particle ratios as a function of the charged hadron density. Our findings suggest that parton evolution effects and the coalescence hadronization process in AMPT model lead to a strong flavor hierarchy in the multiplicity dependence of the baryon to meson ratio. Furthermore, our investigation on the $p_T$ differential double ratio of baryon to meson fraction between high and low multiplicity events indicates distinct modifications to the flavor associated baryon to meson ratio $p_T$ shape in high multiplicity events when comparing the coalescence hadronization model to the color reconnection model. These observations highlight the importance of understanding the hadronization process in high-energy proton-proton collisions through a comprehensive multiplicity dependent multi-flavor analysis.</description>

      <title>Hadron physics with functional methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10397v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give a pedagogical introduction to hadron spectroscopy and structure studies using functional methods. We explain the basic features of Dyson-Schwinger, Bethe-Salpeter and Faddeev equations, which are employed to calculate the spectra of mesons, baryons and four-quark states. We discuss dynamical mass generation as a consequence of the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry, which is intertwined with the emergence of the light pions as Goldstone bosons of QCD. We highlight the importance of diquark correlations in the baryon sector, while for four-quark states such as the light scalar mesons and heavy exotics the dominant two-body clusters are typically mesons. We conclude with a brief discussion of hadron matrix elements like electromagnetic form factors and how vector-meson dominance is an automatic outcome of functional equations.</description>

      <title>Chiral Magnetic Effect enhancement at lower collision energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10593v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend previous holographic studies of the Chiral Magnetic Effect (CME) by incorporating a time-dependent magnetic field. Various magnetic field profiles proposed in the literature are implemented, and their impact on the CME signal is analyzed in both static and expanding backgrounds. Interestingly, the integrated chiral magnetic current can exhibit a non-monotonic dependence on the collision energy. Our results suggest that the CME signal is enhanced at collision energies below $\sqrt{s}=200$ GeV. In addition, we derive a quasi-equilibrium formula for the chiral magnetic effect in the expanding background that is valid at late times.</description>

      <title>Probing the equilibration of the QCD matter created in heavy-ion collisions with dileptons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04156v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A systematic study of intermediate invariant mass dilepton production in Pb+Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 5.02$ TeV is performed, using next-to-leading-order (NLO) thermal QCD dilepton emission rates with a multistage dynamical approach which includes event-by-event IP-Glasma initial conditions, relativistic viscous fluid dynamics, and a hadronic afterburner. Considering dilepton yield and anisotropic flow, special attention is paid to the out-of-equilibrium aspects, both thermal and chemical, and to the contribution of the Drell-Yan process. The relative contribution of each of those different channels to dilepton observables is calculated and discussed.</description>

      <title>Disentangling the influence of excitation energy and compound nucleus angular momentum on fission fragment angular momentum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04340v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The origin of the large angular momenta observed for fission fragments is still a question under discussion. To address this, we study isomeric yield ratios (IYR), i.e. the relative population of two or more long-lived metastable states with different spins, of fission products.
  We report on IYR of 17 isotopes produced in the 28 MeV $\alpha$-induced fission of $^{232}$Th at the IGISOL facility of the University of Jyv\"askyl\"a. The fissioning nuclei in this reaction are $^{233,234,235}$U*. We compare our data to IYR from thermal neutron-induced fission of $^{233}$U and $^{235}$U, and we observe statistically significant larger IYR in the $^{232}$Th($\alpha$,f) reaction, where the average compound nucleus (CN) spin is 7.5 $\hbar$, than in $^{233,235}$U(n$_{th}$,f), with average spins 2.5 and 3.5 $\hbar$, respectively.
  To assess the influence of the excitation energy, we study literature data of IYR from photon-induced fission reactions, and find that the IYR are independent of the CN excitation energy. We conclude that the different IYR must be explained by the different CN spin alone. This implies that the FF angular momentum only partly comes from the fission process itself, and is in addition influenced by the angular momentum present in the CN.</description>

      <title>Numerical study of computational cost of maintaining adiabaticity for long paths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08626v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent work argued that the scaling of a dimensionless quantity $Q_D$ with path length is a better proxy for quantifying the scaling of the computational cost of maintaining adiabaticity than the timescale. It also conjectured that generically the scaling will be superlinear (although special cases exist in which it is linear). The quantity $Q_D$ depends only on the properties of ground states along the Hamiltonian path and the rate at which the path is followed. In this paper, we demonstrate that this conjecture holds for simple Hamiltonian systems that can be studied numerically. In particular, the systems studied exhibit the behavior that $Q_D$ grows approximately as $L \log L$ where $L$ is the path length when the threshold error is fixed.</description>
