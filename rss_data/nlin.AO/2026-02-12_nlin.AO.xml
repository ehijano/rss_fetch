      <title>Defect states as a precursor of the chimera states in a ring of non-locally coupled oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10533v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the transition from synchronized to chimera states in a ring of non-locally coupled phase oscillators. Our focus is on the intermediate defect states, where solitary waves in the phase gradient profile travel at a constant speed. These traveling defects serve as a dynamical precursor for the nucleation of chimera clusters. The fraction of samples exhibiting defect states increases with the phase delay $\alpha$ and peaks at $\alpha_{c}$, where the system crosses over to asynchronous states filled with chimera clusters. While the traveling speed, number, and width of these defects increase with $\alpha$, the total spatial extent of the defects remains robust against the system size $N$. These results shed new light on the emergence of chimera states in frustrated coupled oscillators.</description>

      <title>Kinetic renormalization of auroral turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11755v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Driven-dissipative systems often exhibit self-organization in the form of coherent dissipative structures. However, observing such critical states in natural plasmas remains elusive, leading to the traditional view that the fine structure of Earth's auroral ionosphere is shaped by local turbulent flows. Here we report the discovery of a self-organizing regime in Earth's ionosphere. We identify this by modeling the sum of saturation electric fields in the turbulent auroral electrojets as a stochastic variable that renormalizes into noise-enabled transport, via explicitly derived Bohm diffusion. This constitutes an effective field-theory for Farley-Buneman turbulence in the Martin-Siggia-Rose formalism for renormalization group theory, for which we provide strong empirical evidence. Using a composite radar-GPS power spectrum of plasma turbulence, we resolve a scale-invariant cascade that exhibits a characteristic kinetic Alfv\'{e}n $k^{-8/3}$-signature across four orders of magnitude in $k$. What is more, a large statistical analysis of how the turbulence responds to magnetospheric driving reveals a clear tendency for the observed number density of turbulent waves to scale linearly with driving power, matching the predictions made by our field theory's overdamped equations of motion, which offer closed-form calculations of macroscopic transport relations that are uniquely suitable for sub-grid parameterization in space weather modeling. This establishes geospace storms as opportunities to observe non-equilibrium phase transitions imposing global constraints on collision-dominated systems.</description>
