      <title>Battery Operations in Electricity Markets: Strategic Behavior and Distortions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18685v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electric power systems are undergoing a major transformation as they integrate intermittent renewable energy sources, and batteries to smooth out variations in renewable energy production. As privately-owned batteries grow from their role as marginal "price-takers" to significant players in the market, a natural question arises: How do batteries operate in electricity markets, and how does the strategic behavior of decentralized batteries distort decisions compared to centralized batteries?
  We propose an analytically tractable model that captures salient features of the highly complex electricity market. We derive in closed form the resulting battery behavior and generation cost in three operating regimes: (i) no battery, (ii) centralized battery, and (ii) decentralized profit-maximizing battery. We establish that a decentralized battery distorts its discharge decisions in three ways. First, there is quantity withholding, i.e., discharging less than centrally optimal. Second, there is a shift in participation from day-ahead to real-time, i.e., postponing some of its discharge from day-ahead to real-time. Third, there is reduction in real-time responsiveness, or discharging less in response to smoothing real-time demand than centrally optimal. We quantify each of the three forms of distortions in terms of market fundamentals. To illustrate our results, we calibrate our model to Los Angeles and Houston and show that the loss from incentive misalignment could be consequential.</description>

      <title>Convex Choice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For multidimensional Euclidean type spaces, we study convex choice: from any choice set, the set of types that make the same choice is convex. We establish that, in a suitable sense, this property characterizes the sufficiency of local incentive constraints. Convex choice is also of interest more broadly. We tie convex choice to a notion of directional single-crossing differences (DSCD). For an expected-utility agent choosing among lotteries, DSCD implies that preferences are either one-dimensional or must take the affine form that has been tractable in multidimensional mechanism design.</description>

      <title>Equilibrium Selection in Pure Bubble Models by Dividend Injection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.05636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.05636v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Rational pure bubble models feature multiple (and often a continuum of) equilibria, which makes model predictions and policy analyses non-robust. We show that when the interest rate in the fundamental equilibrium is below the economic growth rate ($R&lt;G$), a bubbly equilibrium with $R=G$ exists. By injecting dividends to the bubble asset that grow slower than the aggregate economy, we can eliminate the fundamental steady state and resolve equilibrium indeterminacy. We show the general applicability of dividend injection through examples in overlapping generations and infinite-horizon models with or without production or financial frictions.</description>

      <title>COWPEA (Candidates Optimally Weighted in Proportional Election using Approval voting)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.08857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.08857v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper describes a new method of proportional representation that uses approval voting, known as COWPEA (Candidates Optimally Weighted in Proportional Election using Approval voting). COWPEA optimally elects an unlimited number of candidates with potentially different weights to a body, rather than giving a fixed number equal weight. A version that elects a fixed a number of candidates with equal weight does exist, but it is non-deterministic, and is known as COWPEA Lottery. This methods passes the "Holy Grail" criteria of monotonicity, Independence of Irrelevant Ballots, and Independence of Universally Approved Candidates. There are also ways to convert COWPEA and COWPEA Lottery to score or graded voting methods.</description>

      <title>Nonparametric Strategy Test</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.10695v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a nonparametric statistical test for determining whether an agent is following a given mixed strategy in a repeated strategic-form game given samples of the agent's play. This involves two components: determining whether the agent's frequencies of pure strategies are sufficiently close to the target frequencies, and determining whether the pure strategies selected are independent between different game iterations. Our integrated test involves applying a chi-squared goodness of fit test for the first component and a generalized Wald-Wolfowitz runs test for the second component. The results from both tests are combined using Bonferroni correction to produce a complete test for a given significance level $\alpha.$ We applied the test to publicly available data of human rock-paper-scissors play. The data consists of 50 iterations of play for 500 human players. We test with a null hypothesis that the players are following a uniform random strategy independently at each game iteration. Using a significance level of $\alpha = 0.05$, we conclude that 305 (61%) of the subjects are following the target strategy.</description>
