      <title>A Survey on Continuous Variable Quantum Key Distribution for Secure Data Transmission: Toward the Future of Secured Quantum-Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21640v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum key distribution (QKD) represents a cornerstone of secure communication in the quantum era. While discrete-variable QKD (DV-QKD) protocols were historically the first to demonstrate secure key exchange, continuous-variable QKD (CV-QKD) has emerged as a more practical alternative due to its seamless compatibility with current telecommunications infrastructure. CV-QKD relies on coherent and squeezed states of light, offering significant advantages for integration into modern optical networks. This review comprehensively explores the theoretical underpinnings, technological advancements, and practical challenges of CV-QKD. Special attention is given to the role of photonic integrated circuits (PICs) in enabling scalable and efficient implementation of CV-QKD systems. Furthermore, recent advances in machine learning have been leveraged to optimize CV-QKD performance, with data-driven techniques enhancing noise estimation, parameter optimization, and system security. Additionally, tensor networks provide efficient computational tools for analyzing complex quantum correlations, improving the efficiency and robustness of quantum key distribution protocols. These developments, combined with ongoing improvements in quantum photonic integration, pave the way for the practical deployment of large-scale, high-speed quantum-secure networks.</description>

      <title>Consistent Simulation of Fibonacci Anyon Braiding within a Qubit Quasicrystal Inflation Code</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The simulation of non-Abelian anyon braiding is a critical step towards fault-tolerant quantum computation. We introduce a framework for this task based on a one-dimensional Quasicrystal Inflation Code (QIC). The code is defined by a local Hamiltonian whose ground state manifold enforces Fibonacci tiling constraints and possesses the correct Fibonacci degeneracy. We derive the corresponding braid operators and demonstrate that, while they are formally non-local, they possess an exact, local 3-qubit structure. This allows us to distill their action into a single, physically realizable $8 \times 8$ gate, which we term the $B_{gate}$. We prove through comparative compilation for systems with different numbers of qubits that constructing circuits by composing these local gates is dramatically more scalable than compiling the equivalent global unitary, showing a greater than tenfold reduction in circuit depth. To validate the framework, we successfully executed a braiding algorithm for the Jones polynomial, a topological invariant of knots, on an IBM Quantum processor, quantifying the signal degradation due to hardware noise. Finally, we numerically confirm for systems up to 17 qubits that our construction rigorously satisfies the required Temperley-Lieb and braid group relations while preserving the code subspace. This work establishes a validated and physically grounded pathway for the scalable simulation of anyonic braiding on programmable quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Operational Threshold for Spatial Entanglement Survival Under Ionizing Decoherence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21647v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The resilience of quantum entanglement under irreversible, energy-transferring interactions remains a fundamental question in quantum foundations and emerging quantum technologies. We develop a fully microscopic quantum electrodynamics framework to describe how spatial entanglement evolves when one particle of an entangled pair undergoes dissipative processes such as ionization or inelastic scattering. We show that entanglement decay follows an exponential law governed by recoil-induced momentum diffusion and identify a sharp operational threshold separating quantum-coherent and classical regimes. This threshold depends on whether the cumulative recoil-induced uncertainty exceeds the intrinsic bandwidth of the entangled state. Our results extend decoherence theory beyond Gaussian and weak-coupling models, providing quantitative criteria for entanglement survival in radiative environments and informing the design of robust quantum protocols in quantum sensing, imaging, and radiation-based quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Quantum Transition Rates in Arbitrary Physical Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21672v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a framework for computing time-dependent quantum transition rates (QTRs) that describe the pace of evolution of a quantum state from a given subspace to a target subspace. QTRs are expressed in terms of flux-flux correlators and are shown to obey two complementary quantum speed limits. Our framework readily accommodates the generalization of Hamiltonian dynamics to arbitrary open quantum evolution, including quantum measurements. We illustrate how QTRs can be controlled by counterdiabatic driving.</description>

      <title>Characterizing non-Markovianity via quantum coherence based on Kirkwood-Dirac quasiprobability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new measure of non-Markovianity based on the property of nonincreasing quantum coherence via Kirkwood-Dirac (KD) quasiprobability under incoherent completely positive trace-preserving maps. Quantum coherence via the KD quasiprobability is defined as the imaginary part of the KD quasiprobability, which is maximised over all possible second bases and evaluated using an incoherent reference basis. A measure non-Markovianity based on KD quasiprobability coherence would capture memory effects via the time evolution of the imaginary part of the KD quasiprobability, providing an experimentally accessible and physically intuitive alternative to traditional measures relying on quantum Fisher information or trace distance. This approach is applied to the study of dissipation and dephasing dynamics in single- and two-qubit systems. The results obtained show that, in the cases studied, our measure based on coherence via Kirkwood-Dirac quasiprobability performs at least as well as $\ell_{1}$-norm coherence in detecting non-Markovianity, this provides a novel perspective on the analysis of non-Markovian dynamics.</description>

      <title>Crosstalk-Resilient Quantum MIMO for Scalable Quantum Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address the challenge of crosstalk in quantum multiplexing -an obstacle to scaling throughput in quantum communication networks. Crosstalk arises when physically coupled quantum modes interfere, degrading signal fidelity. We propose a mitigation strategy based on encoding discrete-variable (DV) quantum information into continuous-variable (CV) bosonic modes using Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) codes. By analyzing the effect of mode-mixing interference, we show that under specific noise strength conditions, the interaction can be absorbed into a gauge subsystem that leaves the logical content intact. We provide rigorous conditions for perfect transmission in the ideal case, derive the structure of the output codes and prove the existence of a gauge-fixing decoder enabling recovery of the logical information. Numerical simulations under displacement Gaussian noise illustrate the fidelity behavior and rate-fidelity tradeoff. Our results establish a coding-theoretic foundation for crosstalk-resilient multiplexing in quantum networks.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21707v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a protocol using machine learning (ML) to simultaneously optimize the quantum error-correcting code space and the corresponding recovery map in the framework of continuous-time quantum error correction. Given a Hilbert space and a noise process -- potentially correlated across both space and time -- the protocol identifies the optimal recovery strategy, measured by the average logical state fidelity. This approach enables the discovery of recovery schemes tailored to arbitrary device-level noise.</description>

      <title>Increasing single-photon production with cavity-QED</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21737v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A study was performed to determine the extent cavity enhancement may increase single-photon production while maintaining single-photon purity. It was found that certain combinations of cavity lifetime and light-matter coupling strength can lead to carrier-photon correlations that increase single-photon generation rate while maintaining low 2nd order photon correlation. This study provides guidance for future emitter-cavity design to achieve high purity and ultrafast single photon generation.</description>

      <title>Arbitrary Boundary Conditions and Constraints in Quantum Algorithms for Differential Equations via Penalty Projections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21751v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Complicated boundary conditions are essential to accurately describe phenomena arising in nature and engineering. Recently, the investigation of a potential speedup through quantum algorithms in simulating the governing ordinary and partial differential equations of such phenomena has gained increasing attention. We design an efficient quantum algorithms for solving differential equations with arbitrary boundary conditions. Specifically, we propose an approach to enforce arbitrary boundary conditions and constraints through adding a penalty projection to the governing equations. Assuming a fast-forwardable representation of the projection to ensure an efficient interaction picture imulation, the cost of to enforce the constraints is at most $O(\log\lambda)$ in the strength of the penalty $\lambda$ in the gate complexity; in the worst case, this goes as $O([\|v(0)\|^2\|A_0\| + \|b\|_{L^1[0;t]}^2)]t^2/\varepsilon)$, for precision $\varepsilon$ and a dynamical system $\frac{\rm d}{{\rm d}t} v(t) = A_0(t) v(t) + b(t)$ with negative semidefinite $A_0(t)$ of size $n^d\times n^d$. E.g., for the heat equation, this leads to a gate complexity overhead of $\widetilde O(d\log n + \log t)$. We show constraint error bounds for the penalty approach and provide validating numerical experiments, and estimate the circuit complexity using the Linear Combination of Hamiltonian Simulation.</description>

      <title>Implementation and representation of qudit multi-controlled unitaries and hypergraph states by many-body angular momentum couplings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a representation of qudit multi-controlled unitary operators in terms of many-body angular momentum interactions. The representation is particularly convenient for odd-dimensional systems, with interesting connections to the Pegg-Barnett phase formalism. We illustrate the main points in the special case of qutrits, where simplifications and connections to dipole-quadrupole and quadrupole-quadrupole interactions can be established. We describe the representation of the closely related set of qudit hypergraph states, identifying possible realizations and their main obstacles. Qutrit tripartite controlled unitaries are decomposed in terms of more familiar two-body angular momentum couplings, enabling their implementation in a variety of physical systems. We give then a concrete example of implementation of qutrit unitaries and hypergraph states in optical systems that employs single-photon sources, two-mode cross-Kerr interactions and linear optical operations. Moreover, we define a new set of states, called angular momentum hypergraph states, which are more directly related to the angular momentum representation.</description>

      <title>Adversarial Threats in Quantum Machine Learning: A Survey of Attacks and Defenses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21842v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum Machine Learning (QML) integrates quantum computing with classical machine learning, primarily to solve classification, regression and generative tasks. However, its rapid development raises critical security challenges in the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) era. This chapter examines adversarial threats unique to QML systems, focusing on vulnerabilities in cloud-based deployments, hybrid architectures, and quantum generative models. Key attack vectors include model stealing via transpilation or output extraction, data poisoning through quantum-specific perturbations, reverse engineering of proprietary variational quantum circuits, and backdoor attacks. Adversaries exploit noise-prone quantum hardware and insufficiently secured QML-as-a-Service (QMLaaS) workflows to compromise model integrity, ownership, and functionality. Defense mechanisms leverage quantum properties to counter these threats. Noise signatures from training hardware act as non-invasive watermarks, while hardware-aware obfuscation techniques and ensemble strategies disrupt cloning attempts. Emerging solutions also adapt classical adversarial training and differential privacy to quantum settings, addressing vulnerabilities in quantum neural networks and generative architectures. However, securing QML requires addressing open challenges such as balancing noise levels for reliability and security, mitigating cross-platform attacks, and developing quantum-classical trust frameworks. This chapter summarizes recent advances in attacks and defenses, offering a roadmap for researchers and practitioners to build robust, trustworthy QML systems resilient to evolving adversarial landscapes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.21916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nuclear spins' dipolar order is created under magic angle spinning through the first-order process made possible by simultaneous implementation of dipolar recoupling and adiabatic demagnetization in a reference frame reached out through nested transformations, firstly from the laboratory frame into the rotating frame, and then into the spin coordinate system nutating inside its parent frame. In such a nutating frame, both the static and resonantly rotating radio-frequency (RF) fields are invisible, and the re-introduced dipolar interaction provides a secular eigenstate on which dipolar order develops with assist of an additional portion of RF field designed to implement adiabatic demagnetization in the nutating frame.</description>

      <title>Practical roadmap to measurement-altered criticality in Rydberg arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21963v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Weak measurements have been predicted to dramatically alter universal properties of quantum critical wavefunctions, though experimental validation remains an open problem. Here we devise a practical scheme for realizing measurement-altered criticality in a chain of Rydberg atoms tuned to Ising and tricritical Ising phase transitions. In particular, we show that projectively measuring a periodic subset of atoms alters quantum critical correlations in distinct ways that one can control via the choice of measured sites and the measurement outcomes. While our protocol relies on post-selection, the measurement outcomes yielding the most dramatic consequences occur with surprisingly large probabilities: O(10%) with chains featuring O(100) sites. Characterizing the proposed post-measurement states requires only an adjustment in the post-process averaging of outcomes used to characterize unmeasured critical states, resulting in minimal additional experimental overhead for demonstrating measurement-altered criticality.</description>

      <title>Unifying communication paradigms in delegated quantum computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21988v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Delegated quantum computing (DQC) allows clients with low quantum capabilities to outsource computations to a server hosting a quantum computer. This process is typically envisioned within the measurement-based quantum computing framework, as it naturally facilitates blindness of inputs and computation. Hence, the overall process of setting up and conducting the computation encompasses a sequence of three stages: preparing the qubits, entangling the qubits to obtain the resource state, and measuring the qubits to run the computation. There are two primary approaches to distributing these stages between the client and the server that impose different constraints on cryptographic techniques and experimental implementations. In the prepare-and-send setting, the client prepares the qubits and sends them to the server, while in the receive-and-measure setting, the client receives the qubits from the server and measures them. Although these settings have been extensively studied independently, their interrelation and whether setting-dependent theoretical constraints are inevitable remain unclear. By implementing the key components of most DQC protocols in the respective missing setting, we provide a method to build prospective protocols in both settings simultaneously and to translate existing protocols from one setting into the other.</description>

      <title>Quantum Search with a Generalized Laplacian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A single excitation in a quantum spin network described by the Heisenberg model can effect a variety of continuous-time quantum walks on unweighted graphs, including those governed by the discrete Laplacian, adjacency matrix, and signless Laplacian. In this paper, we show that the Heisenberg model can effect these three quantum walks on signed weighted graphs, as well as a generalized Laplacian equal to the discrete Laplacian plus a real-valued multiple of the degree matrix, for which the standard Laplacian, adjacency matrix, and signless Laplacian are special cases. We explore the algorithmic consequence of this generalized Laplacian quantum walk when searching a weighted barbell graph consisting of two equal-sized, unweighted cliques connected by a single signed weighted edge or bridge, with the search oracle constituting an external magnetic field in the spin network. We prove that there are two weights for the bridge (which could both be positive, both negative, or one of each, depending on the multiple of the degree matrix) that allow amplitude to cross from one clique to the other -- except for the standard and signless Laplacians that respectively only have one negative or positive weight bridge -- boosting the success probability from 0.5 to 0.820 or 0.843 for each weight. Moreover, one of the weights leads to a two-stage algorithm that further boosts the success probability to 0.996.</description>

Abstract: Quantum reservoir computing is a machine learning framework that offers ease of training compared to other quantum neural network models, as it does not rely on gradient-based optimization. Learning is performed in a single step on the output features measured from the quantum system. Various implementations of quantum reservoir computing have been explored in simulations, with different measured features. Although simulations have shown that quantum reservoirs present advantages in performance compared to classical reservoirs, experimental implementations have remained scarce. This is due to the challenge of obtaining a large number of output features that are nonlinear transformations of the input data. In this work, we propose and experimentally implement a novel quantum reservoir computing platform based on a circuit quantum electrodynamics architecture, consisting of a single cavity mode coupled to a superconducting qubit. We obtain a large number of nonlinear features from a single physical system by encoding the input data in the amplitude of a coherent drive and measuring the cavity state in the Fock basis. We demonstrate classification of two classical tasks with significantly smaller hardware resources and fewer measured features compared to classical neural networks. Our experimental results are supported by numerical simulations that show additional Kerr nonlinearity is beneficial to reservoir performance. Our work demonstrates a hardware-efficient quantum neural network implementation that can be further scaled up and generalized to other quantum machine learning models.</description>

      <title>Dipoles and Anyonic Directional Confinement via Twisted Toric Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22025v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a modified 2D toric code Hamiltonian that exhibits explicit anyon confinement along a single spatial direction. By bounding the motion of these confined anyons, we obtain dipolar excitations with restricted mobility. We analyze the resulting logical operators, whose existence depends on the system size, as well as the structure of gapped boundaries and a tensor network representation of the ground state. Furthermore, when confinement is enforced in both directions, fractal-like excitations emerge, resulting in unpaired logical operators.
  We extend our construction to 3D models, such as the surface code and the X-cube model, leading to novel dipole-loop and dipole-planon excitations that arise from bounding confined excitations. These modifications are implemented through group cohomological twistings--projective representations of finite groups--with most examples based on Z2xZ2.</description>

      <title>Atomic Dirac energy-level dynamics and redshift in the 4xU(1) gravity gauge field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitational interaction unavoidably influences atoms and their electromagnetic radiation field in strong gravitational fields. Theoretical description of such effects using the curved metric of general relativity is limited due to the classical nature of the metric and the assumption of the local inertial frame, where gravitational interaction is absent. Here we apply unified gravity extension of the Standard Model [Rep. Prog. Phys. 88, 057802 (2025)] to solve the Dirac equation for hydrogen-like atoms in the 4xU(1) gravity gauge field, which appears alongside all other quantum fields. We show that the gravity gauge field shifts the atomic Dirac energy levels by an amount that agrees with the experimentally observable gravitational redshift. Our result for the redshift follows directly from quantum field theory and is strictly independent of the metric-based explanation of general relativity. Furthermore, we present how gravitational potential gradient breaks the symmetry of the electric potential of the atomic nucleus, thus leading to splitting of otherwise degenerate spectral lines in strong gravitational fields. Enabling detailed spectral line analysis, our work opens novel possibilities for future investigations of quantum photonics phenomena in strong gravitational fields.</description>

      <title>Certifying Macroscopic Quantum Mechanics via Hypothesis Testing with Finite Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22092v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address the challenge of certifying quantum behavior with single macroscopic massive particles, subject to decoherence and finite data. We propose a hypothesis testing framework that distinguishes between classical and quantum mechanics based on position measurements. While interference pattern visibility in single-particle quantum superposition experiments has been commonly used as a sufficient criterion to falsify classical mechanics, we show that, from a hypothesis testing perspective, it is neither necessary nor efficient. Focusing on recent proposals to prepare macroscopic superposition states of levitated nanoparticles, we show that the likelihood ratio test -- which leverages differences across the entire probability distribution -- provides an exponential reduction in measurements needed to reach a given confidence level. These results offer a principled, efficient method to falsify classical mechanics in interference experiments, relaxing the experimental constraints faced by current efforts to test quantum mechanics at the macroscopic scale.</description>

      <title>Perfect quantum state transfer through a chaotic spin chain via many-body scars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.22114v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum many-body scars (QMBS) offer a mechanism for weak ergodicity breaking, enabling non-thermal dynamics to persist in a chaotic many-body system. While most studies of QMBS focus on anomalous eigenstate properties or long-lived revivals of local observables, their potential for quantum information processing remains largely unexplored. In this work, we demonstrate that \emph{perfect quantum state transfer} can be achieved in a strongly interacting, quantum chaotic spin chain by exploiting a sparse set of QMBS eigenstates embedded within an otherwise thermal spectrum. These results show that QMBS in chaotic many-body systems may be harnessed for information transport tasks typically associated with integrable models.</description>

      <title>Macroscopic theory of multipartite correlations in permutation-invariant open quantum systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.22121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Information-theoretic quantities have received significant attention as system-independent measures of correlations in many-body quantum systems, e.g., as universal order parameters of synchronization. In this work, we present a method to determine the macroscopic behavior of the steady-state multipartite mutual information between $N$ interacting units undergoing Markovian evolution that is invariant under unit permutations. Using this approach, we extend a conclusion previously drawn for classical systems that the extensive scaling of mutual information is either not possible for systems relaxing to fixed points of the mean-field dynamics or such scaling is not robust to perturbations of certain system parameters. In contrast, robust extensive scaling occurs for system relaxing to time-dependent attractors, e.g., limit cycles. We illustrate the applicability of our method on the driven-dissipative Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.22140v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Static electric fields have been suggested as a spin to orbital angular momentum converter in neutrons. Initial calculations showed that the field required to facilitate significant conversion to longitudinal orbital angular momentum is prohibitively high for lab power supplies. In this work we exploit the intra-atomic nuclear electric field in the periodic structure of perfect single crystals, specifically quartz, which can be orders of magnitude larger than lab fields. We calculate the Bragg and Laue diffracted wavefunctions of thermal neutrons and back-diffracted neutrons and demonstrate spin to orbital angular momentum conversion. Finally we report on a thermal neutron Bragg diffraction experiment from [110] quartz confirming our results.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Variational Quantum Algorithms for Multicriteria Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents methodological improvements to variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) for solving multicriteria optimization problems. We introduce two key contributions. First, we reformulate the parameter optimization task of VQAs as a multicriteria problem, enabling the direct use of classical algorithms from various multicriteria metaheuristics. This hybrid framework outperforms the corresponding single-criteria VQAs in both average and worst-case performance across diverse benchmark problems. Second, we propose a method that augments the hypervolume-based cost function with coverage-oriented indicators, allowing explicit control over the diversity of the resulting Pareto front approximations. Experimental results show that our method can improve coverage by up to 40\% with minimal loss in hypervolume. Our findings highlight the potential of combining quantum variational methods with classical population-based search to advance practical quantum optimization.</description>

      <title>Partitions in quantum theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22218v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Decompositional theories describe the ways in which a global physical system can be split into subsystems, facilitating the study of how different possible partitions of a same system interplay, e.g. in terms of inclusions or signalling. In quantum theory, subsystems are usually framed as sub-C* algebras of the algebra of operators on the global system. However, most decompositional approaches have so far restricted their scope to the case of systems corresponding to factor algebras. We argue that this is a mistake: one should cater for the possibility for non-factor subsystems, arising for instance from symmetry considerations. Building on simple examples, we motivate and present a definition of partitions into an arbitrary number of parts, each of which is a possibly non-factor sub-C* algebra. We discuss its physical interpretation and study its properties, in particular with regards to the structure of algebras' centres. We prove that partitions, defined at the C*-algebraic level, can be represented in terms of a splitting of Hilbert spaces, using the framework of routed quantum circuits. For some partitions, however, such a representation necessarily retains a residual pseudo-nonlocality. We provide an example of this behaviour, given by the partition of a fermionic system into local modes.</description>

      <title>Causal Decompositions of 1D Quantum Cellular Automata</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22219v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding quantum theory's causal structure stands out as a major matter, since it radically departs from classical notions of causality. We present advances in the research program of causal decompositions, which investigates the existence of an equivalence between the causal and the compositional structures of unitary channels. Our results concern one-dimensional Quantum Cellular Automata (1D QCAs), i.e. unitary channels over a line of $N$ quantum systems (with or without periodic boundary conditions) that feature a causality radius $r$: a given input cannot causally influence outputs at a distance more than $r$. We prove that, for $N \geq 4r + 1$, 1D QCAs all admit causal decompositions: a unitary channel is a 1D QCA if and only if it can be decomposed into a unitary routed circuit of nearest-neighbour interactions, in which its causal structure is compositionally obvious. This provides the first constructive form of 1D QCAs with causality radius one or more, fully elucidating their structure. In addition, we show that this decomposition can be taken to be translation-invariant for the case of translation-invariant QCAs. Our proof of these results makes use of innovative algebraic techniques, leveraging a new framework for capturing partitions into non-factor sub-C* algebras.</description>

      <title>End-to-end entanglement of quantum network paths with multi-parameter states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22245v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Long-range entanglement distribution in a quantum network relies on entanglement swapping at intermediate nodes along a network path to connect short-range entangled states established over the network edges. The end-to-end entanglement of a network path obtained via this process determines the utility of the network path for executing entanglement enabled tasks and for the design of entanglement routing protocols in the quantum network. Here, we study the end-to-end entanglement of paths in a quantum network when the edges are characterised by multi-parameter quantum states that may be considered to be the output of arbitrary and unknown quantum channels described by the network's edges. We find that over ensembles of multi-parameter states with fixed concurrence but varying density matrix elements, the end-to-end entanglement takes a range of values upper bounded by a function of the concurrence of the network-edge states. The scaling behaviour of the average end-to-end entanglement reveals that its distribution gets increasingly concentrated around the mean as the paths become longer. For a network path of a given length, the average end-to-end entanglement vanishes for edge concurrence values below a threshold that increases with the path-length. Whereas, for edge concurrence values greater than the threshold the average end-to-end entanglement increases faster with the length of the path. As an implication of our results, we show that the optimal path for entanglement distribution between a pair of end nodes, connected by alternate paths with multi-parameter states along the edges, can be indeterminate given only entanglement guarantees along the network edges.</description>

      <title>Excited States from ADAPT-VQE convergence path in Many-Body Problems: application to nuclear pairing problem and $H_4$ molecule dissociation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A quantum computing algorithm is proposed to obtain low-lying excited states in many-body interacting systems. The approximate eigenstates are obtained by using a quantum space diagonalization method in a subspace of states selected from the convergence path of the ADAPT-VQE (adaptive derivative-assembled pseudo-Trotter Ansatz variational quantum eigensolver) towards the ground state of the many-body problem. This method is shown to be accurate with only a small overhead in terms of quantum resources required to get the ground state. We also show that the quantum algorithm might be used to facilitate the convergence of the ADAPT-VQE method itself. Successful applications of the technique are made to like-particle pairing as well as neutron-proton pairing. Finally, the $H_4$ molecule's dissociation also illustrates the technique, demonstrating its accuracy and versatility.</description>

      <title>Translating Bell Non-Locality to Prepare-and-Measure Scenarios under Dimensional Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22282v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the connections between different quantum information protocols has been proven fruitful for both theoretical insights and experimental applications. In this work, we explore the relationship between non-local and prepare-and-measure scenarios, proposing a systematic way to translate bipartite Bell inequalities into dimensionally-bounded prepare-and-measure tasks. We identify sufficient conditions under which the translation preserves the quantum bound and self-testing properties, enabling a wide range of certification protocols originally developed for the non-local setting to be adapted to the sequential framework of prepare-and-measure with a dimensional bound. While the dimensionality bound is not device-independent, it still is a practical and experimentally reasonable assumption in many cases of interest. In some instances, we find new experimentally-friendly certification protocols. In others, we demonstrate equivalences with already known prepare-and-measure protocols, where self-testing results were previously established using alternative mathematical methods. Our results unify different quantum correlation frameworks, and contribute to the ongoing research effort of studying the interplay between parallel and sequential protocols.</description>

      <title>Daemonic ergotropy of Gaussian quantum states and the role of measurement-induced purification via general-dyne detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: According to the Maxwell demon paradigm, additional work can be extracted from a classical or quantum system by exploiting information obtained through measurements on a correlated ancillary system. In the quantum setting, the maximum work extractable via unitary operations in such measurement-assisted protocols is referred to as daemonic ergotropy. In this work, we explore this concept in the context of continuous-variable quantum systems, focusing on Gaussian states and general-dyne (Gaussian) measurements. We derive a general expression for the daemonic ergotropy and examine two key scenarios: (i) bipartite Gaussian states where a general-dyne measurement is performed on one of the two parties, and (ii) open Gaussian quantum systems under continuous general-dyne monitoring of the environment. Remarkably, we show that for single-mode Gaussian states, the ergotropy depends solely on the state's energy and purity. This enables us to express the daemonic ergotropy as a simple function of the unconditional energy and the purity of the conditional states, revealing that enhanced daemonic work extraction is directly linked to measurement-induced purification. We illustrate our findings through two paradigmatic examples: extracting daemonic work from a two-mode squeezed thermal state and from a continuously monitored optical parametric oscillator. In both case we identify the optimal general-dyne strategies that maximize the conditional purity and, in turn, the daemonic ergotropy.</description>

      <title>Maximal intrinsic randomness of noisy quantum measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22294v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum physics exhibits an intrinsic and private form of randomness with no classical counterpart. Any setup for quantum randomness generation involves measurements acting on quantum states. In this work, we consider the following question: Given a quantum measurement, how much randomness can be generated from it? In real life, measurements are noisy and thus contain an additional, extrinsic form of randomness due to ignorance. This extrinsic randomness is not private since, in an adversarial model, it takes the form of quantum side information held by an eavesdropper who can use it to predict the measurement outcomes. Randomness of measurements is then quantified by the guessing probability of this eavesdropper, when minimized over all possible input states. This optimization is in general hard to compute, but we solve it here for any two-outcome qubit measurement and for projective measurements in arbitrary dimension mixed with white noise. We also construct, for a given measured probability distribution, different realizations with (i) a noisy state and noiseless measurement (ii) a noiseless state and noisy measurement and (iii) a noisy state and measurement, and we show that the latter gives an eavesdropper significantly higher guessing power.</description>

      <title>Trainability of Parametrised Linear Combinations of Unitaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22310v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A principal concern in the optimisation of parametrised quantum circuits is the presence of barren plateaus, which present fundamental challenges to the scalability of applications, such as variational algorithms and quantum machine learning models. Recent proposals for these methods have increasingly used the linear combination of unitaries (LCU) procedure as a core component. In this work, we prove that an LCU of trainable parametrised circuits is still trainable. We do so by analytically deriving the expression for the variance of the expectation when applying the LCU to a set of parametrised circuits, taking into account the postselection probability. These results extend to incoherent superpositions. We support our conclusions with numerical results on linear combinations of fermionic Gaussian unitaries (matchgate circuits). Our work shows that sums of trainable parametrised circuits are still trainable, and thus provides a method to construct new families of more expressive trainable circuits. We argue that there is a scope for a quantum speed-up when evaluating these trainable circuits on a quantum device.</description>

      <title>Robust quantum reservoir computers for forecasting chaotic dynamics: generalized synchronization and stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22335v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that recurrent quantum reservoir computers (QRCs) and their recurrence-free architectures (RF-QRCs) are robust tools for learning and forecasting chaotic dynamics from time-series data. First, we formulate and interpret quantum reservoir computers as coupled dynamical systems, where the reservoir acts as a response system driven by training data; in other words, quantum reservoir computers are generalized-synchronization (GS) systems. Second, we show that quantum reservoir computers can learn chaotic dynamics and their invariant properties, such as Lyapunov spectra, attractor dimensions, and geometric properties such as the covariant Lyapunov vectors. This analysis is enabled by deriving the Jacobian of the quantum reservoir update. Third, by leveraging tools from generalized synchronization, we provide a method for designing robust quantum reservoir computers. We propose the criterion $GS=ESP$: GS implies the echo state property (ESP), and vice versa. We analytically show that RF-QRCs, by design, fulfill $GS=ESP$. Finally, we analyze the effect of simulated noise. We find that dissipation from noise enhances the robustness of quantum reservoir computers. Numerical verifications on systems of different dimensions support our conclusions. This work opens opportunities for designing robust quantum machines for chaotic time series forecasting on near-term quantum hardware.</description>

      <title>QuKAN: A Quantum Circuit Born Machine approach to Quantum Kolmogorov Arnold Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22340v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kolmogorov Arnold Networks (KANs), built upon the Kolmogorov Arnold representation theorem (KAR), have demonstrated promising capabilities in expressing complex functions with fewer neurons. This is achieved by implementing learnable parameters on the edges instead of on the nodes, unlike traditional networks such as Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs). However, KANs potential in quantum machine learning has not yet been well explored. In this work, we present an implementation of these KAN architectures in both hybrid and fully quantum forms using a Quantum Circuit Born Machine (QCBM). We adapt the KAN transfer using pre-trained residual functions, thereby exploiting the representational power of parametrized quantum circuits. In the hybrid model we combine classical KAN components with quantum subroutines, while the fully quantum version the entire architecture of the residual function is translated to a quantum model. We demonstrate the feasibility, interpretability and performance of the proposed Quantum KAN (QuKAN) architecture.</description>

      <title>Linearization Scheme of Shallow Water Equations for Quantum Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22345v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Computational fluid dynamics lies at the heart of many issues in science and engineering, but solving the associated partial differential equations remains computationally demanding. With the rise of quantum computing, new approaches have emerged to address these challenges. In this work, we investigate the potential of quantum algorithms for solving the shallow water equations, which are, for example, used to model tsunami dynamics. By extending a linearization scheme previously developed in [Phys. Rev. Research 7, 013036 (2025)] for the Navier-Stokes equations, we create a mapping from the nonlinear shallow water equation to a linear system of equations, which, in principle, can be solved exponentially faster on a quantum device than on a classical computer. To validate our approach, we compare its results to an analytical solution and benchmark its dependence on key parameters. Additionally, we implement a quantum linear system solver based on quantum singular value transformation and study its performance in connection to our mapping. Our results demonstrate the potential of applying quantum algorithms to fluid dynamics problems and highlight necessary considerations for future developments.</description>

      <title>Making Non-Markovian master equations accessible with approximate environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate and efficient simulation of open quantum systems remains a significant challenge, particularly for Non-Markovian dynamics. We demonstrate the profound utility of expressing the environmental correlation function as a sum of damped sinusoidals within master equations. While not strictly required, this decomposition offers substantial benefits, crucially reducing the cost of Lamb-shift and decay rates calculations without sacrificing accuracy. Furthermore, this approach enables straightforward calculation of Lamb-shift corrections, bypassing the need for complex principal value integration. We show that these Lamb-shift effects are demonstrably non-negligible in heat transport scenarios, and are needed for an accurate description. Unlike in the Gorini-Kossakowski-Lindblad-Sudarshan(GKLS) master equation, the non-commuting nature of the Lamb-shift with the Hamiltonian in non-Markovian descriptions, coupled with GKLS's inaccuracies at early times, brings the necessity of Non-Markovian descriptions for finite-time thermodynamics. In the weak coupling regime, our Master Equation formulations with exponential decomposition achieve accuracy comparable to numerically exact methods. This methodology significantly simplifies and accelerates the simulation of non-Markovian dynamics in open quantum systems, offering a more reliable and computationally tractable alternative akin to a Global Master Equation.</description>

      <title>Selective filtering of multi-photon events from a single-photon emitter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Single-photon purity is one of the most important key metrics of many quantum states of light. For applications in photonic quantum technologies, e.g. quantum communication and linear optical quantum computing, a minimization of the multi-photon error rate is required because of its error-introducing nature. Ultimately, the purity of state-of-the-art single-photon sources was found to be limited by spontaneous emission and subsequent reexcitation during the interaction with the driving field. Here, we demonstrate that even this fundamental limit to the single-photon purity can be overcome due to the distinct spectro-temporal properties of the individual photons forming multi-photon errors. For driving pulses shorter than the emitter lifetime, we find that photons emitted during the pulse exhibit a significantly broader spectral shape than the emitter's natural linewidth. Thus, we can selectively filter out the majority of this instantaneously emitted photon by employing narrowband spectral filters which reduces the measured degree of second-order coherence at zero time delay by almost one order of magnitude. This enables a significant suppression of the multi-photon error rate without detrimental effects on the desired single-photon emission.</description>

      <title>Spin squeezing generation in atom-cavity systems: on the effects of adiabatic elimination beyond the leading order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin-squeezed states are a prototypical example of metrologically useful quantum states where structured entanglement allows for enhanced sensing with respect to the one possible using classically correlated particles. Relevant aspects are both the efficient preparation of spin-squeezed states and the scalability of estimation precision with the number $N$ of probes. Recently, in the context of the generation of spin-squeezed states via coupling of three-level atoms to an optical cavity, it was shown that increasing the atom-cavity coupling can be detrimental to spin-squeezing generation, an effect that is not appreciated in the standard second-order cavity removal approximation. We describe adiabatic elimination techniques to derive an effective Lindblad master equation up to third order for the atomic degrees of freedom. We then show through numerical simulations that the spin-squeezing scalability loss is correctly reproduced by the reduced open system dynamics, pinpointing the relevant role of higher order contributions.</description>

      <title>Ground-state reachability for variational quantum eigensolvers: a Rydberg-atom case study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As quantum computing progresses, variational quantum eigensolvers (VQE) for ground-state preparation have become an attractive option in leveraging current quantum hardware. However, a major challenge in implementing VQE is understanding whether a given quantum system can even reach the target ground state. In this work, we study reachability conditions for VQE by analyzing their inherent symmetries. We consider a Rydberg-atom quantum simulator with global controls and evaluate its ability to reach ground states for Ising and Heisenberg target Hamiltonians. Symmetry-based conclusions for a smaller number of qubits are corroborated by VQE simulations, demonstrating the reliability of our approach in predicting whether a given quantum architecture could successfully reach the ground state. Our framework also suggests approaches to overcome symmetry restrictions by adding additional quantum resources or choosing different initial states, offering practical guidance for implementing VQE in quantum simulation architectures. Finally, we illustrate connections to adiabatic state preparation.</description>

      <title>Quantum-Classical Auxiliary Field Quantum Monte Carlo with Matchgate Shadows on Trapped Ion Quantum Computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate an end-to-end workflow to model chemical reaction barriers with the quantum-classical auxiliary field quantum Monte Carlo (QC-AFQMC) algorithm with quantum tomography using matchgate shadows. The workflow operates within an accelerated quantum supercomputing environment with the IonQ Forte quantum computer and NVIDIA GPUs on Amazon Web Services. We present several algorithmic innovations and an efficient GPU-accelerated execution, which achieves a several orders of magnitude speedup over the state-of-the-art implementation of QC-AFQMC. We apply the algorithm to simulate the oxidative addition step of the nickel-catalyzed Suzuki-Miyaura reaction using 24 qubits of IonQ Forte with 16 qubits used to represent the trial state, plus 8 additional ancilla qubits for error mitigation, resulting in the largest QC-AFQMC with matchgate shadow experiments ever performed on quantum hardware. We achieve a $9\times$ speedup in collecting matchgate circuit measurements, and our distributed-parallel post-processing implementation attains a $656\times$ time-to-solution improvement over the prior state-of-the-art. Chemical reaction barriers for the model reaction evaluated with active-space QC-AFQMC are within the uncertainty interval of $\pm4$ kcal/mol from the reference CCSD(T) result when matchgates are sampled on the ideal simulator and within 10 kcal/mol from reference when measured on QPU. This work marks a step towards practical quantum chemistry simulations on quantum devices while identifying several opportunities for further development.</description>

      <title>Universal Quantum Computational Spectroscopy on a Quantum Chip</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.22418v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spectroscopy underpins modern scientific discovery across diverse disciplines. While experimental spectroscopy probes material properties through scattering or radiation measurements, computational spectroscopy combines theoretical models with experimental data to predict spectral properties, essential for advancements in physics, chemistry, and materials science. However, quantum systems present unique challenges for computational spectroscopy due to their inherent complexity, and current quantum algorithms remain largely limited to static and closed quantum systems. Here, we present and demonstrate a universal quantum computational spectroscopy framework that lifts these limitations. Through leveraging coherently controlled quantum dynamics, our method efficiently reconstructs the spectral information for both closed and open systems, furtherly for time-dependent driven systems. We experimentally validate this approach using a programmable silicon-photonic quantum processing chip, capable of high-fidelity time-evolution simulations. The versatility of our framework is demonstrated through spectroscopic computations for diverse quantum systems -- including spin systems, non-Hermitian systems, and quantum Floquet systems -- revealing novel phenomena such as parity-time symmetry breaking and topological holonomy that are inaccessible to conventional spectroscopy or quantum eigenstate algorithms. {Furthermore, systematic benchmarking of UQCS against existing quantum algorithms is numerically performed to demonstrate its unprecedented capabilities and superior performance. This work establishes a noise-robust and transformative paradigm for quantum spectral analysis.</description>

      <title>General many-body entanglement swapping protocol</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22430v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sharing entangled pairs between non-signaling parties via entanglement swapping constitutes a striking demonstration of the nonlocality of quantum mechanics and a crucial building block for future quantum technologies. In this work, we generalize pair-swapping methods by introducing a many-body entanglement swapping protocol, which allows two non-signaling parties to share general many-body states along an arbitrary partitioning. The shared many-body state retains exactly the same Schmidt vectors as the target state and exhibits typically high fidelity, which approaches unity as the variance of the Schmidt coefficients vanishes. The cost of many-body swapping - arising from postselection in a third-party measurement - is determined by the 3rd R\'enyi entanglement entropy of the partitioning. We provide a proof of concept of the protocol on real quantum hardware and discuss how it enables new functionalities, such as flexible sharing of complex multi-qubit states and fault-tolerant entanglement swapping.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.22436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Lindblad master equation is a foundational tool for modeling the dynamics of open quantum systems. As its use has extended far beyond its original domain, the boundaries of its validity have grown opaque. In particular, the rise of new research areas including open quantum many-body systems, non-equilibrium condensed matter, and the possibility to test its limits in driven-open quantum simulators, call for a critical revision of its regimes of applicability. In this pedagogical review, we re-examine the folklore surrounding its three standard approximations (Born, Markov, and Rotating Wave Approximation), as we build our narrative by employing a series of examples and case studies accessible to any reader with a solid background on the fundamentals of quantum mechanics. As a synthesis of our work, we offer a checklist that contrasts common lore with refined expectations, offering a practical guideline for assessing the breakdown of the Lindblad framework in the problem at hand.</description>

      <title>Multi-agent Markov Entanglement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.02385v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Value decomposition has long been a fundamental technique in multi-agent dynamic programming and reinforcement learning (RL). Specifically, the value function of a global state $(s_1,s_2,\ldots,s_N)$ is often approximated as the sum of local functions: $V(s_1,s_2,\ldots,s_N)\approx\sum_{i=1}^N V_i(s_i)$. This approach traces back to the index policy in restless multi-armed bandit problems and has found various applications in modern RL systems. However, the theoretical justification for why this decomposition works so effectively remains underexplored.
  In this paper, we uncover the underlying mathematical structure that enables value decomposition. We demonstrate that a multi-agent Markov decision process (MDP) permits value decomposition if and only if its transition matrix is not "entangled" -- a concept analogous to quantum entanglement in quantum physics. Drawing inspiration from how physicists measure quantum entanglement, we introduce how to measure the "Markov entanglement" for multi-agent MDPs and show that this measure can be used to bound the decomposition error in general multi-agent MDPs.
  Using the concept of Markov entanglement, we proved that a widely-used class of index policies is weakly entangled and enjoys a sublinear $\mathcal O(\sqrt{N})$ scale of decomposition error for $N$-agent systems. Finally, we show how Markov entanglement can be efficiently estimated in practice, providing practitioners with an empirical proxy for the quality of value decomposition.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Holography in Quantum Phases via Twisted R\'enyi-N Correlators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10076v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a holographic framework for the entanglement Hamiltonian in symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases with area-law entanglement, whose reduced density matrix $\rho \propto e^{-H_e}$ can be treated as a lower-dimensional mixed state. By replicating $\rho$, we reconstruct the fixed-point SPT wavefunction, establishing an exact correspondence between the bulk strange correlator of the (d+1)-dimensional SPT state and the twisted R\'enyi-N operator of the d-dimensional reduced density matrix. Notably, the reduced density matrix exhibits long-range or quasi-long-range order along the replica direction, revealing a universal entanglement feature in SPT phases. As a colloary, we generalized the framework of twisted R\'enyi-N correlator to thermal states and open quantum systems, providing an alternative formulation of the Lieb-Schultz-Mattis theorem, applicable to both closed and open systems. Finally, we extend our protocol to mixed-state SPT phases and introduce new quantum information metrics -- twisted R\'enyi-N correlators of the surgery operator -- to characterize the topology of mixed states.</description>

      <title>A Deterministic Model of Free Will</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21553v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The issue of whether we make decisions freely has vexed philosophers for millennia, Resolving this is vital for solving a diverse range of problems, from the physiology of how the brain makes decisions (and how we assign moral responsibility to those decisions) to the interpretation of experiments on entangled quantum particles. A deterministic model of free will is developed, based on two concepts. The first generalises the notion of initialisation of nonlinear systems where information cascades upscale from the Planck scale, exemplified by the chaology of colliding billiard balls, and featured in the author's Rational Quantum Mechanics. With `just-in-time' initialisation, such Planck-scale information is only initialised when it is needed to describe super-Planck scale evolution, and not e.g., at the time of the Big Bang. In this way determinism does not imply predestination and a system with finitely many degrees of freedom can shadow a system with infinitely many, over arbitrarily long timescales. The second concept describes the upscale control of such Planck-scale information on super-Planck scales and is illustrated by reference to stochastic rounding in numerical analysis. Using these concepts, a deterministic model is proposed whereby freely-made decisions are made by using past experiences to control the impact of noise in the low-energy brain. It is claimed that such a model has evolutionary advantages, not least preventing paralysis by analysis and encouraging rational risk taking. It is concluded that humans have free will, determinism notwithstanding. The model is applied to study the foundational issue of free choice in quantum physics experiments: it is shown that violating the Measurement Independence assumption does not invalidate the free-will conclusion above.</description>

      <title>Quantum Theory of Optical Spin Texture in Chiral Tellurium Lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21610v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The absence of inversion symmetry in chiral tellurium (Te) creates exotic spin textures within its electron waves. However, understanding textured optical waves within Te remains a challenge due to the semi-classical limitations of long-wavelength approximation. To unveil these textured optical waves, we develop a spin-resolved deep-microscopic optical bandstructure for Te analogous to its electronic counterpart. We demonstrate that the degeneracies in this optical bandstructure is lifted by the twisted lattice of Te, which induces optical gyrotropy. Our theory shows excellent agreement with experimental optical gyrotropy measurements. At the lattice level, we reveal that the chirality of Te manifests as deep-microscopic optical spin texture within the optical wave. Our framework uncovers the finite-momentum origin of optical activity and provides a microscopic basis for light-matter interactions in chiral crystalline materials.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous Quantum Turbulence in a Newborn Bose-Einstein Condensate via the Kibble-Zurek Mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21670v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Kibble-Zurek mechanism (KZM) predicts the spontaneous formation of topological defects in a continuous phase transition driven at a finite rate. We propose the generation of spontaneous quantum turbulence (SQT) via the KZM during Bose-Einstein condensation induced by a thermal quench. Using numerical simulations of the stochastic projected Gross-Pitaevskii equation in two spatial dimensions, we describe the formation of a newborn Bose-Einstein condensate proliferated by quantum vortices. We establish the nonequilibrium universality of SQT through the Kibble-Zurek and Kolmogorov scaling of the incompressible kinetic energy.</description>

      <title>Focused Sampling for Low-Cost and Accurate Ehrenfest Modeling of Cavity Quantum Electrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21702v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An economic modeling approach for cavity quantum electrodynamics is provided by mean-field dynamics, wherein the optical field is described classically while a self-consistent interaction with quantum emitters is incorporated through the Ehrenfest theorem. However, conventional implementations of mean-field dynamics are known to suffer from a catastrophic leakage of zero-point energy, to lose accuracy in the short-cavity limit, and to require large numbers of trajectories to be sampled. Here, we address these three shortcomings within a single integrated approach. This approach builds on our recently-proposed modification of the Ehrenfest theorem, referred to as decoupled mean-field (DC-MF) dynamics, in combination with a focused sampling scheme that enforces zero-point energy at the single-trajectory level. The approach is shown to yield high accuracy in both short and long-cavity limits while reaching convergence within a minimal amount of trajectories.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.21736v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The thermodynamics of the interacting system of relativistic particles and antiparticles in the presence of a Bose-Einstein condensate was investigated within the framework of the mean-field model. It is assumed that the total isospin (charge) density is conserved. We show that, depending on the strength of the interaction, a bosonic particle-antiparticle system exhibits four types of phase transitions to the condensate phase. Three types correspond to the second-order phase transition, while one is a first-order phase transition.</description>

      <title>Excitation-detector principle and the algebraic theory of planon-only abelian fracton orders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21773v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study abelian planon-only fracton orders: a class of three-dimensional (3d) gapped quantum phases in which all fractional excitations are abelian particles restricted to move in planes with a common normal direction. In such systems, the mathematical data encoding fusion and statistics comprises a finitely generated module over a Laurent polynomial ring $\mathbb{Z}[t^\pm]$ equipped with a quadratic form giving the topological spin. The principle of remote detectability requires that every planon braids nontrivially with another planon. While this is a necessary condition for physical realizability, we observe - via a simple example - that it is not sufficient. This leads us to propose the $\textit{excitation-detector principle}$ as a general feature of gapped quantum matter. For planon-only fracton orders, the principle requires that every detector - defined as a string of planons extending infinitely in the normal direction - braids nontrivially with some finite excitation. We prove this additional constraint is satisfied precisely by perfect theories of excitations - those whose quadratic form induces a perfect Hermitian form. To justify the excitation-detector principle, we consider the 2d abelian anyon theory obtained by spatially compactifying a planon-only fracton order in a transverse direction. We prove the compactified 2d theory is modular if and only if the original 3d theory is perfect, showing that the excitation-detector principle gives a necessary condition for physical realizability that we conjecture is also sufficient. A key ingredient is a structure theorem for finitely generated torsion-free modules over $\mathbb{Z}_{p^k} [t^\pm]$, where $p$ is prime and $k$ a natural number. Finally, as a first step towards classifying perfect theories of excitations, we prove that every theory of prime fusion order is equivalent to decoupled layers of 2d abelian anyon theories.</description>

      <title>A note on a classical dynamical system and its quantization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.21989v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a recent paper a slightly modified version of the Bateman system, originally proposed to describe a damped harmonic oscillator, was proposed. This system is really different from the Bateman's one, in the sense that this latter cannot be recovered for any choice of its parameters. In this paper we consider this system and we show that, at a quantum level, it is not necessarily dissipative. In particular we show that the Hamiltonian of the system, when quantized, produces different behaviors, depending on some relations between its parameters. In fact, it gives rise to either a two dimensional (standard) harmonic oscillator, or to two independent oscillators, one of which is again {\em standard}, and a second one which is an inverted oscillator. The two cases are analyzed in terms of bosonic or pseudo-bosonic ladder operators, and the appearance of distributions for the inverted oscillator is commented.</description>

      <title>Observation of entanglement in a cold atom analog of cosmological preheating</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.22024v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We observe entanglement between collective excitations of a Bose-Einstein condensate in a configuration analogous to particle production during the preheating phase of the early universe. In our setup, the oscillation of the inflaton field is mimicked by the transverse breathing mode of a cigar-shaped condensate, which parametrically excites longitudinal quasiparticles with opposite momenta. After a short modulation period, we observe entanglement of these pairs which demonstrates that vacuum fluctuations seeded the parametric growth, confirming the quantum origin of the excitations. As the system continues to evolve, we observe a decrease in correlations and a disappearance of non-classical features, pointing towards future experimental probes of the less understood interaction-dominated regime.</description>

      <title>Microscopic approach to the quantized light-matter interaction in semiconductor nanostructures: Complex coupled dynamics of excitons, biexcitons, and photons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22220v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a microscopic and fully quantized model to investigate the interaction between semiconductor nanostructures and quantum light fields including the many-body Coloumb interaction between photoexcited electrons and holes. Our approach describes the coupled dynamics of the quantum light field and single and double electron-hole pairs, i.e., excitons and biexcitons, and exactly accounts for Coulomb many-body correlations and carrier band dispersions. Using a simplified yet exact approach, we study a one-dimensional two-band system interacting with a single-mode, two-photon quantum state within a Tavis$\unicode{x2013}$Cummings framework. By employing an exact coherent factorization scheme, the computational complexity is reduced significantly enabling numerical simulations. We also derive a simplified model which includes only the bound $1s$-exciton and biexciton states for comparison. Our simulations reveal distinct single- and two-photon Rabi oscillations, corresponding to photon-exciton and exciton-biexciton transitions. We demonstrate, in particular, that biexciton continuum states significantly modify the dynamics in a way that cannot be captured by simplified models which consider only bound states. Our findings emphasize the importance of a comprehensive microscopic modeling in order to accurately describe quantum optical phenomena of interacting electronic many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Controllable Non-reciprocity in Multi-sphere Loaded Chiral Resonator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.22230v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cavity magnonics explores the hybridization of photons and magnons within microwave resonators. One of the hallmarks of these systems is their ability to exhibit non-reciprocity, which is a key feature for radio frequency (RF) applications. One way to control non-reciprocal behaviors in cavity magnonics is the design of chiral cavities that allow selective coupling between photons and magnons depending on their polarization. However, a built-in chiral platform to harness and control non-reciprocity remains to be achieved. Here, we experimentally demonstrate controllable non-reciprocity (with an absolute isolation ratio reaching 46 dB) in a chiral resonator loaded with multiple yttrium iron garnet spheres. We develop a theoretical model of the S-parameters based on input-output formalism which highlights the links between the phases occurring in the system and its non-reciprocal behavior. Controllable non-reciprocity in cavity magnonics could enable the development of programmable isolators, circulators, and RF switches with improved performance. Such developments could pave the way toward more versatile and scalable information processing systems.</description>

      <title>Boosting Classification with Quantum-Inspired Augmentations</title>

Abstract: Understanding the impact of small quantum gate perturbations, which are common in quantum digital devices but absent in classical computers, is crucial for identifying potential advantages in quantum machine learning. While these perturbations are typically seen as detrimental to quantum computation, they can actually enhance performance by serving as a natural source of data augmentation. Additionally, they can often be efficiently simulated on classical hardware, enabling quantum-inspired approaches to improve classical machine learning methods. In this paper, we investigate random Bloch sphere rotations, which are fundamental SU(2) transformations, as a simple yet effective quantum-inspired data augmentation technique. Unlike conventional augmentations such as flipping, rotating, or cropping, quantum transformations lack intuitive spatial interpretations, making their application to tasks like image classification less straightforward. While common quantum augmentation methods rely on applying quantum models or trainable quanvolutional layers to classical datasets, we focus on the direct application of small-angle Bloch rotations and their effect on classical data. Using the large-scale ImageNet dataset, we demonstrate that our quantum-inspired augmentation method improves image classification performance, increasing Top-1 accuracy by 3%, Top-5 accuracy by 2.5%, and the F$_1$ score from 8% to 12% compared to standard classical augmentation methods. Finally, we examine the use of stronger unitary augmentations. Although these transformations preserve information in principle, they result in visually unrecognizable images with potential applications for privacy computations. However, we show that our augmentation approach and simple SU(2) transformations do not enhance differential privacy and discuss the implications of this limitation.</description>

      <title>Investigation of three-body F\"orster resonance for various spatial configurations of the three interacting Rubidium Rydberg atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22259v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Three-body F\"orster resonances controlled by a dc electric field are of interest for the implementation of three-qubit quantum gates with single atoms captured in optical traps and laser-excited into strongly interacting Rydberg states. In Ref. [P. Cheinet et al., Quantum Electronics 50(3), 213 (2020)], we proposed and analyzed a new type of three-body F\"orster resonance ${\rm 3}\times nP_{3/2} \to nS_{1/2} +(n+1)S_{1/2} +nP_{1/2}$ that can be realized with Rb Rydberg atoms for an arbitrary principal quantum number $n$. Its peculiarity is that the third atom goes into a state with a total angular moment $J=1/2$, which has no Stark structure, so two-body F\"orster resonances are completely absent. In the present work, an extended theoretical study of this three-body F\"orster resonance is performed for various spatial configurations of three interacting Rb Rydberg atoms and conditions for their experimental implementation are determined. It was found that one of the resonances has a weak dependence of the resonant electric field on the distance between atoms and is therefore most suitable for performing experiments to observe coherent oscillations of populations of collective three-body states and implement three-qubit quantum gates based on them.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.22265v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The mechanism by which odorants are recognized by olfactory receptors remains primarily unresolved. While charge transport is believed to play a significant role, its precise nature is still unclear. Here, we present a novel perspective by exploring the interplay between the intrinsic energy scales of odorant molecules and the gap states that facilitate intermolecular charge transport. We find that odorants act as weak tunneling conductors mainly because of the limited magnitude of electronic coupling. This behavior is further connected to electron-phonon interactions and reorganization energy, suggesting that physically meaningful values for these parameters emerge only in the deep off-resonant tunneling regime. These findings complement the swipe card model of olfaction, in which an odorant needs both the right shape to bind to a receptor and the correct vibrational frequency to trigger signal transduction. Moreover, they reveal that the underlying mechanisms are much more complex than previously assumed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.22290v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a dynamical protocol to probe the rigidity and phase coherence of dipolar supersolids by merging initially separated fragments in quasi-one-dimensional (1D) double-well potentials. Simulations based on the extended Gross-Pitaevskii equation reveal distinct dynamical signatures across phases. Supersolids exhibit damped crystal oscillations following barrier removal, with the damping rate reflecting superfluid connectivity. A phase-imprinted jump additionally triggers metastable dark solitons, which excites second sound, as revealed by an out-of-phase drift between the droplet lattice and the superfluid background. Our results show a realizable path to dynamically detect the second sound and rigidity of supersolids, as well as to realize and probe soliton formation.</description>

      <title>Dissipative Kondo physics in the Anderson Impurity Model with two-body losses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22302v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a dissipative version of the Anderson Impurity model, where an interacting impurity is coupled to a fermionic reservoir and exposed to Markovian dissipation in the form of two-body losses. Using a self-consistent hybridization expansion based on the Non-Crossing Approximation (NCA) we compute the dynamics of the impurity, its steady-state and spectral function. We show that the interplay between strong Coulomb repulsion and correlated dissipation gives rise to robust signatures of Kondo physics both at weak and strong losses. These include a strongly suppressed spin relaxation rate, displaying a characteristic Kondo-Zeno crossover and a spectral function where doublon band is quickly destroyed by dissipation while the coherent Kondo peak remains visible for weak losses, then disappears at intermediate values and finally re-emerge as the system enters in the Kondo-Zeno regime. As compared to the case of single particle losses we show that two-body dissipation protects Kondo physics. The picture obtained with NCA is confirmed by numerical simulations of exact dynamics on finite-size chains. We interpret these results using a dissipative Schrieffer-Wolff transformation, which leads to an effective Kondo model with residual impurity-bath losses which are suppressed by strong correlations or strong losses.</description>

Abstract: Correcting astigmatism and ellipticity in laser beams is critical for improving performance in many applications like microscopy, atomic physics, quantum information processing, and advanced manufacturing. Passive correction methods based on cylindrical lens telescopes require choosing lenses with precise focal lengths, effectively limiting the range of tunability when using standard catalog optics. Active solutions based on diffractive optical elements can achieve superior performance, but they are bulky, expensive, and suffer from finite diffraction efficiency and added complexity. Here, we introduce a simple method to convert astigmatic elliptical beams into circular Gaussian beams without astigmatism. Our method comprises three cylindrical lenses. The first lens focuses the beam along its major axis to create a plane where the intensity profile is radially symmetric. The second and third lenses are placed one behind the other in that plane at a relative angle, acting as a biaxial lens pair with tunable focal lengths. By adjusting the relative angle of the lenses, the two separate beam waists of the astigmatic beam can be overlapped, resulting in a circular Gaussian beam without astigmatism. We theoretically validate our method, numerically quantify its robustness to experimental imperfections, and experimentally demonstrate its ability to circularize the output beam of a commercial laser source. Our method corrects astigmatism and ellipticity in laser beams without requiring precise focal length matching, offering greater flexibility than other passive solutions and greater cost-effectiveness than active methods. Its simple and compact design makes it well suited for integration into both tabletop optical setups and industrial systems.</description>

      <title>Characteristic solutions of the chain of Vlasov equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22377v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A new method has been presented of constructing a class of exact solutions of an infinite self-linking chain of the Vlasov equations for distribution functions of kinematic quantities of all orders. Using the characteristic transformation of variables proposed in this paper, any equation from the Vlasov chain can be reduced to the mathematical form of the first Vlasov equation. Since the solution of the first Vlasov equation can be found by the solution of the Schr\"odinger equation, the authors have proposed an algorithm for constructing characteristic solutions for an arbitrary equation from the Vlasov chain. The proposed method of construction of exact solutions has been successfully implemented on an example of time-dependent quantum system with thermodynamic parameter in the form of inverse temperature. These found exact solutions are also applicable to quantum dot systems.</description>

      <title>Decoherence of Majorana qubits by 1/f noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22394v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Qubits based on Majorana Zero Modes (MZMs) in superconductor-semiconductor nanowires have attracted intense interest as a platform for utility-scale quantum computing. These qubits have been predicted to show extremely low error rates due to topological protection of the MZMs, where decoherence processes have been thought to be exponentially suppressed by either the nanowire length or the temperature. However, here we show that 1/f noise, which is ubiquitous in semiconductors, gives rise to a previously unexplored mechanism for Majorana qubit decoherence. The high frequency components of this noise causes quasiparticle excitations in the bulk of the topological superconductor, which in turn result in qubit errors that increase with the length of the nanowire. We calculate the probability of quasiparticle excitation for disorder-free nanowires in the presence of 1/f noise and show that this mechanism limits the decoherence times of the MZM qubits currently being developed to less than a microsecond even for perfectly uniform nanowires with no disorder. This decoherence time is significantly shorter than the time to implement quantum gates using this technology and is also shorter than the decoherence times of qubits in other leading solid-state architectures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.13068v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate that perfect state transfer can be achieved in an optical waveguide lattice governed by a Hamiltonian with modulated nearest-neighbor couplings. In particular, we report the condition that the evolution Hamiltonian should satisfy to achieve perfect transfer of any continuous variable input state. The states that can be transmitted need not have any specific properties - they may be pure or mixed, Gaussian or non-Gaussian in character, and comprise an arbitrary number of modes. We illustrate that the proposed protocol is scalable to two- and three-dimensional waveguide geometries. With the help of local phase gates on all the modes, our results can also be applied to realize a SWAP gate between mirror-symmetric modes about the center of the waveguide setup.</description>

Abstract: Macroscopic quantum superpositions of massive objects are deeply interesting as they have a number of potential applications ranging from the exploration of the interaction of gravity with quantum mechanics to quantum sensing, quantum simulation, and computation. In this letter, we propose two related schemes to prepare a spatial superposition of massive quantum oscillator systems with high Q-factor via a superposition of magnetic forces. In the first method, we propose a large spatial superposition of a levitated spherical magnet generated via magnetic forces applied by adjacent flux qubits. We find that in this method the spatial superposition extent ($\Delta z$) is independent of the size of the particle. In the second method, we propose a large spatial superposition of a magnetically levitated (using the Meissner effect) flux qubit, generated via driving the levitated qubit inductively. In both schemes, we show that ultra-large superpositions $\Delta z/\delta z_{\rm zpm}\sim 10^6$, are possible, where $\delta z_{\rm zpm}$ is the zero point motional extent.</description>

Abstract: According to the Kolmogorovian Censorship Hypothesis, everything that quantum theory says about the world in the language of the quantum mechanical Hilbert space formalism is actually about relationships between ordinary relative frequencies expressible in operational terms using classical Kolmogorovian probability theory. In other words, a quantum theoretical description of a system should in principle be translatable into a purely operational-probabilistic description. However, our goal in this paper is different; we do not want to deal with the problem how to translate the known theory of quantum mechanics into operational terms, or to reconstruct the theory from postulates which can be interpreted in operational terms. Our aim is somewhat broader and points in the opposite direction. We start with a general scheme for the operational description of an arbitrary physical system. The description is based solely on the notion of observable events (measurement operations and measurement results) and on general, empirically established simple laws concerning their relative frequency. These laws are so simple and fundamental that they apply equally to any physical system. In the first part of the paper, we outline the basic elements of such an operational-probabilistic theory. In the second part, we discuss how this operational-probabilistic description compares to the quantum mechanical description and to what extent the standard Hilbert space quantum mechanics can be regarded as a reformulation of the general operational-probabilistic theory.</description>

      <title>Fast, robust and laser-free universal entangling gates for trapped-ion quantum computing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.04730v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A novel two-qubit entangling gate for trapped-ion quantum processors is proposed theoretically and demonstrated experimentally. During the gate, double-dressed quantum states are created by applying a phase-modulated continuous driving field. The speed of this quantum gate is an order of magnitude higher than that of previously demonstrated rf controlled two-qubit entangling gates in static magnetic field gradients. At the same time, the field driving the gate dynamically decouples the qubits from amplitude and frequency noise, increasing the qubits' coherence time by $3$ orders of magnitude. The gate requires only a single continuous rf field per qubit, making it well suited for scaling a quantum processor to large numbers of qubits. Implementing this entangling gate, we generate the Bell states $|\Phi^+\rangle$ and $|\Psi^+\rangle$ in less than or equal to $313$ $\mathrm{\mu}$s with fidelities up to $98^{+2}_{-3}$% in a static magnetic gradient of only $19.09$ T/m. At higher magnetic field gradients, the entangling gate speed can be further improved to match that of laser-based counterparts.</description>

      <title>Quantum Coherence and Distinguishability as Complementary Resources: A Resource-Theoretic Perspective from Wave-Particle Duality</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14323v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Wave-particle duality, a fundamental principle of quantum mechanics, encapsulates the complementary relationship between the wave and particle behaviors of quantum systems. In this paper, we treat quantum coherence and classical distinguishability as complementary resources and uncover a novel duality relation, which is explored through quantum state discrimination under incoherent operations, extending beyond typical interference scenarios. We prove that in an ensemble of mutually orthogonal pure states, the sum of `co-bits', quantifying the coherence preserved under incoherent free operations, and classical bits, representing the distinguishability extracted via quantum state discrimination, is bounded. This coherence-distinguishability duality relation exposes an inherent trade-off between the simultaneous preservation of a system's quantum coherence (wave-like property) and the extraction of its classical distinguishability (particle-like property). Our findings provide a fresh perspective on wave-particle duality through quantum resource theories, offering complementary insights into manipulating quantum and classical resources, with implications for quantum foundations and quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>A Hierarchical Approach to Quantum Many-Body Systems in Structured Environments</title>

Abstract: Open quantum systems that feature non-Markovian dynamics are routinely solved using techniques such as the Hierarchical Equations of Motion (HEOM). However, their usage of the entire system density-matrix renders them intractable for many-body systems. Here, we combine the HEOM with the Bogoliubov-Born-Green-Kirkwood-Yvon (BBGKY) hierarchy to achieve a rigorous description of open many-body systems in contact with structured photonic and phononic baths. We first rationalize that this stacked hierarchy accounts for spin-squeezing and superradiant emission despite its applicability to arbitrarily many emitters. The full potential of BBGKY-HEOM is then illustrated for two relevant applications: (i) the explicit treatment of vibrational modes provides access to resonant enhancements in few-emitter lasing, and (ii) the impact of phononic coupling and charge noise on many-body electronic systems embedded in host materials (e.g. molecules in organic crystals) is as relevant as electronic correlation. Our work establishes an accessible, yet rigorous, route between condensed matter and quantum optics, fostering the growth of a new domain at their interface.</description>

      <title>Field mixing in a thermal medium: A quantum master equation approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08460v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We studied the nonequilibrium dynamics of the indirect mixing of two (pseudo-)scalar fields induced by their couplings to common decay channels in a medium. The effective non-Markovian quantum master equation (QME) for the two fields' reduced density matrix is derived to leading order in the couplings of the two fields with the medium, but to all orders of the couplings among degrees of freedom in the medium. The self-energy and noise-kernel in the QME satisfy a fluctuation-dissipation relation. The solutions show that an initial expectation value (condensate) of one field induces a condensate of the other field through the indirect mixing and that the populations and coherence of the two fields thermalize and approach to non-vanishing values asymptotically. The nearly-degenerate field masses and coupling strengths resonantly enhance the quantum beats and asymptotic coherence, and induce a prominent dynamics of the vacuum after the switch-on of the couplings. We argue that a time-dependent definitions of particles due to the changing vacuum must be introduced so as to obtain results consistent with the calculations of equilibrium states in the asymptotic limit. A coupling strength hierarchy breaks down the resonant enhancement in the nearly-degenerate case but leads to different power countings of the coupling strengths in the magnitudes of the observables and time-scales in the evolution, suggesting the possibility of detecting extremely long-lived particles using prepared short-lived particles within a practical experimental period.</description>

      <title>Concomitant Entanglement and Control Criticality Driven by Collective Measurements</title>

Abstract: Adaptive quantum circuits-where a quantum many-body state is controlled using measurements and conditional unitary operations-are a powerful paradigm for state preparation and quantum error correction tasks. They can support two types of nonequilibrium quantum phase transitions: measurement-induced transitions between volume- and area-law-entangled steady states and control-induced transitions where the system falls into an absorbing state, or an orbit visiting several absorbing states. Within this context, nonlocal conditional operations can alter the critical properties of the two transitions and the topology of the phase diagram. Here, we consider the scenario where the measurements are nonlocal, to engineer efficient control onto dynamical trajectories. Motivated by Rydberg-atom arrays, we consider a locally constrained model with global sublattice magnetization measurements and local correction operations to steer the system's dynamics onto a many-body orbit. The model has a well-defined classical limit, which we leverage to aid our analysis of the control transition. As a function of the density of local correction operations, we find control and entanglement transitions with continuously varying critical exponents. For sufficiently high densities of local correction operations, we find that both transitions acquire a dynamical critical exponent $z&lt;1$, reminiscent of criticality in long-range power-law interacting systems. At low correction densities, we find that the criticality reverts to a short-range nature with $z\gtrsim 1$. In the long-range regime, the control and entanglement transitions are indistinguishable to within the resolution of our numerics, while in the short-range regime we find evidence that the transitions become distinct. We conjecture that the long-range criticality mediated by collective measurements is essential in driving the two transitions together.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the role of catalysts in energy extraction from quantum batteries. A basic class of catalysts is proposed in this regard, viz., energy-invariant catalysts. In particular, for energy extraction, we restrict ourselves to unitaries that jointly act on the battery and the catalyst but keep the catalyst's energy preserved. We demonstrate that in the presence of an energy-invariant catalyst having the same dimension as the battery, all stored energy of the battery can always be extracted, transforming the battery into its ground state, when an appropriate joint unitary and catalyst state are employed. Additionally, we offer a necessary and sufficient condition for a battery to be unable to provide any energy, i.e., to be inactive, even when an energy-invariant catalyst is present, prepared in an arbitrary but fixed state.</description>

Abstract: Significant work has been done to develop quantum satellites, which generate entangled pairs in space and distribute them to ground stations separated some distance away. The reverse uplink case, where pairs are generated on the ground and swapped on the satellite using an optical Bell-measurement, has not been seriously considered due to a prevailing assumption that it is practically infeasible. In this letter, we illustrate the feasibility of performing Discrete Variable photonic Bell-measurements in space by conducting a detailed numerical analysis to estimate the channel efficiency and attainable pair fidelity for various satellite-station configurations. Our model accounts for a wide range of physical effects such as atmospheric effects, stray photons, and mode mismatch. Our findings show promise toward the feasibility of photonic Bell-measurements in space, which motivates future research towards large-scale Satellite-based uplink entanglement distribution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07092v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using the bitstring probabilities of ground states of bipartitioned ladders of Rydberg atoms, we calculate the mutual information which is a lower bound on the corresponding bipartite von Neumann quantum entanglement entropy $S^{vN}_A$. We show that in many cases, these lower bounds can be improved by removing the bitstrings with a probability lower than some value $p_{min}$ and renormalizing the remaining probabilities (filtering). We propose a heuristic based on the change of the conditional entropy under filtering that very effectively improves the estimate of $S^{vN}_A$. We consider various sizes, lattice spacings and bipartitions. Our numerical investigation suggest that the filtered mutual information obtained with samples having just a few thousand bitstrings can provide reasonably close estimates of $S^{vN}_A$. We briefly discuss practical implementations with the QuEra's Aquila device.</description>

These logical gates are obtained from unitary operators given by symmetry-protected topological responses, which correspond to generators of group cohomology and can be expressed explicitly on the lattice using cohomology operations including cup product, Steenrod squares and new combinations of higher cup products called higher Pontryagin powers. Our study covers most types of the cohomology operations in the literature. This hence gives rise to logical $C^{n-1}Z$ gates in $n$ copies of quantum codes via the $n$-fold cup product in the usual color code paradigm, as well as several new classes of diagonal and non-diagonal logical gates in increasing Clifford hierarchies beyond the color code paradigm, including the logical $R_k$ and multi-controlled $C^m R_k$ gates for codes defined in projective spaces. Implementing these gates could make it more efficient to compile specific types of quantum algorithms such as Shor's algorithm. We further extend the construction to quantum codes with boundaries, which generalizes the folding approach in color codes. We also present a formalism for addressable and parallelizable logical gates in LDPC codes via higher-form symmetries. We further construct logical Clifford gates in expander-based codes including the asymptotically good LDPC codes and hypergraph-product codes. As a byproduct, we find new topological responses of finite higher-form symmetries using higher Pontryagin powers.</description>

      <title>Information Dynamics in Quantum Harmonic Systems: Insights from Toy Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.14359v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study explores quantum information dynamics using a toy model of coupled harmonic oscillators, focusing on the interplay between mutual information, synchronization, and circuit complexity. We examine how variations in coupling strength, detuning and external factors, such as a magnetic field, influence information flow and computational metrics. Through exact Gaussian methods we determine the circuit depth for generating target states, examine time-dependent effects, and show that increased fidelity corresponds to more regular behavior. In the context of ion transport, we compare sudden and adiabatic protocols, quantifying their fidelity-complexity through a nonadiabaticity metric. This analysis demonstrates the superior performance of smooth control sequences in minimizing operational errors. We also establish synchronization and mutual information as complementary but distinct measures of quantum correlations, with particularly divergent behavior in nonlinear regimes.</description>

      <title>Sampling Groups of Pauli Operators to Enhance Direct Fidelity Estimation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.19228v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Direct fidelity estimation is a protocol that estimates the fidelity between an experimental quantum state and a target pure state. By measuring the expectation values of Pauli operators selected through importance sampling, the method is exponentially faster than full quantum state tomography. We propose an enhanced direct fidelity estimation protocol that uses fewer copies of the experimental state by grouping Pauli operators before the sampling process. We derive analytical bounds on the measurement cost and estimator variance, showing improvements over the standard method. Numerical simulations validate our approach, demonstrating that for 8-qubit Haar-random states, our method achieves a one-third reduction in the required number of copies and reduces variance by an order of magnitude using only local measurements. These results underscore the potential of our protocol to enhance the efficiency of fidelity estimation in current quantum devices.</description>

Abstract: The interplay between non-stabilizerness and entanglement in random states is a very rich arena of study for the understanding of quantum advantage and complexity. In this work, we tackle the problem of such interplay in random pure quantum states. We show that while there is a strong dependence between entanglement and magic, they are, surprisingly, perfectly uncorrelated. We compute the expectation value of non-stabilizerness given the Schmidt spectrum (and thus entanglement). At a first approximation, entanglement determines the average magic on the Schmidt orbit. However, there is a finer structure in the average magic distinguishing different orbits where the flatness of entanglement spectrum is involved.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.12241v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Transmission loss represents a major obstacle to the device-independent certification of quantum correlations over long distances, limiting applications such as device-independent quantum key distribution (DIQKD). In this work, we investigate the recently proposed concept of routed Bell experiments, in which a particle sent to one side can be measured either near or far from the source. We prove that routed Bell tests involving only entangled qubits can certify quantum correlations even in the presence of arbitrary loss on the channel to the distant device. This is achieved by adapting concepts from self-testing and quantum steering to the routed Bell test framework. Finally, as a natural extension of our approach, we outline a DIQKD protocol that, in principle, is secure over arbitrary distances.</description>

      <title>Quantum secure direct communication based on fully passive source</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.12652v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In practical quantum communication, imperfect devices may introduce side channels, creating opportunities for eavesdroppers. Especially on the source side, the side channels created by active modulation may compromise the security of the protocol. We proposes a passively-sourced quantum secure direct communication (QSDC) protocol based on fully passive source. By passively modulating both the quantum state and the intensity of the decoy state, we can avoid active modulation operations at the source, thereby enhancing the robustness of QSDC against side-channel attacks. We developed a system model and conducted parameter optimization to obtain the maximum secrecy message transmission rate achievable by the protocol for each channel attenuation. At a channel attenuation of 2, 4, 6 dB (corresponding to a communication distance of 5, 10, 15 km), the secrecy message transmission rates are 5.76 * 10^-5, 9.92 * 10^-6, and 4.99 * 10^-7 bit/sec. And its maximum communication distance is about 16.875 km, which is about 94.4% of that of actively modulated QSDC.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.19470v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The exploration of entanglement and Bell non-locality among multi-particle quantum systems offers a profound avenue for testing and understanding the limits of quantum mechanics and local real hidden variable theories. In this work, we examine non-local correlations among three massless spin-1/2 particles generated from the three-body decay of a massive particle, utilizing a framework based on general four-fermion interactions. By analyzing several inequalities, we address the detection of deviations from quantum mechanics as well as violations of two key hidden variable theories: fully local-real and bipartite local-real theories. Our approach encompasses the standard Mermin inequality and the tight $4 \times 4 \times 2$ inequality, providing a comprehensive framework for probing three-partite non-local correlations. Our findings provide deeper insights into the boundaries of classical and quantum theories in three-particle systems, advancing the understanding of non-locality in particle decays and its relevance to particle physics and quantum foundations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.06423v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this tutorial, which contains some original results, we bridge the fields of quantum computing algorithms, conservation laws, and many-body quantum systems by examining three algorithms for searching an unordered database of size $N$ using a continuous-time quantum walk, which is the quantum analogue of a continuous-time random walk. The first algorithm uses a linear quantum walk, and we apply elementary calculus to show that the success probability of the algorithm reaches 1 when the jumping rate of the walk takes some critical value. We show that the expected value of its Hamiltonian $H_0$ is conserved. The second algorithm uses a nonlinear quantum walk with effective Hamiltonian $H(t) = H_0 + \lambda|\psi|^2$, which arises in the Gross-Pitaevskii equation describing Bose-Einstein condensates. When the interactions between the bosons are repulsive, $\lambda &gt; 0$, and there exists a range of fixed jumping rates such that the success probability reaches 1 with the same asymptotic runtime of the linear algorithm, but with a larger multiplicative constant. Rather than the effective Hamiltonian, we show that the expected value of $H_0 + \frac{1}{2} \lambda|\psi|^2$ is conserved. The third algorithm utilizes attractive interactions, corresponding to $\lambda &lt; 0$. In this case there is a time-varying critical function for the jumping rate $\gamma_c(t)$ that causes the success probability to reach 1 more quickly than in the other two algorithms, and we show that the expected value of $H(t)/[\gamma_c(t) N]$ is conserved.</description>

      <title>Quantum Features of the Thermal Two-Qubit Quantum Rabi Model in Ultra- and Deep-Strong Regimes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.23654v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum correlations and non-classical states are indispensable resources for advancing quantum technologies, and their resilience at finite temperatures is crucial for practical experimental implementations. The two-qubit quantum Rabi model (2QQRM), a natural extension of the quantum Rabi model, describes two qubits coupled to a single bosonic mode and has been extensively studied in cavity quantum electrodynamics, superconducting circuits, and quantum information science. In this work, we investigate the persistence of quantum correlations and non-classical states in the 2QQRM at thermal equilibrium, focusing on the ultrastrong and deep strong coupling regimes. Through a systematic analysis of quantumness quantifiers, we demonstrate the emergence of long-lived quantum correlations, even in the presence of thermal noise. Notably, we uncover striking phenomena arising from the interplay between detuning and deep strong-coupling: in the high-frequency limit, where the qubit energy exceeds the cavity-mode energy, quantum criticality emerges, leading to a high degree of photon squeezing. In contrast, the opposite regime is characterized by robust qubit-qubit quantum correlations. Importantly, we show that both dispersive regimes exhibit quantum features that are remarkably robust to parameter fluctuations, making them advantageous for maintaining quantum coherence. These results highlight the exceptional resilience of quantum resources in the 2QQRM and provide valuable insights for developing quantum technologies operating under realistic, finite-temperature conditions.</description>

Abstract: Building upon the Integer Lattice Gas Automata framework of Blommel \textit{et al.} \cite{PhysRevE.97.023310}, we introduce a simplified, fluctuation-free variant. This approach relies on floating-point numbers and closely mirrors the Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM), with the key distinction being a novel collision operator. This operator, derived from the ensemble average of transition probabilities, generates nonlinear terms. We propose this new Float Lattice Gas Automata (FLGA) collision as a computationally efficient alternative to traditional and quantum LBM implementations.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a framework for implementing logic in CSS quantum error correction codes, building on the surgery methods of Cowtan and Burton [CB24]. Our approach offers a systematic methodology for designing and analysing surgery protocols. At the physical level, we introduce the concept of subcodes, which encapsulate all the necessary data for performing surgery. At the logical level, leveraging homological algebra, subcodes enable us to track the logical operations induced by any surgery protocol, regardless of the choice of logical operator basis. In particular, we make no assumptions on the structure of the logical operators of the code. As a proof of concept, we develop a surgery protocol inspired by lattice surgery that implements a logical CNOT gate between any two logical qubits of any CSS code, with fault-tolerance guarantees.</description>

      <title>Simple Sufficient Criteria for Optimality of Entanglement Witnesses</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.15615v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: If one wants to establish optimality of a given bipartite entanglement witness, the current standard approach is to check whether it has the spanning property. Although this is not necessary for optimality, it is most often satisfied in practice, and for small enough dimensions or sufficiently structured witnesses this criterion can be checked by hand. In this work we introduce a novel characterization of the spanning property via entanglement-breaking channels, which in turn leads to a new sufficient criterion for optimality. This criterion amounts to just checking the kernel of some bipartite state. It is slightly weaker than the spanning property, but it is a lot easier to test for -- by hand as well as numerically -- and it applies to almost all witnesses which are known to have the spanning property. A second criterion is derived from this, where one can simply compute the expectation value of the given witness on a maximally entangled state. Finally, this approach implies new spectral constraints on witnesses as well as on positive maps.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.06107v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum memories integrated in a modular quantum processing architecture can rationalize the resources required for quantum computation. This work focuses on spin-based quantum memories, where itinerant electromagnetic fields are stored in large ensembles of effective two-level systems, such as atomic or solid-state spin ensembles, embedded in a cavity. Using a mean-field framework, we model the ensemble as an effective spin communication channel and develop a cascaded quantum model to describe both absorption and emission processes. We derive optimal time-dependent modulations of the cavity linewidth that maximize storage and retrieval efficiency for finite-duration wavepackets. Our analysis yields an upper bound on efficiency, which can be met in the narrow bandwidth regime. It also shows the existence of a critical bandwidth above which the efficiency severely decreases. Numerical simulations are presented in the context of microwave-frequency quantum memories interfaced with superconducting quantum processors, highlighting the protocol's relevance for modular quantum architectures.</description>

      <title>The Janus State: Strong Photon Antibunching from a Superposition of Squeezed Vacua</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.06397v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fundamental principles of quantum mechanics, such as superposition, have long been used to create nonclassical ``cat states'' from classical-like components. We push this concept into the fully quantum regime by introducing the Janus State -- a superposition of two squeezed vacuum states. Here, we report the discovery that this state, born from two photon-bunched components, exhibits strong photon antibunching. Our exact analytical theory reveals this emergent nonclassicality is driven by pure quantum interference, which suppresses two-photon events and drives the second-order coherence to $g^{(2)}(0) \approx 0.567$. This result fundamentally challenges the paradigm that antibunching requires non-Gaussian resources or post-selection. The Janus State thus constitutes a new foundational tool for quantum engineering, providing a deterministic and experimentally accessible route to generating highly nonclassical light.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.21122v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reconciling quantum mechanics and general relativity remains one of the most profound challenges in modern physics. The BMV (Bose-Marletto-Vedral) experiment can assess the quantum nature of gravity by testing whether gravitational interactions can generate entanglement between quantum systems. In this work, we show that entanglement can be generated by gravity without requiring spacetime superpositions or quantum spacetime degrees of freedom by using mediators that do not satisfy the usual property of local tomography when coupling to quantum matter. Specifically, we showcase how entanglement can be generated using three distinct toy models that display non-locally tomographic couplings between quantum matter and a locally classical gravitational mediator. These models include (i) fermionic systems with the parity superselection rule, (ii) non-Abelian anyonic systems, and (iii) a novel bit anti-bit model. Our results demonstrate a crucial point: a gravitational mediator which does not exhibit superpositions of its classical basis but still qualifies as non-classical via non-locally tomographic coupling mechanisms can generate entanglement through local interactions. This work also underscores the importance of relaxing local tomography in exploring the quantum-gravitational interface. It provides a novel perspective on the role of spacetime degrees of freedom in entanglement generation through local interactions.</description>

Abstract: We propose a novel quantum technique to search for unmodeled anomalies in multidimensional binned collider data. We propose associating an Ising lattice spin site with each bin, with the Ising Hamiltonian suitably constructed from the observed data and a corresponding theoretical expectation. In order to capture spatially correlated anomalies in the data, we introduce spin-spin interactions between neighboring sites, as well as self-interactions. The ground state energy of the resulting Ising Hamiltonian can be used as a new test statistic, which can be computed either classically or via adiabatic quantum optimization. We demonstrate that our test statistic outperforms some of the most commonly used goodness-of-fit tests. The new approach greatly reduces the look-elsewhere effect by exploiting the typical differences between statistical noise and genuine new physics signals.</description>

      <title>Entangling color centers via magnon-antimagnon pair creation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09865v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present how entanglement between a spatially separated pair of color centers can be created by letting them weakly interact with the quantum fluctuations of a nonequilibrium magnetic environment. To this end, we consider two coupled ferromagnets, one in the ground state and one in an inverted state with respect to an applied magnetic field. The resulting energetic instability leads to a quantum spin current in the vacuum state that is sustained by the creation of magnon-antimagnon pairs at the interface. We show that these quantum fluctuations imprint a steady-state entanglement onto the two dipole-coupled color centers through nonlocal dissipation. We derive conditions for establishing a maximally entangled Bell state. This entanglement is absent in thermal equilibrium.</description>

      <title>Chirally-protected state manipulation by tuning one-dimensional statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01517v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Chiral symmetry is broken by typical interactions in lattice models, but the statistical interactions embodied in the anyon-Hubbard model are an exception. This is an example for a correlated hopping model where chiral symmetry protects a degenerate zero-energy subspace. Complementary to the traditional approach of anyon braiding in real space, we adiabatically evolve the statistical parameter and find non-trivial Berry phases and holonomies in this chiral subspace. The corresponding states possess stationary checkerboard patterns in their $N$-particle densities which are preserved under adiabatic manipulation. We give an explicit protocol for how these chirally-protected zero-energy states can be prepared, observed, validated, and controlled.</description>

      <title>Deterministic role of chemical bonding in the formation of altermagnetism: Reflection from correlated electron system NiS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00453v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Altermagnetism, a new collinear magnetic state, has gained significant attention in the last few years, and the underlying mechanisms driving this quantum phase are still evolving. Going beyond the group theoretical analyses, which focus on providing a binary description of the presence or absence of the altermagnetic state, in this work, we explore the role of crystal chemical bonding. As the latter successfully integrates the crystal and orbital symmetries and is tunable, it provides a quantitative and realistic mechanism to explain the formation of altermagnetism. From the first principles calculations and tight-binding models within the framework of the linear combination of atomic orbitals on NiS, we establish a set of selection rules for the formation of altermagnetism in the NiAs prototype compounds (e.g. CrSb, MnTe, etc.). Broadly, if single orbitals from Ni and S sites are involved in the bonding, the second neighbor interaction between the nonmagnetic atoms is a must to modulate the intra-sublattice interactions differently for the opposite spin sublattices so that the antiferromagnetic sublattice band degeneracy is lifted and momentum-dependent altermagnetic spin split (AMSS) appears. However, when multiple orbitals are involved from the Ni and S sites in the chemical bonding, altermagnetism is naturally present. Together, they amplify the AMSS. Further, we propose twelve antinodal regions in the NiAs type hexagonal crystals, where AMSS split is maximum. Specific to NiS, AMSS increases with correlation, and for the edge valence and conduction bands, it can go beyond 1eV. The present study opens up new pathways to design chemical bonding driven selection rules in addition to the existing crystal symmetry criteria to tailor tunable altermagnetism.</description>

      <title>Quantum-Enhanced Attention Mechanism in NLP: A Hybrid Classical-Quantum Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15630v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in quantum computing have opened new pathways for enhancing deep learning architectures, particularly in domains characterized by high-dimensional and context-rich data such as natural language processing (NLP). In this work, we present a hybrid classical-quantum Transformer model that integrates a quantum-enhanced attention mechanism into the standard classical architecture. By embedding token representations into a quantum Hilbert space via parameterized variational circuits and exploiting entanglement-aware kernel similarities, the model captures complex semantic relationships beyond the reach of conventional dot-product attention. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach across diverse NLP benchmarks, showing improvements in both efficiency and representational capacity. The results section reveal that the quantum attention layer yields globally coherent attention maps and more separable latent features, while requiring comparatively fewer parameters than classical counterparts. These findings highlight the potential of quantum-classical hybrid models to serve as a powerful and resource-efficient alternative to existing attention mechanisms in NLP.</description>

      <title>Josephson vortices and persistent current in a double-ring supersolid system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11212v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the properties of ultra-cold dipolar atoms in radially coupled, concentric annular traps created by a potential barrier. The non-rotating ground-state phases are investigated across the superfluid-supersolid phase transition, revealing a particle imbalance between the two rings and a preferential density modulation in the outer ring in the absence of rotation. Near the phase transition on the superfluid side, applying rotation can induce density modulations in either ring, depending on the angular momentum and barrier strength. For low angular momentum, such rotation-induced density modulation forms in the outer ring, while for high angular momentum and weak barriers, it emerges in the inner ring. Rotation can lead to persistent currents and the nucleation of a vortex residing either at the center (central vortex) or at the ring junction (Josephson vortex). Josephson vortices can also form at the junctions of the localized density sites induced by rotation in the inner ring, a behavior that is unique to our system. By switching off the trap and allowing the system to expand, distinct interference patterns emerge, which can be analyzed to identify and distinguish between various vortex configurations, and thus can be observed in current state-of-the-art experiments.</description>

      <title>Probing the Quantum Capacitance of Rydberg Transitions of Surface Electrons on Liquid Helium via Microwave Frequency Modulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09890v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a method for probing the quantum capacitance associated with the Rydberg transition of surface electrons on liquid helium using radio-frequency (RF) reflectometry. Resonant microwave excitation of the Rydberg transition induces a redistribution of image charges on capacitively coupled electrodes, giving rise to a quantum capacitance originating from adiabatic state transitions and the finite curvature of the energy bands. By applying frequency-modulated resonant microwaves to drive the Rydberg transition, we systematically measured a capacitance sensitivity of 0.34~aF/$\sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}$ for our RF reflectometry scheme. This sensitivity is sufficient to detect the Rydberg transition of a single electron, offering a scalable pathway toward qubit readout schemes based on surface electrons on helium.</description>

      <title>A Heuristic Study of Temperature: Quantum Circuitry in Thermal Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06994v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Classical thermodynamic singularities at phase transitions and in negative-temperature regimes arise because the equal-a-priori probability postulate overlooks the quantum dynamical complexity required to prepare microstates. We promote bounded dynamical complexity to a postulate and develop Complexity Windowed Thermodynamics (CWT). Introducing a finite complexity budget yields the windowed entropy, an entropy of ignorance that is smooth in energy and monotonically non-increasing in the budget. Smoothness guarantees a finite, continuous effective temperature and a non-negative complexity generation potential, thereby regularizing all classical singularities while recovering standard statistical mechanics as the complexity budget approaches infinity. CWT's generalized first law unveils an information processing work term. From unitary channel geometry we derive universal bounds on action and time: the action consumed must be proportional to the optimal circuit complexity, while the minimum required time is inversely proportional to the effective temperature. The framework unifies phenomena from critical point smoothing to black hole information flow, and predicts that the universe's total generatable complexity and its holographic entropy are of the same order bridging thermodynamics, quantum computation, and gravity.</description>

      <title>Hollow-grams: Generalized Entanglement Wedges from the Gravitational Path Integral</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10064v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, Bousso and Penington (BP) made a proposal for the entanglement wedge associated to a gravitating bulk region. In this paper, we derive this proposal in time-reflection symmetric settings using the gravitational path integral. To do this, we exploit the connection between random tensor networks (RTNs) and fixed-geometry states in gravity. We define the entropy of a bulk region in an RTN by removing tensors in that region and computing the entropy of the open legs thus generated in the "hollowed" RTN. We thus derive the BP proposal for RTNs and hence, also for fixed-geometry states in gravity. By then expressing a general holographic state as a superposition over fixed-geometry states and using a diagonal approximation, we provide a general gravitational path integral derivation of the BP proposal. We demonstrate that the saddles computing the R\'enyi entropy $S_n$ depend on how the bulk region is gauge-invariantly specified. Nevertheless, we show that the BP proposal is universally reproduced in the $n\to1$ limit.</description>
