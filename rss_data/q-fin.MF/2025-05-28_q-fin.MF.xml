      <title>Martingale Consumption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20504v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose martingale consumption as a natural, desirable consumption pattern for any given (proportional) investment strategy. The idea is to always adjust current consumption so as to achieve level expected future consumption under the arbitrarily chosen investment strategy. This approach avoids the formulation of an optimization objective based on preferences towards risk, intertemporal consumption, habit formation etc. We identify general explicit solutions in deterministic-coefficient models. In the general case with random coefficients we establish uniqueness, but the question of existence of a solution is unsettled. With the interest rate as the only random factor we derive a PDE for the wealth-to-consumption factor as a function of the state variables, which, however, is non-linear and without known closed-form solutions. We briefly consider the discrete-time case and obtain similar results. Throughout, we compare with well-known optimal strategies for classical CRRA investors with time-additive utility of consumption and find that under suitable time preferences they may in certain cases achieve martingale consumption simultaneously.</description>

      <title>Robust Lambda-quantiles and extremal distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13539v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the robust models for $\Lambda$-quantiles with partial information regarding the loss distribution, where $\Lambda$-quantiles extend the classical quantiles by replacing the fixed probability level with a probability/loss function $\Lambda$. We find that, under some assumptions, the robust $\Lambda$-quantiles equal the $\Lambda$-quantiles of the extremal distributions. This finding allows us to obtain the robust $\Lambda$-quantiles by applying the results of robust quantiles in the literature. Our results are applied to uncertainty sets characterized by three different constraints respectively: moment constraints, probability distance constraints via the Wasserstein metric, and marginal constraints in risk aggregation. We obtain some explicit expressions for robust $\Lambda$-quantiles by deriving the extremal distributions for each uncertainty set. These results are applied to optimal portfolio selection under model uncertainty.</description>

      <title>Strictly monotone mean-variance preferences with applications to portfolio selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13523v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper extends the monotone mean-variance (MMV) preference to a broader class of strictly monotone mean-variance (SMMV) preferences, and demonstrates its applications to portfolio selection problems. For the single-period portfolio problem under the SMMV preference, we derive the gradient condition for the optimal strategy, and investigate its association with the optimal mean-variance (MV) static strategy. A novel contribution of this work is the reduction of the problem to solving a set of linear equations by analyzing the saddle point of some minimax problem. Building on this advancement, we conduct numerical experiments and compare our results with those of Maccheroni, et al. (Math. Finance 19(3): 487-521, 2009). The findings indicate that our SMMV preferences provide a more rational basis for assessing given prospects. For the continuous-time portfolio problem with the SMMV preference, we consider continuous price processes with random coefficients. We establish the condition under which the optimal dynamic strategies for SMMV and MV preferences coincide, and characterize the optimal solution using the dynamic programming principle and the martingale convex duality method, respectively. Consequently, the problem is reduced to solving a stochastic Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman-Isaacs equation, or a multi-stage linear-quadratic optimization problem with the embedding technique.</description>

      <title>Why do financial prices exhibit Brownian motion despite predictable order flow?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17906v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In financial market microstructure, there are two enigmatic empirical laws: (i) the market-order flow has predictable persistence due to metaorder splitters by institutional investors, well formulated as the Lillo-Mike-Farmer model. However, this phenomenon seems paradoxical given the diffusive and unpredictable price dynamics; (ii) the price impact $I(Q)$ of a large metaorder $Q$ follows the square-root law, $I(Q)\propto \sqrt{Q}$. Here we theoretically reveal why price dynamics follows Brownian motion despite predictable order flow by unifying these enigmas. We generalize the Lillo-Mike-Farmer model to nonlinear price-impact dynamics, which is mapped to an exactly solvable L\'evy-walk model. Our exact solution shows that the price dynamics remains diffusive under the square-root law, even under persistent order flow. This work illustrates the crucial role of the square-root law in mitigating large price movements by large metaorders, thereby leading to the Brownian price dynamics, consistently with the efficient market hypothesis over long timescales.</description>
