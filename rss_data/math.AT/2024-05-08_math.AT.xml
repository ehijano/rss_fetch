      <title>The Smith Fiber Sequence of Invertible Field Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04649v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Smith homomorphisms are maps between bordism groups that change both the dimension and the tangential structure. We give a completely general account of Smith homomorphisms, unifying the many examples in the literature. We provide three definitions of Smith homomorphisms, including as maps of Thom spectra, and show they are equivalent. Using this, we identify the cofiber of the spectrum-level Smith map and extend the Smith homomorphism to a long exact sequence of bordism groups, which is a powerful computation tool. We discuss several examples of this long exact sequence, relating them to known constructions such as Wood's and Wall's sequences. Furthermore, taking Anderson duals yields a long exact sequence of invertible field theories, which has a rich physical interpretation. We developed the theory in this paper with applications in mind to symmetry breaking in quantum field theory, which we study in a companion paper.</description>

      <title>Strictification of $\infty$-Groupoids is Comonadic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04780v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the universal strictification adjunction from weak $\infty$-groupoids (modeled as simplicial sets) to strict $\infty$-groupoids (modeled as simplicial T-complexes). We prove that any simplicial set can be recovered up to weak homotopy equivalence as the totalization of its canonical cosimplicial resolution induced by this adjunction. This generalizes the fact due to Bousfield and Kan that the homotopy type of a simply connected space can be recovered as the totalization of its canonical cosimplicial resolution induced by the free simplicial abelian group adjunction. Furthermore, we leverage this result to show that this strictification adjunction induces a comonadic adjunction between the quasicategories of simplicial sets and strict $\infty$-groupoids.</description>

      <title>Persistent homology of featured time series data and its applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent studies have actively employed persistent homology (PH), a topological data analysis technique, to analyze the topological information in time series data. Many successful studies have utilized graph representations of time series data for PH calculation. Given the diverse nature of time series data, it is crucial to have mechanisms that can adjust the PH calculations by incorporating domain-specific knowledge. In this context, we introduce a methodology that allows the adjustment of PH calculations by reflecting relevant domain knowledge in specific fields. We introduce the concept of featured time series, which is the pair of a time series augmented with specific features such as domain knowledge, and an influence vector that assigns a value to each feature to fine-tune the results of the PH. We then prove the stability theorem of the proposed method, which states that adjusting the influence vectors grants stability to the PH calculations. The proposed approach enables the tailored analysis of a time series based on the graph representation methodology, which makes it applicable to real-world domains. We consider two examples to verify the proposed method's advantages: anomaly detection of stock data and topological analysis of music data.</description>

      <title>On diagonal digraphs, Koszul algebras and triangulations of homology spheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04748v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the magnitude homology of a finite digraph $G$ as a certain subquotient of its path algebra. We use this to prove that the second magnitude homology group ${\rm MH}_{2,\ell}(G,\mathbb{Z})$ is a free abelian group for any $\ell$, and to describe its rank. This allows us to give a condition, denoted by $(\mathcal{V}_2)$, equivalent to vanishing of ${\rm MH}_{2,\ell}(G,\mathbb{Z})$ for $\ell&gt;2.$ Recall that a digraph is called diagonal, if its magnitude homology is concentrated in diagonal degrees. Using the condition $(\mathcal V_2),$ we show that the GLMY-fundamental group of a diagonal (undirected) graph is trivial. In other words, the two-dimensional CW-complex obtained from a diagonal graph by attaching 2-cells to all squares and triangles of the graph is simply connected. We also give an interpretation of diagonality in terms of Koszul algebras: a digraph $G$ is diagonal if and only if the distance algebra $\sigma G$ is Koszul for any ground field; and if and only if $G$ satisfies $(\mathcal{V}_2)$ and the path cochain algebra $\Omega^\bullet(G)$ is Koszul for any ground field. Besides, we show that the path cochain algebra $\Omega^\bullet(G)$ is quadratic for any $G.$ To obtain a source of examples of (non-)diagonal digraphs, we study the extended Hasse diagram $\hat G_K$ of a simplicial complex $K$. For a combinatorial triangulation $K$ of a piecewise-linear manifold $M,$ we express the non-diagonal part of the magnitude homology of $\hat G_K$ via the homology of $M$. As a corollary we obtain that, if $K$ is a combinatorial triangulation of a closed piecewise-linear manifold $M$, then $\hat G_K$ is diagonal if and only if $M$ is a homology sphere.</description>

      <title>On linear-combinatorial problems associated with subspaces spanned by $\{\pm 1\}$-vectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05082v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A complete answer to the question about subspaces generated by $\{\pm 1\}$-vectors, which arose in the work of I.Kanter and H.Sompolinsky on associative memories, is given. More precisely, let vectors $v_1, \ldots , v_p,$ $p\leq n-1,$ be chosen at random uniformly and independently from $\{\pm 1\}^n \subset {\bf R}^n.$ Then the probability ${\mathbb P}(p, n)$ that $$span \ \langle v_1, \ldots , v_p \rangle \cap \left\{ \{\pm 1\}^n \setminus \{\pm v_1, \ldots , \pm v_p\}\right\} \ne \emptyset \ $$ is shown to be $$4{p \choose 3}\left(\frac{3}{4}\right)^n + O\left(\left(\frac{5}{8} + o_n(1)\right)^n\right) \quad \mbox{as} \quad n\to \infty,$$ where the constant implied by the $O$-notation does not depend on $p$. The main term in this estimate is the probability that some 3 vectors $v_{j_1}, v_{j_2}, v_{j_3}$ of $v_j$, $j= 1, \ldots , p,$ have a linear combination that is a $\{\pm 1\}$-vector different from $\pm v_{j_1}, \pm v_{j_2}, \pm v_{j_3}. $</description>

      <title>Topological proofs of categorical coherence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.07391v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give a short topological proof of coherence for categorified non-symmetric operads by using the fact that the diagrams involved form the 1-skeleton of simply connected CW complexes. We also obtain a "one-step" topological proof of Mac Lane's coherence theorem for symmetric monoidal categories, as suggested by Kapranov in 1993. Our analysis is based on a notion of combinatorial homotopy, which we further study in the special case of polyhedral complexes, leading to a second geometrical proof of coherence which is very close to Mac Lane's original argument. We use Morse theory to show that this second method is (strictly) less general than the first. We provide a detailed analysis of how both methods allow us to deduce these two categorical coherence results and discuss possible generalizations to higher categories.</description>

      <title>Soft random simplicial complexes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.13034v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A soft random graph $G(n,r,p)$ can be obtained from the random geometric graph $G(n,r)$ by keeping every edge in $G(n,r)$ with probability $p$. This random graph is a particular case of the soft random graph model introduced by Penrose, in which the probability between 2 vertices is a function that depends on the distance between them. In this article, we define models for random simplicial complexes built over the soft random graph $G(n,r,p)$, which also present randomness in all other dimensions. Furthermore, we study the homology of those random simplicial complexes in different regimes of $n,r$, and $p$ by giving asymptotic formulas for the expectation of the Betti numbers in the sparser regimes, and bounds in the denser regimes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03757v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the sequential parametrized topological complexity of group epimorphisms, which generalizes the sequential topological complexity of groups. We derive bounds for sequential parametrized topological complexity based on the cohomological dimension of certain subgroups, thereby extending the corresponding bounds for sequential topological complexity of groups. Finally, we utilize these results to provide alternative computations for the sequential parametrized topological complexity of planar Fadell-Neuwirth fibrations.</description>

Abstract: We construct a periodic motivic spectrum over $Spec(\mathbb{Z})$ which when pulled back to any scheme $S$ with $\frac{1}{2}\in\Gamma(S,\mathcal{O}_S)$ is the $HP^1-$spectrum constructed by Panin and Walter. This spectrum $\mathbf{KO}^{geo}$ is constructed using closed subschemes of the Grassmannians $Gr(r,n)$. Using this we show that $\mathbf{KO}^{geo}$ is cellular.</description>

      <title>Persistent Homology for High-dimensional Data Based on Spectral Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.03087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.03087v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Persistent homology is a popular computational tool for analyzing the topology of point clouds, such as the presence of loops or voids. However, many real-world datasets with low intrinsic dimensionality reside in an ambient space of much higher dimensionality. We show that in this case traditional persistent homology becomes very sensitive to noise and fails to detect the correct topology. The same holds true for existing refinements of persistent homology. As a remedy, we find that spectral distances on the $k$-nearest-neighbor graph of the data, such as diffusion distance and effective resistance, allow to detect the correct topology even in the presence of high-dimensional noise. Moreover, we derive a novel closed-form formula for effective resistance, and describe its relation to diffusion distances. Finally, we apply these methods to high-dimensional single-cell RNA-sequencing data and show that spectral distances allow robust detection of cell cycle loops.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.10625v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A soft random graph $G(n,r,p)$ can be obtained from the random geometric graph $G(n,r)$ by keeping every edge in $G(n,r)$ with probability $p$. The soft random simplicial complexes is a model for random simplicial complexes built over the soft random graph $G(n,r,p)$. This new model depends on a probability vector $\rho$ which allows the simplicial complexes to present randomness in all dimensions. In this article, we use a normal approximation theorem to prove central limit theorems for the number of $k$-faces and for the Euler's characteristic for soft random simplicial complexes.</description>

      <title>Flux Quantization on Phase Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.12517v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While it has become widely appreciated that (higher) gauge theories need, besides their variational phase space data, to be equipped with "flux quantization laws" in generalized differential cohomology, there used to be no general prescription for how to define and construct the resulting flux-quantized phase space stacks.
  In this short note we observe that all higher Maxwell-type equations have solution spaces given by flux densities on a Cauchy surface subject to a higher Gauss law and no further constraint: The metric duality-constraint is all absorbed into the evolution equation away from the Cauchy surface.
  Moreover, we observe that the higher Gauss law characterizes the Cauchy data as flat differential forms valued in a characteristic L-infinity-algebra. Using the recent construction of the non-abelian Chern-Dold character map, this implies that compatible flux quantization laws on phase space have classifying spaces whose rational Whitehead L-infinity algebra is this characteristic one. The flux-quantized higher phase space stack of the theory is then simply the corresponding (generally non-abelian) differential cohomology moduli stack on the Cauchy surface.
  We show how this systematic prescription subsumes existing proposals for flux-quantized phase spaces of vacuum Maxwell theory and of the chiral boson. Moreover, for the case of NS/RR-fields in type II supergravity, the traditional "Hypothesis K" of flux quantization in topological K-theory is naturally implied, without the need, on phase space, for the notorious further duality constraint. Finally, as a genuinely non-abelian example, we consider flux-quantization of the C-field in 11d supergravity/M-theory given by unstable differential 4-Cohomotopy ("Hypothesis H") and emphasize again that, implemented on Cauchy data, this qualifies as the full phase space without the need for a further duality constraint.</description>
