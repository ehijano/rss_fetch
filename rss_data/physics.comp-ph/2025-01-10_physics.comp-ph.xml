      <title>Modelling complex proton transport phenomena -- Exploring the limits of fine-tuning and transferability of foundational machine-learned force fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04876v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The solid acids CsH$_2$PO$_4$ and Cs$_7$(H$_4$PO$_4$)(H$_2$PO$_4$)$_8$ pose significant challenges for the simulation of proton transport phenomena. In this work, we use the recently developed machine-learned force field (MLFF) MACE to model the proton dynamics on nanosecond time scales for these systems and compare its performance with long-term ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations. The MACE-MP-0 foundation model shows remarkable performance for all observables derived from molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, but minor quantitative discrepancies remain compared to the AIMD reference data. However, we show that minimal fine-tuning -- fitting to as little as 1 ps of AIMD data -- leads to full quantitative agreement between the radial distribution functions of MACE force field and AIMD simulations. In addition, we show that traditional long-term AIMD simulations fail to capture the correct qualitative trends in diffusion coefficients and activation energies for these solid acids due to the limited accessible time scale. In contrast, accurate and convergent diffusion coefficients can be reliably obtained through multi-nanosecond long MD simulations using machine-learned force fields. The obtained qualitative and quantitative behavior of the converged diffusion coefficients and activation energies now matches the experimental trends for both solid acids, in contrast to previous AIMD simulations that yielded a qualitatively wrong picture.</description>

      <title>Constrained Optimization of Charged Particle Tracking with Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05113v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning demonstrated immense success in modelling complex physics-driven systems, providing end-to-end trainable solutions by interacting with a simulated or real environment, maximizing a scalar reward signal. In this work, we propose, building upon previous work, a multi-agent reinforcement learning approach with assignment constraints for reconstructing particle tracks in pixelated particle detectors. Our approach optimizes collaboratively a parametrized policy, functioning as a heuristic to a multidimensional assignment problem, by jointly minimizing the total amount of particle scattering over the reconstructed tracks in a readout frame. To satisfy constraints, guaranteeing a unique assignment of particle hits, we propose a safety layer solving a linear assignment problem for every joint action. Further, to enforce cost margins, increasing the distance of the local policies predictions to the decision boundaries of the optimizer mappings, we recommend the use of an additional component in the blackbox gradient estimation, forcing the policy to solutions with lower total assignment costs. We empirically show on simulated data, generated for a particle detector developed for proton imaging, the effectiveness of our approach, compared to multiple single- and multi-agent baselines. We further demonstrate the effectiveness of constraints with cost margins for both optimization and generalization, introduced by wider regions with high reconstruction performance as well as reduced predictive instabilities. Our results form the basis for further developments in RL-based tracking, offering both enhanced performance with constrained policies and greater flexibility in optimizing tracking algorithms through the option for individual and team rewards.</description>

      <title>Providing Machine Learning Potentials with High Quality Uncertainty Estimates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05250v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Computational chemistry has come a long way over the course of several decades, enabling subatomic level calculations particularly with the development of Density Functional Theory (DFT). Recently, machine-learned potentials (MLP) have provided a way to overcome the prevalent time and length scale constraints in such calculations. Unfortunately, these models utilise complex and high dimensional representations, making it challenging for users to intuit performance from chemical structure, which has motivated the development of methods for uncertainty quantification. One of the most common methods is to introduce an ensemble of models and employ an averaging approach to determine the uncertainty. In this work, we introduced Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) for uncertainty aware energy evaluation as a more principled and resource efficient method to achieve this goal. The richness of our uncertainty quantification enables a new type of hybrid workflow where calculations can be offloaded to a MLP in a principled manner.</description>

      <title>Efficient computation of particle-fluid and particle-particle interactions in compressible flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05340v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Particle collisions are the primary mechanism of inter-particle momentum and energy exchange for dense particle-laden flow. Accurate approximation of this collision operator in four-way coupled Euler-Lagrange approaches remains challenging due to the associated computational cost. Adopting a deterministic collision model and a hard-sphere approach eases time step constraints but imposes non-locality on distributed memory architectures, necessitating the inclusion of collision partners from each grid element in the vicinity. Retaining high-order accuracy and parallel efficiency also ties into the correct and compact treatment of the particle-fluid coupling, where adequate kernels are required to effectively project the work of the particles to the Eulerian grid. In this work, we present an efficient particle collision and projection operator based on an MPI+MPI hybrid approach to enable time-resolved and high-order accurate simulations of compressible, four-way coupled particle-laden flows at dense concentrations. A distinct feature of the proposed particle collision algorithm is the efficient calculation of exact binary inter-particle collisions on arbitrary core counts. Combining the particle operator with a hybrid discretization operator based on a high-order discontinuous Galerkin method and a localized low-order finite volume operator allows an accurate treatment of highly compressible particle-laden flows. The approach is extensively validated against a range of benchmark problems. Contrary to literature, the scaling properties are demonstrated on state-of-the-art high performance computing systems. Finally, the proposed algorithm is compatible with unstructured, curved high-order grids which permits the handling of complex geometries as is emphasized by application of the framework to large-scale application cases.</description>

      <title>Not-Quite-Transcendental Functions For Logarithmic Interpolation of Tabulated Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: From tabulated nuclear and degenerate equations of state to photon and neutrino opacities, to nuclear reaction rates: tabulated data is ubiquitous in computational astrophysics. The dynamic range that must be covered by these tables typically spans many orders of magnitude. Here we present a novel strategy for accurately and performantly interpolating tabulated data that spans these large dynamic ranges. We demonstrate the efficacy of this strategy in tabulated lookups for nuclear and terrestrial equations of state. We show that this strategy is a faster \textit{drop-in} replacement for linear interpolation of logarithmic grids.</description>

      <title>Enabling GPU Portability into the Numba-JITed Monte Carlo Particle Transport Code MC/DC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Center for Exascale Monte Carlo Neutron Transport is developing Monte Carlo / Dynamic Code (MC/DC) as a portable Monte Carlo neutron transport package for rapid numerical methods exploration on CPU- and GPU-based high-performance computers. In this paper, we describe MC/DC's current event-based GPU algorithm as well as the just-in-time (JIT) compilation scheme we use to enable GPU operability on Nvidia and AMD GPUs from MC/DC's Python source. To analyze performance, we conduct runtime tests of the C5G7 k-eigenvalue benchmark problem and a continuous-energy infinite pin cell on Nvidia Tesla V100 GPU, AMD MI250X GPU, and the AMD MI300A APU and make comparison to a dual-socket Intel Xeon Sapphire Rapid CPU node. We found that for the multi-group C5G7 benchmark problem, we respectively see a 15$\times$, 0.7$\times$, 12$\times$ speedup on a V100, MI250X, and MI300A over 112 Intel Xeon CPU cores. For the continuous-energy infinite pin-cell benchmark, we found speedups of 5$\times$, 3$\times$, 4$\times$ on a V100, MI250X, and MI300A, respectively, over the same CPU node.</description>

      <title>Finite-Size Effects in Aging can be Interpreted as Sub-Aging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04843v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Systems brought out of equilibrium through a rapid quench from a disordered initial state into an ordered phase undergo physical aging in the form of phase-ordering kinetics, with characteristic dynamical scaling. In many systems, notably glasses, dynamical scaling is often described through sub-aging, where a phenomenological sub-aging exponent $0&lt;\mu&lt; 1$ is empirically chosen to achieve the best possible data collapse. Here it is shown that finite-size effects modify the dynamical scaling behavior, away from simple aging with $\mu=1$ towards $\mu&lt;1$, such that phenomenologically it would appear as sub-aging. This is exemplified for the exactly solved dynamical spherical model in dimensions $2&lt;d&lt;4$ and numerical simulations of the two-dimensional Ising model, with short-ranged and long-ranged interactions.</description>

      <title>Photon-recycling dielectric laser accelerator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05038v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a photon-recycling dielectric laser accelerator (DLA) system based on silicon photonic device. Our DLA system employs guided electromagnetic waves as a primary energy source, modulated to inject into the electron-light interaction region to accelerate or modulate electron beams and recycled the energy for the next round-trip. Long-distance acceleration takes place as electrons interact with the pre-modulated light field. Our loop recycles post-interaction light field, enabling photons reuse across successive cycles. To optimize the interaction process, we developed an adaptive algorithm to refine waveguide structures, and identified an "optimal waveguide accelerator" with superior performance on our dataset. We find that the optimized DLA loop only requires low-power light injection to sufficiently sustain high acceleration gradients for continuous electron beams. Under optimal electron beam intensity, the system achieves exceptionally high photon utilization, ensuring that nearly all injected light power transferred to electrons. Using spectral analysis, we demonstrate that the optimal waveguide also operates as an electron energy filter, selecting and manipulating phase-matched electrons over a broad energy range, even for quantum electron wavefunction shaping. Our photon-recycling DLA setup is not only suitable for low-energy beam accelerators, but also offers versatility as a beam filter or a narrow energy selection combined with other optical elements, the total setup can be further applied to explore free electron quantum optics engaging with the advancing field of photonic integrated circuits.</description>

      <title>Magnetization reversal of finite-length Co and Fe atomic chains on Pt(332) surface: numerical calculations and a new theoretical approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05047v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Different mechanisms of magnetization reversal in finite-length Co and Fe chains on the Pt(332) surface have been investigated, taking into account the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. It has been found that the magnetization reversal in short atomic chains occurs through the simultaneous reversal of all magnetic moments. In contrast, the magnetization reversal in long atomic chains is facilitated by the formation of domain walls, which exhibit distinct structures for Co and Fe atomic chains. Using the geodesic nudged elastic band method, we have determined the energy barriers for magnetization reversal in chains consisting of 5 to 100 atoms. Additionally, the frequency prefactors have been calculated within the framework of the harmonic approximation of transition state theory. Notably, the dependencies of these prefactors on chain length and external magnetic field are significant and non-monotonic. We propose a theoretical approach that qualitatively describes the numerical dependencies for both the energy barriers and the frequency prefactors. The magnetization curves derived from our theoretical estimates show qualitative agreement with the results of numerical calculations. This analytical approach enables the estimation of the coercive force of atomic chains across a wide range of lengths, temperatures, sweeping rates, and model parameters. The proposed theoretical framework is applicable not only to the Co and Fe chains on the Pt(332) surface but also to a broad class of one-dimensional magnetic systems.</description>

      <title>On the Calculation of Pressure Derivatives in Mean-Field Thermal Field Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05192v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate determination of higher-order pressure derivatives with respect to temperature $T$ and chemical potential $\mu$ is essential for analyzing critical phenomena, transport properties, and phase transitions in strongly interacting matter. However, standard numerical differentiation methods often suffer from large numerical instabilities, especially in more complex mean-field thermal field theories. In this work, we present an approach that systematically derives symbolic expressions for these higher-order derivatives, bypassing the numerical instabilities commonly encountered in conventional methods. Our formalism is based on a Jacobian technique, which ensures that the dependence of internal mean-field parameters is fully incorporated into the final symbolic expressions. We illustrate the effectiveness of this method using the two-flavor Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model as an example and show that it is particularly advantageous near phase transitions and at low temperatures, where numerical differentiation becomes highly sensitive.</description>

      <title>Local particle refinement in terramechanical simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05300v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The discrete element method (DEM) is a powerful tool for simulating granular soils, but its high computational demand often results in extended simulation times. While the effect of particle size has been extensively studied, the potential benefits of spatially scaling particle sizes are less explored. We systematically investigate a local particle refinement method's impact on reducing computational effort while maintaining accuracy. We first conduct triaxial tests to verify that bulk mechanical properties are preserved under local particle refinement. Then, we perform pressure-sinkage and shear-displacement tests, comparing our method to control simulations with homogeneous particle size. We evaluate $36$ different DEM beds with varying aggressiveness in particle refinement. Our results show that this approach, depending on refinement aggressiveness, can significantly reduce particle count by $2.3$ to $25$ times and simulation times by $3.1$ to $43$ times, with normalized errors ranging from $3.4$\% to $11$\% compared to high-resolution reference simulations. The approach maintains a high resolution at the soil surface, where interaction is high, while allowing larger particles below the surface. The results demonstrate that substantial computational savings can be achieved without significantly compromising simulation accuracy. This method can enhance the efficiency of DEM simulations in terramechanics applications.</description>

      <title>Solar wind entry into Mercury's magnetosphere: Simulation results for the second swingby of BepiColombo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05363v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context. We use a global 3D hybrid plasma model to investigate the interaction between Mercury's magnetosphere and the solar wind for the second BepiColombo swingby, evaluate magnetospheric regions, and study the typical energy profile of protons. Aims. The objective of this study is to gain a better understanding of solar wind entry and analyze simulated plasma data along a trajectory using BepiColombo swingby 2 conditions, with the goal of enhancing our comprehension of measurement data and potentially providing forecasts for future swingbys. Methods. To model Mercury's plasma environment, we used the hybrid code AIKEF and developed a method to extract the particle (ion) data in order to compute the proton energy spectrum along the trajectory of BepiColombo during its second Mercury swingby on June 23, 2022. We evaluate magnetopause and bow shock stand-off distances under average upstream solar wind conditions with the Interplanetary Magnetic Field (IMF) condition derived from the BepiColombo magnetic field measurements during the second Mercury swingby. Results. We found that the magnetosheath on the quasi-perpendicular (dusk) side of the bow shock is thicker than that on the quasi-parallel (dawn) side, where a foreshock is formed. Multiple plasma populations can be extracted from our modeled energy spectra that assist in identifying magnetospheric regions. We observed protons of solar wind origin entering Mercury's magnetosphere. Their energies range from a few electron volts in the magnetosphere up to 10 keV in the magnetosheath.</description>

      <title>Large Physics Models: Towards a collaborative approach with Large Language Models and Foundation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05382v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper explores ideas and provides a potential roadmap for the development and evaluation of physics-specific large-scale AI models, which we call Large Physics Models (LPMs). These models, based on foundation models such as Large Language Models (LLMs) - trained on broad data - are tailored to address the demands of physics research. LPMs can function independently or as part of an integrated framework. This framework can incorporate specialized tools, including symbolic reasoning modules for mathematical manipulations, frameworks to analyse specific experimental and simulated data, and mechanisms for synthesizing theories and scientific literature. We begin by examining whether the physics community should actively develop and refine dedicated models, rather than relying solely on commercial LLMs. We then outline how LPMs can be realized through interdisciplinary collaboration among experts in physics, computer science, and philosophy of science. To integrate these models effectively, we identify three key pillars: Development, Evaluation, and Philosophical Reflection. Development focuses on constructing models capable of processing physics texts, mathematical formulations, and diverse physical data. Evaluation assesses accuracy and reliability by testing and benchmarking. Finally, Philosophical Reflection encompasses the analysis of broader implications of LLMs in physics, including their potential to generate new scientific understanding and what novel collaboration dynamics might arise in research. Inspired by the organizational structure of experimental collaborations in particle physics, we propose a similarly interdisciplinary and collaborative approach to building and refining Large Physics Models. This roadmap provides specific objectives, defines pathways to achieve them, and identifies challenges that must be addressed to realise physics-specific large scale AI models.</description>

      <title>Thermal Stoner-Wohlfarth Model for Magnetodynamics of Single Domain Nanoparticles: Implementation and Validation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06136v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the thermal Stoner-Wohlfarth (tSW) model and apply it in the context of Molecular Dynamics simulations. The model is validated against an ensemble of immobilized, randomly oriented uniaxial particles (solid superparamagnet) and a classical dilute ferrofluid for different combinations of anisotropy strength and magnetic field/moment coupling, at a fixed temperature. We compare analytical and simulation results to quantify the viability of the tSW model in reproducing the equilibrium (with and without dipole-dipole interactions) and dynamic (without dipole-dipole interactions) properties of magnetic soft matter systems. We show that if the anisotropy of a particle is more than five times higher than the thermal fluctuations, tSW is applicable and efficient. This approach allows one to consider the interplay between N\'eel and Brownian relaxation, often neglected in the fixed point-dipole representation-based magnetic soft matter theoretical investigations.</description>

      <title>Radiative hydrodynamic equations with nonequilibrium radiative transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01827v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a kinetic model for the coupled evolution of radiation, electrons, and ions in a radiation plasma system. The model is solved using two methods. The gas-kinetic scheme (GKS) for electron and ion hydrodynamics and the unified gas-kinetic scheme (UGKS) for non-equilibrium radiative transfer. The UGKS accurately captures multiscale photon transport from free streaming to diffusion across varying fluid opacities. This approach enables the scheme to model equilibrium plasma with non-equilibrium radiation transport. The model is validated through several test cases, including radiative transfer in kinetic and diffusion regimes, Marshak wave, Radiative shock, 3T(three-temperature) double lax shock tube problem, two-dimensional Sedov blast wave, and two-dimensional tophat based problem. These tests demonstrate the current scheme's capability to handle diverse radiation plasma scenarios.</description>

      <title>Exact and Efficient Representation of Totally Anti-Symmetric Functions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.05064v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper concerns the long-standing question of representing (totally) anti-symmetric functions in high dimensions. We propose a new ansatz based on the composition of an odd function with a fixed set of anti-symmetric basis functions. We prove that this ansatz can exactly represent every anti-symmetric and continuous function and the number of basis functions has efficient scaling with respect to dimension (number of particles). The singular locus of the anti-symmetric basis functions is precisely identified.</description>

      <title>Realizing multiband states with ultracold dipolar quantum simulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14914v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The manipulation of dipolar interactions within ultracold molecular ensembles represents a pivotal advancement in experimental physics, aiming at the emulation of quantum phenomena unattainable through mere contact interactions. Our study uncovers regimes of multiband occupation which allow to probe more realistic, complex long-range interacting lattice models with ultracold dipolar simulators. By mapping out experimentally relevant ranges of potential depths, interaction strengths, particle fillings, and geometric configurations, we calculate the agreement between the state prepared in the quantum simulator and a target lattice state. We do so by separately calculating numerically exact many-body wave functions in the continuum and single- or multiband lattice representations, and building their many-body state overlaps. Our findings reveal that for shallow lattices and stronger interactions above half filling, multiband population increases, resulting in fundamentally different ground states than the ones observed in simple lowest-band descriptions, e.g. striped vs checkerboard states. A wide range of probed parameter regimes in its turn provides a systematic and quantitative blueprint for realizing multiband states with two-dimensional quantum simulators employing ultracold dipolar molecules.</description>

      <title>Deconvoluting Thermomechanical Effects in X-ray Diffraction Data using Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09447v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: X-ray diffraction is ideal for probing sub-surface state during complex or rapid thermomechanical loading of crystalline materials. However, challenges arise as the size of diffraction volumes increases due to spatial broadening and inability to deconvolute the effects of different lattice deformation mechanisms. Here, we present a novel approach to use combinations of physics-based modeling and machine learning to deconvolve thermal and mechanical elastic strains for diffraction data analysis. The method builds on a previous effort to extract thermal strain distribution information from diffraction data. The new approach is applied to extract the evolution of thermomechanical state during laser melting of an Inconel 625 wall specimen which produces significant residual stress upon cooling. A combination of heat transfer and fluid flow, elasto-plasticity, and X-ray diffraction simulations are used to generate training data for machine-learning (Gaussian Process Regression, GPR) models that map diffracted intensity distributions to underlying thermomechanical strain fields. First-principles density functional theory is used to determine accurate temperature-dependent thermal expansion and elastic stiffness used for elasto-plasticity modeling. The trained GPR models are found to be capable of deconvoluting the effects of thermal and mechanical strains, in addition to providing information about underlying strain distributions, even from complex diffraction patterns with irregularly shaped peaks.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of uncertainty estimations for Gaussian process regression based machine learning interatomic potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20398v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Uncertainty estimations for machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) are crucial for quantifying model error and identifying informative training samples in active learning strategies. In this study, we evaluate uncertainty estimations of Gaussian process regression (GPR)-based MLIPs, including the predictive GPR standard deviation and ensemble-based uncertainties. We do this in terms of calibration and in terms of impact on model performance in an active learning scheme. We consider GPR models with Coulomb and Smooth Overlap of Atomic Positions (SOAP) representations as inputs to predict potential energy surfaces and excitation energies of molecules. Regarding calibration, we find that ensemble-based uncertainty estimations show already poor global calibration (e.g., averaged over the whole test set). In contrast, the GPR standard deviation shows good global calibration, but when grouping predictions by their uncertainty, we observe a systematical bias for predictions with high uncertainty. Although an increasing uncertainty correlates with an increasing bias, the bias is not captured quantitatively by the uncertainty. Therefore, the GPR standard deviation can be useful to identify predictions with a high bias and error but, without further knowledge, should not be interpreted as a quantitative measure for a potential error range. Selecting the samples with the highest GPR standard deviation from a fixed configuration space leads to a model that overemphasizes the borders of the configuration space represented in the fixed dataset. This may result in worse performance in more densely sampled areas but better generalization for extrapolation tasks.</description>

      <title>Short-Range Order Based Ultra Fast Large-Scale Modeling of High-Entropy Alloys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18906v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: High-Entropy Alloys (HEAs) exhibit complex atomic interactions, with short-range order (SRO) playing a critical role in determining their properties. Traditional methods, such as Monte Carlo generator of Special Quasirandom Structures within the Alloy Theoretic Automated Toolkit (ATAT-mcsqs), Super-cell Random Approximates (SCRAPs), and hybrid Monte Carlo-Molecular Dynamics (MC-MD) are often hindered by limited system sizes and high computational costs. In response, we introduce PyHEA, a Python-based toolkit with a high-performance C++ core that leverages global and local search algorithms, incremental SRO computations, and GPU acceleration for unprecedented efficiency. When constructing random HEAs, PyHEA achieves speedups exceeding 133,000x and 13,900x over ATAT-mcsqs and SCRAPs, respectively, while maintaining high accuracy. PyHEA also offers a flexible workflow that allows users to incorporate target SRO values from external simulations (e.g., LAMMPS or density functional theory (DFT)), thereby enabling more realistic and customizable HEA models. As a proof of concept, PyHEA successfully replicated literature results for a 256,000-atom Fe-Cr-Co system within minutes-an order-of-magnitude improvement over hybrid MC-MD approaches. This dramatic acceleration opens new possibilities for bridging theoretical insights and practical applications, paving the way for the efficient design of next-generation HEAs.</description>

      <title>Trading Devil RL: Backdoor attack via Stock market, Bayesian Optimization and Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17908v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the rapid development of generative artificial intelligence, particularly large language models, a number of sub-fields of deep learning have made significant progress and are now very useful in everyday applications. For example, well-known financial institutions simulate a wide range of scenarios for various models created by their research teams using reinforcement learning, both before production and after regular operations. In this work, we propose a backdoor attack that focuses solely on data poisoning. This particular backdoor attack is classified as an attack without prior consideration or trigger, and we name it FinanceLLMsBackRL. Our aim is to examine the potential effects of large language models that use reinforcement learning systems for text production or speech recognition, finance, physics, or the ecosystem of contemporary artificial intelligence models.</description>
