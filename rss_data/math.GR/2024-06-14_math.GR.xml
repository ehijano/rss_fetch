      <title>Finite subgroups of the profinite completion of good groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08639v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a residually finite, good group of finite virtual cohomological dimension. We prove that the natural monomorphism $G\hookrightarrow\hat{G}$ induces a bijective correspondence between conjugacy classes of finite $p$-subgroups of $G$ and those of its profinite completion $\hat{G}$. Moreover, we prove that the centralizers and normalizers in $\hat{G}$ of finite $p$-subgroups of $G$ are the closures of the respective centralizers and normalizers in $G$. With somewhat more restrictive hypotheses, we prove the same results for finite solvable subgroups of $G$. In the last section, we give a few applications of this theorem to hyperelliptic mapping class groups and virtually compact special toral relatively hyperbolic groups (these include fundamental groups of $3$-orbifolds and of uniform standard arithmetic hyperbolic orbifolds).</description>

      <title>The cancellation property for projective modules over integral group rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We obtain a partial classification of the finite groups $G$ for which the integral group ring $\mathbb{Z} G$ has projective cancellation, i.e. for which $P \oplus \mathbb{Z} G \cong Q \oplus \mathbb{Z} G$ implies $P \cong Q$ for projective $\mathbb{Z} G$-modules $P$ and $Q$. To do this, we prove a cancellation theorem based on a relative version of the Eichler condition and use it to establish the cancellation property for a large class of finite groups. We then use a group theoretic argument to precisely determine the class of groups not covered by this result. The final classification is then obtained by applying results of Swan, Chen and Bley-Hofmann-Johnston which show failure of the cancellation property for certain groups.</description>

      <title>Computing congruences of finite inverse semigroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09281v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we present an algorithm for computing a congruence on an inverse semigroup from a collection of generating pairs. This algorithm uses a myriad of techniques from computational group theory, automata, and the theory of inverse semigroups. An initial implementation of this algorithm outperforms existing implementations by several orders of magnitude.</description>

      <title>On a generalization of Cannon's conjecture for cubulated hyperbolic groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08779v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that cubulated hyperbolic groups with spherical boundary of dimension 3 or at least 5 are virtually fundamental groups of closed, orientable, aspherical manifolds, provided that there are sufficiently many quasi-convex, codimension-1 subgroups whose limit sets are locally flat subspheres. The proof is based on ideas used by Markovic in his work on Cannon's conjecture for cubulated hyperbolic groups with 2-sphere boundary.</description>

      <title>Projection algebras and free projection- and idempotent-generated regular $*$-semigroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09109v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to introduce a new family of semigroups - the free projection-generated regular $*$-semigroups - and initiate their systematic study. Such a semigroup $PG(P)$ is constructed from a projection algebra $P$, using the recent groupoid approach to regular $*$-semigroups. The assignment $P\mapsto PG(P)$ is a left adjoint to the forgetful functor that maps a regular $*$-semigroup $S$ to its projection algebra $P(S)$. In fact, the category of projection algebras is coreflective in the category of regular $*$-semigroups. The algebra $P(S)$ uniquely determines the biordered structure of the idempotents $E(S)$, up to isomorphism, and this leads to a category equivalence between projection algebras and regular $*$-biordered sets. As a consequence, $PG(P)$ can be viewed as a quotient of the classical free idempotent-generated (regular) semigroups $IG(E)$ and $RIG(E)$, where $E=E(PG(P))$; this is witnessed by a number of presentations in terms of generators and defining relations. The semigroup $PG(P)$ can also be viewed as the fundamental groupoid of a simplicial complex explicitly constructed from $P$. The theory is then illustrated on a number of examples. In one direction, the free construction applied to the projection algebras of adjacency semigroups yields a new family of graph-based path semigroups. In another, it turns out that, remarkably, the Temperley-Lieb monoid $TL_n$ is the free regular $*$-semigroup over its own projection algebra $P(TL_n)$.</description>

      <title>Cohomology on the centric orbit category of a fusion system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.05361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.05361v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the higher derived limits of mod $p$ cohomology on the centric orbit category of a saturated fusion system on a finite $p$-group. It is an open problem whether all such higher limits vanish. This is known in many cases, including for fusion systems realized by a finite group and for many classes of fusion systems which are not so realized. We prove that the higher limits of $H^j$ vanish provided $j$ is small relative to $p$, by showing that the same is true for the contravariant part of a simple Mackey composition factor of $H^j$ under the same conditions.</description>

      <title>Recognisability of the sporadic groups by the isomorphism types of their prime graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.10113v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The prime graph of a finite group $G$ is the labelled graph $\Gamma(G)$ with vertices the prime divisors of $|G|$ and edges the pairs $\{p,q\}$ for which $G$ contains an element of order $pq$. A group $G$ is recognisable by its prime graph if every group $H$ with $\Gamma(H)=\Gamma(G)$ is isomorphic to $G$. Cameron and Maslova have shown that every group that is recognisable by its prime graph is almost simple, which justifies the significant amount of attention that has been given to determining which simple (or almost simple) groups are recognisable by their prime graphs. This problem has been completely solved for certain families of simple groups, including the sporadic groups. A natural extension of the problem is to determine which groups are recognisable by their unlabelled prime graphs, i.e. by the isomorphism types of their prime graphs. There seem to be only very limited results in this direction in the literature. Here we determine which of the sporadic finite simple groups are recognisable by the isomorphism types of their prime graphs. We also show that for every sporadic group $G$ that is not recognisable by the isomorphism type of $\Gamma(G)$, there are infinitely many groups $H$ with $\Gamma(H) \cong \Gamma(G)$.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of primitive elements under group actions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16769v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate group actions in which certain primitive elements fix a point, while not all group elements possess this property when acting upon some space. Using similar dynamical tools, we introduce the notion of Nielsen girth and prove the existence of groups with infinite girth but having finite Nielsen girth.</description>

      <title>Characterizing closed curves on Riemann surfaces via homology groups of coverings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1111.2373</link>
      <description>arXiv:1111.2373v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $S$ be a hyperbolic oriented Riemann surface of finite type. The main purpose of this paper is to show that non-trivial geometric intersection between closed curves on $S$ is detected by some symplectic submodules they naturally determine in the homology groups of the compactifications of unramified $p$-coverings of $S$, for $p\geq 2$ a fixed prime. In particular, this gives a characterization of simple closed curves on $S$ in terms of homology groups of $p$-coverings. We then define a $p$-adic Reidemeister pairing on the fundamental group of $S$ and show that the free homotopy classes of two loops have trivial geometric intersection if and only if they are orthogonal with respect to this pairing. As an application, we give a geometric argument to prove that oriented surface groups are conjugacy $p$-separable (a combinatorial proof of this fact was recentely given by Paris).</description>

      <title>Non-Hausdorff germinal groupoids for actions of countable groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.06340v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study conditions under which the germinal groupoid associated to a minimal equicontinuous action of a countable group on a Cantor set has non-Hausdorff topology. We develop a new criterion, which serves as an obstruction for the \'etale topology on the groupoid to be non-Hausdorff. We use this and other criteria to study the topology of germinal groupoids for a few classes of actions. In particular, we give examples of families of contracting and non-contracting self-similar groups, which are amenable and whose actions have associated germinal groupoids with non-Hausdorff topology.</description>

      <title>On Morita equivalences with endopermutation source and isotypies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20268v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new type of equivalence between blocks of finite group algebras called an almost isotypy. An almost isotypy restricts to a weak isotypy in Brou\'{e}'s original definition, and it is slightly weaker than Linckelmann's version. We show that a bimodule of two block algebras of finite groups - which has an endopermutation module as a source and which induces a Morita equivalence - gives rise to an almost isotypy if and only if the character values of a (hence any) source are rational integers. This generalises a previous result of Huang and Zhou. Consequently, if two blocks are Morita equivalent via a bimodule with endopermutation source, then they are almost isotypic.</description>
