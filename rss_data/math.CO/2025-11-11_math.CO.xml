      <title>On $\{k\}$-Roman graphs: complexity of recognition and the case of split graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05674v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a positive integer $k$, a $\{k\}$-Roman dominating function of a graph $G = (V,E)$ is a function $f\colon V \rightarrow \{0,1,\ldots,k\}$ satisfying $f (N(v)) \geq k$ for each vertex $v\in V$ with $f (v) = 0$. Every graph $G$ satisfies $\gamma_{\{Rk\}}(G) \leq k\gamma(G)$, where $\gamma_{\{Rk\}}(G)$ denotes the minimum weight of a $\{k\}$-Roman dominating function of $G$ and $\gamma(G)$ is the domination number of $G$. In this work we study graphs for which the equality is reached, called \emph{$\{k\}$-Roman graphs}. This extends the concept of $\{k\}$-Roman trees studied by Wang et al. in 2021 to general graphs. We prove that for every $k\geq 3$, the problem of recognizing $\{k\}$-Roman graphs is NP-hard, even when restricted to split graphs. We provide partial answers to the question of which split graphs are $\{2\}$-Roman: we characterize $\{2\}$-Roman split graphs that can be decomposed with respect to the split join operation into two smaller split graphs and classify the $\{k\}$-Roman property within two specific families of split graphs that are prime with respect to the split join operation: suns and their complements.</description>

      <title>Restricted inversion polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05676v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a finite subset $I$ of positive integers, the descent polynomial $\mathcal{D}(I;n)$ counts the number of permutations in $S_n$ that have descent set $I$. We generalize descent polynomials by considering permutations with a specific subset $S$ of common inversions called $\mathbf{h}$-inversions, where $\mathbf{h} = (\mathbf{h}(1), \mathbf{h}(2), \ldots )$ is a weakly increasing sequence of positive integers such that $\mathbf{h}(i)&gt; i$. We prove that this more general count, denoted by $\mathcal{I}_\mathbf{h}(S;n)$, is also a polynomial. We give three explicit expansions for $\mathcal{I}_\mathbf{h}(S;n)$, prove the coefficients for two of these expansions are log-concave, and define a graded generalization.</description>

      <title>Pieri Rule for GQs Computed via Strict Decomposition Tableaux</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05734v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: $GQ$ functions are symmetric functions indexed by strict partitions that represent $K$-theoretic Schubert classes in the Lagrangian Grassmannian. Buch and Ravikumar proved a Pieri rule for expanding $GQ_{\lambda}\cdot GQ_p$ in terms of $GQ$s via certain shifted skew tableaux. In this paper we identify an alternative family of shifted tableaux that enumerates this Pieri rule. This partially resolves a conjecture from previous work that these tableaux enumerate the expansion of $GQ_{\lambda} \cdot GQ_{\tau}$ in terms of $GQ$s where $\tau$ is a trapezoid shape.</description>

      <title>Iterative Generation and Generalized Degree Distribution of Higher-Order Fractal Scale-Free Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05869v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fractals represent one of the fundamental manifestations of complexity, and fractal networks serve as tools for characterizing and investigating the fractal structures and properties of large-scale systems. Higher-order networks have emerged as a research hotspot due to their ability to express interactions among multiple nodes. This study proposes an iterative generation model for higher-order fractal networks. The iteration is controlled by three parameters: the dimension K of the simplicial complex, the multiplier m, and the iteration count t. The constructed network is a pure simplicial complex. Theoretical analysis using the similarity dimension and experimental verification using the box-counting dimension demonstrate that the generated networks exhibit fractal characteristics. When the multiplier m is large, the generalized degree distribution of the generated networks is characterized by its scale-free nature.</description>

      <title>On Maximal Left-Compressed Intersecting Families Generated by a Collection of Subsets of [$n$]</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05917v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a characterization of maximal left-compressed families based on their generating sets $\mathcal{G}\subseteq 2^{[n]}$. We show that there is a one-to-one correspondence between maximal left-compressed families $\mathcal{A}\subseteq \binom{[n]}{k}$ and principal generating sets. Moreover, we give a complete description of maximal left-compressed intersecting families having exactly two maximal generators. Based on this, for any $X\subseteq [2,n]$, we compare $\mathcal{A}(X)$, where $\mathcal{A}$ is a rank-2 maximal left-compressed intersecting family with exactly two maximal generators, and $\mathcal{S}(X)$, where $\mathcal{S}$ denotes the Star family.</description>

      <title>On the Anti-Ramsey Number Under Edge Deletion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: According to a study by Erd\H{o}s et al. in 1975, the anti-Ramsey number of a graph \(G\), denoted as \(AR(n, G)\), is defined as the maximum number of colors that can be used in an edge-coloring of the complete graph \(K_n\) without creating a rainbow copy of \(G\). In this paper, we investigate the anti-Ramsey number under edge deletion and demonstrate that both decreasing and unchanging are possible outcomes. For three non-negative integers \(k\), \(t\), and \(n\), let \(G = kP_4 \cup tP_2\). Let \(E'\) be a subset of the edge set \(E(G)\) such that every endpoint of these edges has a degree of two in \(G\). We prove that if one of the conditions (i) \(t \geq k + 1 \geq 2\) and \(n \geq 8k + 2t - 4\); (ii) \(k, t \geq 1\) and \(n = 4k + 2t\); (iii) \(k = 1\), \(t \geq 1\), and \(n \geq 2t + 4\), occurs then the behavior of the anti-Ramsey number remains consistent when the edges in \(E'\) are removed from \(G\), i.e., \(AR(n, G) = AR(n, G - E')\). However, this is not the case when \(k \geq 2\), \(t = 0\), and \(n=4k\). As a result, we calculate \(AR(kP_4 \cup tP_2)\) for the cases: (i) \(t \geq k + 1 \geq 2\) and \(n \geq 8k + 2t - 4\); (ii) \(k, t \geq 1\) and \(n = 4k + 2t\); (iii) \(k = 1\), \(t \geq 0\), and \(n \geq 2t + 4\); (iv) \(k \geq 1\), \(t = 0\), and \(n = 4k\).</description>

      <title>Characterizing all $K_4$-free well-edge-dominated graphs of girth 3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a graph $G$, a set $F$ of edges is an edge dominating set if all edges in $G$ are either in $F$ or adjacent to an edge in $F$. $G$ is said to be well-edge-dominated if every minimal edge dominating set is also minimum. In 2022, it was proven that there are precisely three nonbipartite, well-edge-dominated graphs with girth at least four. Then in 2025, a characterization of all well-edge-dominated graphs containing exactly one triangle was found. In this paper, we characterize all well-edge-dominated graphs that contain a triangle and yet are $K_4$-free.</description>

      <title>Growing Avoiders from the Right: An Operator-Theoretic Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Marcus and Tardos \cite{MarcusTardos2004} proved the Stanley-Wilf conjecture by reducing pattern avoidance to an extremal problem on $0$-$1$ matrices. We give a parallel proof that stays in the ``grow from the right'' world of enumerative combinatorics. A $v$-avoiding permutation is built by right insertion, we keep a pruned family of forbidden ranks (the \emph{frontier}), and the insertion step becomes a nonnegative transfer operator on a doubly weighted $\ell^\infty$ space. A length-quadratic penalty makes this operator a finite-rank perturbation of a contraction, so a standard core/tail argument \cite{IonescuTulceaMarinescu1950,Hennion1993} yields quasi-compactness and analyticity of the growth series, hence finite exponential growth for Av$(v)$.
  The same operator skeleton applies, with the same bounded-frontier check, to two natural extensions that are visible to right-to-left growth: (i) right-anchored vincular patterns \cite{BabsonSteingrimsson2000}, and (ii) mesh patterns \cite{BrandenClaesson2011} whose shaded cells lie in a fixed right strip. This appears to give the first general Stanley-Wilf type statements for these two subclasses. Our formulation is completely internal -- we never pass to $0$-$1$ matrices -- and it isolates the single pattern-dependent step (a bounded frontier increment) from the rest of the operator-theoretic machinery.</description>

      <title>Kontsevich graphs act on Nambu-Poisson brackets, VI. Open problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kontsevich's graphs from deformation quantisation allow encoding multi-vectors whose coefficients are differential-polynomial in components of Poisson brackets on finite-dimensional affine manifolds. The calculus of Kontsevich graphs can be made dimension-specific for the class of Nambu--Poisson brackets given by Jacobian determinants. Using the Kontsevich--Nambu micro-graphs in dimensions $d\geqslant 2$, we explore the open problem of (non)triviality for Kontsevich's tetrahedral graph cocycle action on the space of Nambu--Poisson brackets. We detect a conjecturally infinite new set of differential-polynomial identities for Jacobian determinants of arbitrary sizes $d\times d$.</description>

      <title>When Arcs Extend Uniquely: A Higher-Dimensional Generalization of Barlotti's Result</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this short communication, we generalize a classical result of Barlotti concerning the unique extendability of arcs in the projective plane to higher-dimensional projective spaces. Specifically, we show that for integers \( k \ge 3 \), \( s \ge 0 \), and prime power \( q \), any \((n, k + s - 1)\)-arc in PG\((k - 1, q)\) of size \( n = (s+1)(q+1) + k - 3 \) admits a unique extension to a maximal arc, provided \( s + 2 \mid q \) and \( s &lt; q - 2 \). This result extends the classical characterizations of maximal arcs in PG\((2,q)\) and connects naturally to the theory of A$^s$MDS codes. Our findings establish conditions under which linear codes of given dimension and Singleton defect can be uniquely extended to maximal-length projective codes.</description>

      <title>Multi-scale symmetry analysis in molecular structures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.06286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological data analysis (TDA), as a relatively recent approach, has demonstrated great potential in capturing the intrinsic and robust structural features of complex data. While persistent homology, as a core tool of TDA, focuses on characterizing geometric shapes and topological structures, the automorphism groups of Vietoris-Rips complexes can capture the structured symmetry features of data. In this work, we propose a multi-scale symmetry analysis approach that leverages persistent automorphism modules to quantify variations in symmetries across scales. By modifying the category of graphs and constructing a suitable functor from the graph category to the category of modules, we ensure that the persistent automorphism module forms a genuine persistence module. Furthermore, we apply this framework to the structural analysis of fullerenes, predicting the stability of 12 fullerene molecules with a competitive correlation coefficient of 0.979.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.06308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we study (102,000)-avoiding inversion sequences with a fixed number of distinct elements. By introducing simple H-paths, we derive the trivariate generating function for these inversion sequences with respect to their length, number of distinct elements, and rank. As consequences, we obtain an explicit formula for the number of (102,000)-avoiding inversion sequences with fixed length and number of distinct elements and we also provide a formula for those with fixed number of distinct elements and rank. In particular, we show that both the number of (102,000)-avoiding inversion sequences with a fixed number of distinct elements whose maximum element occurs exactly once and the number of those whose rank is zero are given by the 3-Fuss-Catalan numbers.</description>

      <title>On the Asymptotic Palindrome Density of Fibonacci Infinite Words</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06485v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the combinatorial and density properties of infinite words generated by Fibonacci-type morphisms, focusing on their subword structure, palindrome density, and extremal statistical behaviors. Using the morphism $0 \to 01$, $1 \to 0$, we define the word $\mathbb{Y}$ and establish new results relating its density components $\mathrm{dens}(\lambda,n)$, $\mathrm{dens}(\alpha,n)$, and $\mathrm{dens}(\beta,n)$, deriving explicit formulae and bounds on their behavior. We further prove a general density theorem for infinite words with paired subwords, showing that the density is bounded above by $\frac{1}{\varphi_1}$, where $\varphi_1 = (1 + \sqrt{5})/2$ is the golden ratio. Our approach connects the structure of Fibonacci and Thue--Morse sequences to central binomial coefficients, and yields precise asymptotic and combinatorial interpretations for the observed densities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.06539v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses two open questions posed in [27] regarding the balanced domination number in graphs. We show that three new classes of graphs, those of convex polytopes A_n, D_n, and Rn'', are d-balanced. Further, we provide a characterization of d-balancedness for rooted trees with two levels of descendants and prove that each full binary tree is d-balanced. Several results for caterpillar graphs are established. Moreover, we determine and prove the exact balanced domination number for grid graphs. Finally, we conclude by providing several open problems of interest.</description>

      <title>Nonexistence of $srg(19,6,1,2)$: Combinatorial Proof</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06569v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An $srg(19,6,1,2)$ is the graph with the smallest parameter set in the family of strongly regular graphs with parameters $\lambda=1$ and $\mu=2$ for which the respective graph doesn't exist. The proof of that fact is based on algebraic arguments, particularly, on the Integrality Test, the very usefull tool for studying strongly regular graphs. To our best knowledge, there have not been proofs of pure combinatorial nature. In this short paper, we have decided to fill in this gap.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian Subgraphs of Order Seven in $srg(n,k,1,2)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strongly regular graphs are highly symmetrical and can be described fully with just a few parameters, yet the existence of many of them is still under the question. In this paper, we continue the study of the famuly of strongly regular graphs with parameters $\lambda =1$ and $\mu =2$ and establish all of their possible Hamiltonian subgraphs of order seven. By doing so we establish the lower and upper bounds for number of 7-gons, or 7-cycles, in such graphs.</description>

      <title>Concatenative nonmonotonicity and optimal links in HP protein folding models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06617v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The hydrophobic-polar (HP) model represents proteins as binary strings embedded in lattices, with fold quality measured by an energy score. We prove that the optimal fold energy is not monotonic under concatenation for several standard lattices, including the 2D and 3D rectangular, hexagonal, and triangular lattices. In other words, concatenating two polymers can produce a fold with strictly worse optimal energy than one of the polymers alone.
  For closed chains, we show that under the levels-of-hydrophobicity model of Agarwala et al. (1997), proper links can arise as uniquely optimal folds, revealing an unexpected connection between HP models and knot/link theory.</description>

      <title>Connectivity keeping trees in triangle-free graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06622v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 2012, Mader conjectured that for any tree $T$ of order $m$, every $k$-connected graph $G$ with minimum degree at least $\lfloor \frac{3k}{2}\rfloor+m-1$ contains a subtree $T'\cong T$ such that $G-V(T')$ remains $k$-connected. In 2022, Luo, Tian, and Wu considered an analogous problem for bipartite graphs and conjectured that for any tree $T$ with bipartition $(X,Y)$, every $k$-connected bipartite graph $G$ with minimum degree at least $k+\max\{|X|,|Y|\}$ contains a subtree $T'\cong T$ such that $G-V(T')$ remains $k$-connected. In this paper, we relax the bipartite assumption by considering triangle-free graphs and prove that for any tree $T$ of order $m$, every $k$-connected triangle-free graph $G$ with minimum degree at least $2k+3m-4$ contains a subtree $T' \cong T$ such that $G-V(T')$ remains $k$-connected. Furthermore, we establish refined results for specific subclasses such as bipartite graphs or graphs with girth at least five.</description>

      <title>Extremal graphs for the maximum $A_{\alpha}$-spectral radius of graphs with order and size</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1986, Brualdi and Solheid firstly proposed the problem of determining the maximum spectral radius of graphs in the set $\mathcal{H}_{n,m}$ consisting of all simple connected graphs with $n$ vertices and $m$ edges, which is a very tough problem and far from resolved. The $A_{\alpha}$-spectral radius of a simple graph of order $n$, denoted by $\rho_\alpha(G)$, is the largest eigenvalue of the matrix
  $A_{\alpha}(G)$ which is defined as $\alpha D(G)+(1-\alpha)A(G)$ for $0\le \alpha&lt; 1$, where $D(G)$ and $A(G)$ are the degree diagonal and adjacency matrices of $G$, respectively. In this paper, if $r$ is a positive integer, $n&gt;30r$ and $n-1\leq m \le rn-\frac{r(r+1)}{2}$, we characterize all extremal graphs which have the maximum $A_{\alpha}$-spectral radius of graphs in the set $\mathcal{H}_{n,m}$. Moreover, the problem on $A_{\alpha}$-spectral radius proposed by
  Chang and Tam [T.-C. Chang and B.-T. Tam, Graphs of fixed order and size with maximal $A_{\alpha}$-index. Linear Algebra Appl. 673 (2023), 69-100] has been solved.</description>

      <title>Polynomial extensions of Raimi's theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06650v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Raimi's theorem guarantees the existence of a partition of $\mathbb{N}$ into two parts with an unavoidable intersection property: for any finite coloring of $\mathbb{N}$, some color class intersects both parts infinitely many times, after an appropriate shift (translation). We establish a polynomial extension of this result, proving that such intersections persist under polynomial shifts in any dimension. Given non-constant polynomials $P^{(1)},\dots,P^{(f)}\in\mathbb{Z}[x]$ with positive leading coefficients and $P^{(j)}(0)=0$, we construct a partition of $\mathbb{N}^k$ such that for any coloring of $\mathbb{N}^k$ with finitely many colors, there exist $x_0\in \mathbb{N}$ and a single color class that meets all partition pieces after shifts by $x_0+P^{(j)}(h)$ in each of the $k$ coordinate directions, for every $j$ and infinitely many values $h\in \mathbb{N}$. Our proof exploits Weyl's equidistribution theory, Pontryagin duality, and the structure of polynomial relation lattices. We also prove finite analogues in cyclic groups and $SL_2(\mathbb{F}_q)$, establishing quantitative bounds for Raimi-type intersections in finite settings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.06656v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A graph $G$ is $m$-joined if there is an edge between every two disjoint $m$-sets of vertices. In this paper, we prove that for any $\varepsilon&gt;0$ and sufficiently large $m, n\in \mathbb{N}$ with $m \le n^{1-\varepsilon}$, every $n$-vertex $m$-joined graph $G$ contains a minor with density $\Omega\!\left(\tfrac{n}{\sqrt{m}}\right)$, which is best possible up to a constant factor. When $m \ge n^{1-\varepsilon}$, we further show that $G$ contains a clique minor of order $\Omega\!\left(\tfrac{n}{\sqrt{m\log m}}\right)$.</description>

      <title>A combinatorial proof of the trace Cayley-Hamilton theorem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.06689v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The deep interconnection between linear algebra and graph theory allows one to interpret classical matrix invariants through combinatorial structures. To each square matrix A over a commutative ring K, one can associate a weighted directed graph D(A), where the algebraic behavior of A is reflected in the combinatorial properties of D(A). In particular, the determinant and characteristic polynomial of A admit elegant formulations in terms of sign-weighted sums over linear subdigraphs of D(A), thereby providing a graphical interpretation of fundamental algebraic quantities. Building upon this correspondence, we establish a combinatorial proof of the trace Cayley-Hamilton theorem. This theorem furnishes explicit trace identities linking the coefficients of the characteristic polynomial of A with the traces of its successive powers.</description>

      <title>Subspace State Transfer in Coined Quantum Walks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.06750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a transport phenomenon in certain coined quantum walks where a subspace of states localized at a vertex gets transferred to another vertex. We first develop characterizations for perfect and pretty good subspace state transfer using the spectral properties of a Hermitian weighted digraph obtained from the underlying graph. We then provide a polynomial-time algorithm that tests whether perfect pointwise subspace state transfer occurs at an integer step, given that the subspace and coins are rational. Finally, we construct several infinite families of examples that admit perfect pointwise $d$-dimensional subspace state transfer where $d\ge 2$.</description>

      <title>Latin cubes with disjoint subcubes of two orders</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.06768v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a partition $h_1+h_2+\dots+h_k = n$, a latin square of order $n$ with pairwise disjoint subsquares of orders $h_1,\dots ,h_k$ is called a realization. When the values $h_i$ are of at most two sizes, the existence of a realization has been completely determined. However, the existence of a latin cube with pairwise disjoint subcubes of two orders is only partially solved. In this paper, we determine existence for such latin cubes in almost all cases.</description>

      <title>Heaps of rhombic dodecahedra, catalan congruences on alternating sign matrices, and bases of the Temperley-Lieb algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06968v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that the excedance relation on permutations defined by N. Bergeron and L. Gagnon actually extends to a congruence of the lattice on alternating sign matrices. Motivated by this example, we study all lattice congruences of the lattice on alternating sign matrices whose quotient is isomorphic to the Stanley lattice on Dyck paths, which we call catalan congruences. We prove that the maxima of the congruence classes are always covexillary permutations (and all covexillary permutations appear this way), and that the minimal permutations in each class are always precisely the $321$-avoiding permutations. Finally, we show that any choice of representative permutations in each congruence class yield a basis of the Temperley-Lieb algebra with parameter $2$, vastly generalizing the bases arising from the excedance relation.</description>

      <title>A universal theory of switching for combinatorial objects, and applications to complex Hadamard matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07020v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The concept of switching has arisen in several different areas within combinatorics. The act of switching usually transforms a combinatorial object into a non-isomorphic object of the same type, in a way that some key property is preserved. Godsil-McKay switching of graphs preserves the spectrum, switching of designs preserves their parameters, and switching of binary codes preserves the minimum distance. For Hadamard matrices, the switching techniques introduced by Orrick proved to be an incredibly powerful tool when enumerating the Hadamard matrices of order $32$. In this paper, we introduce a universal definition of switching that can be adapted to incorporate these known types of switching. Through this language, we extend Orrick's methods to Butson Hadamard and complex Hadamard matrices. We introduce switchings of these matrices that can be used to construct new, inequivalent matrices. We also consider the concept of trades in complex Hadamard matrices in this terminology, and address an open problem on the permissible size of a trade.</description>

      <title>New small regular graphs of given girth: the cage problem and beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The cage problem concerns finding $(k,g)$-graphs, which are $k$-regular graphs with girth $g$, of the smallest possible number of vertices. The central goal is to determine $n(k,g)$, the minimum order of such a graph, and to identify corresponding extremal graphs. In this paper, we study the cage problem and several of its variants from a computational perspective. Four complementary graph generation algorithms are developed based on exhaustive generation of lifts, a tabu search heuristic, a hill climbing heuristic and excision techniques. Using these methods, we establish new upper bounds for eleven cases of the classical cage problem: $n(3,16) \leq 936$, $n(3,17) \leq 2048$, $n(4,9) \leq 270$, $n(4,10) \leq 320$, $n(4,11) \leq 713$, $n(5,9) \leq 1116$, $n(6,11) \leq 7783$, $n(8,7) \leq 774$, $n(10,7) \leq 1608$, $n(12,7) \leq 2890$ and $n(14,7) \leq 4716$. Notably, our results improve upon several of the best-known bounds, some of which have stood unchanged for 22 years. Moreover, the improvement for $n(4,10)$, from the longstanding upper bound of 384 down to 320, is surprising and constitutes a substantial improvement.
  While the main focus is on the cage problem, we also adapted our algorithms for variants of the cage problem that received attention in the literature. For these variants, additional improvements are obtained, further narrowing the gaps between known lower and upper bounds.</description>

      <title>On maximizing private neighbors in graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07248v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a set $U \subset V$ of vertices in a graph $G = (V, E)$, a {\it private neighbor with respect to the set $U$} is any vertex $w \in V$ having precisely one neighbor, say $v$, in $U$. If $w \in V - U$, then $w$ is called an {\it external private neighbor} of $v$ with respect to $U$. If $w \in U$ then $w$ is called an {\it internal private neighbor} of $v$ with respect to $U$. We also add one special case: if $w \in U$ and $N(w) \cap U = \emptyset$, then we say that $w$ is a {\it self private neighbor} with respect to $U$. By definition, a self private neighbor with respect to $U$ is an isolated vertex in the subgraph of $G$ induced by $U$. In this paper we consider the general problems of trying to find sets of vertices which maximize the number of private neighbors of specific types in a graph. In the process of doing this we define several new maximization parameters of graphs which generalize some known and well-studied parameters of graphs relating to vertex and edge independence, domination and irredundance in graphs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.07285v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Cycle double cover (CDC) conjecture states that for every bridgeless graph $G$, there exists a family $\mathcal{F}$ of cycles such that each edge of the graph is contained in exactly two members of $\mathcal{F}$. Given an embedding of a graph~$G$, an edge $e$ is called a \emph{singular edge} if it is visited twice by the boundary of one face. The CDC conjecture is equivalent to bridgeless cubic graphs having an embedding with no singular edge. In this work, we introduce nontrivial upper bounds on the minimum number of singular edges in an embedding of a cubic graph. Moreover, we present efficient algorithms to find embeddings satisfying these bounds.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We solve a recent question of Caro, Patk\'os and Tuza by determining the exact maximum number of edges in a bipartite connected graph as a function of the longest path it contains as a subgraph and of the number of vertices in each side of the bipartition. This was previously known only in the case where both sides of the bipartition have equal size and the longest path has size at most $5$. We also discuss possible generalizations replacing "path" with some specific types of trees.</description>

      <title>Stable non-minimal fixed points of threshold-linear networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05517v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In threshold-linear networks (TLNs), a fixed point is called minimal if no proper subset of its support is also a fixed point. Curto et al (Advances in Applied Mathematics, 2024) conjectured that every stable fixed point of any TLN must be a minimal fixed point. We provide a counterexample to this conjecture: an explicit competitive TLN on 3 neurons that exhibits a stable fixed point whose support is not minimal (it contains the support of another stable fixed point). We prove that there is no competitive TLN on 2 neurons which contains a stable non-minimal fixed point, so our 3-neuron construction is the smallest such example. By expanding our base example, we show for any positive integers $i, j$ with $i &lt; j-1$ that there exists a competitive TLN with stable fixed point supports $\tau \subsetneq \sigma$ for which $|\tau| = i$ and $|\sigma| = j$. Using a different expansion of our base example, we also show that chains of nested stable fixed points in competitive TLNs can be made arbitrarily long.</description>

      <title>The Complexity of Stackelberg Pricing Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05700v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider Stackelberg pricing games, which are also known as bilevel pricing problems, or combinatorial price-setting problems. This family of problems consists of games between two players: the leader and the follower. There is a market that is partitioned into two parts: the part of the leader and the part of the leader's competitors. The leader controls one part of the market and can freely set the prices for products. By contrast, the prices of the competitors' products are fixed and known in advance. The follower, then, needs to solve a combinatorial optimization problem in order to satisfy their own demands, while comparing the leader's offers to the offers of the competitors. Therefore, the leader has to hit the intricate balance of making an attractive offer to the follower, while at the same time ensuring that their own profit is maximized.
  Pferschy, Nicosia, Pacifici, and Schauer considered the Stackelberg pricing game where the follower solves a knapsack problem. They raised the question whether this problem is complete for the second level of the polynomial hierarchy, i.e., $\Sigma^p_2$-complete. The same conjecture was also made by B\"ohnlein, Schaudt, and Schauer. In this paper, we positively settle this conjecture. Moreover, we show that this result holds actually in a much broader context: The Stackelberg pricing game is $\Sigma^p_2$-complete for over 50 NP-complete problems, including most classics such as TSP, vertex cover, clique, subset sum, etc. This result falls in line of recent meta-theorems about higher complexity in the polynomial hierarchy by Gr\"une and Wulf.</description>

      <title>SAT-sampling for statistical significance testing in sparse contingency tables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05709v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Exact conditional tests for contingency tables require sampling from fibers with fixed margins. Classical Markov basis MCMC is general but often impractical: computing full Markov bases that connect all fibers of a given constraint matrix can be infeasible and the resulting chains may converge slowly, especially in sparse settings or in presence of structural zeros. We introduce a SAT-based alternative that encodes fibers as Boolean circuits which allows modern SAT samplers to generate tables randomly. We analyze the sampling bias that SAT samplers may introduce, provide diagnostics, and propose practical mitigation. We propose hybrid MCMC schemes that combine SAT proposals with local moves to ensure correct stationary distributions which do not necessarily require connectivity via local moves which is particularly beneficial in presence of structural zeros. Across benchmarks, including small and involved tables with many structural zeros where pure Markov-basis methods underperform, our methods deliver reliable conditional p-values and often outperform samplers that rely on precomputed Markov bases.</description>

      <title>Adaptation and Fine-tuning with TabPFN for Travelling Salesman Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05872v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tabular Prior-Data Fitted Network (TabPFN) is a foundation model designed for small to medium-sized tabular data, which has attracted much attention recently. This paper investigates the application of TabPFN in Combinatorial Optimization (CO) problems. The aim is to lessen challenges in time and data-intensive training requirements often observed in using traditional methods including exact and heuristic algorithms, Machine Learning (ML)-based models, to solve CO problems. Proposing possibly the first ever application of TabPFN for such a purpose, we adapt and fine-tune the TabPFN model to solve the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP), one of the most well-known CO problems. Specifically, we adopt the node-based approach and the node-predicting adaptation strategy to construct the entire TSP route. Our evaluation with varying instance sizes confirms that TabPFN requires minimal training, adapts to TSP using a single sample, performs better generalization across varying TSP instance sizes, and reduces performance degradation. Furthermore, the training process with adaptation and fine-tuning is completed within minutes. The methodology leads to strong solution quality even without post-processing and achieves performance comparable to other models with post-processing refinement. Our findings suggest that the TabPFN model is a promising approach to solve structured and CO problems efficiently under training resource constraints and rapid deployment requirements.</description>

      <title>Minimum bounding polytropes for estimation of max-linear Bayesian networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05962v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Max-linear Bayesian networks are recursive max-linear structural equation models represented by an edge weighted directed acyclic graph (DAG). The identifiability and estimation of max-linear Bayesian networks is an intricate issue as Gissibl, Kl\"uppelberg, and Lauritzen have shown. As such, a max-linear Bayesian network is generally unidentifiable and standard likelihood theory cannot be applied. We can associate tropical polyhedra to max-linear Bayesian networks. Using this, we investigate the minimum-ratio estimator proposed by Gissibl, Kl\"uppelberg, and Lauritzen and give insight on the structure of minimal best-case samples for parameter recovery which we describe in terms of set covers of certain triangulations. We also combine previous work on estimating max-linear models from Tran, Buck, and Kl\"uppelberg to apply our geometric approach to the structural inference of max-linear models. This is tested extensively on simulated data and on real world data set, the NHANES report for 2015--2016 and the upper Danube network data.</description>

      <title>Extremal poker hand rankings: why the standard 52 card deck and a 3044 card deck are special</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06145v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study poker hand rankings in the partially generalised setting of a deck with $r$ ranks, rather than the typical 13 ranks. We provide the hand rankings for all $r$ and observe some interesting phenomena such as the smallest $r$ such that flushes rank below one-pair hands. Perhaps surprisingly, as $r$ grows without bound, the hand ranking is not stable until $r=761$ (a 3044 card deck). We consider showdown frequency, which is the frequency that a given type of hand is declared by a player at showdown, and make note of counterintuitive instances in which a hand with lower absolute frequency than some other hand nonetheless has a higher showdown frequency. This can be interpreted as a form of Gadbois paradox but in the typical setting of poker without wild cards. Conveniently, the standard deck with 13 ranks turns out to be the smallest deck that avoids a discrepancy between absolute frequency and showdown frequency for all hand types other than having a high card.</description>

Abstract: Transfer systems on finite posets have recently been gaining traction as a key ingredient in equivariant homotopy theory. Additionally, they also naturally occur in the data of a model structure. We give a complete characterization of all model category structures on a finite lattice, using transfer systems as our main tool, resulting in new connections between abstract homotopy theory and equivariant methods.</description>

Abstract: This paper studies the restriction multiplicities of half-diagram modules for the partition algebra and their geometric interpretations. By specializing the Bowman-De Visscher-Orellana formula [BVC, Theorem 4.3] for restriction multiplicities of standard modules in the partition algebra, we compute these multiplicities and provide interpretations in terms of planar triangles and conic sections. Additionally, through the decomposition of half-diagrams, we explain the intrinsic reasons underlying this connection between geometry and algebra.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.06342v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Regions in the Euclidean plane surrounded by circles are fundamental geometric and combinatorial objects. Related studies have been done and we cannot explain them precisely, or roughly, well.
  We study such regions whose Poincar\'e-Reeb graphs are trees and investigate the trees obtained by a certain inductive rule from a disk in the plane. The Poincar\'e-Reeb graph of such a region is a graph whose underlying set is the set of all components of level sets of the restriction of the canonical projection to the closure and whose vertices are points corresponding to the components containing {\it singular} points. Related studies were started by the author, motivated by importance and difficulty of explicit construction of a real algebraic map onto a prescribed closed region in the plane.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.06737v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the asymptotic size of decompositions of tensor powers of tilting modules for quantum groups (mostly at a complex root of unity). In type A1 we obtain a sharp result for the number of indecomposable summands, explained by a one dimensional half-line random walk with a periodic congruence constraint. In general type we prove a universal law: the dominant part is governed only by the dimension of the module, while the correction depends only on the root system, so the asymptotic size is largely independent of the specific tilting module.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Chazelle's Implementation of the Bottom-Left Heuristic: A Corrected and Rigorous Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07008v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Strip Packing Problem is a classical optimization problem in which a given set of rectangles must be packed, without overlap, into a strip of fixed width and infinite height, while minimizing the total height of the packing. A straightforward and widely studied approach to this problem is the Bottom-Left Heuristic. It consists of iteratively placing each rectangle in the given order at the lowest feasible position in the strip and, in case of ties, at the leftmost of those. Due to its simplicity and good empirical performance, this heuristic is widely used in practical applications. The most efficient implementation of this heuristic was proposed by Chazelle in 1983, requiring $O(n^2)$ time and $O(n)$ space to place $n$ rectangles. However, although Chazelle's original description was largely correct, it omitted several formal details. Furthermore, our analysis revealed a critical flaw in the original runtime analysis, which, in certain cases, results in $\Omega(n^3)$ running time. Motivated by this finding, this paper provides a rigorous and corrected presentation of the implementation, addressing the imprecise arguments and resolving the identified flaw. The resulting analysis establishes a formally verified version of Chazelle's implementation and confirms its quadratic time complexity.</description>

Abstract: In 2015, Bachmann \cite{Ba3} conjectured that the~$\Q$-vector space~$\Zq$ of (formal)~$q$-analogues of Multiple Zeta Values (\qmzv s) is spanned by a very particular set compared to known spanning sets. In this work, we prove that this conjecture is true for a subspace of~$\Zq$ spanned by words satisfying some condition on their number of zeros and depth. According to this partial result, we give an explicit approach to the whole conjecture, based on particular~$\Q$-linear relations among formal Multiple~$q$-Zeta Values which are implied by duality.</description>

      <title>Decoupling of clusters in independent sets in a percolated hypercube</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07350v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Independent sets in graphs are sets of vertices containing no neighbors, and they represent a canonical spin system with hardcore constraints. Of particular interest is the setting of the boolean hypercube, where counting independent sets was the original motivator for Sapozhenko's famous graph container method. A modern perspective on such problems is to consider the effect of disorder, and the study of independent sets in random subgraphs of the hypercube obtained via bond percolation with parameter $p$ was initiated by Kronenberg and Spinka. They employed tools from statistical mechanics to obtain detailed information about the moments of the number of independent sets (now a random variable), and posed many interesting questions. Previous work by the authors addressed many of these questions in the regime $p \geq \frac{2}{3}$, where the behavior is relatively simple and can be modeled well by a related family of independent particles.
  As $p$ decreases, though, typical independent sets become larger and feature more intricate clustering behavior. In the present article we overcome many of the challenges presented by this phenomenon and analyze the model for all $p&gt; 0.465$. We obtain a sharp in-probability approximation for the number of independent sets in the percolated hypercube in terms of explicit random variables, as well as provide a sampling algorithm. Note that this shows, curiously, that $p = \frac{1}{2}$ is not a natural barrier for this problem unlike in many other problems where it appears as a point of a phase transition. A key contribution of this work is the introduction of a new probabilistic framework to handle the clustering behavior for these low values of $p$. Although our analysis is restricted to $p &gt; 0.465$, our arguments are expected to be helpful for studying this model at even lower values of $p$, and possibly for other related problems.</description>

      <title>Skew RSK and the switching on ballot tableau pairs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.06095</link>
      <description>arXiv:1808.06095v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In arXiv:1808.06095 we have introduced the Knuth class of the word recording a sequence of locations for repeated internal insertion operations in the Sagan-Stanley skew RSK correspondence, with no prescribed external insertion of new cells, to be a preserver for the $P$-tableau. As a consequence the Benkart-Sottile-Stroomer switching involution on ballot tableau pairs allows a realization as a recursive internal insertion procedure. This amounts to explain the various presentations of Littlewood-Richardson (LR) commuters and their coincidence predicted by Pak and Vallejo with contributions by Danilov and Koshevoi. In particular, the aforesaid presentation provides internal insertion as an alternative to Sch\"utzenberger- Lusztig involution (or evacuation) to constructing the Gelfand-Tsetlin pair in the Henriques-Kamnitzer $\mathfrak{gl}_n$-crystal commuter. In addition, the coincidence of LR commuters solves the Lecouvey-Lenart conjecture, recently further developed by Kumar-Torres, on bijections between the Kwon and Sundaram branching models.</description>

      <title>Extremal Results on Conflict-free Coloring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.02570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.02570v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A conflict-free open neighborhood coloring of a graph is an assignment of colors to the vertices such that for every vertex there is a color that appears exactly once in its open neighborhood. For a graph $G$, the smallest number of colors required for such a coloring is called the conflict-free open neighborhood (CFON) chromatic number and is denoted by $\chi_{ON}(G)$. By considering closed neighborhood instead of open neighborhood, we obtain the analogous notions of conflict-free closed neighborhood (CFCN) coloring, and CFCN chromatic number (denoted by $\chi_{CN}(G)$). The notion of conflict-free coloring was introduced in 2002, and has since received considerable attention.
  In this paper, we study some extremal questions related to CFON and CFCN coloring.</description>

Abstract: Garbe, Hladk\'y, \v{S}ileikis and Skerman [Ann. Inst. Henri Poincar\'e Probab. Stat., 60 (2024), pp. 2878-2922] recently introduced a general class of random graph processes called flip processes and proved that the typical evolution of these discrete-time random graph processes corresponds to certain continuous-time deterministic graphon trajectories. We obtain a complete characterization of the equivalence classes of flip process rules with the same graphon trajectories. As an application, we characterize the flip process rules which are unique in their equivalence classes. These include several natural families of rules such as the complementing rules, the component completion rules, the extremist rules, and the clique removal rules.</description>

      <title>Improving Uniquely Decodable Codes in Binary Adder Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.11723v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a general method to modify existing uniquely decodable codes in the $T$-user binary adder channel. If at least one of the original constituent codes does not have average weight exactly half of the dimension, then our method produces a new set of constituent codes in a higher dimension, with a strictly higher rate. Using our method we improve the highest known rate for the $T$-user binary adder channel for all $T \geq 2$. This information theory problem is equivalent to co-Sidon problems initiated by Lindstr{\"o}m in the 1960s, and also the multi-set union-free problem. Our results improve the known lower bounds in these settings as well.</description>

      <title>Differential equations for the series of hypermaps with control on their full degree profile</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14668v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the generating series of oriented and non-oriented hypermaps with controlled degrees of vertices, hyperedges and faces. It is well known that these series have natural expansions in terms of Schur and Zonal symmetric functions, and with some particular specializations, they satisfy the celebrated KP and BKP equations.
  We prove that the full generating series of hypermaps satisfy a family of differential equations. We give a first proof which works for an $\alpha$ deformation of these series related to Jack polynomials. This proof is based on a recent construction formula for Jack characters using differential operators. We also provide a combinatorial proof for the orientable case.
  Our approach also applies to the series of $k$-constellations with control of the degrees of vertices of all colors. In other words, we obtain an equation for the generating function of Hurwitz numbers (and their $\alpha$-deformations) with control of full ramification profiles above an arbitrary number of points. Such equations are new even in the orientable case.</description>

      <title>Bounds and Hardness Results for Conflict-free Choosability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12672v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A 'conflict-free coloring' of a hypergraph $\mathcal{H}$ is an assignment of colors to the vertex set of $\mathcal{H}$ such that every hyperedge in $\mathcal{H}$ has a vertex whose color is distinct from every other vertex in that hyperedge. The minimum number of colors required for such a coloring is known as the 'conflict-free chromatic number' of $\mathcal{H}$. Conflict-free coloring has also been studied on the open/closed neighborhood hypergraphs of a given graph under the name open/closed neighborhood conflict-free coloring. In this paper, we study the list variant of conflict-free coloring where, for every vertex $v$, we are given a list of admissible colors $L_v$ such that $v$ is allowed to be colored only from $L_v$.
  It was shown by Pach and Tardos [Combinatorics, Probability and Computing, 2009] that for any constant $\epsilon &gt; 0$, the closed-neighborhood conflict-free chromatic number of a graph $G$ is at most $O(\ln^{2 + \epsilon}\Delta)$, where $\Delta$ represents the maximum degree of $G$. Later, Glebov, Szab\'o, and Tardos [Combinatorics, Probability and Computing, 2014] showed that there exist graphs $G$ that require $\Omega(\ln^2\Delta)$ colors for a closed neighborhood conflict-free coloring. Bhyravarapu, Kalyanasundaram, and Mathew [Journal of Graph Theory, 2021] bridged the gap between the upper and the lower bound. They showed that the closed-neighborhood conflict-free chromatic number of any graph $G$ is at most $O(\ln^2 \Delta)$.
  In this paper, we extend the $O(\ln^2 \Delta)$ upper bound to the list variant of the closed-neighborhood conflict-free chromatic number. Further, we establish computational complexity results concerning the list open/closed-neighborhood conflict-free chromatic numbers.</description>

      <title>On the Sprague-Grundy values of games with a pass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15786v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider two-player impartial games with a pass-move. A disjunctive compound of games is a position in which, on each turn, the current player chooses one of the components and makes a legal move in it. For disjunctive compounds, it is known that the time to determine which player has a winning strategy is bounded by the time to compute the SG-values of the components plus the time for their XOR. However, if we allow a pass-move during the play, the analysis of such games becomes much more difficult. A pass-move allows each player to skip exactly one turn in non-terminal positions during the game, after which neither player may use a pass-move again. We establish a homomorphism on the SG-values of games with a pass-move. That is, if every component satisfies a condition called one-move game, the SG-value of the disjunctive compound of the components with a pass-move is the same as the SG-value of nim with a pass-move where the size of every pile is the same as the SG-value of every component of the compound. This guarantees that the time to determine which player has a winning strategy in a disjunctive compound with a pass can be bounded by the sum of the time to determine SG-values of all components without a pass and a position in nim with a pass. We also show how the homomorphism is used for determining SG-values of some chocolate games.</description>

Abstract: We prove that the Gorensteinification of the face ring of a cycle is totally $p$-anisotropic in characteristic $p$. In other words, given an appropriate Artinian reduction, it contains no nonzero $p$-isotropic elements. Moreover, we prove that the linear system of parameters can be chosen corresponding to a geometric realization with points on the moment curve. In particular, this implies that the parameters do not have to be chosen very generically.</description>

      <title>A two-player voting game in Euclidean space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01713v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a finite set $S$ of points in $\mathbb{R}^d$, which we regard as the locations of voters on a $d$-dimensional political `spectrum', two candidates (Alice and Bob) select one point in $\mathbb{R}^d$ each, in an attempt to get as many votes as possible. Alice goes first and Bob goes second, and then each voter simply votes for the candidate closer to them in terms of Euclidean distance. If a voter's distance from the two candidates is the same, they vote for nobody. We give a geometric characterization of the sets $S$ for which each candidate wins, assuming that Alice wins if they get an equal number of votes. We also show that, if not all the voters lie on a single line, then, whenever Alice has a winning strategy, there is a unique winning point for her. We also provide an algorithm which decides whether Alice has a winning point, and determines the location of that point, both in finite (in fact polynomial) time.</description>

      <title>Regularity properties of Macbeath-Hurwitz and related maps and surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02089v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Macbeath-Hurwitz maps $M$ of type $\{3,7\}$, obtained from the Hurwitz groups $G={\rm PSL}_2(q)$ found by Macbeath, are fully regular by a result of Singerman, with automorphism group $G\times{\rm C}_2$ or ${\rm PGL}_2(q)$. Hall's criterion determines which of these two properties, called inner and outer regularity, $M$ has. Inner (but not outer) regular maps $M$ yield non-orientable regular maps $M/{\rm C}_2$ of the same type with automorphism group $G$. If $q=p^3$ for a prime $p\equiv\pm 2$ or $\pm 3$ mod~$(7)$ the unique map $M$ is inner regular if and only if $p\equiv 1$ mod~$(4)$. If $q=p$ for a prime $p\equiv\pm 1$ mod~$(7)$ there are three maps $M$; we use the density theorems of Frobenius and Chebotarev to show that in this case the sets of such primes $p$ for which $0, 1, 2$ or $3$ of them are inner regular have relative densities $1/8$, $3/8$, $3/8$ and $1/8$ respectively. Hall's criterion and its consequences are extended to the analogous Macbeath maps of type $\{3,n\}$ obtained from ${\rm PSL}_2(q)$ for all $n\ge 7$; theoretical predictions on their number and properties are supported by evidence from the map databases of Conder and Poto\v cnik.</description>

      <title>Functional Inequalities and Random Walks on Increasing Subsets of the Hypercube</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.09852v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by random walks on subsets of the hypercube, we prove two discrete functional inequalities on the hypercube. First, we give a short, elementary proof of the Poincar\'e inequality on increasing subsets of the cube recently established by Fei and Ferreira Pinto Jr, which yields an $O(n^2)$ upper bound on the mixing time of censored random walks, improving upon previous bounds. Second, adapting Samorodnitsky's induction method to the $p$-biased setting, we establish a sharp $p$-biased edge-isoperimetric inequality for real-valued increasing functions, which recovers the classic biased edge-isoperimetric inequality for increasing sets and identifies increasing subcubes as the extremizers. This result also admits a probabilistic interpretation in terms of maximizing the mean first exit time of biased random walks.</description>

      <title>Completely (Quasi-)Uniform Nested Boolean Steiner Quadruple Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.06663v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nested Steiner quadruple systems are designs derived from Steiner quadruple systems (SQSs) by partitioning each block into pairs. A nested SQS is completely uniform if every possible pair appears with equal multiplicity, and completely quasi-uniform if every pair appears with multiplicities that differ by at most one. An explicit construction on the Boolean SQS of order $2^m$ is presented, producing a nested SQS$(2^m)$ that is completely uniform when $m$ is odd and completely quasi-uniform when $m$ is even for each integer $m \ge 3$ . These results resolve two open problems posed by Chee et al. (2025). The notion of completely uniform pairings is further generalized for $t$-designs with $t \ge 2$. As an application, completely uniform nested $2$-$(2^m,4,3)$ designs give rise to fractional repetition codes with zero skip cost, requiring fewer storage nodes than constructions based on SQSs. In addition, small examples are provided for non-Boolean orders, establishing the existence of completely uniform nested SQS$(v)$ for all $v \le 50$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.17852v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Huh-Stevens and Ferroni-Schr\"oter independently conjectured that Hilbert-Poincar\'e series of Chow rings of geometric lattices have only real zeros. Ferroni, Matherne and the second author extended this conjecture to Chow polynomials of Cohen-Macaulay poset. In this paper we address the above conjectures by providing new defining relations and properties of Chow functions of posets and matrices. These are used, in conjunction with new techniques on interlacing sequences of polynomials, to prove that Chow polynomials of totally nonnegative matrices have only real zeros, which, in turn, proves the above conjectures for a class of posets that contains projective and affine geometries, face lattices of cubical polytopes, partition lattices and Dowling lattices, perfect matroid designs, and lattices of flats of paving matroids. We also study Chow polynomials of Toeplitz matrices in greater detail, and show how these are related the combinatorics of binomial and Sheffer posets, as well as to a family of generalized Eulerian polynomials with coefficients in the ring of symmetric polynomials that have been studied by e.g. Stanley, Brenti, Stembridge and Shareshian-Wachs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.16236v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $G=(V, E)$ be a graph where $V(G)$ and $E(G)$ are the vertex and edge sets, respectively. In a graph $G$, two edges $e_1, e_2\in E(G)$ are said to have a \emph{common edge} $e\neq e_1, e_2$ if $e$ joins an endpoint of $e_1$ to an endpoint of $e_2$ in $G$. A subset $D\subseteq E(G)$ is called an \emph{edge open packing set} in $G$ if no two edges in $D$ share a common edge in $G$, and the largest size of such a set in $G$ is known as the \emph{edge open packing number}, represented by $\rho_{e}^o(G)$. The \textsc{Maximum Edge Open Packing Problem} is to find an edge open packing set of a given graph with maximum size. In [Bre{\v{s}}ar and Samadi. Edge open packing: complexity, algorithmic aspects, and bounds. Theor. Comput. Sci., 2024.], Bre{\v{s}}ar and Samadi pose an open question of the edge open packing problem in chordal graphs. In this paper, we partially answer this open question by showing a polynomial-time algorithm to solve the maximum edge open packing problem in the subclasses of chordal graphs. First, we show that the \textsc{Maximum Edge Open Packing Problem} can be solved in polynomial time for \emph{proper interval graphs}. Furthermore, we show that in \emph{block graphs} we can solve this problem in polynomial time. Finally, we prove that this problem can be solved in linear time for \emph{split graphs}.</description>

Abstract: Nathanson introduced the range of cardinalities of $h$-fold sumsets $R(h,k) := \{|hA|:A \subset \mathbb{Z} \text{ and }|A| = k\}.$ Following a remark of Erd\H{o}s and Szemer\'edi that determined the form of $R(h,k)$ when $h=2$, Nathanson asked what the form of $R(h,k)$ is for arbitrary $h, k \in \mathbb{N}$. For $h \in \mathbb{N}$, we prove there is some constant $k_h \in \mathbb{N}$ such that if $k &gt; k_h$, then $R(h,k)$ is the entire interval $\left[hk-h+1,\binom{h+k-1}{h}\right]$ except for a specified set of $\binom{h-1}{2}$ numbers. Moreover, we show that one can take $k_3 = 2$.</description>

      <title>Bounded ratios for Lorentzian matrices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.25030v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study multiplicative inequalities among entries of Lorentzian matrices, referred to as bounded ratios. These inequalities can be viewed as generalizations of the classical Alexandrov--Fenchel inequalities for mixed volumes. Our main structural result identifies the cone of all bounded ratios on Lorentzian matrices with the dual of the cut cone, a finitely generated integral polyhedral cone extensively studied in metric geometry and graph theory. We examine in detail the pentagonal ratio, which first appears for Lorentzian matrices of size at least five. For Lorentzian matrices of size three, we determine the optimal bounding constants across the entire cone of bounded ratios, obtaining an explicit entropy-like formula. We conjecture that any normalized bounded ratio is, in fact, bounded by 2.</description>

Abstract: In the work of C. Donovan and N. A. Scoville, the homotopy type of the Morse complex of the extended star graph which is obtained as the one-point union of n paths of length 2 was determined by using star clusters and Cluster Lemma. In this paper, we determine the homotopy type of the Morse complex of extended star graph consisting of a path of length 1 and n paths of length 2 by using strong collapses and Hasse diagram. Furthermore, we compute the homotopy type of the graph obtained by attaching the center vertices of two extended star graphs to different endpoints of a path by using star clusters and the Cluster Lemma.</description>

      <title>On the enumeration of connected sets in finite cylindrical lattice graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01319v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A connected set in a graph is a non-empty set of vertices that induces a connected subgraph. In an infinite lattice, a connected set is often referred to as a lattice animal, whose enumeration up to isomorphism is a classical problem in both combinatorics and statistical physics. In this paper, we focus on the enumeration of connected sets in finite lattice graphs, providing a link between combinatorial counting and structural connectivity in the system.
  For any positive integers $m,n$, let $N(P_m\times P_n)$ and $N(C_m\times P_n)$ denote the number of all connected sets in the $(m\times n)$-lattice graph $P_m\times P_n$ and $(m\times n)$-cylindrical lattice graph $C_m\times P_n $, respectively. In 2020, Vince derived enumeration formulas for $N(P_m\times P_2)$ and $N(C_m\times P_2)$, and highlighted the increasing difficulty of extending these calculation results to larger (cylindrical) lattice graphs. Recently, the authors of this paper have developed a method based on multi-step recurrence formulas to obtain the enumeration formula for $N(P_m\times P_n)$ with $m\le 4$. In this article, we apply a similar approach to derive the enumeration formula for $N(C_m\times P_n)$ with $m\le 7$. Further, for the general case, we establish an explicit and tight lower bound on the number of connected sets in the Cartesian product graph $G\times P_n $ for any connected graph $G$, by employing the transfer matrix method on a subclass of connected sets. Based on this, we perform an asymptotic analysis on several lattice graphs and show that $O(N(P_3\times P_n))=1.6694^{3n}$, $O(N(C_4\times P_n))=1.8014^{4n}$, and $O(N(C_5\times P_n))=1.7877^{5n}$.</description>

      <title>Essential graded algebra over polynomial rings with real exponents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.03819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2008.03819v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The geometric and algebraic theory of monomial ideals and multigraded modules is initiated over real-exponent polynomial rings and, more generally, monoid algebras for real polyhedral cones. The main results include the generalization of Nakayama's lemma; complete theories of minimal and dense primary, secondary, and irreducible decomposition, including associated and attached faces; socles and tops; minimality and density for downset hulls, upset covers, and fringe presentations; Matlis duality; and geometric analysis of staircases. Modules that are semialgebraic or piecewise-linear (PL) have the relevant property preserved by functorial constructions as well as by minimal primary and secondary decompositions. And when the modules in question are subquotients of the group itself, such as monomial ideals and quotients modulo them, minimal primary and secondary decompositions are canonical, as are irreducible decompositions up to the new real-exponent notion of density.</description>

      <title>Motivic Coh and Quot zeta functions of singular curves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.12528v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a general and effective algebraic framework for enumerating finite-length quotients of a torsion-free sheaf of arbitrary rank (the Quot zeta function) and finite-length coherent sheaves (the Coh zeta function) over reduced singular curves. We prove that Quot zeta functions are motivically rational, using a novel parametrization and the geometry of affine Grassmannians, and that they satisfy an arbitrary-rank reflection principle, via harmonic analysis. We show that the a normalized high-rank limit of Quot zeta functions converges to the Coh zeta function. As a first application, we compute explicit formulas for these zeta functions for all $y^2 = x^n$ singularities, revealing a surprising and previously unknown connection to Rogers--Ramanujan type $q$-series. Further applications to affine Springer fibers and commuting varieties are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Ginzburg--Landau Functionals in the Large-Graph Limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00422v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ginzburg--Landau (GL) functionals on graphs, which are relaxations of graph-cut functionals on graphs, have yielded a variety of insights in image segmentation and graph clustering. In this paper, we study large-graph limits of GL functionals by taking a functional-analytic view of graphs as nonlocal kernels. For a graph $W_n$ with $n$ nodes, the corresponding graph GL functional $\GL^{W_n}_\ep$ is an energy for functions on $W_n$. We minimize GL functionals on sequences of growing graphs that converge to functions called graphons. For such sequences of graphs, we show that the graph GL functional $\Gamma$-converges to a continuous and nonlocal functional that we call the \emph{graphon GL functional}. We also investigate the sharp-interface limits of the graph GL and graphon GL functionals, and we relate these limits to a nonlocal total-variation (TV) functional. We express the limiting GL functional in terms of Young measures and thereby obtain a probabilistic interpretation of the variational problem in the large-graph limit. Finally, to develop intuition about the graphon GL functional, we determine the GL minimizer for several example families of graphons.</description>

      <title>A Probabilistic Parking Process and Labeled IDLA</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11718v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In 1966, Konheim and Weiss [33] introduced a now classical parking protocol. The deterministic process and its resultant objects, known as parking functions, have since become a favorite object of study in enumerative combinatorics. In our work, we introduce and study a probabilistic variant of the classical parking protocol, which is closely related to Internal Diffusion Limited Aggregation, or IDLA, introduced in 1991 by Diaconis and Fulton [19]. In particular, we compute the stationary distribution of this process when initiated with a particular class of initial preferences, of which weakly increasing parking functions are a subset. Furthermore, we compute the expected time it takes for the protocol to complete assuming all of the cars park, and prove that, in some cases, the parking process is negatively correlated. In addition, we study statistics of uniformly random weakly increasing parking functions such as the distribution of the last entry, the probability that a specific set of cars is lucky, and the expected number of lucky cars.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.18473v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a simplified proof of a forty-year-old result concerning the tiling of the plane with equilateral convex polygons. Our approach is based on a theorem by M. Rao, who used an exhaustive computer search to confirm the completeness of the well-known list of fifteen pentagon types. Assuming the validity of Rao's result, we provide a concise and mainly geometric proof of a tiling theorem originally due to Hirschhorn and Hunt. Finally, a possible connection to quasicrystals is sketched.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.10370v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For the type A, BC, and D root systems, we determine equivalent conditions between the coefficients of an exponential holomorphic function and the asymptotic values taken by the Dunkl bilinear form when one of its entries is the function. We establish these conditions over the $|\theta N| \rightarrow\infty$ regime for the type A and D root systems and over the $|\theta_0 N|\rightarrow \infty, \frac{\theta_1}{\theta_0 N}\rightarrow c\in\mathbb{C}$ regime for the type BC root system. We also generalize existing equivalent conditions over the $\theta N \rightarrow c\in\mathbb{C}$ regime for the type A root system and over the $\theta_0 N\rightarrow c_0\in\mathbb{C}, \frac{\theta_1}{\theta_0 N}\rightarrow c_1\in\mathbb{C}$ regime for the type BC root system and prove new equivalent conditions over the $\theta N \rightarrow c\in\mathbb{C}$ regime for the type D root system. Furthermore, we determine the asymptotics of the coefficients of the Bessel functions over the regimes that we have mentioned.</description>

      <title>Diameter and mixing time of the giant component in the percolated hypercube</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13348v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider bond percolation on the $d$-dimensional binary hypercube with $p=c/d$ for fixed $c&gt;1$. We prove that the typical diameter of the giant component $L_1$ is of order $\Theta(d)$, and the typical mixing time of the lazy random walk on $L_1$ is of order $\Theta(d^2)$. This resolves long-standing open problems of Bollob\'as, Kohayakawa and {\L}uczak from 1994, and of Benjamini and Mossel from 2003.
  A key component in our approach is a new tight large deviation estimate on the number of vertices in $L_1$ whose proof includes several novel ingredients: a structural description of the residue outside the giant component after sprinkling, a tight quantitative estimate on the spread of the giant in the hypercube, and a stability principle which rules out the disintegration of large connected sets under thinning. This toolkit further allows us to obtain optimal bounds on the expansion in $L_1$.</description>

      <title>Random generation of universal cycles and de Bruijn sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16545v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present practical algorithms for generating universal cycles uniformly at random. In particular, we consider universal cycles for shorthand permutations, subsets and multiset permutations, weak orders, and orientable sequences. Additionally, we consider de Bruijn sequences, weight-range de Bruin sequences, and de Bruijn sequences, with forbidden $0^z$ substring. Each algorithm, seeded with a random element from the given set, applies a random walk of an underlying Eulerian de Bruijn graph to obtain a random arborescence (spanning in-tree). Given the random arborescence and the de Bruijn graph, a corresponding random universal cycle can be generated in constant time per symbol. We present experimental results on the average cover time needed to compute a random arborescence for each object using a Las Vegas algorithm.</description>

      <title>Laplacian Spectrum and Domination in Trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20318v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For a finite simple undirected graph $G$, let $\gamma(G)$ denote the size of a smallest dominating set of $G$ and $\mu(G)$ denote the number of eigenvalues of the Laplacian matrix of $G$ in the interval $[0,1)$, counting multiplicities. Hedetniemi, Jacobs and Trevisan [Eur. J. Comb. 2016] showed that for any graph $G$, $\mu(G) \leqslant \gamma(G)$. Cardoso, Jacobs and Trevisan [Graphs Combin. 2017] asks whether the ratio $\gamma(T)/\mu(T)$ is bounded by a constant for all trees $T$. We answer this question by showing that this ratio is less than $4/3$ for every tree. We establish the optimality of this bound by constructing an infinite family of trees where this ratio approaches $4/3$. We also improve this upper bound for trees in which all the vertices other than leaves and their parents have degree at least $k$, for every $k \geqslant 3$. We show that, for such trees $T$, $\gamma(T)/\mu(T) &lt; 1 + 1/((k-2)(k+1))$.</description>
