      <title>Constraining the Cosmological Evolution of Post-Newtonian Parameters with Gravitational Wave Signals from Compact Binary Inspirals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08756v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitational waves from compact binary inspirals offer a new opportunity to constrain the cosmological time dependence of gravitational coupling parameters, due to the high precision of the observations themselves as well as the significant cosmological redshifts at which such systems exist. We calculate theory-independent equations of motion for compact objects in a binary system, implementing a new approach to sensitivities, and subsequently determine the gravitational wave signal that one should expect to measure from their inspiral. Expressions for the wave phase and amplitude are derived in terms of post-Newtonian gravitational coupling parameters, radiative flux parameters, and compact body sensitivities. These results complement recent attempts to gain theory-independent constraints on the time-evolution of gravitational coupling parameters from cosmological probes, and represent a new opportunity to constrain modified gravity with gravitational wave data.</description>

      <title>Noncommutative Bianchi I and III Cosmology Models: Radiation Era Dynamics and gamma Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the early evolution of the universe requires models that incorporate possible quantum and anisotropic effects in its dynamics. In this work, we analyze the dynamical evolution of locally rotationally symmetric anisotropic cosmological models of Bianchi type I (flat curvature) and Bianchi type III (open curvature) within a noncommutative phase space framework characterized by a deformation parameter gamma. Using a Hamiltonian formulation based on Schutz formalism for a perfect radiation fluid, we introduce noncommutative Poisson brackets that allow for geometric corrections to commutative dynamics. The resulting equations are solved numerically under various initial conditions, enabling the study of the impact of gamma and the energy density C on the universe expansion and anisotropy evolution. The results show that gamma &lt; 0 enhances expansion and favors isotropization, while gamma &gt; 0 tends to slow expansion and preserve residual anisotropy, especially in the open curvature model. It is estimated that the influence of non-commutativity was significant during the early stages of the universe, decreasing toward the present time, suggesting that this approach could serve as an effective alternative to the cosmological constant in describing the evolution of the early universe.</description>

      <title>Distinguishing between Black Holes and Neutron Stars within a Population of Weak Tidal Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08832v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the ability of tidal signatures within the inspiral of compact binaries observed through gravitational waves (GWs) to distinguish between neutron stars (NSs) and black holes (BHs). After quantifying how hard this measurement is on a single-event basis, we investigate the ability of a large catalog of GW detections to constrain the fraction of NS in the population as a function of mass: $f_{\mathrm{NS}}(m)$. Using simulated catalogs with realistic measurement uncertainty, we find that $&gt; O(200)$ events will be needed before we can precisely measure $f_{\mathrm{NS}}$, and catalogs of $&gt; O(100)$ events will be needed before we can even rule out the possibility that all low-mass objects are BHs with GW data alone (i.e., without electromagnetic counterparts). Therefore, this is unlikely to occur with advanced detectors, even at design sensitivity. Nevertheless, it could be feasible with next-generation facilities like Cosmic Explorer and Einstein Telescope.</description>

      <title>Chaos of charged particles near a renormalized group improved Kerr black hole in an external magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08954v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a quantum theory of gravity, a renormalization group improved Kerr metric is obtained from the Kerr metric, where the Newton gravitational constant is modified as a function of the radial distance. The motion of neutral test particles in this metric is integrable. However, the dynamics of charged test particles is nonintegrable when an external asymptotically homogeneous magnetic field exists in the vicinity of the black hole. The transition from regular dynamics to chaotic dynamics is numerically traced as one or two dynamical parameters vary. From a statistical point of view, the strength of chaos is typically enhanced as both the particle energy and the magnetic field increase, but it is weakened with increasing the particle angular momentum and the black hole spin. In particular, an increase of the quantum corrected parameter weakens the extent of chaos. This is because the running Newton gravity constant effectively weakens the central gravitational attraction and results in decreasing sensitivity to initial conditions.</description>

      <title>Gravitational lensing of gravitational waves: universal characteristics of strongly lensed memory waveforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, the strong lensing effect of the memory signal was considered. In the geometric optics limit, the lensed memory signal becomes oscillatory, while the unlensed is basically monotonic. This is because only the high frequency Fourier modes contribute to the lensed signal. Therefore, the strong lensing system serves as a high-pass filter for the memory signal. Due to the step function like behavior of the unlensed memory waveform, the lensed waveform possesses characteristic morphology that is dependent on the type of the image, and independent of the lens model and the binary system. That is, for each type of the lensed image, the lensed memory waveform has an approxmiate reflection symmetry about a symmetrical axis in the time domain. More specifically, for the type I and type III images, the lensed memory signals are nearly odd under the reflection, while the type II signal is roughly even. In addition, at the symmetrical axis, the sign of the slope for type I image is different from that for the type III image. These universal characteristic features would help determine the type of the lensed image. This is particularly because the memory waveform can be well approximated by a suitable step function, which involves two parameters. In addition, the detection of multiple images by the space-borne interferometer would also be helpful. Once the type of the lensed image is determined with the approximated memory waveform, one can use the appropriate waveform template for the oscillatory component of the gravitational wave to perform the parameter estimation.</description>

      <title>Particle creation in a cosmological background in analogy to the Schwinger effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09481v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a gravitational analogue of the Schwinger effect in a cosmological context. While the Schwinger effect is usually attributed to a static electric background, its derivation is actually based on a switching on/off of the electric field in the infinite past/future. Motivated by this, and our previous work on particle production in a gravitational background, we consider a long pulse of the gravitational field in an FLRW-spacetime, thus simulating a static background. We rigorously derive particle production by a novel application of the Heun equation. In fact, the recently obtained connecting formulas between its local solutions can be used to determine the Bogolyubov coefficients, and subsequently the particle production probabilities, in the limit of an infinitely long pulse.
  The particle production in the FLRW-model is found to have a lower threshold on the outgoing frequencies, which can be related to the duration of the time interval of the switching on/off the background field. For large frequencies and in the spatially flat case, we find black-body radiation whose temperature is inversely proportional to the radius of the apparent horizon that appears in the FLRW-model during the phase of scale change.
  We compare our findings to Schwinger's result on particle production for a long pulse of an electromagnetic background field, for which we also include a detailed derivation.</description>

      <title>A physically interesting singularity in general relativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore what appears to be a very benign timelike and naked singularity of the Weyl curvature scalar. This singularity arises in an inhomogeneous generalization of the Einstein static universe. The matter energy density is everywhere finite and it vanishes at the singularity. The spacetime still enjoys causal geodesic completeness and unambiguous wave dynamics. Each singularity contributes to the Komar mass of the spacetime, and this reduces the required size of the positive cosmological constant. In an expanding universe, the effect of the singularities is to push the acceleration towards more positive values.</description>

      <title>Theoretical filters for shift-symmetric Horndeski gravities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the structure of nontrivial maximally symmetric vacua and compact-object solutions in shift-symmetric scalar-tensor theories. Focusing on Horndeski gravity, we derive consistency conditions directly from the field equations to identify the subclasses that admit Minkowski and de Sitter vacua with a nontrivial scalar field. In doing so, we obtain a filtering mechanism that operates independently of observational data. In this context, we introduce the notion of stealth vacua, where the scalar field remains active without altering the vacuum. Following this, we examine the theoretical framework of Horndeski theories that admit homogeneous geometries and we extract the implicit form of the solution pertaining to the entire family of theories. Building upon these frameworks, we construct exact solutions in beyond-Horndeski gravity by applying a linear disformal transformation to the regularized Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet black hole. This procedure yields solitonic spacetimes with scalar hair as well as black holes carrying primary scalar hair, demonstrating how disformal maps can qualitatively modify solution properties. We delineate the parameter space in which the transformation is well-defined and analyze the solutions. Our results provide both a principled criterion for selecting viable Horndeski models and a framework for exploring rich solution spaces in beyond-Horndeski gravity.</description>

      <title>Particles with precessing spin in Kerr spacetime: analytic solutions for eccentric orbits and homoclinic motion near the equatorial plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a family of analytic solutions for the nearly-equatorial motion of a test particle with precessing spin in Kerr spacetime. We solve the equations of motion up to linear order in the small body's spin for periodic and homoclinic orbits. At zero order, the particle moves along equatorial geodesics. The spin-curvature force introduces post-geodesic corrections which, for generic spin orientations, cause the precession of the orbital plane. We derive the solutions for eccentric orbits in terms of Legendre elliptic integrals and Jacobi elliptic functions for generic referential geodesics (known as ``spin gauges"). Our analytical solutions perfectly match the numerical trajectories obtained by Drummond and Hughes in Phys. Rev. D 105, 124041 (2022), and Piovano et al. in Phys. Rev. D 111, 044009 (2025). Furthermore, we present, for the first time, the solutions for homoclinic orbits for a spinning particle in Kerr spacetime, and the spin-corrections to the location of the separatrix. The homoclinic trajectories are described in closed form using elementary functions. Finally, we introduce a novel parametrization for the motion of a spinning particle, called ``fixed eccentricity spin gauge". The latter is the only spin gauge in which the corrections to periodic orbits are finite at the geodesic separatrix, and continuously reduce to the last stable orbits under appropriate limits. Our results will be useful for modeling the inspiral and transition-to-plunge phases of asymmetric mass binaries within the two-time-scale framework.</description>

      <title>Regular black holes in isothermal cavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.03349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2012.03349v3 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We examine the thermodynamic behavior of a static neutral regular (non-singular) black hole enclosed in a finite isothermal cavity. The cavity enclosure helps us investigate black hole systems in a canonical or a grand canonical ensemble. Here we demonstrate the derivation of the reduced action for the general metric of a regular black hole in a cavity by considering a canonical ensemble. The new expression of the action contains quantum corrections at short distances and concludes to the action of a singular black hole in a cavity at large distances. We apply this formalism to the noncommutative Schwarzschild black hole, in order to study the phase structure of the system. We conclude to a possible small/large stable regular black hole transition inside the cavity that exists neither at the system of a classical Schwarzschild black hole in a cavity, nor at the asymptotically flat regular black hole without the cavity. This phase transition seems to be similar with the liquid/gas transition of a Van der Waals gas.</description>

      <title>Targeted search for an individual SMBHB in NANOGrav 15-year and EPTA DR2 data sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14742v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While pulsar timing array (PTA) collaborations have reported evidence for a stochastic gravitational wave background (GWB), the detection of continuous gravitational waves (GWs) from a confirmed supermassive black hole binary (SMBHB) would provide strong support for the SMBHB origin of GWB. In this study, we analyze continuous GWs from the SMBHB candidate 3C 66B, modeling the GWB as a common uncorrelated red noise. Using Bayesian methods, we perform targeted searches across two PTA data sets: Nanohertz Observatory for Gravitational Waves 15 years data set and the European Pulsar Timing Array DR2 full data set. We find no evidence of such signal in both data sets and then place upper limits on the amplitude of the signal and the chirp mass of the source. Additionally, we evaluate the case of a GWB characterized by Hellings-Downs correlations using a likelihood reweighting method, which consistently reconfirms the conclusion of non-detection.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamic models of Reheating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08685v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a causal hydrodynamic model that provides an effective macroscopic description of the field-theoretic dynamics during the early stages of reheating. The inflaton condensate is treated as a homogeneous background coupled to a relativistic fluid that represents its inhomogeneous fluctuations. Within the divergence-type theory framework derived from kinetic considerations, the model captures essential dissipative and non-equilibrium effects while remaining stable and causal. We find that the coupling between the oscillating condensate and the fluid induces a parametric resonance in the tensor sector, leading to the amplification of the viscous stress tensor and the generation of gravitational waves with a characteristic spectral peak. The predicted spectrum agrees with lattice simulations performed with CosmoLattice. This hydrodynamic approach offers an effective bridge between microscopic field dynamics and macroscopic cosmological observables.</description>

      <title>Non-closed scalar charge in 4-dimensional Einstein-scalar-Gauss-Bonnet black hole thermodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08686v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a covariant differential-form framework to define scalar charges for stationary, asymptotically flat black holes in $4$--dimensional Einstein-scalar-Gauss-Bonnet gravity with a general scalar coupling function. Contracting the scalar field equation of motion with the horizon generator $k$ yields a non-closed-form scalar charge, revealing a bulk contribution encoded in a $3$--form, which measures the obstruction to its closedness. In the presence of shift-symmetry, this obstruction vanishes and the $2$--form scalar charge satisfies a Gauss law, depending solely on boundary data. Geometrically, this reproduces known topological results in the shift-symmetric limit. This framework allows us to analyze the role of the non-closed scalar charges in black hole thermodynamics through the Smarr formula for more general couplings and provide a covariant, charge-based interpretation of the spontaneous scalarization mechanism, showing how the behavior of the scalar charge and the bulk term capture the instability of scalar-free black holes and the emergence of scalar hair. Our results offer a unified geometric understanding of the role of scalar charges and the mechanism of spontaneous scalarization in Einstein-scalar-Gauss-Bonnet gravity.</description>

Abstract: We discuss the low-frequency gravitational wave signals from three state-of-the-art three-dimensional core-collapse supernova models produced with the \textsc{Chimera} supernova code. We provide a detailed derivation of the gravitational wave signal sourced from the anisotropic emission of neutrinos and provide the total (fluid sourced and neutrino sourced) gravitational waves signal generated in our models. We discuss the templatablity of this low-frequency signal, which is useful for future work involving matched filtering for signal detection and parameter estimation.</description>

      <title>Broken Weyl Gravity: Dynamical Torsion and Generalized Proca</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08778v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a symmetry-based construction of gravity from a phase in which Weyl invariance is spontaneously broken. Using the coset formalism, the dilaton acts as a Stuckelberg field for the gauged scale symmetry, giving the Weyl gauge field a mass of order $\mathcal{O}(M_{\rm Pl})$. The resulting gauge-gravity interactions fall within the ghost-free generalized Proca framework. We further show that the Weyl field can be exchanged for a propagating vector component of torsion, providing a natural realization of dynamical vector torsion. Our construction organizes all operators systematically, clarifies the absence of Wess-Zumino terms in $d=4$, and recovers General Relativity in the infrared with controlled higher-derivative corrections.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.08828v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inspired by approaches based on the stochastic generalized uncertainty principle, we propose a Lindblad equation derived from the quantization of a stochastic modified dispersion relation in a Lorentz Invariance Violation (LIV) scenario. This framework enables us to investigate decoherence effects in a system of particles exhibiting gravitationally induced entanglement. We analyze the impact of LIV on entanglement (quantified by concurrence) considering systematic and stochastic effects.</description>

      <title>Investigating the $w$CDM Model with Latest DESI BAO Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09074v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we explore the impact of various combinations of CMB-independent datasets, including the recent DESI BAO measurements, on the equation of state (EoS) of dark energy and other cosmological parameters within the framework of the dynamical dark energy model ($w$CDM). Assuming a constant EoS parameter for dark energy, we derive constraints on the free parameters of the model using observational datasets such as DESI BAO, BBN, Observational Hubble Data (OHD), and Pantheon Plus (SN$^+$) $\&amp;$ SH0ES. Our analysis examines the deviations of the $w$CDM model from the standard $\Lambda$CDM scenario and assesses its implications for cosmological tensions, particularly the $H_0$ tension [$\text{km} \text{s}^{-1} \text{Mpc}^{-1}$]. We find that the combination of DESI BAO + BBN + OHD + SN$^+$ (DESI BAO + BBN + OHD + SN$^+$ \&amp;SH0ES) datasets provides constraints on $w_{\mathrm{de}0}$, suggesting a possible deviation from the cosmological constant scenario at a significance level of $1.6\sigma$ ($1.4\sigma$), respectively. Furthermore, we observe an inverse correlation between $w_{\text{de0}}$ and $H_0$, which highlights the role of dark energy dynamics in resolving the tension $H_0$ by approximately $2.1\sigma(0.8\sigma)$ from DESI BAO + BBN + OHD (DESI BAO + BBN + OHD + SN$^+$ \&amp;SH0ES) datasets, respectively.
  Our findings offer valuable insights into the nature of dark energy and its influence on the cosmic expansion history, with implications for future observational efforts. We utilize the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) to evaluate our model's performance. The results indicate that the $w$CDM model demonstrates superior effectiveness.</description>

      <title>Hubble Constant and Mass Determination of Centaurus A and M83 from TGRB Distances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09190v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An independent determination of the Hubble constant is crucial in light of the persistent tension between early- and late-Universe measurements. In this study, we analyze the dynamics of the Centaurus A (CenA) and M83 galaxies, along with their associated dwarf companions identified via Tip of the Red Giant Branch (TRGB) distance measurements, to constrain both the group mass and the local value of $H_0$. By examining the motions of these galaxies relative to the system's barycenter, we apply both the minor and major infall models, which provide bounds on the true radial velocity dispersion. Averaging these approaches, we obtain a virial mass estimate of $(11 \pm 2) \times 10^{12}\, M_{\odot}$ and a Hubble flow-based mass of $(2.6 \pm 1.1) \times 10^{12}\, M_{\odot}$. Modeling the cold Hubble flow around the group center of mass, we derive a corresponding value of the Hubble constant as $68 \pm 5~\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}\,Mpc^{-1}}$. These results offer an independent, dynamically motivated constraint on the local value of $H_0$, explicitly accounting for the impact of peculiar velocities in the nearby Universe. We also discuss the mild tension between the virial and Hubble flow-based mass estimates, which likely arises from the fact that M83 is close to the velocity surface and breaks the Hubble flow model assumptions. While the Hubble flow fit emphasizes galaxies that follow smooth expansion on the lower branch of the velocity-distance relation, the virial estimate includes the broader spread of bound galaxies near the group core, which seems to fit better for the CenA/M83 total mass.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.09291v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that the only smooth, Ricci flat, ALE instanton with a toric Hermitian non-K\"ahler structure is the Eguchi-Hanson instanton. The proof is analogous to the classification of toric Hermitian ALF instantons by Biquard and Gauduchon, although we avoid the use of toric K\"ahler geometry and instead perform a direct global analysis of the Tod form of the metric in Weyl-Papapetrou coordinates. This supports a conjecture by Gibbons and Bando-Kasue-Nakajima which states that any Ricci flat ALE instanton is self-dual.</description>

      <title>Effect of stochastic kicks on primordial black hole abundance and mass via the compaction function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09303v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study stochastic effects in viable ultra-slow-roll inflation models that produce primordial black holes. We consider asteroid, solar, and supermassive black hole seed masses. In each case, we simulate $10^8$ patches of the universe that may collapse into PBHs. In every patch, we follow $4\times10^4$ momentum shells to construct its spherically symmetric profile from first principles, without introducing a window function. We include the effects of critical collapse and the radiation era transfer function. The resulting compaction function profiles are very spiky due to stochastic kicks. This can enhance the PBH abundance by up to 36 orders of magnitude, depending on the mass range and collapse criterion. The PBH mass function shifts to higher masses and widens significantly. These changes may have a large effect on observational constraints of PBHs and make it possible to generate PBHs with a smaller amplitude of the power spectrum. However, convergence issues for the mass function remain. The results call for redoing collapse simulations to determine the collapse criterion for spiky profiles.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.09395v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study dark matter (DM) production from evaporation of regular primordial black holes (RPBHs). While there are many available metrics that describe singularity-free RPBHs, we focus on the Hayward metric and the Simpson-Visser metric for illustrative purpose. The framework can be applied straightforwardly to other metrics. RPBHs generally have different Hawking temperature and therefore different lifetime from the standard singular black holes. The resulting modified cosmological constraints for this DM production mechanism and the allowed parameter space to obtain the correct DM abundance are calculated.</description>

      <title>Generalized Distributions of Host Dispersion Measures in the Fast Radio Burst Cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09463v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As is well known, Hubble tension is one of the most serious challenges in cosmology to date. So, it is of interest to measure the Hubble constant by using some new probes independent of cosmic microwave background (CMB) and type Ia supernovae (SNIa). One of the promising probes is the fast radio bursts (FRBs), which could be useful in cosmology. In the literature, the methodology proposed by Macquart {\it et al.} has been widely used, in which both $\rm DM_{IGM}$ and $\rm DM_{host}$ are described by probability distribution functions. Recently, it was found that in order to obtain a Hubble constant $H_0$ consistent with the ones of Planck 2018 and SH0ES by using the current ${\cal O}(100)$ localized FRBs, an unusually large $f_{\rm IGM}$ fairly close to its upper bound $1$ is required, if the narrow prior bounded by $0.5$ for the parameter $F$ in the distribution of $\rm DM_{IGM}$ was used. In fact, a small $F$ is the key to make $H_0$ larger. In the present work, we consider a loose prior for the parameter $F$, and find an unusually low $H_0$ by using 125 localized FRBs. We show that the model with loose $F$ prior is strongly preferred over the one with narrow $F$ prior in all terms of the Bayesian evidence and the information criteria AIC, BIC. So, the great Hubble tension between FRBs, Planck 2018 and SH0ES should be taken seriously. Instead of modifying $\sigma_\Delta=Fz^{-0.5}$ in the distribution of $\rm DM_{IGM}$, here we try to find a new way out by generalizing the distribution of $\rm DM_{host}$ with varying location and scale parameters $\ell$ and $e^\mu$, respectively. We find that $H_0$ can be consistent with the ones of Planck 2018 and SH0ES in all cases. All the Bayesian evidence and the information criteria AIC, BIC for the generalized distributions of $\rm DM_{host}$ are overwhelmingly strong.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.09572v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first complete next-to-leading-order analysis of a Yukawa system within the framework of asymptotically safe quantum gravity. Our results are obtained through a systematic resummation of higher-order operators, revealing two distinct resummation mechanisms -- one of which has not been explored previously. In addition, we introduce a novel approach to estimate systematic uncertainties by simulating the impact of neglected higher-order contributions.
  We demonstrate that quantum gravity fluctuations anti-screen Yukawa interactions, thereby resolving previously inconclusive leading-order results. This anti-screening mechanism enables the generation of finite interactions from an asymptotically free Yukawa fixed point. Consequently, our findings provide strong evidence that non-vanishing Yukawa couplings are compatible with asymptotically safe quantum gravity, which is a necessary requirement for the Standard Model to emerge from an asymptotically safe ultraviolet completion.</description>

      <title>Anchoring the Universe with Characteristic Redshifts using Raychaudhuri Equation Informed Reconstruction Algorithm (REIRA)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09602v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the robustness and physical implications of a set of characteristic redshifts that capture key features of the late-time Universe. Using both model-independent reconstructions as well as different dark energy (DE) parameterizations, we show that these redshifts remain stable across cosmological models and reconstruction algorithm, making them reliable geometric anchors of the expansion history. Moreover, the Alcock-Paczy\'nski corrections at these redshift anchors are found to be unity with high statistical significance, making them natural isotropy points in the comoving distance-redshift relation. We also find that certain redshifts anchors $(z &lt; 1)$ coincide with epochs where strong deviations from the Planck $\Lambda$CDM baseline are apparent irrespective of DE parametrisation like CPL or reconstruction algorithm, indicating their potential as probes of new physics in cosmological evolution. Finally, we demonstrate, for the first time, that a Raychaudhuri Equation Informed Reconstruction Algorithm, substantially enhances the precision of the inferred distance measures and the Hubble expansion rate as well as results tighter constraints in the DE parameter space. These results demonstrate that combining geometric reconstruction with physics-informed kinematic information offers a powerful and consistent algorithm to probe new physics in the late-time dynamics of our Universe.</description>

Abstract: In this letter, we investigate the impact of non-spherical effects on the Primordial Black Hole mass function, based on the ellipticity-dependent threshold calculated by performing $3+1$ relativistic numerical simulations. We consider an equation of state of radiation $w:=P/\rho=1/3$ and a softer one $w=1/10$ with $P$ and $\rho$ being the pressure and energy density, respectively. We suppose that the curvature perturbations obey Gaussian statistics with a monochromatic power spectrum and examine the most probable ellipsoidal configurations utilizing peak theory. We also suppose the critical scaling law of the PBH mass near the threshold following the known results. The simulations arXiv:2410.03452 show that the non-sphericity can easily prevent the system from black hole formation when the initial fluctuation amplitude is near the threshold (critical scaling regime). Nevertheless, we show that the non-spherical effects make the mass function just a few times smaller and are insignificant on the mass function distribution, including the power-law scaling in the small mass region.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.03452v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We perform $3+1$ relativistic numerical simulations to study primordial black hole (PBH) formation from the collapse of adiabatic super-horizon non-spherical perturbations generated from curvature fluctuations obeying random Gaussian statistics with a monochromatic power spectrum. The matter field is assumed to be a perfect fluid of an equation of state $w:=P/\rho={\rm const.}$ with $P$ and $\rho$ being the pressure and the energy density, respectively. The initial spatial profile of the curvature perturbation is modeled with the amplitude $\mu$ and non-spherical parameters $e$ (ellipticity) and $p$ (prolateness) according to peak theory. We focus on the dynamics and the threshold for PBH formation in terms of the non-spherical parameters $e$ and $p$. We find that the critical values ($e_c, p_c$) with a fixed value of $\mu$ closely follow a superellipse curve. With $p=0$, for the range of amplitudes considered, we find that the critical ellipticity for non-spherical collapse follows a decaying power law as a function of $(\mu-\mu_{\rm c,sp})$ with $\mu_{\rm c,sp}$ being the threshold for the spherical case. Our results also indicate that, for both cases of $w = 1/3$ and $w = 1/10$, small deviations from sphericity can avoid collapsing to a black hole when the amplitude is near its critical threshold. Finally we discuss the significance of the ellipticity on the rate of the PBH production.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.10930v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a compact and transparent framework for photon dynamics and shadow formation in slowly evolving, spherically symmetric spacetimes. Starting from the Eddington-Finkelstein action, we derive a force-decomposed radial equation in which the radial acceleration splits into an induced term sourced by mass variation, a centrifugal term, and a purely general-relativistic correction. A key result is a gauge-invariant energy-flux relation, $d(E^2)/dv=-\Lambda/r$, with $\Lambda\equiv \varepsilon\,\dot M\,\dot v^2$, which controls how time dependence modifies the canonical energy of null geodesics. In the adiabatic regime we obtain an explicit first-order shift of the photon-sphere radius, $r_{ph}(v)=r_0-a_i/(a_g'+a_c')$, and connect it to the observable shadow through the evolving critical impact parameter, $b_{\rm crit}(v)=\sqrt{r_{ph}(v)^2/f(r_{ph}(v))}$. For Vaidya spacetimes this predicts that accretion ($\dot M&gt;0$) expands the photon sphere and increases the shadow angle, whereas mass loss has the opposite effect. Our formulation refines classic force-balance ideas to dynamical settings, provides a constructive link to time-dependent photon surfaces, and yields simple, observer-ready expressions for the evolution of the shadow. The framework offers a baseline for confronting time-variable horizon-scale imaging with dynamical inflow/outflow models.</description>

Abstract: In the wake of major breakthroughs in General Relativity during the 1960s, Roger Penrose introduced Strong Cosmic Censorship, a profound conjecture regarding the deterministic nature of the theory. Penrose's proposal has since opened far-reaching new mathematical avenues, revealing connections to fundamental questions about black holes and the nature of gravitational singularities. We review recent advances arising from modern techniques in the theory of partial differential equations as applied to Strong Cosmic Censorship, maintaining a focus on the context of gravitational collapse that gave birth to the conjecture.</description>

Abstract: We study the properties of a nonlinear magnetic-charged black hole in the presence of a phantom global monopole. By incorporating nonlinear electrodynamics (NLE) and exotic scalar fields, we derive an exact black hole solution and analyze its geometric structure, causal properties, and thermodynamic behavior. We examine how the presence of a phantom global monopole modifies the black hole's Hawking temperature, entropy, and stability conditions, revealing significant changes in its phase structure. Additionally, we investigate the geodesic motion of test particles. The quasinormal mode (QNM) spectrum is computed using the WKB approximation and P\"oschl-Teller potential method, providing insights into the perturbative stability of the system. Furthermore, we analyze the grey-body factors that characterize radiation emission, highlighting their dependence on black hole parameters. Our findings indicate that the interplay between phantom energy, NLE, and global monopoles introduces observable deviations in strong-field astrophysical phenomena. These results offer potential signatures for testing modified gravity theories and contribute to a deeper understanding of black hole physics in exotic field environments.</description>

      <title>The coexistence of null and spacelike singularities inside spherically symmetric black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12370v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In our previous work [Van de Moortel, The breakdown of weak null singularities, Duke Mathematical Journal 172 (15), 2957-3012, 2023], we showed that dynamical black holes formed in charged spherical collapse generically feature both a null weakly singular Cauchy horizon and a stronger (presumably spacelike) singularity, confirming a longstanding conjecture in the physics literature. However, this previous result, based on a contradiction argument, did not provide quantitative estimates on the stronger singularity.
  In this study, we adopt a new approach by analyzing local initial data inside the black hole that are consistent with a breakdown of the Cauchy horizon. We prove that the remaining portion is spacelike and obtain sharp spacetime estimates near the null-spacelike transition. Notably, we show that the Kasner exponents of the spacelike portion are positive, in contrast to the well-known Oppenheimer-Snyder model of gravitational collapse. Moreover, these exponents degenerate to (1,0,0) towards the null-spacelike transition.
  Our result provides the first quantitative instances of a null-spacelike singularity transition inside a black hole. In our companion paper, we moreover apply our analysis to carry out the construction of a large class of asymptotically flat one or two-ended black holes featuring coexisting null and spacelike singularities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.17848v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The characteristic oscillations of black holes, as described by their quasinormal mode (QNM) spectrum, play a fundamental role in testing general relativity with gravitational waves. The so-called parametrized QNM framework was introduced to predict perturbative changes in the spectrum due to small deviations from general relativity. In this work, we extend the framework to model time domain signals and study the excitation of quasinormal modes from the time evolution of initial data. Specifically, we quantify whether the perturbative eigenvalue predictions agree with extracting excited quasinormal modes from such simulations. Addressing this issue is particularly important in the context of agnostic ringdown tests and the possible presence of spectral instabilities, which may diminish the promises of black hole spectroscopy. We find that the extracted quasinormal modes agree well with the perturbative predictions, underlining that these types of modifications can, in principle, be robustly tested from real observations. Moreover, we also report the importance of including late-time tails for accurate mode extractions. Finally, we provide a WKB-inspired analysis supporting the importance of the peak of the scattering potential and show robust scaling relations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.18992v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we carry out a comprehensive perturbative analysis of four cosmological models featuring a sign-switching cosmological constant. Among these, we include the well-known $\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM model, characterised by an abrupt transition from a negative to a positive cosmological constant. We also consider the L$\Lambda$CDM model, which exhibits a generalised ladder-step evolution, as well as the SSCDM and ECDM models, both of which undergo a smooth sign change at comparable redshifts. We solve the linear cosmological perturbation equations from the radiation-dominated era, imposing initial adiabatic conditions for matter and radiation, for modes well outside the Hubble radius in the early Universe. We analyse the behaviour of the matter density contrast, the gravitational potential, the linear growth rate, the matter power spectrum, and the $f\sigma_8$ evolution . These results are contrasted with predictions from the standard $\Lambda$CDM model and are confronted with observational data.</description>

      <title>Nonlocal correlations for semiclassical states in loop quantum gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.19729v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compute the two-point correlation function of the area operator for semiclassical states of loop quantum gravity in the limit of large spins. The cases of intrinsic and extrinsic coherent states are considered, along with a new class of semiclassical states constructed as perturbations of Livine-Speziale coherent states. For the usual coherent states, the correlations are shown to be short-ranged, decaying exponentially with the distance. Introducing perturbations given by correlated elementary excitations and decays of the gravitational field along pairs of loops, we obtain new states that, while preserving the peakedness properties of the unperturbed states, can also display long-ranged correlations. The perturbed coherent states include examples reproducing the typical decay of correlations for quantum fluctuations of the geometry associated with free gravitons on a background metric. Such a behavior is a natural requirement for the compatibility of semiclassical states in quantum gravity with the physical regime pictured by perturbative quantum gravity.</description>

      <title>Peaking into the abyss: Characterizing the merger of equatorial-eccentric-geodesic plunges in rotating black holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.05870v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the gravitational waveforms generated by critical, equatorial plunging geodesics of the Kerr metric that start from an unstable-circular-orbit, which describe the test-mass limit of spin-aligned eccentric black-hole mergers. The waveforms are generated employing a time-domain Teukolsky code. We span different values of the Kerr spin $-0.99 \le a \le 0.99 $ and of the critical eccentricity $e_c$, for bound ($0 \le e_c&lt;1$) and unbound plunges ($e_c \ge 1$). We find that, contrary to expectations, the waveform modes $h_{\ell m}$ do not always manifest a peak for high eccentricities or spins. In case of the dominant $h_{22}$ mode, we determine the precise region of the parameter space in which its peak exists. In this region, we provide a characterization of the merger quantities of the $h_{22}$ mode and of the higher-order modes, providing the merger structure of the equatorial eccentric plunges of the Kerr spacetime in the test-mass limit.</description>

Abstract: We present a simplified review of inflationary cosmology across various modified gravity theories. These include models based on curvature, torsion, and non-metricity. We explore how scalar fields interact with different geometric quantities and how these interactions affect inflationary dynamics. Key cosmological features such as background evolution, reheating, and observable parameters are discussed. We also examine exotic scenarios inspired by string theory, extra dimensions, and non-local models. This work aims to connect theoretical models with observational data and future missions, offering guidance for exploring inflation beyond general relativity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.21652v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Numerical relativity has produced profound and extensive impacts on modern astrophysics and gravitational-wave astronomy. In this work, we develop a Python interface for the numerical relativity program AMSS-NCKU. This interface enables the automation of initializing and executing the AMSS-NCKU simulations, as well as the automated visualization of the output data. To show the practical utility of this Python interface, we present two representative examples of numerical relativity simulations (the binary and triple black hole merger processes), obtaining well-behaved stable numerical results and the expected physical behaviors for black hole systems. The Python operational interface significantly reduces the operational complexity of the AMSS-NCKU simulation workflow, lowering the technical barriers for freshman users.

Abstract: Motivated by the profound connection between quantum mechanics and spacetime geometry, particularly the conjectured correspondence between wormholes and quantum entanglement as proposed in the ER=EPR framework, this study aims to investigate the influence of wormhole geometries on quantum information extraction. We examine the correlation-specifically mutual information (MI) and entanglement-extracted by two Unruh-DeWitt (UDW) detectors from the quantum vacuum field in the presence of a BTZ wormhole featuring a null-like throat, also known as an Einstein-Rosen bridge. First, we analyze how the detector's position relative to the wormhole throat and the throat's size affect the extracted MI. Our results indicate that the wormhole enhances MI extraction, with maximal MI achieved when the detectors are located at specific image-symmetric points connected by the wormhole. By analyzing the behavior of the nonlocal contribution term and the classical noise term, it is found that the correlations extracted contain genuine non-classical components. This work highlights the feasibility of extracting quantum correlations through null-like wormhole geometries and provides a novel perspective for probing the potential relationship between spacetime topology and the nonlocal characteristics of quantum mechanics.</description>

      <title>Cosmological dynamics in the theory of gravity both with non-minimal and non-minimal derivative coupling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.04531v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper explores cosmological scenarios in a scalar-tensor theory of gravity, including both a non-minimal coupling with scalar curvature of the form $R\phi^2$ and a non-minimal derivative coupling of the form $G^{\mu\nu}\phi_{,\mu}\phi_{,\nu}$ in the presence of a scalar field potential with the monomial dependence $V(\phi) = V_0\phi^n$. Critical points of the system were obtained and analyzed. In the absence of a scalar field potential, stability conditions for these points were determined. Using methods of dynamical systems theory, the asymptotic behavior of the model was analyzed. It was shown that in the case of $V(\phi)\equiv0$ or $n &lt; 2$, a quasi-de Sitter asymptotic behavior exists, corresponding to an early inflationary universe. This asymptotic behavior in the approximation $V_0 \rightarrow 0,\ \xi \rightarrow 0$ coincides with the value $H = \frac{1}{\sqrt{9|\eta|}}$ obtained in works devoted to cosmological models with non-minimal kinetic coupling. For $|\xi|\ \rightarrow \infty$, this asymptotic behavior tends to the value $H = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3|\eta|}}$. Moreover, unstable regimes with phantom expansion $w_{eff} &lt; -1$ were found for the early dynamics of the model. For the late dynamics, the following stable asymptotic regimes were obtained: a power-law expansion with $w_{eff} \ge 1$, an expansion with $w_{eff} =\frac{1}{3}$ ($V(\phi)\equiv0$), at which the effective Planck mass tends to zero, and an exponential expansion with $w_{eff} = 0$ as $n = 2$. In this case, the asymptotic value of the Hubble parameter depends only on $V_0 = \frac{1}{2}m^2$ and $\xi$. Numerical integration of the model dynamics was performed for specific values of the theory parameters. The results are presented as phase portraits.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.05947v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the optical properties of black holes endowed with primary Proca hair, focusing on the distinctive double-peak structure generated in the effective potential by the massive vector field. This novel feature drastically modifies the geodesic motion of both photons and massive particles, leading to qualitatively new dynamical and observational signatures. We derive and analyze the effective potentials, classify time-like and null geodesics, and identify the conditions for multiple circular orbits. Particular attention is devoted to the photon sphere structure, the associated shadows, and lensing phenomena. Our analysis reveals that, for a broad range of parameters, the black-hole shadow can acquire a two-boundary structure and exhibit additional inner rings, unlike the standard Schwarzschild case. These modifications provide potentially observable imprints of Proca hair in electromagnetic spectra, highlighting the relevance of double-barrier optical phenomena for current and future observations of strong-gravity environments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1911.11605v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the metric-affine formulation of bumblebee gravity, derive the field equations, and show that the connection can be written as Levi-Civita of a disformally related metric in which the bumblebee field determines the disformal part. As a consequence, the bumblebee field gets coupled to all the other matter fields present in the theory, potentially leading to nontrivial phenomenological effects. To explore this issue we compute the weak-field, post-Minkowskian limit and study the resulting effective theory. In this scenario, we couple scalar and spinorial matter to the effective metric, and then we explore the physical properties of the VEV of the bumblebee field, focusing mainly on the dispersion relations and the stability of the resulting effective theory.</description>

Abstract: We consider the Euclidean vacuum for linearized gravity on the global de Sitter space, obtained from the Euclidean Green's function on the 4-sphere. We use the notion of Calder\'on projectors to recover a quantum state for the Lorentzian theory on de Sitter space. We show that while the state is gauge invariant and Hadamard, it is not positive on the whole of the phase space. We show however that a suitable modification at low energies yields a well-defined Hadamard state on global de Sitter space.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18853v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study torsional topological defects in Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity in ($4+1$)-dimensional anti-de Sitter spacetime. In the holographic interpretation, these correspond to crystalline dislocation defects associated with the discrete lattice translational symmetry. The Gauss-Bonnet coupling is fixed at the Chern-Simons point. By solving the equations of motion through an asymptotic expansion near the boundary, we show that the dual ($3+1$)-dimensional theory admits axially symmetric solutions. These solutions describe holographic materials with dislocation defects at finite temperature, encoded by a black hole in the bulk. At the same time, they feature ring-shaped defects arising from the background Riemann-Cartan geometry, characterized by nontrivial Burgers vectors. We also discuss the possible appearance of an odd-parity Abelian holographic anomaly, proportional to the Nieh-Yan invariant. Our results motivate further studies of holographic defects using bulk gravitational theories and support the view that torsion provides a holographic counterpart of crystalline dislocation defects.</description>

      <title>Testing $f(R)$ Gravity from Cosmic Shear Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04807v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we perform a detailed analysis to constrain the Hu-Sawicki \(f(R)\) gravity model, using cosmic shear data from three prominent Stage-III weak lensing surveys: DES-Y3, KiDS-1000, and HSC-Y3. To accurately model the nonlinear matter clustering in the analysis of cosmic shear signals, we employ \texttt{FREmu}, a recently developed power spectrum emulator for the \(f(R)\) gravity trained on the Quijote-MG simulations. This emulator achieves precise predictions, limiting the errors to 5\% on scales of \(0.009h\,{\rm Mpc}^{-1} &lt; k &lt; 0.5h\,{\rm Mpc}^{-1}\). Our findings reveal that cosmic shear data alone impose only weak constraints on the \(f(R)\) parameter \(\log_{10}|f_{R_0}|\). To improve these constraints, we incorporate state-of-the-art external observations, including data from the cosmic microwave background and baryon acoustic oscillations.

      <title>Gravitational Waves from Resonant Transitions of Tidally Perturbed Gravitational Atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18121v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Light bosons can form a gravitational atom (GA) around a spinning black hole through the superradiance process. Considering the black hole to be part of a binary system, the tidal potential of the companion periodically perturbs the GA such that an ``atomic'' transition occurs between two of its energy eigenstates. The resonant transition is modeled by the Landau-Zener system, where the orbital frequency of the companion determines the relevant transition. In this work, we study a novel quasi-monochromatic gravitational wave signal originating directly from the level transition of the GA in a binary system. We derive the analytical formulae of both the strain waveform and frequency spectrum of the signal. We further investigate the GA-binary systems that can have a large signal-to-noise ratio in the milli-Hz to deci-Hz frequency band. Using the future space-based gravitational wave observatory DECIGO, we find the signal-to-noise ratio is $\mathcal{O}(10-200)$ for the fine-structure constant $\alpha\simeq 0.3$, host black hole mass $M= 150M_\odot$ and boson mass $\mu \simeq 10^{-13} \rm eV$ at a distance within 100 kpc. Given astrophysical uncertainties about the black hole's initial spin, the degeneracy with other monochromatic signals and the small merger rate at those distances, we conclude that the detection of the signal would be challenging.</description>

      <title>What is a photon in de Sitter spacetime?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00761v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The states of a single photon in four-dimensional de Sitter (dS) spacetime form a Unitary Irreducible Representation (UIR) of SO(1,4), which we call the photon UIR. While in flat spacetime photons are intimately tied to gauge symmetry, we demonstrate that in de Sitter, photon states emerge generically in any quantum field theory, even without an underlying U(1) gauge field. We derive a K\"all\'en-Lehmann representation for antisymmetric tensor two-point functions and show that numerous composite operators constructed from massive free fields can create states in the photon UIR. Remarkably, we find that some of these operators exhibit two-point functions with slower late-time and large-distance decay than the electromagnetic field strength itself, challenging the conventional notion that photons dominate the infrared regime. Using our spectral representation, we establish non-perturbative bounds on the late-time behavior of electric and magnetic fields in de Sitter, with potential implications for primordial magnetogenesis. Through one-loop calculations, we demonstrate that both the creation of photon states and the enhanced late-time large-distance behavior persist in weakly interacting theories.</description>

      <title>Scalar field stochastic dynamics in de Sitter spacetime from exact solutions of quantum deficient oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21429v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The stochastic dynamics of a scalar field in de Sitter spacetime can be regarded as a non-perturbative diffusion process, to which exact distribution and correlation functions are constructed by utilising the correspondence between diffusion and Schr\"{o}dinger equations. The Krein--Adler transformation of the quantum harmonic oscillator deletes several pairs of the energy levels to define anharmonic oscillators that we dub quantum deficient oscillators, based on which this article constructs a new class of exact solutions in stochastic inflation. In addition to the simplest single-well model, an exactly solvable double-well model is also presented. The results are further extended to exactly solvable models with multiple wells, allowing analytical studies on various cosmological phenomenologies.</description>

      <title>Model-independent cosmological inference after the DESI DR2 data with improved inverse distance ladder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22369v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, the baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) measurements from the DESI survey have suggested hints of dynamical dark energy, challenging the standard $\Lambda $CDM model. In this work, we adopt an improved inverse distance ladder approach based on the latest cosmological data to provide a model-independent perspective, employing a global parametrization based on cosmic age (PAge). Our analysis incorporates DESI DR2 BAO measurements, cosmic chronometer (CC) data, and type Ia supernovae (SNe) observations from either the DESY5 or PantheonPlus datasets. For the DESY5+DESI DR2+CC datasets, we obtain $H_0 = 67.91 \pm 2.33~\mathrm{km~s^{-1}~Mpc^{-1}}$. This value is consistent with the Planck 2018 result, while shows $2.0 \sigma$ tension with the SH0ES measurement. Furthermore, by mapping specific cosmological models into PAge approximation parameter space $(p_{\mathrm{age}}, \eta)$, our model-independent analysis reveals a notable deviation from the $\Lambda \mathrm{CDM}$ model, as indicated by the DESY5 and DESI DR2 datasets. Finally, DESY5+DESI DR2+CC datasets provide nearly decisive evidence favoring the PAge model over the standard $\Lambda \mathrm{CDM}$ model. These findings highlight the need for further investigation into the expansion history to better understand the deviations from the $\Lambda \mathrm{CDM}$ model.</description>

      <title>GW-YOLO: Multi-transient segmentation in LIGO using computer vision</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.17399v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Time series data and their time-frequency representation from gravitational-wave interferometers present multiple opportunities for the use of artificial intelligence methods associated with signal and image processing. Closely connected with this is the real-time aspect associated with gravitational-wave interferometers and the astrophysical observations they perform; the discovery potential of these instruments can be significantly enhanced when data processing can be achieved in O(1s) timescales. In this work, we introduce a novel signal and noise identification tool based on the YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection framework. For its application into gravitational waves, we will refer to it as GW-YOLO. This tool can provide scene identification capabilities and essential information regarding whether an observed transient is any combination of noise and signal. Additionally, it supplies detailed time-frequency coordinates of the detected objects in the form of pixel masks, an essential property that can be used to understand and characterize astrophysical sources, as well as instrumental noise. The simultaneous identification of noise and signal, combined with precise pixel-level localization, represents a significant advancement in gravitational-wave data analysis. Our approach yields a 50\% detection efficiency for binary black hole signals at a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of 15 when such signals overlap with transient noise artifacts. When noise artifacts overlap with binary neutron star signals, our algorithm attains 50\% detection efficiency at an SNR of 30. This presents the first quantitative assessment of the ability to detect astrophysical events overlapping with realistic, instrument noise present in gravitational-wave interferometers.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear realisation approach to extended supergravity theories in three dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03088v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We elaborate on the nonlinear realisation approach to spontaneously broken supergravity in three dimensions presented in arXiv:2304.09506. Using this approach we provide a novel derivation of $\mathcal{N}$-extended supergravity, with and without a cosmological term. It corresponds to a St\"uckelberg-type extension of the following theories: (i) the $(p,q)$ anti-de Sitter (AdS) supergravity theories with $p+q=\mathcal{N}$, $p\geq q\geq 0$ proposed by Ach\'ucarro and Townsend; and (ii) the $\mathcal{N}$-extended Poincar\'e supergravity of Marcus and Schwarz. We also apply the approach to obtain a St\"uckelberg reformulation of the supersymmetric Lorentz Chern-Simons action for arbitrary $\mathcal{N}$. In our construction, the pure supergravity actions (Poincar\'e and AdS) share the invariance under two different local $\mathcal{N}$-extended supersymmetries. One of them acts on the Goldstini, while the other supersymmetry leaves the Goldstini inert. The $\mathcal{N}$-extended supersymmetric Lorentz Chern-Simons action proposed in our setting shares the former supersymmetry, but differs in the one that leaves the Goldstini inert. The supersymmetry that acts on the Goldstini can be used to gauge them away, and then the resulting actions coincide with that given in the literature.</description>

      <title>Massive Spinning Fields During Inflation: Feynman rules and correlator comparison</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08888v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the dynamics of massive spinning fields during inflation and the resulting signatures in the cosmological correlators of inflaton perturbations computed in the Poincar\'e patch of de Sitter space. There are (at least) two ways to describe the fluctuations of such new spinning degrees of freedom and these are distinguished by the symmetries of the de Sitter group that they linearly realise. The primary question we ask is: do these two set-ups yield distinct signatures in cosmological observables? After systematically deriving the Feynman rules for exchange diagrams consisting of massive spinning fields, where we discover the necessity of effective propagators that augment the naive Schwinger-Keldysh ones by delta functions corresponding to instantaneous propagation, we show that the two set-ups are indistinguishable at the level of the inflaton bispectrum but distinguishable at the level of the trispectrum and other higher-point correlation functions. The bispectrum is special since in the corresponding tree-level Feynman diagrams, only the helicity-zero modes of the spinning fields can propagate. The bispectrum correspondence holds up to the addition of contact diagrams arising from the self-interactions of the inflaton, and is consistent with the symmetries of the effective field theory of inflation. Our results suggest that the cosmological collider signals in the bispectrum are universal and do not depend on the detailed description of the massive spinning field.</description>

      <title>Scrambling-Enhanced Quantum Battery Charging in Black Hole Analogues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23598v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Black holes constitute nature's fastest quantum information scramblers, a phenomenon captured by gravitational analogue systems such as position-dependent XY spin chains. In these models, scrambling dynamics are governed exclusively by the hopping interactions profile, independent of system size. Utilizing such curved spacetime analogues as quantum batteries, we explore how the black hole scrambling affects charging via controlled quenches of preset scrambling parameters. Our analysis reveals that the intentionally engineered difference between post-quench and pre-quench scrambling parameters could significantly enhance both maximum stored energy $E_{\max}$ and peak charging power $P_{\max}$ in the quench charging protocol. The optimal charging time $\tau_*$ exhibits negligible dependence on the preset initial horizon parameter $x_{h0}$, while decreasing monotonically with increasing quench horizon parameter $x_{ht}$. This temporal compression confines high-power operation to regimes with strong post-quench scrambling $x_{ht} &gt; x_{h0}$, demonstrating accelerated charging mediated by spacetime-mimicking scrambling dynamics.</description>
