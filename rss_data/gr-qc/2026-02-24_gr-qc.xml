      <title>Canonical Vielbeins for General Relativity: D + 1 Decomposition and Constraint Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18491v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a self-contained derivation of the Hamiltonian formulation of General Relativity in vielbein variables in $d=D+1$ dimensions. Starting from the Einstein--Hilbert action in a standard metric $D+1$ decomposition, we derive Lorentz- and $\mathrm{SO}(D)$-covariant phase-space actions, identify the primary Lorentz constraints, and obtain the Hamiltonian and momentum constraints. We compute the resulting first-class constraint algebra, relate the vielbein and metric phase-space formulations, and discuss the rotation/boost decomposition. In particular, we construct the boost generator in the $\mathrm{SO}(D)$-covariant formulation, thereby recovering full local Lorentz symmetry.</description>

      <title>Null hypersurfaces in general relativity: Intrinsic symmetries and differential invariants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18499v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates intrinsic Killing symmetries of null hypersurfaces $\mathcal{N}_3$ within the framework of general relativity. To this end we consider $\mathcal{N}_3$ as detached from the embedding spacetime and equipped with a degenerate metric of signature (0,+,+). As geometrical tools we use a triad calculus and differential invariants. Extending prior work, we present a classification of null hypersurfaces according to groups of motion up to the fourth order. For each type certain normal forms of the metric are given, and their invariants are listed. A discussion of horizons - defined as null hypersurfaces with vanishing shear and divergence - is included.</description>

      <title>Population-coherence routes to purity in Page-type models of black-hole evaporation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18503v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the black-hole information problem from the viewpoint of a population-coherence decomposition of density-matrix purity. Building on a previously developed formalism for ndimensional density matrices, we characterize each state by a normalized global purity index and two complementary indices, which quantify the contributions of level populations and coherences. This yields a simple quadratic relation and a geometric representation in a population-coherence plane, where different routes to purity can be distinguished. In the two-level case we construct explicit families of states with identical spectra and global purity but opposite internal structure, realizing population-dominated and coherence-dominated routes. We then apply this framework to a standard Page-type evaporation model without an explicit Hamiltonian, in which a black hole and its Hawking radiation form a bipartite pure state with varying Hilbert-space dimensions. Using known results for typical reduced states in large dimensions, we analyze the behavior of population and coherence components of purity along the evaporation process. Under the physically motivated requirement that, in this energy-free setting, the radiation populations remain nearly uniform in the chosen basis, we show that the late-time recovery of purity must be coherence-dominated: the global purity of the radiation approaches unity while the population index stays small and the coherence index carries essentially all the purity.</description>

      <title>Two Parameter Deformation of Embedding Class-I Compact Stars in Linear $f(Q)$ Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18615v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent multi-messenger observations, including gravitational wave detections of compact objects in the neutron star-black hole mass-gap region and precise measurements of high-mass pulsars, motivate mechanisms capable of enlarging the stellar mass window without arbitrarily stiffening the equation of state (EOS) toward the causal limit. In linear $f(Q)$ gravity of the form $f(Q)=\beta_1 Q+\beta_2$, the theory is dynamically equivalent to General Relativity at the geometric level and modifies stellar structure solely through a uniform rescaling of the matter sector governed by $\beta_1$. Consequently, linear $f(Q)$ alone does not introduce new geometric families of stellar solutions or alter classical compactness bounds. To overcome this structural limitation, we incorporate gravitational decoupling within an embedding class-I (Karmarkar) Vaidya-Tikekar configuration in linear $f(Q)$ gravity. While similar VT-based decoupling constructions exist in GR, the present framework introduces a controlled two-parameter deformation characterized by $(\epsilon,\beta_1)$: the decoupling parameter $\epsilon$ governs geometric deformation and EOS stiffness, whereas $\beta_1$ independently rescales the matter sector without altering the metric structure. This separation permits a direct comparison between GR and linear $f(Q)$ gravity at fixed geometric deformation, thereby isolating pure coupling-driven mass enhancement. We determine the admissible parameter domain from regularity, matching, causality and compactness requirements and derive an analytic compactness bound for the decoupled embedding class-I configuration. The combined action of $\epsilon$ and $\beta_1$ enlarges the accessible stellar mass window while preserving physical acceptability, allowing configurations compatible with recent high-mass pulsars and mass-gap candidates without exceeding causal limits.</description>

      <title>Ultraviolet Fixed Point in Covariant Loop Quantum Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the ultraviolet behavior of 4-dimensional Lorentzian covariant Loop Quantum Gravity (LQG) and address the problem of infinite ambiguities relating to the triangulation dependence of spinfoam amplitudes. We consider the complete LQG amplitude that summing spinfoam amplitudes over 2-complexes. By introducing spin-network stacks and their covariant extension, spinfoam stacks, the summation over complexes is partitioned into distinct families. We demonstrate that the theory exhibits a condensation phenomenon, where quantum geometry condenses to a dominant small spin configuration. We identify a candidate fixed point controlling the ultraviolet (small spin) regime of covariant LQG. At this fix point, the complete LQG amplitude dynamically reduces to a topological theory at leading order, and the infinite ambiguities of triangulation dependence reduces to a finite set of boundary coefficients associated with a finite basis of 3-dimensional boundary blocks. These results provide a definition for the continuum limit of spinfoam theory at the fundamental level.</description>

      <title>New Black hole Solutions in $f(\mathbb{Q})$ Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18732v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate static and spherically symmetric vacuum solutions in the symmetric teleparallel $f(\mathbb{Q})$ modified theory of gravity. Starting from a recently proposed classification of affine connections compatible with both the symmetries of spacetime and the constraints of symmetric teleparallel geometry, we develop a systematic approach to solve the full field equations. We first identify two distinct classes of connections that satisfy the off-diagonal metric field equations and the connection constraints. For an arbitrary $f(\mathbb{Q})$ function when the non-metricity scalar $\mathbb{Q}$ vanishes, we recover exact analytical solutions equivalent to those of general relativity, including the Schwarzschild and Schwarzschild (anti)de-Sitter metrics. We then extend our analysis beyond general relativity by considering the quadratic model $f(\mathbb{Q})=\mathbb{Q}+\alpha~\mathbb{Q}^2$ with a small parameter $\alpha$. Using a perturbative approach, we derive asymptotically flat, analytical solutions up to second order in $\alpha$. These solutions exhibit corrections to the standard Schwarzschild metric, characterized by new integration constants that can be interpreted as connection hair. We explore the asymptotic behavior of these solutions and disclose that the horizon radius receives corrections that can be expressed compactly using the Lambert $\mathcal{W}$ function. Our results provide new, non-trivial vacuum solutions within $f(\mathbb{Q})$ gravity and highlight the rich structure introduced by the non-metricity connection.</description>

      <title>Generalized Carter &amp; R\"udiger Constants of $\sqrt{\text{Kerr}}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18790v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the motion of a charged spinning test/probe particle -- governed by the Mathisson-Papapetrou-Dixon equations with generic, adiabatic, and conservative spin- and field-induced multipole moments -- in a background $\sqrt{\text{Kerr}}$ field on flat spacetime: the electromagnetic field of a charged spinning ring-disk singularity obtained from the $G\to 0$ limit of the Kerr-Newman solution for a charged spinning black hole. We investigate the existence of two extra hidden constants of motion, analogous to the Carter constant (for geodesic motion in a Kerr spacetime, or for its spinning-probe generalization) and R\"udiger's linear-in-spin constant for a spinning probe in a Kerr background. We find that these two constants exist only when the Wilson coefficients parameterizing the probe's multipole structure take the particular values corresponding to spin-exponentiation of the effective Compton amplitudes through second order in spin.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.18877v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It was recently demonstrated that imposing the condition $P_{r} = -\rho$ on the radial pressure of a galactic halo can lead to regular black-hole solutions for certain density profiles, such as the Dehnen and Einasto models. In the present work, we show that some of the most commonly used halo profiles, including the Hernquist model, do not yield regular geometries under the same condition, but instead support black-hole solutions that retain a central singularity</description>

      <title>Thermal aspects and particle dynamics of Euler-Heisenberg AdS black hole in 4D Einstein Gauss-Bonnet gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18945v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct charged AdS black hole solutions in four dimensional Einstein Gauss Bonnet gravity coupled to Euler Heisenberg nonlinear electrodynamics and investigate their physical properties. The modified field equations admit black hole solutions whose horizon structure is significantly affected by higher-curvature and nonlinear electromagnetic corrections, allowing for multiple horizons depending on the model parameters. In the extended phase space, where the cosmological constant is interpreted as thermodynamic pressure, we analyze the thermodynamic behavior and show that both the Gauss Bonnet coupling and the Euler Heisenberg parameter induce notable modifications in the equation of state, critical behavior, and thermal stability. Interpreting the black hole mass as enthalpy, we study the Joule-Thomson expansion and determine the inversion temperature and pressure, demonstrating that higher curvature and nonlinear electrodynamic effects substantially influence the cooling and heating regions. Finally, we examine time-like geodesics and show that Gauss Bonnet corrections significantly modify the effective potential, orbital stability, and particle motion in the strong-field regime</description>

      <title>Inertial Frame Dragging as a Probe to Differentiate Kerr-Newman Naked Singularities from Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18972v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate inertial frame dragging and relativistic precession in the Kerr--Newman spacetime and show how gyroscopic observables can operationally discriminate between Kerr--Newman black holes and Kerr--Newman naked singularities. We study a test gyroscope attached to a stationary observer and derive closed-form expressions for the Lense--Thirring, geodetic, and general spin-precession frequencies. A sharp qualitative distinction emerges: for Kerr--Newman black holes, the spin-precession frequency generically diverges as the horizon is approached (remaining finite only for the ZAMO family), whereas for Kerr--Newman naked singularities, the precession remains finite throughout the spacetime, with divergences confined to the ring singularity on the equatorial plane. Working with physically admissible stationary observers (including ZAMOs), we first construct the timelike geodesic motion and the fundamental orbital frequencies for equatorial circular orbits. Using these, we analyse the radial and vertical epicyclic frequencies, the ISCO shift induced by the charge parameter $Q$, and the associated periastron and nodal precession frequencies relevant to quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs). We demonstrate that nonzero $Q$ produces systematic, and in rapidly rotating regimes nontrivial, modifications to the frequency hierarchy: $\nu_{\rm nod}$ can develop a finite maximum at $r=r_p=\mathcal{O}(M)$, its peak amplitude decreases with increasing $Q$, and sign reversals may occur for sufficiently large charge and high spin, signalling a reversal of nodal-precession orientation. These results establish spin-precession behaviour as a robust strong-field probe of horizons versus exposed singularities, with potential implications for testing cosmic censorship using future high-precision precession/QPO measurements.</description>

      <title>Testing the Spacetime Geometry of Sgr A* with the Relativistic Orbit of S2 star</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we perform a relativistic test of the spacetime geometry of Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*) using the orbit of the S2 star. We consider a broad class of compact object models, including Schwarzschild, Reissner-Nordstr\"om, Bardeen, Hayward, and Simpson-Visser black holes, as well as the Janis-Newman-Winicour naked singularity spacetime. For each geometry, we integrate the timelike geodesic equations and consistently project the resulting trajectories onto astrometric and spectroscopic observables, incorporating R{\o}mer time delay and relativistic redshift effects. The theoretical predictions are tested with current Very Large Telescope (VLT) observations of the S2 star, while simultaneously imposing constraints from the Event Horizon Telescope shadow size. We find that several spacetimes that are degenerate at the level of shadow imaging, most notably Schwarzschild, Reissner-Nordstr\"om, and Bardeen regular black hole geometries, remain statistically indistinguishable when tested against present S2 data. We further carry out a statistical model comparison based on the Akaike and Bayesian information criteria (AIC and BIC) to evaluate the relative performance of the alternative spacetime models. Our analysis also constrains the generalized charge like parameter $q/M$ in non-Schwarzschild spacetimes based on current S2 star observations, and identifies specific black hole and horizonless geometries that can be further tested with forthcoming high precision astrometric observations from the VLT and Keck telescopes.</description>

      <title>Unitary and finite self-energy of a single classical point charge and naked point singularity spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze linear Einstein--Maxwell perturbations of the superextremal Reissner--Nordstr\"om geometry in its static Kerr--Schild rest frame, viewing it as the nonlinear self-field of a single static point charge. In optical radial coordinates, and using the Kodama--Ishibashi gauge-invariant formalism, each radiative multipole is encoded by a single scalar master field on the half-line. The resulting master equation is of Regge--Wheeler type, with an inverse-square potential core at the optical apex (controlled by a Hardy inequality) and a short-range tail at infinity. The spatial-plus-potential part of the Einstein--Maxwell $T$-energy is closable and bounded below, which defines a positive quadratic form on the natural energy space. Its Friedrichs extension then gives the canonical self-adjoint realization of the master operator. The static Coulomb field and its nonlinear gravitational backreaction are treated as the exact background. All linear Einstein--Maxwell perturbations with finite spatial $T$-energy evolve unitarily on the energy space. The naked singularity at finite optical distance is ``silent'' in the technical sense that it carries no $T$-energy flux. We also construct the forward radiation field at future null infinity, obtaining a translation representation of the self-field dynamics in which the conserved $T$-energy coincides with the $L^2$ norm of the radiation profile in retarded time.</description>

      <title>The Role of Inhomogeneities in the Turbulent Accretion of Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Observations of supermassive black holes by the Event Horizon Telescope reveal significant inhomogeneities, most likely related to density and magnetic field perturbations. To model these features, we conduct high-resolution 2D general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamics (GRMHD) simulations of a Fishbone-Moncrief torus around a Kerr black hole using the Black Hole Accretion Code $\texttt{BHAC}$. We compare unperturbed accretion with a case featuring plasma density bubbles with pressure balanced magnetic islands of different amplitudes. Power spectrum analysis of accretion time series, performed via the Blackman-Tukey method, shows that the perturbed case exhibits (1) steeper spectral indices compared to the unperturbed case, deviating from the characteristic $1/\omega$ noise spectrum, and (2) increased correlation times, providing evidence for absorption of macro-structures at the event horizon. Spatial auto-correlation analysis of near-horizon turbulence confirms larger energy-containing coherent structures in the perturbed case altering the accretion rate. These results provide new insights for interpreting observations of supermassive black hole environments, where near-horizon turbulence may play a key role in the accretion process.</description>

      <title>A New Perspective on the Cosmological Constant and Its Core Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the most enduring and unresolved challenges in modern theoretical and observational cosmology is the fine-tuning and coincidence problems associated with the cosmological constant. Rather than attempting to reconcile these issues within the standard LCDM framework where they remain effectively frozen, we adopt a fundamentally different viewpoint based on alternative theories of gravity. We argue that the root of these problems lies in a deep misinterpretation of the cosmological constant, particularly its identification with the quantum ground-state energy of spacetime. In this work, we propose a novel physical interpretation of the cosmological constant and introduce a new mechanism, termed Breaking Energy-Momentum Symmetry. This framework provides a natural and unified route toward alleviating, and potentially resolving, both the fine-tuning and coincidence problems, offering a compelling alternative to the conventional cosmological paradigm.</description>

      <title>Gauss-Bonnet Gravity and Spacetime Singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19150v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the effect of higher-order curvature terms, specifically Gauss-Bonnet terms, on spacetime singularities in five dimensions. For FLRW cosmologies, we demonstrate that Gauss-Bonnet terms can replace the Big Bang/Crunch with a "sudden" singularity, characterized by a finite scale factor and Hubble rate but diverging higher-order derivatives. Investigating various branches of solutions shows the possibility of explicit extension of non-spacelike geodesics beyond the singular point. Furthermore, we employ the Gauss-Bonnet junction conditions to verify the consistency of the extension with the field equations. The whole solution describes a contracting phase prior to the expansion phase with a well-defined surface stress-energy tensor. Regarding the Boulware-Deser black hole, we find that Gauss-Bonnet terms soften the central singularity for radial geodesics--rendering them "weak" according to the Tipler and Krolak criteria--whereas non-radial geodesics remain strongly singular. Junction condition analysis of this solution shows that although higher-curvature corrections alter the nature of the singularity, geodesics are still inextendible as a result of divergent extrinsic curvature. Our results are consistent with the Penrose-Hawking singularity theorems since in Gauss-Bonnet black holes, geodesics suffer from focusing (expansion parameter diverges), while in cosmology, there is no focusing since the expansion parameter remains finite at the singularity.</description>

      <title>Propagation effects of Lorentz violation in gravitational waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19186v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the propagation of gravitational waves in the presence of Lorentz- and diffeomorphism-violating operators within the linearized gravitational sector of the Standard Model Extension. Focusing on isotropic contributions, we analyze the combined effects of the nondispersive CPT-even dimension-four coefficient $\mathring{k}^{(4)}_{(I)}$ and the CPT-odd dimension-five coefficient $\mathring{k}^{(5)}_{(V)}$ on tensorial gravitational radiation. The modified dispersion relation induces both a rescaling of the propagation speed and helicity-dependent dispersive corrections, leading to birefringence and polarization mixing without introducing additional propagating degrees of freedom. We derive the retarded Green function associated with the modified wave operator and obtain explicit expressions for the gravitational waveform generated by matter sources. As a concrete application, we examine a binary black hole system and show how Lorentz violation alters the observed strain through shifted retarded times, amplitude rescaling, and higher derivative corrections to the quadrupole formula. The CPT-odd term produces characteristic attenuation and distortions in the waveform, which can be interpreted as energy exchange between the gravitational wave and the Lorentz-violating background rather than a violation of energy conservation. Using published LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA propagation tests and polarization consistency arguments, we translate current observational constraints into bounds on $\mathring{k}^{(4)}_{(I)}$ and $\mathring{k}^{(5)}_{(V)}$.</description>

      <title>The early history of symmetric teleparallel gravity: An overlooked period</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19194v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is noteworthy that symmetric teleparallel gravity has attracted considerable attention in recent years. A survey of the literature indicates that this surge of interest became particularly prominent around 2017 and 2018. However, together with my students and collaborators, we published a series of systematic and pioneering papers on this subject between 2004 and 2013. In this letter, we will summarize our overlooked contributions to symmetric teleparallel gravity produced during that period. For the sake of completeness and coherence, we will also briefly review our work on this topic carried out after 2018. In the final paragraph, we will write our personal perspectives on the future of symmetric teleparallel geometry.</description>

      <title>The linearised conformal Einstein field equations around a Petrov-type~D spacetime: the conformal Teukolsky equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19245v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While the Teukolsky equation plays a central role in traditional treatments of perturbations of algebraically special spacetimes, its relation to Friedrich's conformal Einstein field equations (CEFEs) remains largely unexplored. Here we develop a conformal formulation of black-hole perturbation theory based on the CEFEs and derive the conformal Teukolsky equation. Starting from a transparent review of Friedrich's regularisation strategy, this work establishes a direct connection between mainstream curvature-based linear perturbation theory and conformal formulations of general relativity. This perspective is timely given the growing relevance of hyperboloidal frameworks in black-hole perturbation theory, where conformal compactification is introduced at the level of an already linearised effective wave equation. Here instead, the conformal factor is a dynamical variable within the field equations. In the non-linear equations there is a coupling between conformal and curvature perturbations; however, when linearised around a Petrov-type D background, the conformal factor decouples from the equations governing the Newman-Penrose components $\phi_0$ and $\phi_4$ of the rescaled Weyl tensor. The resulting equation preserves the structural form of the classical Teukolsky equation while remaining regular at the conformal boundary. This provides a geometric interpretation of the hyperboloidal master variable and an entry point into the CEFE framework. We further derive the conformal Teukolsky equation for a conformal representation of Kerr spacetime where spatial infinity is realised as a blown-up cylinder. By bridging conformal and traditional approaches to black-hole perturbation theory, the framework highlights a geometrically regular representation of perturbative dynamics that may inform extensions beyond the linear regime.</description>

      <title>The extremely-tilted fluid regime near asymptotically Kasner big bang singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we solve the relativistic Euler equations with a linear barotropic equation of state on a large class of background spacetimes with Kasner big bang asymptotics. Building on previous work in the asymptotically non-tilted regime, which applies when the speed of sound of the fluid is large in comparison to the Kasner exponents, we now consider the asymptotically extremely-tilted regime when the speed of sound is small. We solve the Cauchy problem for the Euler equations towards the big bang singularity and prove, without any symmetry assumptions or smallness conditions on the Cauchy data, that the solutions exist globally in time provided the mean curvature of the initial hypersurface is sufficiently large. Finally, we prove that the solutions exhibit the asymptotics expected from standard heuristic arguments in this regime; in particular, fluid particles are driven towards the speed of light in the direction of the largest Kasner exponent as the big bang singularity is approached.</description>

      <title>Improving calibration accuracy with torque coupled gravity field calibrator for sub-Hz gravitational wave observation in CHRONOS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A fundamental challenge in low-frequency gravitational-wave detectors is the limited signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of calibration lines, particularly in torsion-bar systems where the response is governed by rotational dynamics. In this work, we resolve this issue by optimizing the geometrical configuration of a torque-coupled gravity field calibrator (GCal), achieving an improvement in calibration-line SNR by more than an order of magnitude compared to conventional layouts.
  For the Cryogenic sub-Hz cROss torsion-bar detector with quantum NOn-demolition Speed-meter (CHRONOS), the calibration signal appears as a monochromatic line within the $0.1$--$10~\mathrm{Hz}$ band. At $1~\mathrm{Hz}$, the strain-equivalent calibration amplitude reaches $|h_{\rm GCal}| = 1.18 \times 10^{-14}$, corresponding to an SNR density of $|h_{\rm GCal}|/S_h = 4.25 \times 10^{3}$. This demonstrates for the first time that a high-SNR calibration line can be directly injected into the sub-Hz band of a torsion-bar detector.
  A first-order perturbative error propagation analysis yields a total fractional systematic uncertainty of $\delta h_{\rm GCal}/h_{\rm GCal} = 0.24\%$, dominated by geometric alignment uncertainties, while contributions from mass uncertainties and the gravitational constant remain subdominant. The corresponding absolute systematic uncertainty is $\delta h_{\rm GCal} \sim 10^{-17}$ at $1~\mathrm{Hz}$.
  These results establish torque-coupled gravitational calibration as a practical solution to the longstanding low-SNR problem in sub-Hz torsion-bar detectors and provide a robust pathway toward precision absolute calibration in the low-frequency regime.</description>

      <title>Chaotic imprints of dark matter in extreme mass-ratio inspirals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19541v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extreme mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs) are among the most powerful probes of strong-field gravity and of the environments surrounding supermassive compact objects. Motivated by the expected presence of dark matter near galactic centers, we investigate the emergence and gravitational-wave imprints of chaotic dynamics in EMRIs evolving in non-vacuum spacetimes. Within a unified dynamical framework, we analyze test-particle motion in a broad class of dark-matter-embedded geometries, including singular black holes, regular black holes, naked singularities, and Einstein-cluster configurations. We show that environmental perturbations generically break integrability in the strong-field regime, giving rise to chaotic motion whose onset, duration, and termination depend sensitively on horizon structure, core regularization, and matter distribution. Using the numerical Kludge approach, we demonstrate that chaotic trajectories produce systematic qualitative modifications of the emitted gravitational radiation, such as irregular amplitude modulation and loss of phase coherence, in contrast to the smooth, quasi-periodic waveforms generated by regular motion. Our results establish the robustness of chaos in environmentally perturbed EMRIs and provide a clear conceptual link between nonlinear orbital dynamics, spacetime structure, and observable gravitational-wave signatures.</description>

      <title>Boltzmann Dynamics in K-essence Cosmology: Photon Propagation in an Emergent Spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19576v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent cosmological tensions, notably the Hubble and $S_{8}$ tensions, necessitate extensions of the conventional $\Lambda$CDM framework, wherein additional dynamical fields alter the effective spacetime encountered by matter and radiation. In K-essence cosmology, the scalar field induces an emergent FLRW geometry that is disformally linked to the gravitational metric, resulting in a \emph{tilted causal structure} where the light cone propagation differs from that of gravity. This study develops a covariant Boltzmann formalism inside a homogeneous K-essence framework and derives the modified mass-shell condition, geodesic equations, and collision integrals for both massless and massive particles. We demonstrate that the photon distribution retains its thermal properties in the emergent frame, while it seems geometrically rescaled in the gravitational frame. The Thomson and Compton processes maintain their microscopic structure while obtaining effective masses and interaction rates governed by the scalar field. During the tightly coupled epoch, the photon-baryon fluid experiences acoustic oscillations characterized by a modified sound horizon. For the kinetic K-essence DBI-type Lagrangian, the interaction rate scales as $n_{e}\sigma_{T}^{\rm eff}a\propto a^{-8}$, indicating a strong coupling in the early universe. Additionally, the diffusion damping scale scales as $k_{D}^{-2}\propto a^{29/2}$, indicating that small-scale anisotropies become increasingly sensitive to the evolving geometry. The results provide a coherent kinetic description of particle transport in a tilted spacetime and demonstrate that CMB propagation effects may serve as an observational probe of K-essence and emergent gravity frameworks.</description>

      <title>Unimodular quantum cosmology in the connection representation: A minimal model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a quantization of unimodular gravity in the connection representation for a homogeneous, isotropic, and spatially flat cosmological model without matter. In this model, the wave function is governed by a Schr\"odinger-type equation derived from a reduced phase space approach. Our analysis suggests that, within this minimal setting, the regularity of the operators and the self-adjointness of the Hamiltonian operator are incompatible with a negative cosmological constant. For a positive cosmological constant, the wave functions vanish at zero spatial volume. This behavior emerges as a consequence of enforcing the unimodular condition at the quantum level. Semiclassical fluctuations of the geometry are evaluated and discussed in relation to the cosmological constant problem.</description>

      <title>Spectral Analysis of Quasinormal Modes of Planck Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19833v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the quasinormal modes (QNMs) of Planck stars within the framework of scale-dependent gravity (SDG). In our setup, the running parameter $\alpha$ is fixed to a negative value by matching the effective Newtonian potential to the one-loop EFT result. As a consequence, the associated running Newton coupling does not realise the ultraviolet fixed point of asymptotically safe gravity, and the geometry should be interpreted as an SDG-inspired effective metric rather than a realisation of asymptotically safe gravity itself. We focus on the resulting renormalisation-group-improved Schwarzschild metric, which naturally yields a finite-size Planck-density core. Building on this background, we compute the QNM spectrum for scalar, electromagnetic, and gravitational perturbations using the Spectral Method (SM). This approach, known for its superior accuracy over high-order WKB schemes, enables the detection of fundamental modes, large families of overtones, and purely imaginary overdamped modes that are entirely missed in previous analysis. Our results reveal a robust Martini glass morphology of the oscillatory spectrum across perturbation sectors, nearly equally spaced overdamped modes with characteristic anomalous gaps, and the emergence, in the gravitational sector, of isolated overdamped modes separated from the main sequence by exceptionally large frequency intervals. These features, resolved here for the first time in the Planck-star context, underscore the importance of high-precision spectral techniques in probing subtle signatures of quantum-gravity-inspired black hole models.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we derive an exact vacuum solution to the Einstein field equations that depends on three constant parameters: the throat radius $r_0$, a parameter $q$, which is closely associated with the Komar mass, and a parameter $s$, which introduces axial topological defect while avoiding the emergence of conical singularities. We employ the cut-and-paste construction to generate wormhole geometries from this solution for $q \neq 0$. In addition, we perform a detailed analysis of the embedding diagrams, the wormhole throat, the occurrence and structure of trapped surfaces, the behavior of geodesics, the associated tidal forces, the Petrov algebraic classification, the Newman-Penrose spin coefficients, and the corresponding invariant conserved charges.</description>

      <title>New modified cosmology from a new generalized entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop new modified cosmological scenarios by applying the first law of thermodynamics at the Universe horizon, utilizing a new entropic functional that generalizes the standard Boltzmann-Gibbs-Shannon entropy. In particular, starting from the general theory of entropy in terms of the probability distribution over the accessible microstates, and by imposing violation of the separability requirement and thus considering a generalized microstate scaling, we result to a generalized entropy expression, which applied in systems with boundaries yields a generalized holographic-like area-law scaling with two exponents. Hence, incorporating it within the gravity-thermodynamics framework, we result to a modified cosmological scenario with additional terms, which eventually give rise to an effective dark energy sector. We extract analytical expressions for the dark energy density and equation-of-state parameters, and we show that the Universe experiences the usual thermal history, with the sequence of matter and dark-energy eras. Additionally, depending on the values of the entropic exponents, the dark energy can be quintessence-like, phantom-like or experience the phantom-divide crossing during its evolution, ultimately stabilizing at the cosmological constant value in the asymptotic far future, a behavior richer than other entropic modified cosmologies.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of the Bianchi~V cosmological model inspired by quintessential $\alpha$-attractors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20072v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate scalar-field cosmologies in the Bianchi V spacetime using a dynamical-systems framework. Motivated by representative $\alpha$-attractor potentials - the E-model and T-model - we apply averaging theorems and amplitude--phase reductions to monomial potentials $\sim \phi^{2n}$ of the scalar field, which approximate the attractor models near their minima, in the presence of matter with barotropic index $\gamma$. The reduced averaged system admits five generic isolated equilibria: Kasner vacua $\mathcal{K}_0^\pm$, the matter FLRW point $\mathcal{F}$, the scalar FLRW point $\mathcal{S}$, and the curvature Milne-type point $\mathcal{K}$, together with special families for tuned $(n,\gamma)$. We find that $\mathcal{K}_0^\pm$ are always sources, $\mathcal{F}$ is generically a saddle but can act as a sink for $\gamma&lt;\min\{\tfrac{2n}{n+1},\tfrac{2}{3}\}$, $\mathcal{S}$ is a sink if $0&lt;n&lt;\tfrac{1}{2}$ and $\tfrac{2n}{n+1}&lt;\gamma\leq 2$, while $\mathcal{K}$ becomes a sink whenever $\gamma&gt;\tfrac{2}{3}$ and $n&gt;\tfrac{1}{2}$. These results demonstrate that isotropic FLRW $\alpha$-attractor models extend naturally to anisotropic Bianchi~V cosmologies: inflationary attractors remain robust, while the Milne-type curvature solution emerges as the late-time state.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.20075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mapping gravitational-wave background (GWB) anisotropy with pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) is affected by harmonic-space mode suppression and mode coupling arising from an array's nonuniform sky response. Spherical harmonic expansions must be truncated at finite multipole l_max^rec, often set to l_max^N_pair$\equiv {\rm int}\left[\sqrt{\text{N_pair}}-1\right]$, where N_pair is the number of distinct pulsar pairs in an array. This choice is motivated by the counting argument that cross-correlations provide at most N_pair independent constraints. We obtain the multipole l_max^res corresponding to the maximum informative angular scale of a PTA. It is defined such that expansions to l_max^res (approximately) span the space of "observable skies" encoded in the N_pair eigenmaps of the Fisher information matrix, and therefore depends on the array configuration. We explicitly show that GWB power contained in multipoles l$\gtrsim$l_max^res do not significantly affect analyses that use expansions out to l_max^res, because the PTA response acts as a low-pass filter. In contrast, truncating at l_max^rec&lt; l_max^res leads to leakage of small-scale angular power from l_max^rec&lt;l$\leq$l_max^res. Even choosing l_max^rec=l_max^res, the standard frequentist estimator of the angular power spectrum C_l remains biased by the modes unobservable by the array. Although we can (partially) debias the standard estimator -- improving its agreement with an injected spectrum -- this reduction in bias comes at the expense of an increase in variance, particularly for poorly constrained modes with l$\gg$l_eff. We therefore recommend: (i) using l_max^res for PTA analyses involving spherical harmonic expansions, and (ii) using the debiased standard estimator for C_l recovery, but only out to multipoles l&lt;l_eff ($\ll$l_max^res) corresponding to sufficiently constrained modes.</description>

      <title>The Spacetime Positive Mass Theorem with Multiple Time Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20081v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We generalize the spacetime positive mass theorem to include multiple time dimensions. In particular, we show that the mass remains nonnegative in the sense that the energy $E$ is bounded from below by the trace norm of the linear momenta $J^1,...,J^m$. Equality in this energy inequality implies a foliation by flat submanifolds of a generalized initial data set. Moreover, under an additional umbilicity assumption, we find that the initial data set isometrically embeds into a generalized pp-wave.</description>

      <title>Spherically symmetric solutions to the Einstein-scalar field conformal constraint equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20099v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent works by the second author and Dilts et al. have shown that the Einstein-scalar field conformal constraint equations are highly complex and generally intractable, even in the vacuum case. In this article, to gain a clearer understanding and offer a new perspective, we study these equations under special assumptions: the manifold $(M,g)$ is harmonic and data is radial.
  In this setting, the system reduces to a single nonlinear equation and is completely resolved in the standard cases. In particular, on the sphere, our results reveal phenomena that contrast with the well-known achievements on compact manifolds without conformal Killing vector fields, including nonexistence of solutions in the near-CMC regime and instability when the mean curvature is non-constant. By contrast, on Euclidean or hyperbolic manifolds, the equations are always solvable, with all expected properties of solutions satisfied. These findings support the view that, although the conformal method appears to present some drawbacks on compact manifolds, it remains a promising tool for parametrizing solutions to the constraint equations on asymptotically flat and hyperbolic manifolds in arbitrary mean curvature regimes.
  In this article, we also investigate the sign of mass, showing that the ADM and asymptotically hyperbolic mass can take arbitrary sign when the decay rate of symmetric $(0,2)$-tensor $k$ at infinity is critical. Finally, most solution classes in our framework are explicit, providing a variety of models in general relativity and offering insights into the structure and behavior of initial data, particularly in numerical applications.</description>

      <title>Exotic spherically-symmetric Lambda-vacuum in the four-dimensional Starobinsky model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce an exact, two-parameter family of static, spherically-symmetric, constant-curvature $\Lambda$-vacuum solutions within the four-dimensional Starobinsky $f(R)=R+\alpha R^2$ model. When the bare cosmological constant is precisely fine-tuned to $\Lambda = 1/(8\alpha)$, the scalar curvature is fixed such that the derivative $f'(R)=1+2\alpha R$ identically vanishes, demonstrating that the family represents a pathological $R_0$-degenerate boundary of the viable physical states. This mathematical degeneracy decouples the modified field equations, permitting the existence of an arbitrary $1/r^2$ integration constant in the metric, which functions as a purely geometric, Reissner-Nordstr\"om hair mimicker. However, any infinitesimal deviation from this exact boundary instantaneously destroys the degeneracy, rigorously forcing the geometric hair to vanish and collapsing the spacetime back into the standard Schwarzschild-de Sitter family. We provide the exact algebraic derivation of this spacetime and highlight its physical pathologies, including the identically vanishing Wald entropy of the associated black hole horizons, the divergence of the effective gravitational coupling, the resulting backreaction catastrophe, and the onset of severe ghost instabilities. Ultimately, this exact solution functions as a rigorous no-go theorem within the Starobinsky model, pedagogically illustrating the extreme fragility and physical hostility of degenerate, purely mathematical solutions in highly non-linear $f(R)$ gravity theories.</description>

      <title>A positive period derivative in the quasi-periodic eruptions of ZTF19acnskyy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16776v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the first direct measurement of the period derivative in a quasi-periodic eruption (QPE), finding a smoothly increasing period with $\dot{P}\approx (1.7\pm 0.02)\times10^{-2}$ d d$^{-1}$ in the source ZTF19acnskyy/"Ansky". Most models for QPEs invoke repeated interactions of a stellar-mass orbiting companion around the supermassive black hole (SMBH) in an extreme mass-ratio inspiral (EMRI). In these scenarios, a positive $\dot{P}$ is surprising, but not impossible to produce. We explore several possible explanations for the observed $\dot{P}$, including stable mass-transfer driven by impulsive mass loss events in an EMRI, velocity kicks at pericenter due to tidal interactions with the SMBH, apparent period changes due either to general relativistic precession effects in an EMRI or light travel-time delays in a hierarchical SMBH binary, and mass-transfer variations in a thermal/viscous disk instability model. We find that none of the considered models provides a complete explanation for the data, motivating further work on physical explanations for positive period derivatives in QPEs.</description>

      <title>Thermal Analysis, Joule-Thomson Expansion and Hawking Sparsity of Mod(A)Max-AdS Black Hole Immersed in a Cloud of Strings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18488v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the thermodynamic behavior of a spherically symmetric Anti-de Sitter black hole in Mod(A)Max electrodynamics surrounded by a cloud of strings. Within the extended phase-space framework, we treat the cosmological constant as a pressure and interpret the black-hole mass as enthalpy, which enables a unified discussion of local stability, global phase structure, and Joule--Thomson expansion. We analyze the Hawking temperature, Gibbs free energy, and heat capacity, and show how the string-cloud parameter, the Mod(A)Max deformation, and the electric charge reshape the physical domain, the stability windows, and the small/large black-hole transition pattern. We further characterize the critical behavior and demonstrate that a van der Waals--like phase structure arises only in the physical sector, while the alternate branch does not admit a genuine critical point. For the Joule-Thomson process, we determine the inversion curve and the corresponding isenthalpic trajectories, highlighting how the model parameters control the cooling/heating regimes and can generate terminating isenthalpic behavior at sufficiently large charge. Finally, we examine the sparsity of Hawking radiation and discuss how the underlying parameters influence the temporal discreteness of the emitted flux, particularly near extremality and in the large-radius AdS regime.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Invariants from Asymptotic Composants</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.18501v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Asymptotic composants and their incidence relations are powerful invariants of 1-dimensional inflation tilings spaces, which can distinguish many MLD classes of tilings. In particular, and unlike most other invariants, they can often provide obstructions to a tiling space being MLD to its reflection. We present a simple algorithm to determine these asymptotic composants for primitive inflation tiling spaces in one dimension, and illustrate how they can be used to tell different MLD classes of tilings apart. In an Appendix, we then show that the structure of asymptotic composants, together with the orbit separation dimension (OSD), can distinguish all MLD classes of inflations tilings with pure-point spectrum for a bunch of small inflation factors, which illustrates the power of these invariants.</description>

      <title>Holographic Pressure and Extensivity of Rotating Black Holes at Finite Cutoff</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18526v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the quasi-local thermodynamics of rotating Kerr-AdS black holes enclosed by a finite timelike boundary (cavity). Extending recent work on static systems, we define the holographic pressure and volume via the trace of the Brown-York stress tensor on the cutoff surface. We demonstrate that the inclusion of angular momentum introduces a momentum flux term at the boundary, requiring a generalized first law: $dE = T_{\mathrm{loc}}dS + \Omega_{\mathrm{loc}}dJ - \mathcal{P}d\mathcal{A}$. We derive the explicit expressions for these thermodynamic conjugates and analyze the equation of state. Crucially, we examine the extensivity of the system in the large-size limit. We find that while small rotating black holes exhibit non-extensive behavior typical of self-gravitating systems, large Kerr-AdS black holes recover extensivity, behaving effectively as a thermal fluid on the boundary. This result strengthens the holographic interpretation of the cutoff surface as the domain of a dual field theory.</description>

      <title>Reanalyzing DESI DR1: 5. Cosmological Constraints with Simulation-Based Priors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18554v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze the public DESI full-shape clustering data using simulation-based priors (SBPs). Our priors are obtained by fitting normalizing flows to the distribution of EFT parameters measured from field-level simulations, themselves generated using tailored halo occupation distribution (HOD) models for each tracer. Incorporating SBPs in a power spectrum analysis significantly enhances $\Lambda$CDM cosmological parameter constraints; in combination with BAO information from DESI DR2 and a BBN prior on the baryon density, we find the matter density parameter $\Omega_m=0.2987\pm 0.0066$, the Hubble constant $H_0=68.80\pm 0.35\,\mathrm{km}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$, and the mass fluctuation amplitude $\sigma_8 = 0.766\pm 0.015$ (or the lensing parameter $S_8=0.764\pm 0.018$), which are $1\%$, $40\%$ and $50\%$ stronger than the baseline results, though with a notable downwards shift in $\sigma_8$. The SBPs also have a significant impact in extended models, with the dark energy figure-of-merit improving by $70\%$ ($20\%$) in a $w_0w_a$CDM analysis when combining with the CMB (and supernovae). In the SBP analysis, we do not find statistically significant evidence for dynamical dark energy: the equation of state parameters are consistent with a cosmological constant within $2.2\sigma$ ($1.4\sigma$) in analyses without (with) supernovae. The neutrino mass constraints are also enhanced, with the $95\%$ limits $M_\nu&lt;0.073\,\mathrm{eV}$ and $M_\nu&lt;0.090\,\mathrm{eV}$ in $\Lambda$CDM and $w_0w_a$CDM respectively. The latter is the strongest constraint obtained to date and reinforces the preference for the normal neutrino mass hierarchy, regardless of the background dynamics. While our results are sensitive to HOD modeling assumptions, they clearly demonstrate that the inclusion of small-scale information can significantly sharpen cosmological parameter constraints.</description>

      <title>Inferring the population properties of galactic binaries from LISA's stochastic foreground</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18560v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Galactic binaries are expected to be the most numerous LISA sources and to produce a stochastic gravitational-wave foreground whose spectral shape encodes information about the underlying population. Extracting this information with standard hierarchical methods is challenging due to the high dimensionality of the problem and the computational cost of global-fit analyses. We present a simulation-based inference framework to measure the population properties of galactic binaries directly from the reconstructed foreground. Adopting an astrophysically agnostic parametrization in the observable space -- defined by signal amplitude, frequency, and frequency derivative -- we generate synthetic catalogs and foreground spectra using a global-fit-inspired subtraction algorithm. We then train a neural posterior estimator to map spectra to population parameters. We validate our method on simulated data and recover population parameters with good accuracy, including the total number of binaries. As a by-product, we present a GPU-accelerated version of the subtraction algorithm, which delivers a ~100X speed-up compared to previous implementations in the literature. Our results demonstrate that LISA's stochastic foreground alone carries significant information about the Galactic binary population and provide a practical step toward joint inference from resolved and unresolved sources.</description>

Abstract: We study particle creation for scalar fields in conformally flat spacetimes using resummed heat-kernel techniques. We make use of an analogy between quantum scalar fields in conformally flat spacetimes and scalar field theories with a Yukawa coupling in Minkowski space. The correspondence holds exactly at the level of the effective action and includes nonconformal curvature couplings. This framework provides access to particle creation at strong curvature. In a radiation dominated universe, the particle production rates in arbitrary dimensions are independently confirmed through explicit calculations of the Bogoliubov coefficients. We also find new exact gravitational analogues of the Schwinger effect in quantum field theory in curved spacetime.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.18586v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use the Velocity-dependent One Scale Model for topological defect evolution to explore and classify the possible scaling solutions for string networks with time-varying tension, in cosmological and non-cosmological settings and under two different phenomenological assumptions for the behavior of these variations, which rely on different stretching and damping contributions to the string dynamics. We discuss how these assumptions impact the standard scaling solutions, as well as the evolution of the string network density. In addition to simple power-law cosmological epochs solutions, we also discuss the behavior of the network during the radiation-to-matter and matter-to-acceleration transitions. Overall, our results show that for the same amount of tension variation, a change in the stretching length scale tends to have a more significant impact on the network than a change in the damping length.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Universe Expansion History with f(R,T) Gravity: Constraints on Cosmological Parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18859v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work examines the cosmological implications of two functional forms of $f(R,T) = R + \alpha T^n$ gravity: for two different value of $n $ where $n=1$ and $n\neq 1$, and $\alpha$ and $n$ are free parameters. The modified Friedmann equations are derived, and the cosmic evolution of the Hubble parameter $H(z)$ is determined. Cosmological parameters are estimated through $\chi^2$ minimization and MCMC analysis using the emcee algorithm, with model parameters constrained by various observational datasets. Both models reproduce late-time acceleration and remain observationally indistinguishable from $\Lambda$CDM, while allowing small deviations parameterized by $\alpha$ and $n$. The cosmological behavior of the deceleration parameter $q(z)$, the jerk, the snap parameter $s(z)$, and the effective equation of state parameter $\omega$ is also analyzed. The results indicate that the Universe transitioned from deceleration to late-time accelerated expansion, consistent with the $\Lambda$CDM model. Analysis of the energy conditions reveals that the NEC and DEC are satisfied, while the SEC is violated, which explains the transition from a decelerating matter-dominated epoch to the present accelerated phase. These findings indicate that the proposed $f(R,T)$ models are compatible with current observational data and provide a viable alternative to $\Lambda$CDM in describing cosmic acceleration.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.19118v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate a quintessence field with an exponential potential motivated by the suggestion of time-varying dark energy from the DESI galaxy survey. Assuming a kination epoch in the early Universe, we analytically derive constraints on initial conditions that are consistent with Big Bang Nucleosynthesis and the current dark energy density. Compared to the severe 120-digit fine-tuning required for dark energy to be a cosmological constant, our result suggests that the degree of fine-tuning is naturally relaxed by dozens of orders of magnitude. Furthermore, we discuss the method for testing this model through future observations of the gravitational wave background.</description>

Abstract: An $SO(3,3)$ BF-type gauge theory is formulated on a six-dimensional spacetime of split signature $(3,3)$, interpreted as the pre-electroweak-symmetry-breaking phase. A MacDowell--Mansouri-type symmetry breaking to $SU(2)\times SU(2)$ is implemented, and the corresponding stabilizer and coset structures are computed. The curvature decomposes into chiral sectors, and effective tetrads are introduced using components of the higher-dimensional connection. The resulting left and right sectors are formulated as constrained BF/Plebanski-like theories with appropriate simplicity and reality conditions. The six-dimensional theory yields two overlapping four-dimensional Lorentzian sectors of opposite signature, related via gluing constraints across their intersection. In the first sector, the selfdual two-forms ($\Sigma^{(+)}$) satisfy simplicity constraints that select the non-degenerate branch and reproduce Einstein gravity. Subsequently, the $SU(2)_R\times U(1)_{Y{\rm dem}}\to U(1)_{\rm dem}$ breaking pattern is outlined which admits an ultra-soft regime consistent with current phenomenological bounds under sufficiently suppressed couplings. In the second sector, the antiself dual two-forms ($\Sigma^{(-)}$) satisfy analogous simplicity constraints, realizing weak gauge dynamics as gravity on the opposite-signature sector. Subsequently, the $SU(2)_L\otimes U(1)_Y$ electroweak symmetry is realized within the Yang--Mills branch of the BF theory which incorporates the standard Higgs mechanism $SU(2)_L\otimes U(1)_Y \to U(1)_{\mathrm{EM}}$, recovering the conventional electroweak $W^\pm$, $Z$, and photon spectrum.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Poissonian Spontaneous Localization Model of Hybrid Quantum-Classical Newtonian Gravity: Energy Increase and Experimental Bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19377v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Gravitational Poissonian Spontaneous Localization (GPSL) model is a hybrid classical-quantum framework in which Newtonian gravity emerges from stochastic collapses of a smeared mass-density operator. Consistency of the hybrid dynamics entails momentum diffusion and, hence, spontaneous heating. Without smearing, which enters both the collapse (measurement) and gravitational-feedback components of the dynamics, the heating rate would be divergent. Previous work assumed identical smearings for both components. Here, we treat the general case of distinct spatial smearings $g_{r_C} (\mathbf{x})$ and $g_{r_G} (\mathbf{x})$, characterized, respectively, by length scales $r_C$ and $r_G$. We characterize the spontaneous heating rate for arbitrary $g_{r_C} (\mathbf{x})$ and $g_{r_G} (\mathbf{x})$, and then discuss which smearing profiles minimize the spontaneous heating rate in relevant physical situations. Remarkably, there are situations in which, while the measurement noise remains the same, allowing $g_{r_G} (\mathbf{x}) \neq g_{r_C} (\mathbf{x})$ may reduce the feedback-induced spontaneous heating by more than 60 orders of magnitude already for $r_G = 10 r_C$. Finally, we use our results to estimate the spontaneous heating rate of neutron stars and to set new lower bounds on the model's parameters by comparing the theoretical predictions with astronomical data on temperature, radius, and mass of neutron stars.</description>

      <title>A Realistic Pulsar - Supermassive Black Hole Timing Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.19546v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Timing observation of pulsars orbiting around a supermassive black hole (SMBH) can measure the spacetime around the SMBH to a high precision and thus be a novel probe of the gravity theory. Future high-frequency surveys of the Galactic Centre (GC) region to be performed by the next-generation radio telescopes, such as the SKA, may discover pulsars that orbit around Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*), the SMBH dwelling in our GC. In this paper, we present a realistic pulsar-SMBH timing model based on the post-Newtonian equations of motion of the pulsar. Considering the expected timing precision in the future, we take into account several next-to-leading order light propagation time delays in the timing model. For the first time, we include the effects of proper motion of Sgr A*, which were expected to break the spin measurement degeneracy. We forecast the measurement precision of various parameters of Sgr A*, and discuss the data analysis procedure in the presence of red noise, which can be strong if the pulsar is a normal pulsar. The realistic timing model constructed in this study will serve as a useful tool in future searching and timing of pulsar-SMBH systems in the GC.</description>

      <title>Probing dark matter distributions with the pericentre precession of the stellar orbits near the Galactic Centre black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19553v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Galactic Centre black hole provides a naive environment for understanding unknown matter distribution and new gravitational physics. For this stellar orbits in the nuclear star cluster are reliable probes. We investigate different dark matter mass profiles through pericentre shift of stellar orbits near the black hole. We also study capability of existing and upcoming astrometric facilities to detect dark matter induced precession and to distinguish between several dark matter profiles. Parameters of different dark matter density profiles are estimated by using the most recent upper bound on dark mass near the black hole. These profiles are then used for calculating the gravitational potential and hence the relativistic pericentre shift of both low and high eccentricity orbits of 13 S-stars. We use the recently measured deviation parameter $f_{sp}$ for investigating competition between dark matter and gravitational physics within S2's orbit. The astrometric shift of the pericentres has been calculated and compared with existing and upcoming astrometric capabilities of large and extremely large telescopes. The orbit of S2 is found to be insensitive to dark matter induced precession. Low eccentricity and wider orbits are prominent probes for measuring dark matter induced precession which is accessible to present and upcoming astrometric facilities such as Keck, GRAVITY and TMT. The existing and upcoming facilities can distinguish between different dark matter profiles for some stars and hence they posses the capability to distinguish between possible formation histories of the central region of our Galaxy.</description>

      <title>A unified study of nuclear physics and dark matter constraints through gravitational-wave observations of binary neutron star mergers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.19627v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the properties of strongly interacting matter at extreme densities is a central problem in fundamental physics, but neutron star mergers provide a natural laboratory for probing this regime. However, the complexity of the merger process complicates the interpretation of the associated gravitational-wave and electromagnetic signals. This picture becomes even more complex in the potential scenario in which dark matter accumulates around and in neutron stars, altering their structure and the associated observables. In this work, we study synthetic gravitational-wave observations of binary neutron star mergers with next-generation detectors, investigating their potential to extract both nuclear physics and dark-matter constraints. We also examine how the potential presence of fermionic, non-interacting dark matter inside neutron stars affects the inference of nuclear empirical parameters. We find that combining observations can tighten constraints on nuclear empirical parameters. However, the inferred values remain sensitive to systematic modeling biases and intrinsic degeneracies among the parameters. Conversely, our analysis reveals that even in the presence of dark matter, it will be unlikely to find decisive evidence for dark matter when analyzing gravitational-wave signals. Consequently, systematic biases in nuclear empirical parameter inference potentially resulting from the presence of dark matter are expected to be negligible even for observations with next-generation gravitational-wave detectors.</description>

      <title>dS$^4$ Metamorphosis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.19812v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the Euclidean path integral of higher spin gravity on $S^4$. Based on a one-loop analysis, we are led to a gluing formula expressing the $S^4$ path integral in terms of an underlying $S^3$ path integral. We view the three-sphere as a boundary hypersurface splitting the four-sphere into two halves. For a higher spin spectrum containing even spins only, the resulting boundary theory living on the $S^3$ cut is the $\mathrm{Sp}(N)$ invariant sector of $N\in \mathbb{Z}^+$ anti-commuting, conformally coupled free scalars, with conformal higher spin sources mediating the gluing. This boundary $\mathrm{Sp}(N)$ theory was previously shown to compute the Hartle-Hawking wavefunction at $\mathcal{I}^+$ in the higher spin dS$_4$/CFT$_3$ correspondence. In contrast to the infinite spatial volume of $\mathcal{I}^+$, here the conformal fields populate a finite size $S^3$ hypersurface of $S^4$. For theories with both bosonic and fermionic higher spin fields, the gluing formula is instead built from an $\mathcal{N}=2$ superconformal boundary field theory coupled to $U(N)$ invariant superconformal sources. Under this assumption, the leading contribution to the four-sphere partition function is $2^N$, and we observe exact cancellations at one-loop.</description>

      <title>Primordial Black Hole Formation in Rastall Gravity: Shifted Collapse Threshold and Exponential Abundance Sensitivity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.19826v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Primordial black holes formed in the early universe are compelling candidates for dark matter. We investigate their production in Rastall gravity, a modification of general relativity that introduces a non-minimal coupling between matter and geometry through the non-conservation of the energy-momentum tensor. Analyz- ing cosmological perturbations during radiation domination, we demonstrate that the Rastall parameter fundamentally alters the collapse dynamics, modifying the growth of density fluctuations, the critical threshold for black hole formation, and the fluctuation amplitude at horizon crossing. Current cosmological constraints from Big Bang Nucleosynthesis, the cosmic microwave background, and large-scale structure restrict the Rastall parameter to small values, yet within this allowed range PBH production can be altered by orders of magnitude compared to general relativity. Our results establish primordial black holes as novel probes of modified gravity.</description>

      <title>Is Quadratic Gravity ghost free because the ghost is only virtual?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20047v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In \cite{salvio} a prescription for calculating the correlation functions in Quadratic Gravity \cite{stelle1}-\cite{stelle2} was presented. This procedure does not enter in conflict with unitarity The Gauss-Ostrogradsky method for higher order theories defines two momentum densities $P_1$ and $P_2$ and two coordinate densities $Q_1$ and $Q_2$, one pair is standard, the other ghost like. The approach in \cite{salvio} involves the continuation $P_2\to i P_2$ and $Q_2\to i Q_2$ of the ghost variables. In the present work, following \cite{yomismo}, the LSZ rules are derived, but with a formalism adapted to full quartic or higher order theories. The hypothesis for quantization are that $[Q_1, Q_2]=\text{"gauge terms"}$, $[P_1, P_2]=\text{"gauge terms"}$ and $[P_1, Q_1]=iI+\text{"gauge terms"}$. This alone leads to the conclusion that $[P_2, Q_2]=-iI+\text{"gauge terms"}$, therefore this last pair of variables is ghost like. The graviton contains a massless mode, which is the standard graviton, plus two massive modes with masses $m_2$ and $m_3$. The third mode is usually interpreted as a ghost in the literature \cite{stelle2}. Here it is shown that, even after making the continuation $P_2\to i P_2$ and $Q_2\to i Q_2$, the creation and annihilation operators for this mode commute, the third mode does not appear as a free wave. This does not invalidate the model. The effective action $\Gamma$ can be calculated following \cite{stelle1}, and can be constrained by the Slavnov-Taylor identities \cite{Slavnov}-\cite{Taylor}, and the scattering rules may be worked out consequently.</description>

      <title>The Universal Eccentricity Distribution for Dynamical Gravitational-Wave Merger Channels</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.20110v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We argue that all dynamical astrophysical black hole merger channels are expected to result in a common eccentricity distribution at gravitational wave (GW) frequencies relevant for LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA (LVK) in the high eccentricity limit. This follows from the large separation of scales between the GW regime required for creating eccentric mergers in LVK, and the underlying astrophysical formation environment. Our analytical solution shows exceptional agreement with numerical studies. This finding has important implications for both theoretical studies and ongoing searches for eccentric GW sources.</description>

      <title>A meta inspiral-merger-ringdown consistency test of general relativity with gravitational wave signals from compact binaries</title>

Abstract: The observation of gravitational waves from compact binary coalescences is a promising tool to test the validity of general relativity (GR) in a highly dynamical strong-field regime. There are now a variety of tests of GR performed on the observed compact binary signals. In this paper, we propose a new test of GR that compares the results of these individual tests. This meta inspiral-merger-ringdown consistency test (IMRCT) involves inferring the final mass and spin of the remnant black hole obtained from the analyses of two different tests of GR and checking for consistency. If there is a deviation from GR, we expect that different tests of GR will recover different values for the final mass and spin, in general. We check the performance of the meta IMRCT using a standard set of null tests used in various gravitational-wave analyses: the original IMRCT, parameterized phasing tests (TIGER and FTI) and the modified dispersion test. However, the meta IMRCT is applicable to any tests of GR that infer the initial masses and spins or the final mass and spin, including ones that are applied to binary neutron star or neutron star--black hole signals. We apply the meta IMRCT to simulated quasi-circular GR and non-GR binary black hole (BBH) signals as well as to eccentric BBH signals in GR (analyzed with quasicircular waveforms). We find that the meta IMRCT gives consistency with GR for the quasi-circular GR signals and picks up a deviation from GR in the other cases, as do other tests. In some cases, the meta IMRCT finds a significant GR deviation for a given pair of tests (and specific testing parameters) while the individual tests do not, showing that it is more sensitive than the individual tests to certain types of deviations. In addition, we also apply this test to a few selected real compact binary signals and find them consistent with GR.</description>

Abstract: In this study, we explore the potential of using TianQin missions to probe the local gravitational effects of dark matter. The TianQin project plans to launch satellites at both low and high orbits. High-precision orbit determination is expected to aid in detecting Earth's gravity or gravitational waves. By comparing the derived masses in low and high orbits, it is possible to constrain the amount of dark matter between the two spheres, hence placing a local constraint on dark matter's gravitational effect. Our results show the capability of TianQin in detecting the density of dark matter around Earth, with an ultimate sensitivity to a value of $10^{-8}\,\,{\rm kg\,\,m^{-3}}$. This detection limit surpasses the estimated bounds for the solar system and the observation results for our Galaxy by approximately 7 and 14 orders of magnitude, respectively.</description>

Abstract: We present a canonical quantization framework for static spherically symmetric spacetimes described by the Einstein-Hilbert action with a cosmological constant. In addition to recovering the classical Schwarzschild-(Anti)-de Sitter solutions via the Ehrenfest theorem, we investigate the quantum uncertainty relations that arise among the geometric operators in this setup. Our analysis uncovers an intriguing relation to black hole thermodynamics and opens a new angle towards generalized uncertainty relations. We further obtain an upper and a lower limit of the mass that is allowed in our model, for a given value of the cosmological constant. Both limits, when evaluated for the known value of the cosmological constant, have a stunning relation to observed bounds. These findings open a promising avenue for deeper insights into how quantum effects manifest in spacetime geometry and gravitational systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.02410v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cosmological production of scalar, non-minimally coupled dark matter depends on the specifics of the inflationary model under consideration. We analyze both Starobinsky inflation and a quadratic potential, solve the full background dynamics, study pair production during inflation and reheating, and find that the observed dark matter abundance can be explained solely by this mechanism, regardless of the inflationary model. Qualitative differences between the two cases only appear for dark matter masses close to the inflationary scale. In addition, we identify a large region in parameter space in which cosmological production of dark matter is mostly independent of the chosen inflationary potential, highlighting the robustness of this dark matter production mechanism and its independence of the unknown particular details of inflation. In the region of masses lower than the scale of inflation, and sufficiently away from the conformal limit, the total comoving number density of produced particles becomes a function of the coupling to the geometry alone. This allows us to provide an approximated analytic expression for fitting the resulting abundance.</description>

Abstract: We propose a method for separating and detecting the non-tensor modes of stochastic gravitational-wave backgrounds (SGWBs) using networks of space-based gravitational-wave detectors. We consider four distinct data-reconstruction schemes for the co-inclination and anti-inclination orbital configurations of the LISA-Taiji network. We find that the co-inclination configuration offers its advantages over the anti-inclination one and can achieve signal-to-noise ratios up to 17.3 for the vector modes and 10.4 for the scalar modes with the energy density spectrum as $\Omega_{GW}^p(f)=10^{-12}$. Our method can be used to measure beyond-general-relativity polarization modes of SGWBs at mHz frequency band, opening a new avenue for testing alternative gravity theories.</description>

      <title>Quantum modified inertia: an application to galaxy rotation curves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.11524v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work explores modified inertia in the context of galactic dynamics by investigating the consequences of introducing quantum-motivated bounds on acceleration. Building on earlier ideas related to maximal acceleration and quantum speed limits, an effective framework is developed in which both upper and lower acceleration bounds are incorporated within special relativity through a correspondence between the proper time of an accelerated object and the quantum speed limit.
  The resulting modified inertia model is applied to galaxy rotation curves, taking into account the baryonic contributions from stellar disks, gas, and bulges. An analytic expression for the radial acceleration relation is derived within this framework. When confronted with observations, the model provides a good description of several galactic systems, including the Milky Way and the dwarf galaxy DDO 52. It also successfully recovers the Tully-Fisher relation linking the baryonic mass and the terminal speed, with $\mathrm{log}(M) = 4 \, \mathrm{log}(v) + 2.62$.
  A characteristic minimal acceleration of order $1.8 \times 10^{-11}$ m s$^{-2}$ naturally emerges from the analysis and proves effective in reproducing a wide range of rotation curves. The resulting radial acceleration relation is consistent with Solar System constraints, including the Cassini quadrupole bound, and remains compatible with recent observational results on dwarf spheroidals and ultra-wide binaries.
  Within this effective description, the presence of a lower acceleration bound significantly reduces the amount of dark matter required to account for galactic rotation curves. Possible implications for the redshift evolution of this minimal acceleration, and for galaxy formation and evolution, are briefly discussed.</description>

      <title>Master field equations for spherically symmetric gravitational fields beyond general relativity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.15920v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: According to general relativity, black holes are incomplete, which prevents developing a complete physical description of their dynamical formation and evolution once quantum effects are taken into account. Theories beyond general relativity may provide a more complete description of black hole interiors. In this work, the most general form of the field equations for spherically symmetric gravitational fields, in which the Einstein tensor is deformed into a conserved tensor constructed from up to second-order derivatives of the metric, is described. These equations set up the stage for the study of the dynamics of spherically symmetric spacetimes beyond general relativity, providing tools for the theoretical exploration of a paradigm of black hole physics free of the incompleteness characteristic of Einstein's theory. A general proof of the Birkhoff--Jebsen theorem for vacuum solutions, and the construction of field equations describing the effective geometrodynamics of regular black holes interacting with matter, are discussed.</description>

      <title>Probing scalar field with generic extreme mass-ratio inspirals around Kerr black holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.00516v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The future space-based gravitational wave observatories are expected to provide unprecedented opportunities to explore intricate characteristics of black hole binaries, particularly for extreme mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs), in which a stellar-mass compact object slowly inspirals into a supermassive black hole. These systems are very prominent sources for testing gravity in the strong gravity fields and for probing potential deviations from general relativity, including those arising from the presence of fundamental scalar fields. In this work, we examine the impact of a scalar charge carried by the inspiraling object within the context of EMRIs. We focus on generic orbits that present both eccentricity and inclination to evaluate how these parameters affect the modifications induced by the scalar charge to the gravitational wave signal. Our results demonstrate that the inclusion of orbital inclination, in particular, enhances the detectability of scalar field effects by introducing richer waveform features that deviate from the purely general relativistic case. The interplay among scalar charge, eccentricity and inclination provides a more complete sampling of the black hole spacetime, suggesting that EMRIs with such generic orbits represent compelling systems for stringently constraining or discovering new fundamental fields through future gravitational wave observations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.21652v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Numerical relativity has brought about profound and wide-ranging influences on modern astrophysics and gravitational-wave astronomy. In this study, we present a user-friendly Python interface for the numerical relativity code AMSS-NCKU. This interface facilitates the automation of initializing and executing the AMSS-NCKU simulations, as well as the automatic visualization of the output data. The Python interface can significantly reduce the operational complexity of the AMSS-NCKU simulation workflow, lowering the technical barriers for new users. To show the utility of this Python interface, we present two representative examples of numerical relativity simulations (the binary black hole and triple black hole merger processes), obtaining stable numerical results and the expected physical behaviors for black hole systems.

Abstract: In this letter, we review the well known ambiguity in defining angular momentum (and mass dipole) fluxes in general relativity and we reinterpret recent works that resolve the ambiguity by defining invariant charges. We resolve the ambiguity by finding the conditions that fix a frame for supertranslation and for space-time translation. We also present an elementary method for measuring the angular momentum aspect and work out explicitly the supertranslation frame-fixing conditions for the metric created by point particles to first nontrivial order in the Newton constant.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.18022v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work investigates a singularity-free early Universe within the paradigm of quantum cosmology. We develop a bouncing model where the singularity is resolved via the de Broglie--Bohm interpretation of quantum mechanics, which provides a deterministic trajectory for the scale factor through a quantum bounce. The primordial power spectrum for scalar perturbations is derived, incorporating a characteristic modulation (distortion function) imprinted by the nonstandard quantum gravitational dynamics near the bounce. We confront this model with the Planck 2018 cosmic microwave background data, establishing its strong compatibility with observations. Our analysis places a stringent upper bound on the fundamental scale of the bounce $k_B$, constraining the parameter space of such quantum cosmological scenarios. {}Furthermore, the model's specific scale-dependent anticorrelation between the spectral index and amplitude of perturbations offers a potential mechanism for mitigating the $H_0$-$\sigma_8$ tension, presenting a testable signature for future cosmological surveys.</description>

      <title>Two descriptions of dark matter around a black hole: photon sphere, shadow, and lensing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.17304v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examine observational discrepancies of two widely used models describing anisotropic (dark) matter distributions around a black hole, focusing on their photon spheres, shadow radii, and lensing observables. The models considered are the vacuum and Einstein cluster dark matter model, characterized by negative and zero radial pressure, respectively. The analysis reveals that these models display contrasting photon sphere behavior. In particular, the Einstein cluster results in a more pronounced deviation in the shadow radius relative to the standard Schwarzschild black hole. Additionally, a distinctive lensing phenomenon associated with the matter halo is identified in both models.</description>

      <title>Bounds on the photon sphere radius for spherically symmetric black holes in n-dimensional Einstein gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.01451v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The photon sphere, a hypersurface of circular null geodesics, plays a fundamental role in characterizing black hole spacetimes, influencing phenomena such as black hole shadows, gravitational lensing, and quasinormal modes. In this work, we derive both upper and lower bounds on the photon sphere radius for static, spherically symmetric, asymptotically flat black holes within $n$-dimensional Einstein gravity ($n\ge 4$), assuming an anisotropic matter field satisfying the weak energy condition and a non-positive trace of the energy-momentum tensor. For the upper bound we obtain $r_\gamma\le [(n-1)M]^{\frac{1}{n-3}}$, where $M$ is the ADM mass, which reduces to $r_\gamma\le 3M$ for $n=4$ in agreement with Hod's result. For the lower bound, under the additional assumption that $|r^{n-1}p_r(r)|$ is monotonically decreasing, we prove $r_\gamma\ge (\frac{n-1}{2})^{1/(n-3)}r_H$, where $r_H$ is the radius of the outer event horizon; for $n=4$ this gives $r_\gamma\ge \frac{3}{2}r_H$, also consistent with Hod's four-dimensional theorem. These results provide dimension-dependent geometric constraints that generalize well-known four-dimensional bounds to a specific class of higher-dimensional black holes (described by a Tangherlini-type metric) and deepen our understanding of spacetime structure in higher-dimensional gravitational theories.</description>

      <title>A universal lower bound on the photon sphere radius in higher-dimensional black holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.07289v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The photon sphere, a hypersurface of circular null geodesics, plays a fundamental role in characterizing black hole spacetimes, influencing phenomena such as black hole shadows, gravitational lensing, and quasinormal modes. While universal upper bounds on the photon sphere radius have been established for both four-dimensional and higher-dimensional black holes, the question of a corresponding lower bound in higher-dimensional black holes remains less explored. In this work, we derive a universal lower bound for the photon sphere radius in static, spherically symmetric, asymptotically flat black hole spacetimes of arbitrary dimension $n\ge 4$. Under the assumptions of the weak energy condition, a non-positive trace of the energy-momentum tensor, and a monotonicity condition on the radial pressure function $|r^{n-1}p_r(r)|$, we prove that the photon sphere radius $r_\gamma$ satisfies $r_\gamma\ge (\frac{n-1}{2})^{1/(n-3)}r_H$, where $r_H$ is the radius of the outer event horizon. For $n=4$, this reduces to the known result $r_\gamma\ge \frac{3}{2}r_H$. Our result generalizes Hod's four-dimensional theorem to higher dimensions, and provides a new geometric constraint on the structure of black holes in extended theories of gravity.</description>

Abstract: We confront the ghost-free non-local $F(R)$ gravity theories with the latest Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) constraints on the spectral index of the scalar perturbations and the updated constraints of Planck/BICEP on the tensor-to-scalar ratio. After reviewing how the ghost-free non-local version of $F(R)$ gravity can be obtained, we show that the de Sitter solution can be obtained in this framework. Also, we show that the resulting theory can be cast in terms of an $F(R,\phi)$ theory of gravity. We analyze two models of non-local $F(R)$ gravity, one power-law and the $R^2$ model, and we show that both models can be compatible with the ACT and updated Planck/BICEP constraints.</description>

      <title>When inflationary perturbations refuse to classicalise: the role of non-Gaussianity in Wigner negativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22219v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inflationary perturbations are quantum in origin. Yet, when computing cosmological observables, they are often treated as classical stochastic fields. Do they nevertheless retain quantum birthmarks? A hallmark of genuinely quantum behaviour is quantum interferences, arising from phase coherence between distinct branches of the wavefunction. Such interference is diagnosed by the non-positivity of the Wigner function, and according to Hudson's theorem, the only pure states with positive Wigner functions are Gaussian states. Consequently, any departure from Gaussianity necessarily implies a non-positive Wigner function, precluding a description in terms of a classical distribution. This motivates us to compute the Wigner function of curvature perturbations, accounting for primordial non-Gaussianities, using the EFT of inflation. We find that the Wigner function develops pronounced interference fringes on super-Hubble scales, and in particular, its negativity grows as $a^2$ in ultra-slow-roll backgrounds. These results demonstrate that quantum effects can remain significant at late times, and that squeezing alone does not ensure classicality, contrary to standard lore. This suggests that the prospects for detecting genuinely quantum signatures of the universe's origins in cosmological observables may be less bleak than previously thought.</description>

      <title>$\delta N$ formalism with gradient interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.00902v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The standard $\delta N$ formalism is a cornerstone technique for calculating nonlinear curvature perturbations on super-Hubble scales. However, its validity relies heavily on the separate universe assumption, in which spatial gradients are neglected. This approximation is known to break down in scenarios that are critical for primordial black hole formation, such as transitions to an ultra-slow-roll phase, where gradient interactions induce a significant non-conservation of the comoving curvature perturbation. In this paper, we introduce a framework that systematically incorporates gradient corrections into the $\delta N$ formalism at a desired order by adding an effective source term to the background Klein--Gordon equation. This approach allows for a fully nonlinear treatment of curvature perturbations at the end of inflation considering initial conditions at the time of horizon exit. By computing the equilateral non-Gaussianity parameter $f_{\mathrm{NL}}^{\mathrm{eq}}$, we demonstrate that our method captures essential physical features missed by the standard $\delta N$ approach, offering a simple yet rigorous pathway to determine the nonlinear evolution expected from full cosmological perturbation theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.10311v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by recent accurate measurements of disk/jet coprecessions around some galactic supermassive black holes, the accelerations experienced by an uncharged, spinless object in the Kerr metric, written in harmonic coordinates, are analytically calculated up to the formal second post-Newtonian order. To such a level, some new accelerations make their appearance. They are proportional to even and odd powers of the hole's angular momentum. Their counterparts are not known where the primary is a material body. After expressing them in a coordinate-independent, vector form valid for any orientations of the hole's spin axis in space, their orbital effects are perturbatively worked out in terms of the particle's Keplerian orbital elements. The resulting expressions, averaged over one orbital revolution, are valid for generic shapes and inclinations of the orbit. The orbital plane's precession proportional to the first power of the hole's angular momentum and to the reciprocal of the fourth power of the speed of light amounts to about twenty per cent of the corresponding Lense-Thirring effect. The latter is believed to be the cause of the accurately measured disk/jet precessional phenomenology, currently measured to a few per cent accuracy. Although at a lesser extent, also the precession proportional to the second power of the hole's spin and to the reciprocal of the fourth power of the speed of light is measurable. Allowed domains in the parameter space of the jet precession around M87$^\ast$ are displayed.</description>

      <title>The most general four-derivative Unitary String Effective Action with Torsion and Stringy-Running-Vacuum-Model Inflation: Old ideas from a modern perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16076v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The string-inspired running vacuum model (StRVM) of inflation is based on a Chern-Simons (CS) gravity effective action, in which the only four-spacetime-derivative-order term is a gravitational anomalous CS Pontryagin density coupled to an axion. In this work, we revisit curvature-squared string-inspired effective actions, from the point of view of appropriate local field redefinitions, leaving the perturbative string scattering matrices invariant. We require simultaneously unitarity and torsion interpretation of the field strength of the Kalb-Ramond antisymmetric tensor, features characterising the (3+1)-dimensional StRVM Cosmology. Unlike the higher dimensional case, the above feature is possible in the context of (3+1)-dimensional spacetimes, obtained after string compactification. We demonstrate that the unitarity and torsion-interpretation requirements lead to a single-type of extra four-derivative terms in the effective gravitational action, not discussed in the previous literature of StRVM, which however is shown to be subleading by many orders of magnitude, compared to the terms of the StRVM framework. Hence, its presence has no practical implications for the relevant inflationary (and, hence, postinflationary) physics of the StRVM. This demonstrates the phenomenological completeness of the StRVM cosmological scenario, which is thus fully embeddable in the UV complete (quantum-gravity compatible) string theory framework.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Wave-Induced Freeze-In of Fermionic Dark Matter</title>

Abstract: The minimal coupling of massless fermions to gravity does not allow for their gravitational production solely based on the expansion of the Universe. We argue that this changes in presence of realistic and potentially detectable stochastic gravitational wave backgrounds. We compute the resulting energy density of Weyl fermions at 1-loop using in--in formalism. If the initially massless fermions eventually acquire mass, this mechanism can explain the dark matter abundance in the Universe. Remarkably, it may be more efficient than conventional gravitational production of superheavy fermions.</description>

      <title>Krylov complexity of thermal state in early universe</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03293v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Thermal interactions are ubiquitous in the cosmos, driving systems toward equilibrium. In this work, we investigate the evolution of thermal states across the early universe, encompassing the inflationary, radiation-dominated (RD), and matter-dominated (MD) eras, through the lens of Krylov complexity. Utilizing a purification scheme, we map the thermal state to a two-mode pure state, facilitating an open-system analysis of Krylov complexity in contrast to closed-system methodologies. Our numerical results demonstrate that Krylov complexity grows exponentially during inflation, indicating chaotic behavior, before saturating at nearly constant values in the RD and MD eras due to particle production via preheating. Furthermore, we analyze the Krylov entropy, which exhibits an evolutionary trend analogous to that of complexity. Crucially, our analysis reveals a dynamical transition in the universe's dissipative nature: with the universe acting as a strongly dissipative system during inflation and transitioning to a weakly dissipative regime in the subsequent eras. These findings provide a novel quantum information perspective on early universe dynamics.</description>

      <title>Traversable AdS Wormhole via Non-local Double Trace or Janus Deformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03531v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study (i) Janus deformations and (ii) non-local double trace deformations of a pair of CFTs, as two different ways to construct CFT duals of traversable AdS wormholes. First, we construct a simple model of traversable wormholes by gluing two Poincar\'e AdS geometries and BTZ black holes and compute holographic two point functions and (pseudo) entanglement entropy. We point out that a Janus gravity solution describes a traversable wormhole when the deformation parameter takes imaginary values. On the other hand, we show that double trace deformations between two decoupled CFTs can reproduce two point functions of traversable AdS wormholes. By considering the case where the double trace deformation is given by a non-local $T\overline{T}$ deformation, we analyze the dual gravity which implies emergence of wormholes. We present toy model of these deformed CFTs by using free scalars and obtain qualitative behaviors expected for them. We argue that the crucial difference between the two constructions is that a global time slice of wormhole is described by a pure state for Janus deformations, while it is a mixed state for the double trace deformations.</description>

      <title>Resonant amplification of multimessenger emission in rotating stellar core collapse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03825v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a series of axisymmetric core-collapse supernova simulations extending up to $\sim 2\,\mathrm{s}$, we identify a regime of pre-collapse central rotation rates ($\sim 1\,\mathrm{Hz}$) that greatly enhances the emission of gravitational waves (GWs) during extended periods of time after bounce. The enhancement is a consequence of the resonance between the frequency of the fundamental quadrupolar $^2f$-mode of oscillation of the proto-neutron star and the frequency of the epicyclic oscillations at the boundary of the inner core. We observe periods of about several hundred milliseconds each where the resonance is active. The GW emission enhancement produces a correlated resonant modulation of the associated neutrino signal at the same frequencies. With GW frequencies of $\mathcal{O}(1\,\mathrm{kHz})$ and strain amplitudes within the sensitivity curves of current and next-generation interferometers at distances of $\mathcal{O}(1\,\mathrm{Mpc})$, this resonant-amplification mechanism may represent a potential game-changer for unveiling the supernova explosion mechanism through multimessenger astronomy.</description>

      <title>A Nonperturbative Toolkit for Quantum Gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.16986v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a method for demonstrating equivalences beyond the saddlepoint approximation between quantities in quantum gravity that are defined by the Euclidean path integral, without assumptions about holographic duality. The method involves three ingredients: (1) a way of resolving the identity with an overcomplete basis of microstates that is under semiclassical control, (2) a drastic simplification of the sum over topologies in the limit where the basis is infinitely overcomplete, and (3) a way of cutting and splicing geometries to demonstrate equality between two different gravitational path integrals even if neither can be explicitly computed. We illustrate our methods by giving a general argument that the thermal partition function of quantum gravity with two boundaries factorises. One implication of our results is that universes containing a horizon can sometimes be understood as superpositions of horizonless geometries entangled with a closed universe.</description>

      <title>Effective field theory of coupled dark energy and dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17293v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We formulate an effective field theory (EFT) of coupled dark energy (DE) and dark matter (DM) interacting through energy and momentum transfers. In the DE sector, we exploit the EFT of vector-tensor theories with the presence of a preferred time direction on the cosmological background. This prescription allows one to accommodate shift-symmetric and non-shift-symmetric scalar-tensor theories by taking a particular weak coupling limit, with and without consistency conditions respectively. We deal with the DM sector as a non-relativistic perfect fluid, which can be described by a system of three scalar fields. By choosing a unitary gauge in which the perturbations in the DE and DM sectors are eaten by the metric, we incorporate the leading-order operators that characterize the energy and momentum transfers besides those present in the conventional EFT of vector-tensor and scalar-tensor theories and the non-relativistic perfect fluid. We express the second-order action of scalar perturbations in real space in terms of time- and scale-dependent dimensionless EFT parameters and derive the linear perturbation equations of motion by taking into account additional matter (baryons, radiation). In the small-scale limit, we obtain conditions for the absence of both ghosts and Laplacian instabilities and discuss how they are affected by the DE-DM interactions. We also compute the effective DM gravitational coupling $G_{\rm eff}$ by using a quasi-static approximation for perturbations deep inside the DE sound horizon and show that the existence of momentum and energy transfers allow a possibility to realize $G_{\rm eff}$ smaller than in the uncoupled case at low redshift.</description>

      <title>Null infinity as an inverted extremal horizon: Matching an infinite set of conserved quantities for gravitational perturbations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.15526v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Every spacetime that is asymptotically flat near null infinity can be conformally mapped via a spatial inversion onto the geometry around an extremal, non-rotating and non-expanding horizon. We set up a dictionary for this geometric duality, connecting the geometry and physics near null infinity to those near the dual horizon. We then study its physical implications for conserved quantities for extremal black holes, extending previously known results to the case of gravitational perturbations. In particular, we derive a tower of near-horizon gravitational charges that are exactly conserved and show their one-to-one matching with Newman-Penrose conserved quantities associated with gravitational perturbations of the extremal Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m black hole geometry. We furthermore demonstrate the physical relevance of spatial inversions for extremal Kerr-Newman black holes, even if the latter are notoriously not conformally isometric under such inversions.</description>

      <title>An Open System Approach to Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03103v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Several major open problems in cosmology, including the nature of inflation, dark matter, and dark energy, share a common structure: they involve spacetime-filling media with unknown microphysics, and can be probed so far only through their gravitational effects. This observation motivates a systematic open-system approach to cosmology, in which gravity evolves in the presence of a generic, unobservable environment. In this work, we develop a general framework for open gravitational dynamics based on general relativity and the Schwinger-Keldysh formalism, carefully addressing the nontrivial constraints imposed by diffeomorphism invariance. At the quantum level, our path integral formulation computes the gravitational density matrix in perturbation theory around a semi-classical spacetime. As illustrative applications, we study inflation and the propagation of gravitational waves in classical regimes where environmental interactions are non-negligible. In the inflationary context, our framework reproduces the known Open Effective Field Theory of Inflation in the decoupling limit and extends it to include gravitational interactions. For gravitational waves, we derive the most general conservative and dissipative corrections to propagation. Remarkably, we find that the leading-order gravitational birefringence is dissipative in nature, whereas conservative birefringence appears only at higher derivative order, opposite to the electromagnetic case. Our results pave the way to modeling dissipative effects in the late universe.</description>

      <title>Non-linear Dynamics and Primordial Black Hole Formation During Kination</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.19166v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the effects of large scalar inhomogeneities during the kination epoch, a period in which the universe's dynamics are dominated by the kinetic energy of a scalar field, by fully evolving the Einstein equations using numerical relativity. By tracking the non-linear growth of scalar perturbations with both sub-horizon and super-horizon initial wavelengths, we are able to compare their evolution to perturbative results. Our key findings show that in the deep sub-horizon limit, the perturbative behaviour remains valid, whereas in the super-horizon regime, non-linear dynamics exhibit a much richer phenomenology. Finally, we discuss the possibility of primordial black hole formation from the collapse of such perturbations and assess whether this process could serve as a viable mechanism to reheat the universe in the post-inflationary era.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.07718v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the Sagnac and Mashhoon effects in graphene, taking into account both the pseudospin and intrinsic spin of electrons, within a simplified model of a rotating nanotube or infinitesimally narrow ring. Based on considerations of the relativistic phase of the wave function and employing the effective Larmor theorem, we demonstrate that the Sagnac fringe shift retains a form analogous to that for free electrons, governed by the electron's vacuum mass. In the case of a narrow ring, an additional $\pi$-phase shift arises due to the Berry phase associated with the honeycomb graphene lattice. The Mashhoon fringe shift retains its conventional form, with its dependence on the Fermi velocity.</description>

      <title>Momentum Squeezed State Realized via Optimal Filtering in Optomechanics: Implications for Gravity-Induced Entanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14337v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze the conditional quantum state of a mechanical mirror in an optomechanical system subject to continuous measurement, feedback control, and quantum filtering. We identify a parameter regime in which the mirror exhibits momentum squeezing beyond the standard quantum limit, achieved through an appropriate choice of the homodyne detection angle. In this regime, we show that optimal filtering effectively realizes a free-particle-like conditional state. When this mechanism is applied to a configuration consisting of two optomechanical systems, the resulting momentum squeezing significantly enhances the signal of gravity-induced entanglement (GIE). This enhancement arises because the momentum squeezing not only amplifies the distinction between the common and differential modes, but also, in the high-purity regime, increases the position uncertainty in accordance with the uncertainty principle, thereby enlarging the spatial extent of the quantum superposition. Our results provide new insights into experimental strategies for probing the quantum nature of gravity using optomechanical platforms.</description>

      <title>Probing Hernquist dark matter with black hole shadows: A comprehensive study of various accretions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11245v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The shadow of a black hole is critically dependent on the surrounding accreting matter. We investigate the observational signatures of a Schwarzschild black hole embedded in a Hernquist dark matter (DM) halo under three distinct accretion scenarios: a geometrically thin disk, a static spherical flow, and an infalling spherical flow. For the thin disk model, we find that direct emission dominates the total observed intensity, while the size and brightness of the lensing and photon rings serve as sensitive probes of the Hernquist DM parameters. Under spherical accretion, the Hernquist DM halo significantly enlarges the photon sphere. This results in an observable shadow that is approximately $2\%$ to $30\%$ larger than in the vacuum case, though this increase in size is accompanied by a considerable decrease in overall image brightness. Furthermore, the Doppler de-boosting effect in the infalling scenario produces a markedly darker image than its static counterpart. Our results demonstrate that the size and brightness profile of a black hole shadow provide a powerful observational tool to probe and constrain the distribution of dark matter in galactic centers.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the adiabatic elimination of fast variables in relativistic stochastic mechanics, which is analyzed by using the equation of motion and the distribution function, with relativistic corrections explicitly derived. A new dimensionless parameter is introduced to characterize the timescale. The adiabatic elimination is compared with the path integral coarse graining, which is more general yet computationally demanding.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.14468v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We formulate a stochastic generalisation of the Schwinger effect, extending pair production to statistically fluctuating gauge-field backgrounds. Our approach captures realistic field configurations that are transient, inhomogeneous, and stochastic, as commonly encountered in cosmological and high-energy astrophysical settings. Using the effective action formalism, we compute the vacuum decay rate and number density of charged particles, obtaining closed-form analytical expressions for both scalar and fermionic cases. To isolate the essential physics, the analysis is performed in flat spacetime and at zero temperature, providing a controlled setting in which curvature and thermal effects can be neglected. As a proof of concept, we present representative phenomenological examples relevant to astrophysical plasmas and early-Universe-motivated scenarios.</description>

      <title>Beware of the running $n_s$ when producing heavy primordial black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18791v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We examine single-field inflationary models for the formation of primordial black holes (PBHs). By analyzing the latest observations from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT)~\cite{ACT:2025fju, ACT:2025tim}, we demonstrate that the observed preference for positive running ($\alpha_s$) of the scalar spectral index $n_s$ imposes significant restrictions on the parameter space for a large class of ultra-slow-roll (USR) models. This tension becomes progressively pronounced for more massive PBHs, posing substantial challenges for USR models to yield a detectable PBH abundance, especially in the mass range probed by ongoing and future gravitational-wave experiments such as LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA and the Einstein Telescope. However, this discrepancy is minimal for asteroid-mass PBHs, which are still capable of feasibly constituting the entirety of dark matter. To numerically probe the six-dimensional parameter space of the models, we adapted a Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach to efficiently scan over the viable configurations. Our results further indicate that, in non-minimally coupled polynomial inflation, a viable cosmic microwave background (CMB) spectrum is best obtained at an inflection point for which second-order slow-roll approximation is necessary for precise CMB predictions.</description>

      <title>The Gravitational Aspect of Information: The Physical Reality of Asymmetric "Distance"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22664v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that when a Brownian bridge is physically constrained to satisfy a canonical condition, its time evolution exactly coincides with an m-geodesic on the statistical manifold of Gaussian distributions. This identification provides a direct physical realization of a geometric concept in information geometry. It implies that purely random processes evolve along informationally straight trajectories, analogous to geodesics in general relativity. Our findings suggest that the asymmetry of informational ``distance" (divergence) plays a fundamental physical role, offering a concrete step toward an equivalence principle for information.</description>

      <title>Optical design and sensitivity optimization of Cryogenic sub-Hz cROss torsion bar detector with quantum NOn-demolition Speed meter (CHRONOS)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24780v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the optical design and sensitivity modeling of the 2.5 m Cryogenic sub-Hz cROss torsion-bar detector with quantum NOn-demolition Speed meter (CHRONOS), a triangular Sagnac speed-meter interferometer incorporating power- and signal-recycling techniques. Using ABCD-matrix analysis and Finesse3 simulations, we show that stable eigenmodes are obtained with optimized mirror curvatures and focal placements, achieving mode-matching efficiencies above 99.5 %. The resulting configuration reaches a quantum-noise-limited strain sensitivity of $h \simeq 3\times10^{-18},\mathrm{Hz^{-1/2}}$ at 1 Hz, with a ring-cavity finesse $\mathcal{F}\simeq3.1\times10^{4}$ and round-trip Gouy phase $\psi_{\mathrm{rt}}\approx153^{\circ}$. The power-recycling cavity detuning ($\phi_p=-85^{\circ}$) dominates the low-frequency quantum noise, while the signal-recycling cavity detuning ($\phi_s=0^{\circ}$) mainly introduces a uniform quadrature rotation. The optimal homodyne angle ($\zeta_{\mathrm{opt}}\simeq46^{\circ}$) balances shot-noise and radiation-pressure effects to give the best sensitivity near 1 Hz. Assuming end-mirror reflectivity $R_{\mathrm{ETM}}=99.9999\%$ under cryogenic operation at 10 K, CHRONOS can achieve quantum-noise-limited performance on a laboratory scale and serve as a testbed for future long-baseline, cryogenic interferometers probing sub-hertz gravitational waves.</description>

      <title>Game Theory in Cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20739v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a game-theoretic statistical framework for cosmology, which we term \textit{Cosmological Teleodynamics}. We recast the dark sector, cosmic acceleration, large-scale structure, and cosmic tensions as emergent consequences of nonlocal memory and intrinsically persistent organization in a self-gravitating Universe. By introducing a maximum-caliber weight on cosmic histories and a bias functional encoding structural memory, we derive modified Friedmann, Boltzmann, and Poisson equations that naturally generate dark energy-like acceleration, dark matter-like clustering, and scale-dependent growth suppression. We also show how this approach can naturally help alleviate the $H_0$ and $S_8$ tensions, can produce anisotropic velocity fields, and predict environment-dependent halo signatures that cannot arise from particle dark matter or scalar-field dark energy. We also derive a generalized horizon entropy and temperature, revealing a nonequilibrium statistical origin for cosmic acceleration and formulating a Law of Universal Arbitrage Equilibrium that governs the evolution of the Universe, showing that it is expanding towards a continuous form of Nash equilibrium. Cosmological Teleodynamics therefore offers a unified, emergent, and testable alternative to the conventional dark sector, rooted not in new particles but in the intrinsic statistical and systemic structure of cosmic memory, and shows that the universe itself operates like a giant potential game.</description>

      <title>Relating auxiliary field formulations of $4d$ duality-invariant and $2d$ integrable field theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21982v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Auxiliary field techniques have recently gained interest in four-dimensional non-linear electrodynamics and two-dimensional integrable sigma models. In these settings, coupling a suitable ``seed'' theory to auxiliary fields provides a powerful mechanism to generate infinite families of models while preserving key dynamical properties, such as electromagnetic duality invariance in four dimensions and classical integrability in two dimensions. Deformations induced through auxiliary fields are closely related to $T\bar{T}$-like deformations and, in two dimensions, also to their higher-spin generalisations. In this paper, we analyse and clarify the relations between different auxiliary field formulations in two and four dimensions, showing how they are governed by Legendre transformations of the interaction functions combined with appropriate field redefinitions. In four-dimensional electrodynamics, we establish a correspondence between the auxiliary field model of Russo and Townsend and the Ivanov--Zupnik formalism. In two dimensions, we develop the analogue of the Ivanov--Zupnik $\mu$-frame to deform Principal Chiral, symmetric-space, non-Abelian T-dual, and (bi-)Yang-Baxter sigma models. We discuss how integrability is preserved and use properties of the $\mu$-frame to further extend known families of integrable deformations.</description>

      <title>Euler-Korteweg vortices: A fluid-mechanical analogue to the Schr\"odinger and Klein-Gordon equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23771v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum theory and relativity exhibit several formal analogies with fluid mechanics. This paper extends upon known analogies by showing that under specific assumptions, an Euler-Korteweg vortex model can be cast into equations that are mathematically equivalent to the Schr\"odinger and Klein-Gordon equations. By assuming that the angular momentum of an irrotational vortex in an inviscid, barotropic, isothermal fluid with sound speed c is equal in magnitude to the reduced Planck constant, and incorporating Korteweg capillary stress, a complex wave equation describing the momentum and continuity equations of an Euler-Korteweg vortex is obtained. When uniform convection is introduced, the weak field approximation of this wave equation is formally equivalent to Schr\"odinger's equation. The model is shown to yield analogues to de Broglie wavelength, the Einstein-Planck relation, the Born rule and the uncertainty principle. Accounting for the retarded propagation of the wave field of a vortex in convection requires the Lorentz transformation and yields a wave equation mathematically equivalent to the Klein-Gordon equation, with Schr\"odinger's equation appearing as the low-Mach-number limit.</description>

      <title>Bound States in Lee's Complex Ghost Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05562v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum field theories (QFTs) including fourth-derivative terms such as the Lee-Wick finite QED and quadratic gravity have a better ultra-violet behavior compared to standard theories with second-derivative ones, but the existence of ghost with negative norm endangers unitarity. Such a ghost in general acquires a pair of complex conjugate masses from radiative corrections whose features are concisely described by the so-called Lee model. Working with the canonical operator formalism of QFTs, we investigate the issue of bound states in the Lee model. We find that the bound states cannot be created from ghosts by contributions of a complex delta function, which is a complex generalization of the well-known Dirac delta function. Since the cause of unitarity violation in the Lee-Wick model is the existence of the complex delta function instead of the Dirac delta function, it is of interest to notice that the violation of the unitarity is also connected to the non-existence of bound states. Finally, the problem of amelioration of the unitarity in quadratic gravity is briefly discussed.</description>

      <title>New Rotating Black Holes in String Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06905v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present new black hole solutions to the low-energy effective action of string theory. We introduce three- and four-dimensional solutions that are rotating, asymptotically flat, and exhibit a linear dilaton vacuum. We also introduce higher-dimensional generalisations of these black holes that possess multi angular momentum-like charges. These solutions cannot be overspun, i.e., do not have an extremality condition, akin to some higher-dimensional Myers-Perry black holes. Studying their thermodynamics reveals that the temperature associated to these solutions does not depend on the black hole mass, similar to the Witten black hole. We also find that their asymptotic symmetry group is more stringent than the BMS group. We consider the charged generalisations for these black holes, which introduces closed timelike curves within the inner horizon. We show that these black holes can be derived from the large-$d$ limit of the Myers-Perry black hole. As such we advocate that large-$d$ can provide a useful vantage point to interpret the here introduced black holes, as well as more generally a way to generate new effective field theories and corresponding non-trivial solutions.</description>
