      <title>$\mathbb{Z}_2$-actions on positively curved manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kennard, Khalili Samani, and Searle showed that for a $\mathbb{Z}_2$-torus acting on a closed, positively curved Riemannian $n$-manifold, $M^{n}$, with a non-empty fixed point set for $n$ large enough and $r$ approximately half the dimension of $M$, then $M^n$ is homotopy equivalent to $S^n$, $\mathbb{R}\mathrm{P}^{n}$, $\mathbb{C}\mathrm{P}^{\frac{n}{2}}$, or a lens space. In this paper, we lower $r$ to approximately $2n/5$ and show that we still obtain the same result.</description>

      <title>The Z_2-valued spectral flow of a symmetric family of Toeplitz operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15534v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider families $A(t)$ of self-adjoint operators with symmetry that causes the spectral flow of the family to vanish. We study the secondary $\mathbb{Z}_2$-valued spectral flow of such families. We prove an analog of the Atiyah-Singer-Robbin-Salamon theorem, showing that this secondary spectral flow of $A(t)$ is equal to the secondary $\mathbb{Z}_2$-valued index of the suspension operator $\frac{d}{dt}+A(t)$.
  Applying this result, we show that the graded secondary spectral flow of a symmetric family of Toeplitz operators on a complete Riemannian manifold equals the secondary index of a certain Callias-type operator. In the case of a pseudo-convex domain, this leads to an odd version of the secondary Boutet de Monvel's index theorem for Toeplitz operators. When this domain is simply a unit disc in the complex plane, we recover the bulk-edge correspondence for the Graf-Porta module for 2D topological insulators of type AII.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.15707v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note we prove three rigidity results for Einstein manifolds with bounded covering geometry.
  (1) An almost flat manifold $(M,g)$ must be flat if it is Einstein, i.e. $\operatorname{Ric}_g=\lambda g$ for some real number $\lambda$.
  (2) A compact Einstein manifolds with a non-vanishing and almost maximal volume entropy is hyperbolic.
  (3) A compact Einstein manifold admitting a uniform local rewinding almost maximal volume is isometric to a space form.</description>

      <title>Jacobi algebroids and Jacobi sigma models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14568v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The definition of an action functional for the Jacobi sigma models, known for Jacobi brackets of functions, is generalized to \emph{Jacobi bundles}, i.e., Lie brackets on sections of (possibly nontrivial) line bundles, with the particular case of contact manifolds. Different approaches are proposed, but all of them share a common feature: the presence of a \emph{homogeneity structure} appearing as a principal action of the Lie group $\mathbb{R}^{\times}=\mathrm{GL}(1;\mathbb{R})$. Consequently, solutions of the equations of motions are morphisms of certain \emph{Jacobi algebroids}, i.e., principal $\mathbb{R}^{\times}$-bundles equipped additionally with a compatible Lie algebroid structure. Despite the different approaches we propose, there is a one-to-one correspondence between the space of solutions of the different models. The definition can be immediately extended to \emph{almost Poisson} and \emph{almost Jacobi brackets}, i.e., to brackets that do not satisfy the Jacobi identity. Our sigma models are geometric and fully covariant.</description>

      <title>Multisections of $(m+3)$-dimensional $m$-spun $3$-manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15469v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A multisection, or $n$-section, of an $(n + 1)$-dimensional manifold is a decomposition of this manifold into $n$ $1$-handlebodies of dimension $n+1$, such that all these handlebodies intersect along a closed surface, and every subcollection of $k$ handlebodies intersects along an $(n - k + 2)$-dimensional $1$-handlebody. This concept, due to Ben Aribi, Courte, Golla and Moussard, generalizes to any dimension Heegaard splittings and Gay and Kirby's trisections. If any $(n+1)$-manifold admits a multisection for $n \leq 4$, there are yet no general existence results for $n \geq 5$. In this article, we provide a class of examples of multisected manifolds in all dimensions. We extend the concept of $4$-dimensional spun manifolds to any dimension, and construct multisections and their associated multisection diagrams for the class of $m$-spun $3$-manifolds, of dimension $m+3$, for any $m$. This allows us to give infinitely many examples of non-diffeomorphic multisected manifolds, in all dimensions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.15592v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the construction of non-Weinstein Liouville geometric objects based on Anosov 3-flows, intoduced by Mitsumatsu, in the generalized framework of Liouville Interpolation Systems and non-singular partially hyperbolic flows. We study the subtle phenomena inherited from the regularity and persistence theory of hyperbolic dynamics in the resulting Liouville structures, and prove dynamical and geometric rigidity results in this context. Among other things, we show that Mitsumatsu's examples characterize 4-dimensional non-Weinstein Liouville geometry with 3-dimensional $C^1$-persistent transverse skeleton. We also draw applications to the regularity theory of the weak dominated bundles for non-singular partially hyperbolic 3-flows.</description>

      <title>Ricci Curvature Formula: Applications to Bonnet-Myers Sharp Irregular Graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.15667v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish a simple formula for computing the Lin-Lu-Yau Ricci curvature on graphs. For any edge $xy$ in a simple locally finite graph $G$, the curvature $\kappa(x,y)$ can be expressed as a cost function of an optimal bijection between two blow-up sets of the neighbors of $x$ and $y$. Utilizing this approach, we derive several results including a structural theorem for the Bonnet-Myers sharp irregular graphs of diameter $3$ and a theorem on $C_3$-free Bonnet-Myers sharp graphs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2004.10185v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present new explicit tight and overtwisted contact structures on the (round) 3-sphere and the (flat) 3-torus for which the ambient metric is weakly compatible. Our proofs are based on the construction of nonvanishing curl eigenfields using suitable families of Jacobi or trigonometric polynomials. As a consequence, we show that the contact sphere theorem of Etnyre, Komendarczyk and Massot (2012) does not hold for weakly compatible metric as it was conjectured. We also establish a geometric rigidity for tight contact structures by showing that any contact form on the 3-sphere admitting a compatible metric that is the round one is isometric, up to a constant factor, to the standard (tight) contact form.</description>

      <title>A Geometric flow towards hamiltonian stationary submanifolds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13997v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a geometric flow for Lagrangian submanifolds in a K\"ahler manifold that stays in its initial Hamiltonian isotopy class and is a gradient flow for volume. The stationary solutions are the Hamiltonian stationary Lagrangian submanifolds. The flow is not strictly parabolic but it corresponds to a fourth order strictly parabolic scalar equation in the cotangent bundle of the submanifold via Weinstein's Lagrangian neighborhood theorem. For any compact initial Lagrangian immersion, we establish short-time existence, uniqueness, and higher order estimates when the second fundamental forms are uniformly bounded up to time $T$.</description>

      <title>Existence and non-uniqueness of cone spherical metrics with prescribed singularities on a compact Riemann surface with positive genus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12673v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cone spherical metrics, defined on compact Riemann surfaces, are conformal metrics with constant curvature one and finitely many cone singularities. Such a metric is termed \textit{reducible} if a developing map of the metric has monodromy in ${\rm U(1)}$, and \textit{irreducible} otherwise. Utilizing the polystable extensions of two line bundles on a compact Riemann surface $X$ with genus $g_X&gt;0$, we establish the following three primary results concerning these metrics with cone angles in $2\pi{\mathbb Z}_{&gt;1}$:
  \begin{itemize} \item[(1)] Given an effective divisor $D$ with an odd degree surpassing $2g_X$ on $X$, we find the existence of an effective divisor $D'$ in the complete linear system $|D|$ that can be represented by at least two distinct irreducible cone spherical metrics on $X$.
  \item[(2)] For a generic effective divisor $D$ with an even degree and $\deg D\geq 6g_X-2$ on $X$, we can identify an arcwise connected Borel subset in $|D|$ that demonstrates a Hausdorff dimension of no less than $\big(\deg D-4g_{X}+2\big)$. Within this subset, each divisor $D'$ can be distinctly represented by a family of reducible metrics, defined by a single real parameter.
  \item[(3)] For an effective divisor $D$ with $\deg D=2$ on an elliptic curve, we can identify a Borel subset in $|D|$ that is arcwise connected, showcasing a Hausdorff dimension of one. Within this subset, each divisor $D'$ can be distinctly represented by a family of reducible metrics, defined by a single real parameter.</description>

Abstract: We study some properties of a $3$-dimensional manifold with a diagonal Riemannian metric as an almost $\eta$-Ricci soliton from the following points of view: under certain assumptions, we determine the potential vector field if $\eta$ is given; we get constraints on the metric when the potential vector field has a particular expression; we compute the defining functions of the soliton when both the potential vector field and the $1$-form are prescribed. Moreover, we find conditions for the manifold to be flat. Based on the theoretical results, we provide examples.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04956v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies the relationship between an analytic compactification of the moduli space of flat $\mathrm{SL}_2(\mathbb{C})$ connections on a closed, oriented 3-manifold $M$ defined by Taubes, and the Morgan-Shalen compactification of the $\mathrm{SL}_2(\mathbb{C})$ character variety of the fundamental group of $M$. We exhibit an explicit correspondence between $\mathbb{Z}/2$ harmonic 1-forms, measured foliations, and equivariant harmonic maps to $\mathbb{R}$-trees, as initially proposed by Taubes. As an application, we prove that $\mathbb{Z}/2$ harmonic 1-forms exist on all Haken manifolds with respect to all Riemannian metrics. We also show that there exist manifolds that support singular $\mathbb{Z}/2$ harmonic 1-forms but have compact $\mathrm{SL}_2(\mathbb{C})$ character varieties, which resolves a folklore conjecture.</description>

      <title>Linearization in incompatible elasticity for general ambient spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.08041v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by recent interest in elastic problems in which the target space is non-Euclidean, we study a limit where local rest distances within an elastic body are incompatible, yet close to, distances within the ambient space. Specifically, we obtain, via $\Gamma$-convergence, a limit elastic model for a sequence of elastic bodies $(M,g_\varepsilon)$ in an ambient space $(S,s)$, for Riemannian metrics $g_\varepsilon$ and $s$ such that $g_\varepsilon \to s$. Furthermore, we relate the minimum of the limit problem to a linearized curvature discrepancy between $g_\varepsilon$ and $s$, using recent results of Kupferman and Leder. This relation confirms a linearized version of a long-standing conjecture in elasticity regarding the relation between the elastic energy and the curvature of the underlying space. The main technical challenge, compared to other linearization results in elasticity, is obtaining the correct notion of displacement for manifold-valued configurations, using Sobolev truncations and parallel transport. We show that the associated compactness result is obtained if $(S,s)$ satisfies a quantitative rigidity property, analogous to the Friesecke--James--M\"uller rigidity estimate in Euclidean space, and show that this property holds when $(S,s)$ is a round sphere.</description>

      <title>Poisson bundles over unordered configurations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15287v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we construct a Poisson algebra bundle whose distributional sections are suitable to represent multilocal observables in classical field theory. To do this, we work with vector bundles over the unordered configuration space of a manifold $M$ and consider the structure of a $2$-monoidal category given by the usual (Hadamard) tensor product of bundles and a new (Cauchy) tensor product which provides a symmetrized version of the usual external tensor product of vector bundles on $M$. We use the symmetric algebras with respect to both products to obtain a Poisson 2-algebra bundle mimicking the construction of Peierls bracket from the causal propagator in field theory. The explicit description of observables from this Poisson algebra bundle will be carried out in a forthcoming paper.</description>
