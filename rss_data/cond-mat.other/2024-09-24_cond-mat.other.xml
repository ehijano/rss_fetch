      <title>Self-Attention Assistant Classification of non-Hermitian Topological Phases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classification of non-Hermitian topological phases becomes challenging due to interplay of the band topology and non-Hermiticity. The significant increase in data dimensions and the number of categories has rendered traditional supervised learning and unsupervised manifold learning failed. Here, we propose the self-attention assistant machine learning for clustering topological phases. By incorporating the self-attention mechanism, the model can effectively capture long-range dependencies and important patterns, resulting in a more compact and information-rich latent space. It can directly classify the eigenvectors and obtains the information of all topological phases. Our results provide a general method for studying non-Hermitian topological phase via machine learning.</description>

      <title>Fractonic Coset Construction for Spontaneously Broken Translations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15193v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the homogeneous breaking of spatial translation symmetry concomitantly with the spontaneous breaking of other internal and spacetime symmetries, including dilations. We use the symmetry breaking pattern as the only input to derive, via the coset construction, general effective field theories for the symmetry-originated modes associated with Goldstone's theorem, namely the Nambu-Goldstone candidates. Through explicit computations, we show that integrating out the explicit massive Nambu-Goldstone candidates or imposing symmetric constraints, namely the inverse Higgs constraints, to express massive modes in terms of the massless ones leads to physically distinct effective field theories. This sensitivity to the chosen method can be traced back to the homogeneous breaking of translations, the homogeneous aspect of the breaking induces a mixing between internal and spacetime symmetries at the level of the Lie algebra. This, in turn, leads to subtle discussions about the inverse Higgs constraints, in particular that they lead to a loss of generality in our specific examples. The derived general effective field theories also give rise to a broad class of theories exhibiting emergent enhanced shift symmetries, which constrain the mobility of the modes. The latter are referred to as fractonic modes.</description>

      <title>Making s-wave superconductors topological with magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15266v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that an s-wave superconductor may become topological in the presence of a magnetic field which leads to formation of an Abrikosov vortex lattice. Below the upper critical field, a new superconducting state with a nontrivial topological number emerges, which we call Abrikosov-Chern superconducting state. Deeper in the superconducting domain, the topological number changes in steps, eventually reaching zero. Our theory uncovers the nature of evolution from an integer quantum Hall state having a cyclotron gap above the upper critical field to the topologically-trivial s-wave superconductor carrying finite-energy Caroli-de Gennes-Matricon levels at low field. Topological transitions manifest as changes in the number of edge modes, detectable through tunneling microscopy and thermal transport measurements.</description>

      <title>Neural network-based recognition of multiple nanobubbles in graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15658v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a machine learning method for swiftly identifying nanobubbles in graphene, crucial for understanding electronic transport in graphene-based devices. Nanobubbles cause local strain, impacting graphene's transport properties. Traditional techniques like optical imaging are slow and limited for characterizing multiple nanobubbles. Our approach uses neural networks to analyze graphene's density of states, enabling rapid detection and characterization of nanobubbles from electronic transport data. This method swiftly enumerates nanobubbles and surpasses conventional imaging methods in efficiency and speed. It enhances quality assessment and optimization of graphene nanodevices, marking a significant advance in condensed matter physics and materials science. Our technique offers an efficient solution for probing the interplay between nanoscale features and electronic properties in two-dimensional materials.</description>

      <title>Sub-millisecond electric field sensing with an individual rare-earth doped ferroelectric nanocrystal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02000v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the dynamics of electrical signals within neuronal assemblies is crucial to unraveling complex brain function. Despite recent advances in employing optically active nanostructures in transmembrane potential sensing, there remains room for improvement in terms of response time and sensitivity. Here, we report the development of such a nanosensor capable of detecting electric fields with a submillisecond response time at the single particle level. We achieve this by using ferroelectric nanocrystals doped with rare earth ions producing upconversion (UC). When such a nanocrystal experiences a variation of surrounding electric potential, its surface charge density changes, inducing electric polarization modifications that vary, via converse piezoelectric effect, the crystal field around the ions. The latter variation is finally converted into UC spectral changes, enabling optical detection of electric potential. To develop such a sensor, we synthesized erbium and ytterbium-doped barium titanate crystals of size $\approx160$~nm. We observed distinct changes in the UC spectrum when individual nanocrystals were subjected to an external field via a conductive AFM tip, with a response time of 100~$\mu$s. Furthermore, our sensor exhibits a remarkable sensitivity of 4.8~kV/cm/$\sqrt{\rm Hz}$, enabling time-resolved detection of fast changing electric field of amplitude comparable to that generated during a neuron action potential.</description>
