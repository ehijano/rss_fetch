      <title>The benefits and costs of agglomeration: insights from economics and complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13178v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There are many benefits and costs that come from people and firms clustering together in space. Agglomeration economies, in particular, are the manifestation of centripetal forces that make larger cities disproportionately more wealthy than smaller cities, pulling together individuals and firms in close physical proximity. Measuring agglomeration economies, however, is not easy, and the identification of its causes is still debated. Such association of productivity with size can arise from interactions that are facilitated by cities ("positive externalities"), but also from more productive individuals moving in and sorting into large cities ("self-sorting"). Under certain circumstances, even pure randomness can generate increasing returns to scale. In this chapter, we discuss some of the empirical observations, models, measurement challenges, and open question associated with the phenomenon of agglomeration economies. Furthermore, we discuss the implications of urban complexity theory, and in particular urban scaling, for the literature in agglomeration economies.</description>

      <title>Human behavior-driven epidemic surveillance in urban landscapes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14009v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a surveillance strategy specifically designed for urban areas to enhance preparedness and response to disease outbreaks by leveraging the unique characteristics of human behavior within urban contexts. By integrating data on individual residences and travel patterns, we construct a Mixing matrix that facilitates the identification of critical pathways that ease pathogen transmission across urban landscapes enabling targeted testing strategies. Our approach not only enhances public health systems' ability to provide early epidemiological alerts but also underscores the variability in strategy effectiveness based on urban layout. We prove the feasibility of our mobility-informed policies by mapping essential mobility flows to major transit stations, showing that few resources focused on specific stations yields a more effective surveillance than non-targeted approaches. This study emphasizes the critical role of integrating human behavioral patterns into epidemic management strategies to improve the preparedness and resilience of major cities against future outbreaks.</description>

      <title>The effect of frames on engagement with quantum technology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum technology is predicted to have a significant impact on society once it matures. This study (n = 637 adults representative of the Dutch population) examined the effect of different frames on engagement - specifically, information seeking, internal efficacy, general interest and perceived knowledge - with quantum technology. The different frames were: enigmatic, explaining quantum physics, benefit, risk and balanced. Results indicated that framing quantum as enigmatic does not affect engagement, while explaining quantum physics positively influences general interest. Furthermore, emphasising a benefit of quantum technology increases participants' internal efficacy, whereas highlighting both a benefit and a risk of quantum technology decreases perceived knowledge. Based on these findings, we offer practical advice for science communicators in the field and suggest further research.</description>

      <title>Properties of the `friend of a friend' model for network generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14205v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The way in which a social network is generated, in terms of how individuals attach to each other, determines the properties of the resulting network. Here we study an intuitively appealing `friend of a friend' model, where a network is formed by each newly added individual attaching first to a randomly chosen target and then to $n_q\geq 1$ randomly chosen friends of the target, each with probability $0&lt;q\leq1$. We revisit the master equation of the expected degree distribution for this model, providing an exact solution for the case when $n_q$ allows for attachment to all of the chosen target's friends (a case previously studied by \cite{lambiotte2016}), and demonstrating why such a solution is hard to obtain when $n_q$ is fixed (a case previously studied by \cite{Levens2022}.) In the case where attachment to all friends is allowed, we also show that when $q&lt;q^*\approx0.5671$, the expected degree distribution of the model is stationary as the network size tends to infinity. We go on to look at the clustering behaviour and the triangle count, focusing on the cases where $n_q$ is fixed.</description>

      <title>Uncovering large inconsistencies between machine learning derived gridded settlement datasets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13127v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-resolution human settlement maps provide detailed delineations of where people live and are vital for scientific and practical purposes, such as rapid disaster response, allocation of humanitarian resources, and international development. The increased availability of high-resolution satellite imagery, combined with powerful techniques from machine learning and artificial intelligence, has spurred the creation of a wealth of settlement datasets. However, the precise agreement and alignment between these datasets is not known. Here we quantify the overlap of high-resolution settlement map for 42 African countries developed by Google (Open Buildings), Meta (High Resolution Population Maps) and GRID3 (Geo-Referenced Infrastructure and Demographic Data for Development). Across all studied countries we find large disagreement between datasets on how much area is considered settled. We demonstrate that there are considerable geographic and socio-economic factors at play and build a machine learning model to predict for which areas datasets disagree. It it vital to understand the shortcomings of AI derived high-resolution settlement layers as international organizations, governments, and NGOs are already experimenting with incorporating these into programmatic work. As such, we anticipate our work to be a starting point for more critical and detailed analyses of AI derived datasets for humanitarian, planning, policy, and scientific purposes.</description>

      <title>A numerical analysis of the impact of gas pressure and dielectric material on the generation of body force in an air gas plasma actuator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13384v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Plasma technology has undeniably revolutionized industrial processes in recent decades. Atmospheric pressure plasma (APP) has emerged as a prominent and widely applicable tool in various scientific disciplines. Notably, plasma-assisted flow control has become a subject of intense interest, particularly applying surface dielectric barrier discharge (SDBD) plasma actuators for aerodynamic flow control. In this study, a two-dimensional model of the SDBD plasma actuator is developed using the COMSOL Multiphysics program, incorporating air gas discharge reactions with N2/O2/Ar gases in specific ratios (0.78, 0.21, 0.01). The investigation focuses on the impact of dielectric materials (mica, silica glass, quartz, and polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE)) on plasma characteristics and body force within the plasma actuator under constant input parameters. Moreover, the study explores how variable pressure (760, 660, and 560 torr) in different applications influences plasma properties, ultimately affecting the magnitude of the body force in the plasma actuator. These findings contribute to optimizing plasma technology for flow control applications and enhance industrial efficiency and performance.</description>

      <title>Swap distance minimization beyond entropy minimization in word order variation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14192v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Here we consider the problem of all the possible orders of a linguistic structure formed by $n$ elements, for instance, subject, direct object and verb ($n=3$) or subject, direct object, indirect object and verb ($n=4$). We investigate if the frequency of the $n!$ possible orders is constrained by two principles. First, entropy minimization, a principle that has been suggested to shape natural communication systems at distinct levels of organization. Second, swap distance minimization, namely a preference for word orders that require fewer swaps of adjacent elements to be produced from a source order. Here we present average swap distance, a novel score for research on swap distance minimization, and investigate the theoretical distribution of that score for any $n$: its minimum and maximum values and its expected value in die rolling experiments or when the word order frequencies are shuffled. We investigate whether entropy and average swap distance are significantly small in distinct linguistic structures with $n=3$ or $n=4$ in agreement with the corresponding minimization principles. We find strong evidence of entropy minimization and swap distance minimization with respect to a die rolling experiment. The evidence of these two forces with respect to a Polya urn process is strong for $n=4$ but weaker for $n=3$. We still find evidence of swap distance minimization when word order frequencies are shuffled, indicating that swap distance minimization effects are beyond pressure to minimize word order entropy.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we will review some of the issues that have been raised by opinion dynamics theory to date. In particular, we conducted a hypothesis-based simulation using a socio-physical approach regarding the filter bubble phenomenon that tends to occur under special conditions such as (1) Distance, (2) Time, and (3) Existence of strong opinion clusters in the barriers to consensus building (4) Place where opinions are not influenced In particular, this paper discusses the hypothesis and simulations of filter bubbles, in which opinions diverge or converge without reaching consensus under conditions in which non-consensus is likely to be emphasized. This article serves as an Appendix in "Case Study On Opinion Dynamics In Dyadic Risk On Possibilities Of Trust-Distrust Model."</description>

      <title>Discussion of the Effect of Inter-group Sub-groups Using a Consensus Model Incorporating External Effective or Immobile Magnetic Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.01519v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Individuals belong to certain social groups in search of a sense of belonging, pride, stability, and significance. Perceiving the group to which one belongs as an "in-group" and other groups as "out-groups" often leads to harmful and discriminatory attitudes. In-group consciousness reinforces a sense of unity within the group and promotes commitment to group goals and problem solving. Identification with the in-group also shapes the social cognitive framework (norms, values, and beliefs) that determine group behavior. In fact, identification with an in-group often leads to prejudice, ethnocentrism, stereotyping, and discrimination, even in the absence of physical conflict or hostility. Social scientists have conducted thousands of empirical studies to elucidate the mechanisms behind these prejudices and discriminations and the social conflicts they generate. These studies are essential to understanding the processes by which group membership and self-categorization create prejudice and discrimination, which in turn lead to social conflict. However, there remain many unanswered questions about howin-groups and out-groups canmove beyond conflict to build harmony and avoid social conflict. According to existing research, it is difficult to establish harmonious relationships between in-groups and out-groups. This study proposes an approach using opinion dynamics theory and social simulation to examine these issues. We examine the possibility of simulating the movement of opinions between and within groups and applying the considerations to cases of social conflict. The model analyzes the severity of conflict within a society with two groups on the basis of intragroup and intergroup trust.</description>

Abstract: This study analyzes the role of meritocracy, media influence, and scheduled theory from multiple perspectives as mechanisms that maintain inequality in social classes. Social inequality exists in complex forms in the educational, media, and political spheres. The study focuses on how inequality in society is structured and reproduced and how the theory of scheduled harmony justifies this.</description>

      <title>Urban topology and dynamics can assess green areas importance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12902v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Green areas are a crucial element in evolution of a city, contributing to improve citizens' life, to reduce effects of climate change, and to make possible the survival of other species in urban areas. Unfortunately, the above effects are difficult to assess quantitatively for regulators, stakeholders and experts, making troublesome the planning of city development. Here we present a method to estimate the impact of these areas in the city life based on the network topology of the city itself and on a simple model of dynamics on this structure. Movements between various areas of the city are simulated by means of an agent-based biased-diffusion process where citizens try to reach the nearest Public Green Area (PGA) from their position and the model is fed with real data about the density of populations in the cases of study. Firstly, we define a centrality measure of PGA's based on average farness measured on the city network; this approach outperforms information based on the simple topology. We then improve this quantity by taking into account the occupation of PGA's, thereby providing a quantitative measure of PGA usage for regulators.</description>

      <title>A Non-Expert's Introduction to Data Ethics for Mathematicians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.07794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2201.07794v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: I give a short introduction to data ethics. I begin with some background information and societal context for data ethics. I then discuss data ethics in mathematical-science education and indicate some available course material. I briefly highlight a few efforts -- at my home institution and elsewhere -- on data ethics, society, and social good. I then discuss open data in research, research replicability and some other ethical issues in research, and the tension between privacy and open data and code, and a few controversial studies and reactions to studies. I then discuss ethical principles, institutional review boards, and a few other considerations in the scientific use of human data. Finally, I briefly survey a variety of research and lay articles that are relevant to data ethics and data privacy. I conclude with a brief summary.
  My focal audience is mathematicians, but I hope that this chapter will also be useful to others. I am not an expert about data ethics, and this chapter provides only a starting point on this wide-ranging topic. I encourage you to examine the resources that I discuss and to reflect carefully on data ethics, its role in mathematics education, and the societal implications of data and data analysis. As data and technology continue to evolve, I hope that such careful reflection will continue throughout your life.</description>

      <title>A Review of Graph Neural Networks in Epidemic Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19852v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been a growing interest in studying epidemiological models. Traditional mechanistic models mathematically describe the transmission mechanisms of infectious diseases. However, they often suffer from limitations of oversimplified or fixed assumptions, which could cause sub-optimal predictive power and inefficiency in capturing complex relation information. Consequently, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a progressively popular tool in epidemic research. In this paper, we endeavor to furnish a comprehensive review of GNNs in epidemic tasks and highlight potential future directions. To accomplish this objective, we introduce hierarchical taxonomies for both epidemic tasks and methodologies, offering a trajectory of development within this domain. For epidemic tasks, we establish a taxonomy akin to those typically employed within the epidemic domain. For methodology, we categorize existing work into Neural Models and Hybrid Models. Following this, we perform an exhaustive and systematic examination of the methodologies, encompassing both the tasks and their technical details. Furthermore, we discuss the limitations of existing methods from diverse perspectives and systematically propose future research directions. This survey aims to bridge literature gaps and promote the progression of this promising field, with a list of relevant papers at https://github.com/Emory-Melody/awesome-epidemic-modelingpapers. We hope that it will facilitate synergies between the communities of GNNs and epidemiology, and contribute to their collective progress.</description>
