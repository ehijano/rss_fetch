      <title>An objective criterion for evaluating new physical theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Currently, the value of a new physical theory is determined by whether it has been published in a prestigious journal. Yet, to publish an article in a prestigious journal, one must undergo a rigorous process of independent subjective peer review, with the success of the theory depending on the subjective opinion of reviewers who have proven themselves in developing old theories of physics. As a result, a closed system (gatekeeping) has been created that does not allow the penetration of new theories, especially those that call into question the established paradigm. A subjective approach is not uniquely possible. Here, we propose an objective criterion for evaluating new physical theories and illustrate this criterion through an example.</description>

      <title>Growing unlabeled networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17200v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Models of growing networks are a central topic in network science. In these models, vertices are usually labeled by their arrival time, distinguishing even those node pairs whose structural roles are identical. In contrast, unlabeled networks encode only structure, so unlabeled growth rules must be defined in terms of structurally distinguishable outcomes; network symmetries therefore play a key role in unlabeled growth dynamics. Here, we introduce and study models of growing unlabeled trees, defined in analogy to widely-studied labeled growth models such as uniform and preferential attachment. We develop a theoretical formalism to analyze these trees via tracking their leaf-based statistics. We find that while many characteristics of labeled network growth are retained, numerous critical differences arise, caused primarily by symmetries among leaves in common neighborhoods. In particular, degree heterogeneity is enhanced, with the strength of this enhancement depending on details of growth dynamics: mild enhancement for uniform attachment, and extreme enhancement for preferential attachment. These results and the developed analytical formalism may be of interest beyond the setting of growing unlabeled trees.</description>

      <title>Disrespect Others, Respect the Climate? Applying Social Dynamics with Inequality to Forest Climate Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17252v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the role of human behavior in shaping environmental outcomes is crucial for addressing global challenges such as climate change. Environmental systems are influenced not only by natural factors like temperature, but also by human decisions regarding mitigation efforts, which are often based on forecasts or predictions about future environmental conditions. Over time, different outcomes can emerge, including scenarios where the environment deteriorates despite efforts to mitigate, or where successful mitigation leads to environmental resilience. Additionally, fluctuations in the level of human participation in mitigation can occur, reflecting shifts in collective behavior. In this study, we consider a variety of human mitigation decisions, in addition to the feedback loop that is created by changes in human behavior because of environmental changes. While these outcomes are based on simplified models, they offer important insights into the dynamics of human decision-making and the factors that influence effective action in the context of environmental sustainability. This study aims to examine key social dynamics influencing society's response to a worsening climate. While others conclude that homophily prompts greater warming unconditionally, this model finds that homophily can prevent catastrophic effects given a poor initial environmental state. Assuming that poor countries have the resources to do so, a consensus in that class group to defect from the strategy of the rich group (who are generally incentivized to continue ``business as usual'') can frequently prevent the vegetation proportion from converging to 0.</description>

      <title>Assessment of Socioeconomic Determinants of Voting Patterns: A Spatio-Temporal and Multinomial Logits Analysis of the 2023 Nigerian Presidential Election</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17507v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In Nigeria, electoral behavior is often interpreted through ethno-religious views and regional allegiances, without empirically assessing the influence of socioeconomic indicators such as health, income, education, and other deprivations on voter behavior. This study investigates the voting pattern in the 2023 Nigerian presidential election and previous cycles using spatio-temporal and multivariate analysis. It examines whether support for some candidates was more substantial in states with higher Human Development Index (HDI) and whether this alignment impacts governance quality and macroeconomic performance post-election. Socioeconomic data were obtained from the Global Data Lab and the Nigerian Bureau of Statistics (NBS) for the year preceding each election, while presidential vote results were sourced from the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC). The results show that the Labour Party (LP) dominated states with high socioeconomic indices, accounting for about 30-53% of the variance in voting patterns of LP and People's Democratic Party (PDP), while the All Progressive Congress (APC) variance is less explained by these factors. Multinomial logits based on HDI is used to predict party win probabilities; the model predicted about 60% wins accurately. Comparative analysis of four presidential cycles revealed that in 2011, the winner had an HDI-vote correlation of 0.44, with improved macroeconomic indices post-election. In contrast, 2015, 2019, and 2023 saw negative correlations of -0.38, -0.43, and -0.34, respectively, alongside macroeconomic decline. The findings suggest that socioeconomic development shapes political preferences, promotes issue-based politics, and supports quality leadership; therefore, strengthening education, healthcare, and poverty reduction should be prioritized to enhance citizens' well-being and build an informed electorate.</description>

      <title>Social influence on complex networks as a perturbation to individual behavior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17948v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cooperation is fundamental to the functioning of biological and social systems in both human and animal populations, with the structure of interactions playing a crucial role. Previous studies have used networks to describe interactions and explore the evolution of cooperation, but with limited transposability to social settings due to biologically relevant assumptions. Exogenous processes -- that affect the individual and are not derived from social interactions -- even if unbiased, have a role in supporting cooperation over defection, and this role has been largely overlooked in the context of network-based interactions. Here, we show that selection can favor either cooperation or defection depending on the frequency of exogenous, even if neutral, processes in any population structure. Our framework allows for deriving analytically the conditions for favoring a specific behavior in any network structure strongly affected by non-social environments (frequent exogenous forcing, FEF), which contrasts with previous computationally prohibitive methods. Our results demonstrate that the requirements for favoring cooperation under FEF do not match those in the rare-mutation limit, establishing that underlying neutral processes can be considered a mechanism for cooperation. We reveal that, under FEF, populations are less cooperative, and network heterogeneity can provide an advantage only if targeting specific network properties, clarifying seemingly contradictory experimental results and evolutionary predictions. While focused on cooperation, our assumptions generalize to any decision-making process involving a choice between alternative options. Our framework is particularly applicable to non-homogeneous human populations, offering a new perspective on cooperation science in the context of cultural evolution, where neutral and biased processes within structured interactions are abundant.</description>

      <title>Scientific mobility patterns of Indian researchers: Impact on career growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18069v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scientific mobility shapes individual research careers and national innovation by enabling knowledge exchange, fostering collaborations, and providing access to leading research environments. Studying international mobility patterns of researchers from developing countries offers insights into strengthening domestic scientific ecosystems and addressing talent migration. We analyze the international mobility of India-affiliated researchers using longitudinal affiliation trajectories from the OpenAlex database, covering 157,471 researchers categorized as immobile, returnees, or settled abroad after moving to the US, EU, or other high-income countries. Our analysis shows that 28% experience at least one international move, yet over 73% never return, highlighting persistent brain drain. Internationally mobile researchers predominantly originate from premier Indian institutions. Matched pair analyses demonstrate that mobility yields lasting benefits: citation impact increases, publication rates align with immobile peers, and international collaboration rises-foreign co-author share grows from 52% to 83-87% at transition abroad and remains elevated among returnees (32-40 percentage points across disciplines). Returnees maintain global networks, bridging Indian science with global research. These patterns are consistent across major research disciplines, emphasizing that scientific mobility drives excellence and engagement while posing challenges for developing nations seeking to reintegrate talent.</description>

      <title>Towards the State Space Interpretation (SSI): A Formalized Framework for Game Studies and Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17610v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish structural analogies between core concepts in quantum mechanics and games. By constructing the Quantum Coin Toss on a quantum circuit, we preliminarily investigate the similarity between quantum system behavior and game behavior, thereby formulating the state-operation paradigm. Using this paradigm, we introduce the conceptual prototype of the State Space Interpretation (SSI). Based on mathematical and physical theories, particularly linear algebra, quantum mechanics, and statistical mechanics, we define formal constructs including state space, evolution path, and derived concepts. With the SSI, a game is conceptualized as a state space, while a gameplay process corresponds to an evolution path within this space. We propose that the SSI constitutes a novel interpretation framework for game design and game studies. This framework aims to enhance understanding of games and function as a link between game studies and related fields.</description>

      <title>Comparing Data Assimilation and Likelihood-Based Inference on Latent State Estimation in Agent-Based Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17625v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present the first systematic comparison of Data Assimilation (DA) and Likelihood-Based Inference (LBI) in the context of Agent-Based Models (ABMs). These models generate observable time series driven by evolving, partially-latent microstates. Latent states need to be estimated to align simulations with real-world data -- a task traditionally addressed by DA, especially in continuous and equation-based models such as those used in weather forecasting. However, the nature of ABMs poses challenges for standard DA methods. Solving such issues requires adaptation of previous DA techniques, or ad-hoc alternatives such as LBI. DA approximates the likelihood in a model-agnostic way, making it broadly applicable but potentially less precise. In contrast, LBI provides more accurate state estimation by directly leveraging the model's likelihood, but at the cost of requiring a hand-crafted, model-specific likelihood function, which may be complex or infeasible to derive. We compare the two methods on the Bounded-Confidence Model, a well-known opinion dynamics ABM, where agents are affected only by others holding sufficiently similar opinions. We find that LBI better recovers latent agent-level opinions, even under model mis-specification, leading to improved individual-level forecasts. At the aggregate level, however, both methods perform comparably, and DA remains competitive across levels of aggregation under certain parameter settings. Our findings suggest that DA is well-suited for aggregate predictions, while LBI is preferable for agent-level inference.</description>

      <title>Limited Improvement of Connectivity in Scale-Free Networks by Increasing the Power-Law Exponent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17652v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It has been well-known that many real networks are scale-free (SF) but extremely vulnerable against attacks. We investigate the robustness of connectivity and the lengths of the shortest loops in randomized SF networks with realistic exponents $2.0 &lt; \gamma \leq 4.0$. We show that smaller variance of degree distributions leads to stronger robustness and longer average length of the shortest loops, which means the existing of large holes. These results will provide important insights toward enhancing the robustness by changing degree distributions.</description>

      <title>Discrete-Time Two-Strain Epidemic Dynamics on Complex Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08294v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate a discrete-time two-strain symbiotic epidemic model on complex networks with both random and long-range interactions. Our analysis examines how the co-infection recovery rate ($\mu$), the long-range decay exponent ($\alpha$), and the scale-free connectivity exponent ($\gamma$) shape epidemic persistence under cooperative dynamics. Comparison with a two-strain competition model shows how these parameters control strain dominance, coexistence, or extinction. The results demonstrate that contagion dynamics are strongly affected by environmental randomness and long-range couplings. In facultative symbiosis, the co-infection recovery rate undergoes a clear phase transition, separating persistence from extinction. In the competitive setting, regimes with $\alpha &lt; 2$ and $\gamma &lt; 3$ markedly lower the epidemic threshold, allowing persistence even at small contagion rates ($\sigma$). Statistical analysis further reveals that $\gamma$ and $\alpha$ exert pronounced, nonlinear, and time-dependent effects on strain survival.</description>

      <title>Exploring the dynamics of external and self-citations and their role in shaping scientific impact</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09811v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the mechanisms driving the distribution of scientific citations is a key challenge in assessing the scientific impact of authors. We investigate the influence of the preferential attachment rule (PAR) in this process by analysing individual citation events from the DBLP dataset and two Scopus-based datasets, enabling us to estimate the probability of citations being assigned preferentially. Our findings reveal that, for the aggregated dataset, PAR dominates the citation distribution process, with approximately 70% of citations adhering to this mechanism. However, analysis at the individual level shows significant variability, with some authors experiencing a greater prevalence of preferential citations, particularly in the context of external citations. In contrast, self-citations exhibit notably different behaviour, with only 20% following PAR. We also demonstrate that the prominence of PAR increases with an author's citability (average citations per paper), suggesting that more citable authors are preferentially cited, while less-cited authors experience more random citation patterns. Furthermore, we show that self-citations may influence bibliometric indices, such as the h-index. Our results confirm the distinct dynamics of self-citations compared to external citations, raising questions about the mechanisms driving self-citation patterns. These findings provide new insights into citation behaviours and highlight the limitations of existing approaches.</description>

      <title>Fluent but Foreign: Even Regional LLMs Lack Cultural Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21548v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are used worldwide, yet exhibit Western cultural tendencies. Many countries are now building ``regional'' LLMs, but it remains unclear whether they reflect local values and practices or merely speak local languages. Using India as a case study, we evaluate six Indic and six global LLMs on two dimensions -- values and practices -- grounded in nationally representative surveys and community-sourced QA datasets. Across tasks, Indic models do not align better with Indian norms than global models; in fact, a U.S. respondent is a closer proxy for Indian values than any Indic model. Prompting and regional fine-tuning fail to recover alignment and can even degrade existing knowledge. We attribute this to scarce culturally grounded data, especially for pretraining. We position cultural evaluation as a first-class requirement alongside multilingual benchmarks and offer a reusable, community-grounded methodology. We call for native, community-authored corpora and thick x wide evaluations to build truly sovereign LLMs.</description>

      <title>Does the draw matter in an incomplete round-robin tournament? The case of the UEFA Champions League</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15320v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A fundamental reform has been introduced in the 2024/25 season of club competitions organised by the Union of European Football Associations (UEFA): the well-established group stage has been replaced by an incomplete round-robin format. In this format, the 36 teams are ranked in a single league table, but play against only a subset of the competitors. While this innovative change has highlighted that the incomplete round-robin tournament is a reasonable alternative to the standard design of allocating the teams into round-robin groups, the characteristics of the new format remain unexplored. Our paper contributes to this topic by using simulations to compare the uncertainty generated by the draw in the old format with that in the new format of the UEFA Champions League. We develop a method to break down the impact of the 2024/25 reform into various components for each team. The new format is found to decrease the overall effect of the draw. However, this reduction can mainly be attributed to the inaccurate seeding system used by UEFA. If the teams are seeded based on their actual strengths, the impact of the draw is about the same in a tournament with an incomplete round-robin league or a group stage.</description>
