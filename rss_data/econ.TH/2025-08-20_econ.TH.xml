      <title>Pricing insurance policies with offsetting relationship</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13409v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the benefits of incorporating diversification effects into the pricing process of insurance policies from two different business lines. The paper shows that, for the same risk reduction, insurers pricing policies jointly can have a competitive advantage over those pricing them separately. However, the choice of competitiveness constrains the underwriting flexibility of joint pricers. The paper goes a step further by modeling explicitly the relationship between premiums and the number of customers in each line. Using the total collected premiums as a criterion to compare the competing strategies, the paper provides conditions for the optimal pricing decision based on policyholders' sensitivity to price discounts. The results are illustrated for a portfolio of annuities and assurances. Further, using non-life data from the Brazilian insurance market, an empirical exploration shows that most pairs satisfy the condition for being priced jointly, even when pairwise correlations are high.</description>

      <title>The equilibrium properties of obvious strategy profiles in games with many players</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22144v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies the equilibrium properties of the ``obvious strategy profile'' in large finite-player games. Each player in such a strategy profile simply adopts a randomized strategy as she would have used in a symmetric equilibrium of an idealized large game. We show that, under a continuity assumption, (i) obvious strategy profiles constitute a convergent sequence of approximate symmetric equilibria as the number of players tends to infinity, and (ii) realizations of such strategy profiles also form a convergent sequence of (pure strategy) approximate equilibria with probability approaching one. Our findings offer a solution that is easily implemented without coordination issues and is asymptotically optimal for players in large finite games. Additionally, we present a convergence result for approximate symmetric equilibria.</description>
