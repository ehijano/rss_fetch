      <title>A Novel Density Profile for Isothermal Cores of Dark Matter Halos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11945v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel density profile for halos in self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) models, which accurately captures the flat- and isothermal-core configurations. We show analytically how our density profile satisfies these conditions, with comparisons to other contemporary functional choices. We demonstrate the versatility of our profile by putting it into the context of idealized N-body simulations and show that it provides excellent representations for both density and velocity dispersion structures of the simulation data. When an estimated fitting criterion is used to approximate the general cases, such as in cosmological simulations, the resulting regressions maintain their goodness of fit in both extremes, in the initial thermalization phase and the late core-collapse regime. Our density profile provides a framework for more detailed analyses of halos in different SIDM models while serving as the basis for reducing simulation needs and constructing initial conditions for deep core-collapse simulations.</description>

      <title>Testing for Intrinsic Type Ia Supernova Luminosity Evolution at z&gt;2 with JWST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11953v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is opening new frontiers of transient discovery and follow-up at high-redshift. Here we present the discovery of a spectroscopically confirmed Type Ia supernova (SN Ia; SN 2023aeax) at z=2.15 with JWST, with cadenced NIRCam observations that enable multi-band light curve fitting. SN 2023aeax lands at the edge of traditional low-z cosmology color cuts because of its blue color (peak rest-frame B-V~-0.3), but we still apply a fiducial standardization approach with the BayeSN model and find that the SN 2023aeax luminosity distance measurement is in agreement (~0.1sigma) with LambdaCDM. SN 2023aeax is only the second spectroscopically confirmed SN Ia in the dark matter-dominated Universe at z&gt;2 (the other is SN 2023adsy), giving it rare leverage to constrain any potential evolution in SN Ia standardized luminosities. Similar to SN 2023adsy (B-V~0.8), SN 2023aeax has a fairly extreme (but opposite) color, which may be due to the small sample size or a secondary factor, such as host galaxy properties. Nevertheless, the SN 2023aeax spectrum is well-represented by normal low-z SN Ia spectra and we find no definitive evolution in SN Ia standardization with redshift. Still, the first two spectroscopically confirmed z&gt;2 SNe Ia have peculiar colors and combine for a ~1sigma distance slope relative to LambdaCDM, the implications of which require a larger sample and dedicated host galaxy observations to investigate.</description>

      <title>A Novel Bispectrum Estimator of the Kinematic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich Effect using Projected Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11974v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the advent of current and future high-resolution CMB experiments, the kinematic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (kSZ) effect has become a unique observational probe of the distribution of baryons and velocities in the Universe. In this work, we propose a novel binned bispectrum of the form temperature-temperature-density to extract the late-time kSZ effect from cleaned CMB maps. Unlike 'kSZ tomography' methods, this estimator can use any tracer of the large-scale structure density field projected along the line-of-sight and does not require individual redshifts. With our method, we forecast signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) of $\sim$100-200 for the upcoming Simons Observatory (SO) and CMB-S4 correlated with a galaxy sample from WISE that is restricted to the linear regime. We also extend galaxy modes into the non-linear regime and explore this harmonic space to show that the SNR peaks for squeezed triangles that have a short (linear) density mode and long temperature modes in harmonic space. The existing kSZ$^{2}$-density projected-fields estimator compresses the rich information contained in this bispectrum across various scales and triangle shapes. Moreover, we find that the lensing correction to our estimator's signal is relatively small. We study the dependence of this kSZ signal on $\Lambda$CDM parameters for SO and CMB-S4 and forecast initial constraints on the sum of neutrino masses while restricting to the linear galaxy bias regime. Our work illustrates the potential of the projected-fields kSZ bispectrum as a novel probe of baryonic abundance and beyond-$\Lambda$CDM cosmology with upcoming precision measurements.</description>

      <title>Darkness Visible: N-Body Simulations of Dark Matter Spikes in Hernquist Haloes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12007v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dark matter is theorised to form massive haloes, which could be further condensed into so-called spikes when a black hole grows at the centre of such a halo. The existence of these spikes is instrumental for several dark matter detection schemes such as indirect detection and imprints on gravitational wave inspirals, but all previous work on their formation has been (semi-)analytical. We present fully numerically simulated cold dark matter spikes using the SWIFT code. Based on these results, we propose a simple empirical density profile - dependent on only a single mass-ratio parameter between the black hole and total mass - for dark matter spikes grown in Hernquist profiles. We find that the radius of the spike scales differently compared to theoretical predictions, and show a depletion of the outer halo that is significant for high mass-ratio systems. We critically assess approximations of the spike as used in the field, show that our profile significantly deviates, and contextualise the potential influence for future dark matter detections by simulating binary black hole inspirals embedded in our profile.</description>

      <title>DESI 2024 II: Sample Definitions, Characteristics, and Two-point Clustering Statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12020v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the samples of galaxies and quasars used for DESI 2024 cosmological analyses, drawn from the DESI Data Release 1 (DR1). We describe the construction of large-scale structure (LSS) catalogs from these samples, which include matched sets of synthetic reference `randoms' and weights that account for variations in the observed density of the samples due to experimental design and varying instrument performance. We detail how we correct for variations in observational completeness, the input `target' densities due to imaging systematics, and the ability to confidently measure redshifts from DESI spectra. We then summarize how remaining uncertainties in the corrections can be translated to systematic uncertainties for particular analyses. We describe the weights added to maximize the signal-to-noise of DESI DR1 2-point clustering measurements. We detail measurement pipelines applied to the LSS catalogs that obtain 2-point clustering measurements in configuration and Fourier space. The resulting 2-point measurements depend on window functions and normalization constraints particular to each sample, and we present the corrections required to match models to the data. We compare the configuration- and Fourier-space 2-point clustering of the data samples to that recovered from simulations of DESI DR1 and find they are, generally, in statistical agreement to within 2\% in the inferred real-space over-density field. The LSS catalogs, 2-point measurements, and their covariance matrices will be released publicly with DESI DR1.</description>

      <title>DESI 2024 V: Full-Shape Galaxy Clustering from Galaxies and Quasars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12021v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the measurements and cosmological implications of the galaxy two-point clustering using over 4.7 million unique galaxy and quasar redshifts in the range $0.1&lt;z&lt;2.1$ divided into six redshift bins over a $\sim 7,500$ square degree footprint, from the first year of observations with the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI Data Release 1). By fitting the full power spectrum, we extend previous DESI DR1 baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements to include redshift-space distortions and signals from the matter-radiation equality scale. For the first time, this Full-Shape analysis is blinded at the catalogue-level to avoid confirmation bias and the systematic errors are accounted for at the two-point clustering level, which automatically propagates them into any cosmological parameter. When analysing the data in terms of compressed model-agnostic variables, we obtain a combined precision of 4.7\% on the amplitude of the redshift space distortion signal reaching similar precision with just one year of DESI data than with 20 years of observation from previous generation surveys. We analyse the data to directly constrain the cosmological parameters within the $\Lambda$CDM model using perturbation theory and combine this information with the reconstructed DESI DR1 galaxy BAO. Using a Big Bang Nucleosynthesis Gaussian prior on the baryon density parameter, and a Gaussian prior on the spectral index, we constrain the matter density is $\Omega_m=0.296\pm 0.010 $ and the Hubble constant $H_0=(68.63 \pm 0.79)[{\rm km\, s^{-1}Mpc^{-1}}]$. Additionally, we measure the amplitude of clustering $\sigma_8=0.841 \pm 0.034$. The DESI DR1 results are in agreement with the $\Lambda$CDM model based on general relativity with parameters consistent with those from Planck. The cosmological interpretation of these results in combination with external datasets are presented in a companion paper.</description>

      <title>DESI 2024 VII: Cosmological Constraints from the Full-Shape Modeling of Clustering Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12022v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present cosmological results from the measurement of clustering of galaxy, quasar and Lyman-$\alpha$ forest tracers from the first year of observations with the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI Data Release 1). We adopt the full-shape (FS) modeling of the power spectrum, including the effects of redshift-space distortions, in an analysis which has been validated in a series of supporting papers. In the flat $\Lambda$CDM cosmological model, DESI (FS+BAO), combined with a baryon density prior from Big Bang Nucleosynthesis and a weak prior on the scalar spectral index, determines matter density to $\Omega_\mathrm{m}=0.2962\pm 0.0095$, and the amplitude of mass fluctuations to $\sigma_8=0.842\pm 0.034$. The addition of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) data tightens these constraints to $\Omega_\mathrm{m}=0.3056\pm 0.0049$ and $\sigma_8=0.8121\pm 0.0053$, while further addition of the the joint clustering and lensing analysis from the Dark Energy Survey Year-3 (DESY3) data leads to a 0.4% determination of the Hubble constant, $H_0 = (68.40\pm 0.27)\,{\rm km\,s^{-1}\,Mpc^{-1}}$. In models with a time-varying dark energy equation of state, combinations of DESI (FS+BAO) with CMB and type Ia supernovae continue to show the preference, previously found in the DESI DR1 BAO analysis, for $w_0&gt;-1$ and $w_a&lt;0$ with similar levels of significance. DESI data, in combination with the CMB, impose the upper limits on the sum of the neutrino masses of $\sum m_\nu &lt; 0.071\,{\rm eV}$ at 95% confidence. DESI data alone measure the modified-gravity parameter that controls the clustering of massive particles, $\mu_0=0.11^{+0.45}_{-0.54}$, while the combination of DESI with the CMB and the clustering and lensing analysis from DESY3 constrains both modified-gravity parameters, giving $\mu_0 = 0.04\pm 0.22$ and $\Sigma_0 = 0.044\pm 0.047$, in agreement with general relativity.

      <title>Exploring HOD-dependent systematics for the DESI 2024 Full-Shape galaxy clustering analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyse the robustness of the DESI 2024 cosmological inference from fits to the full shape of the galaxy power spectrum to uncertainties in the Halo Occupation Distribution (HOD) model of the galaxy-halo connection and the choice of priors on nuisance parameters. We assess variations in the recovered cosmological parameters across a range of mocks populated with different HOD models and find that shifts are often greater than 20% of the expected statistical uncertainties from the DESI data. We encapsulate the effect of such shifts in terms of a systematic covariance term, $\mathsf{C}_{\rm HOD}$, and an additional diagonal contribution quantifying the impact of our choice of nuisance parameter priors on the ability of the effective field theory (EFT) model to correctly recover the cosmological parameters of the simulations. These two covariance contributions are designed to be added to the usual covariance term, $\mathsf{C}_{\rm stat}$, describing the statistical uncertainty in the power spectrum measurement, in order to fairly represent these sources of systematic uncertainty. This approach is more general and robust to choices of model free parameters or additional external datasets used in cosmological fits than the alternative approach of adding systematic uncertainties at the level of the recovered marginalised parameter posteriors. We compare the approaches within the context of a fixed $\Lambda$CDM model and demonstrate that our method gives conservative estimates of the systematic uncertainty that nevertheless have little impact on the final posteriors obtained from DESI data.</description>

      <title>Mitigating Imaging Systematics for DESI 2024 Emission Line Galaxies and Beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12024v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Emission Line Galaxies (ELGs) are one of the main tracers that the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) uses to probe the universe. However, they are afflicted by strong spurious correlations between target density and observing conditions known as imaging systematics. We present the imaging systematics mitigation applied to the DESI Data Release 1 (DR1) large-scale structure catalogs used in the DESI 2024 cosmological analyses. We also explore extensions of the fiducial treatment. This includes a combined approach, through forward image simulations in conjunction with neural network-based regression, to obtain an angular selection function that mitigates the imaging systematics observed in the DESI DR1 ELGs target density. We further derive a line-of-sight selection function from the forward model that removes the strong redshift dependence between imaging systematics and low redshift ELGs. Combining both angular and redshift-dependent systematics, we construct a 3D selection function and assess the impact of all selection functions on clustering statistics. We quantify differences between these extended treatments and the fiducial treatment in terms of the measured 2-point statistics. We find that the results are generally consistent with the fiducial treatment and conclude that the differences are far less than the imaging systematics uncertainty included in DESI 2024 full-shape measurements. We extend our investigation to the ELGs at $0.6&lt;z&lt;0.8$, i.e., beyond the redshift range ($0.8&lt;z&lt;1.6$) adopted for the DESI clustering catalog, and demonstrate that determining the full 3D selection function is necessary in this redshift range. Our tests showed that all changes are consistent with statistical noise for BAO analyses indicating they are robust to even severe imaging systematics. Specific tests for the full-shape analysis will be presented in a companion paper.</description>

      <title>Characterization of DESI fiber assignment incompleteness effect on 2-point clustering and mitigation methods for DR1 analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12025v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an in-depth analysis of the fiber assignment incompleteness in the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Data Release 1 (DR1). This incompleteness is caused by the restricted mobility of the robotic fiber positioner in the DESI focal plane, which limits the number of galaxies that can be observed at the same time, especially at small angular separations. As a result, the observed clustering amplitude is suppressed in a scale-dependent manner, which, if not addressed, can severely impact the inference of cosmological parameters. We discuss the methods adopted for simulating fiber assignment on mocks and data. In particular, we introduce the fast fiber assignment (FFA) emulator, which was employed to obtain the power spectrum covariance adopted for the DR1 full-shape analysis. We present the mitigation techniques, organised in two classes: measurement stage and model stage. We then use high fidelity mocks as a reference to quantify both the accuracy of the FFA emulator and the effectiveness of the different measurement-stage mitigation techniques. This complements the studies conducted in a parallel paper for the model-stage techniques, namely the $\theta$-cut approach. We find that pairwise inverse probability (PIP) weights with angular upweighting recover the "true" clustering in all the cases considered, in both Fourier and configuration space. Notably, we present the first ever power spectrum measurement with PIP weights from real data.</description>

      <title>Modified Gravity Constraints from the Full Shape Modeling of Clustering Measurements from DESI 2024</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12026v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present cosmological constraints on deviations from general relativity (GR) from the first-year of clustering observations from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) in combination with other datasets. We first consider the $\mu(a,k)$-$\Sigma(a,k)$ modified gravity (MG) parametrization (as well as $\eta(a,k)$) in flat $\Lambda$CDM and $w_0 w_a$CDM backgrounds. Using a functional form for time-only evolution gives $\mu_0= 0.11^{+0.44}_{-0.54}$ from DESI(FS+BAO)+BBN and a wide prior on $n_{s}$. Using DESI(FS+BAO)+CMB+DESY3+DESY5-SN, we obtain $\mu_0 = 0.05\pm 0.22$ and $\Sigma_0 = 0.009\pm 0.045$ in the $\Lambda$CDM background. In $w_0 w_a$CDM, we obtain $\mu_0 =-0.24^{+0.32}_{-0.28}$ and $\Sigma_0 = 0.006\pm 0.043$, consistent with GR, and we still find a preference of the data for dynamical dark energy with $w_0&gt;-1$ and $w_a&lt;0$. We then use binned forms in the two backgrounds starting with two bins in redshift and then combining them with two bins in scale for a total of 4 and 8 MG parameters, respectively. All MG parameters are found consistent with GR. We also find that the tension reported for $\Sigma_0$ with GR when using Planck PR3 goes away when we use the recent LoLLiPoP+HiLLiPoP likelihoods. As noted previously, this seems to indicate that the tension is related to the CMB lensing anomaly in PR3 which is also alleviated when using these likelihoods. We then constrain the class of Horndeski theory in the effective field theory of dark energy. We consider both EFT-basis and $\alpha$-basis. Assuming a power law parametrization for the function $\Omega$, which controls non-minimal coupling, we obtain $\Omega_0 = 0.0120^{+0.0021}_{-0.013}$ and $s_0 = 0.99^{+0.54}_{-0.20}$ from DESI(FS+BAO)+DESY5SN+CMB in a $\Lambda$CDM background. Similar results are obtained when using the $\alpha$-basis, where we constrain $c_M&lt;1.24$, and are all consistent with GR. [Abridged.]</description>

      <title>Analytical and EZmock covariance validation for the DESI 2024 results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12027v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The estimation of uncertainties in cosmological parameters is an important challenge in Large-Scale-Structure (LSS) analyses. For standard analyses such as Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) and Full Shape, two approaches are usually considered. First: analytical estimates of the covariance matrix use Gaussian approximations and (nonlinear) clustering measurements to estimate the matrix, which allows a relatively fast and computationally cheap way to generate matrices that adapt to an arbitrary clustering measurement. On the other hand, sample covariances are an empirical estimate of the matrix based on en ensemble of clustering measurements from fast and approximate simulations. While more computationally expensive due to the large amount of simulations and volume required, these allow us to take into account systematics that are impossible to model analytically. In this work we compare these two approaches in order to enable DESI's key analyses. We find that the configuration space analytical estimate performs satisfactorily in BAO analyses and its flexibility in terms of input clustering makes it the fiducial choice for DESI's 2024 BAO analysis. On the contrary, the analytical computation of the covariance matrix in Fourier space does not reproduce the expected measurements in terms of Full Shape analyses, which motivates the use of a corrected mock covariance for DESI's Full Shape analysis.</description>

      <title>Miscentering of Optical Galaxy Clusters Based on Sunyaev-Zeldovich Counterparts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12120v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The "miscentering effect," i.e., the offset between a galaxy cluster's optically-defined center and the center of its gravitational potential, is a significant systematic effect on brightest cluster galaxy (BCG) studies and cluster lensing analyses. We perform a cross-match between the optical cluster catalog from the Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) Survey S19A Data Release and the Sunyaev-Zeldovich cluster catalog from Data Release 5 of the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT). We obtain a sample of 186 clusters in common in the redshift range $0.1 \leq z \leq 1.4$ over an area of 469 deg$^2$. By modeling the distribution of centering offsets in this fiducial sample, we find a miscentered fraction (corresponding to clusters offset by more than 330 kpc) of ~25%, a value consistent with previous miscentering studies. We examine the image of each miscentered cluster in our sample and identify one of several reasons to explain the miscentering. Some clusters show significant miscentering for astrophysical reasons, i.e., ongoing cluster mergers. Others are miscentered due to non-astrophysical, systematic effects in the HSC data or the cluster-finding algorithm. After removing all clusters with clear, non-astrophysical causes of miscentering from the sample, we find a considerably smaller miscentered fraction, ~10%. We show that the gravitational lensing signal within 1 Mpc of miscentered clusters is considerably smaller than that of well-centered clusters, and we suggest that the ACT SZ centers are a better estimate of the true cluster potential centroid.</description>

      <title>CMBAnalysis: A Modern Framework for High-Precision Cosmic Microwave Background Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12207v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I present CMBAnalysis, a state-of-the-art Python framework designed for high-precision analysis of Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) radiation data. This comprehensive package implements parallel Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques for robust cosmological parameter estimation, featuring adaptive integration methods and sophisticated error propagation. The framework incorporates recent advances in computational cosmology, including support for extended cosmological models, detailed systematic error analysis, and optimized numerical algorithms. I demonstrate its capabilities through analysis of Planck Legacy Archive data, achieving parameter constraints competitive with established pipelines while offering significant performance improvements through parallel processing and algorithmic optimizations. Notable features include automated convergence diagnostics, comprehensive uncertainty quantification, and publication-quality visualization tools. The framework's modular architecture facilitates extension to new cosmological models and analysis techniques, while maintaining numerical stability through carefully implemented regularization schemes. My implementation achieves excellent computational efficiency, with parallel MCMC sampling reducing analysis time by up to 75\% compared to serial implementations. The code is open-source, extensively documented, and includes a comprehensive test suite, making it valuable for both research applications and educational purposes in modern cosmology.</description>

      <title>It\^{o}, Stratonovich, and zoom-in schemes in stochastic inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12465v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The It\^{o} and Stratonovich approaches are two ways to integrate stochastic differential equations. Detailed knowledge of the origin of the stochastic noise is needed to determine which approach suits a particular problem. I discuss this topic pedagogically in stochastic inflation, where the noise arises from a changing comoving coarse-graining scale or, equivalently, from `zooming in' into inflating space. I introduce a zoom-in scheme where deterministic evolution alternates with instantaneous zoom-in steps. I show that this alternating zoom-in scheme is equivalent to the It\^{o} approach in the Markovian limit, while the Stratonovich approach doesn't have a similar interpretation. In the full non-Markovian setup, the difference vanishes. The framework of zoom-in schemes clarifies the relationship between computations in stochastic inflation, linear perturbation theory, and the classical $\Delta N$ formalism. It informs the numerical implementation of stochastic inflation and is a building block for a first-principles derivation of the stochastic equations.</description>

      <title>The direct measurement of gravitational potential decay rate at cosmological scales II -- Improved dark energy constraint from $z\le1.4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The gravitational potential decay rate (DR) is caused by the cosmic acceleration of the universe, providing a direct probe into the existence of dark energy (DE). We present measurements of DR and explore its implications for DE models using the Data Release 9 galaxy catalog of DESI imaging surveys and the Planck cosmic microwave background maps. Our analysis includes six redshift bins within the range of $0.2\le z&lt;1.4$ and achieves a total significance of 3.1$\sigma$, extending the DR measurements to a much higher redshift comparing to Dong et al. (2022), which focused on $0.2\le z&lt;0.8$. Other improvements involve addressing potential systematics in the DR-related measurements of correlation functions, including imaging systematics and magnification bias. We explore the constraining power of DR both the $w$CDM model and the $w_0w_a$CDM model. We find that, the addition of DR can significantly improves DE constraints, over Sloan Digital Sky Survey baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) data alone or PantheonPlus supernovae (SNe) compilation alone, although it shows only a modest improvement for DESI BAO. In the $w$CDM model, all three probes-DR, DESI BAO and SNe-favor $w=-1$. For the $w_0w_a$CDM, while DESI BAO prefers $w_0&gt;-1$ and $w_a&lt;0$, SNe Ia and DR data constrain $w_0=-0.94^{+0.11}_{-0.13}$ and $w_a=-0.22^{+0.57}_{-0.97}$. Namely SNe Ia and DR data has no preference on dynamical dark energy over $\Lambda$.</description>

      <title>A population study on the effect of metallicity on ZAMS to the merger</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11902v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multiband observations of compact object sources offer a unique opportunity to explore their progenitors and enhance early multi-messenger alert. Recent analyses have indicated that metallicity significantly impacts the evolution of progenitors and the resulting compact objects. Using binary population synthesis, we investigate the formation of eccentric, inspiralling black hole binaries and black hole-neutron star binaries through the isolated binary evolution channel. We introduced a fiducial mass and metallicity relation for each ZAMS star. We model the stellar cluster of ZAMS stars by extending COSMIC's publicly available code. Our BPS code effectively accounts for the metallicity of each stellar object in the stellar cluster. In our analysis, we observed a significant increase in the number of inspiral binaries remaining in the stellar cluster. Instead of assuming a uniform metallicity for a stellar cluster, ZAMS stars within the cluster, characterized by diverse metallicity, evolve into more massive compact objects. The total mass of a single binary black hole inspiral varies from $\sim 9-86$ M$_\odot$; whereas for a black hole-neutron star system, this range becomes $\sim 6-32$ M$_\odot$. We compare the detectability of the characteristic strain against sub-Hz gravitational wave detectors.</description>

      <title>Phenomenology of dark matter indirect detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11928v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this thesis, we present a comprehensive and pedagogical overview of dark matter (DM). Chapter 1 discusses the main evidences for its existence, its properties, and potential candidates. We then explore major detection strategies, with Chapter 2 specifically dedicated to indirect detection. In the following chapters, we study the emission of secondary photons resulting from the interaction between DM products and the Galactic environment. Chapters 3 and 4 focus on DM as sub-GeV particles, analysing how the DM-produced electrons and positrons interact with ambient photons to generate X-rays through inverse Compton scattering. Comparing the predicted spectra with data from X-ray observatories yields strong constraints on sub-GeV DM. Chapter 5 extends these techniques to the case of primordial black hole (PBH) evaporation, imposing significant limits on PBHs as potential DM candidates.</description>

      <title>Zooming-in on cluster radio relics -- I. How density fluctuations explain the Mach number discrepancy, microgauss magnetic fields, and spectral index variations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11947v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is generally accepted that radio relics are the result of synchrotron emission from shock-accelerated electrons. Current models, however, are still unable to explain several aspects of their formation. In this paper, we focus on three outstanding problems: i) Mach number estimates derived from radio data do not agree with those derived from X-ray data, ii) cooling length arguments imply a magnetic field that is at least an order of magnitude larger than the surrounding intracluster medium (ICM), and iii) spectral index variations do not agree with standard cooling models. To solve these problems, we first identify typical shock conditions in cosmological simulations, using the results to inform significantly higher resolution shock-tube simulations. We apply the cosmic ray electron spectra code CREST and the emission code CRAYON+ to these, thereby generating mock observables ab-initio. We identify that upon running into an accretion shock, merger shocks generate a shock-compressed sheet, which, in turn, runs into upstream density fluctuations in pressure equilibrium. This mechanism directly gives rise to solutions to the three problems: it creates a distribution of Mach numbers at the shock-front, which flattens cosmic ray electron spectra, thereby biasing radio-derived Mach number estimates to higher values. We show that this effect is particularly strong in weaker shocks. Secondly, the density sheet becomes Rayleigh-Taylor unstable at the contact discontinuity, causing turbulence and additional compression downstream. This amplifies the magnetic field from ICM-like conditions up to microgauss levels. We show that synchrotron-based measurements are strongly biased by the tail of the distribution here too. Finally, the same instability also breaks the common assumption that matter is advected at the post-shock velocity downstream, thus invalidating laminar-flow based cooling models.</description>

      <title>Dark plasmas in the nonlinear regime: constraints from particle-in-cell simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11958v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: If the dark sector possesses long-range self-interactions, these interactions can source dramatic collective instabilities even in astrophysical settings where the collisional mean free path is long. Here, we focus on the specific case of dark matter halos composed of a dark $U(1)$ gauge sector undergoing a dissociative cluster merger. We study this by performing the first dedicated particle-in-cell plasma simulations of interacting dark matter streams, tracking the growth, formation, and saturation of instabilities through both the linear and nonlinear regimes. We find that these instabilities give rise to local (dark) electromagnetic inhomogeneities that serve as scattering sites, inducing an effective dynamic collisional cross-section. Mapping this effective cross-section onto existing results from large-scale simulations of the Bullet Cluster, we extend the limit on the dark charge-to-mass ratio by over ten orders of magnitude. Our results serve as a simple example of the rich phenomenology that may arise in a dark sector with long-range interactions and motivate future dedicated study of such ``dark plasmas.''</description>

      <title>The Gravitational Wave Bias Parameter from Angular Power Spectra: Bridging Between Galaxies and Binary Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11965v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study presents the modeling of the gravitational wave (GW) bias parameter by bridging a connection between simulated GW sources and galaxies in low redshift galaxy surveys 2MPZ and WISExSCOS (WISC). We study this connection by creating a mock GW catalog, populating galaxy surveys with binary black holes (BBHs) for different scenarios of the GW occupation fraction (or selection function) as a function of the galaxy stellar mass. We probe the observable consequences of this connection by exploring the spatial clustering of the GW sources in terms of the GW bias parameter. We consider a phenomenological broken power law model for the selection function, with a potential turnover $M_{K}$ at high stellar mass ($10^{11}$ $M_{\odot}$ in the fiducial model) where the star formation efficiency begins to drop. We vary the parameters of the selection function and find that generically the GW bias increases as $M_{K}$ increases (and gets suppressed as $M_{K}$ decreases). The change in the GW bias parameter shows a maximum change of about $30\%$ for different scenarios explored in this work in comparison to the galaxy bias. Future measurements of the GW bias can help constrain $M_{K}$ and the slopes of the selection function and thus offer insights into the underlying astrophysical processes.</description>

      <title>Hunting axion dark matter with anti-ferromagnets: a case study with nickel oxide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11971v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that nickel oxide, which is already a very promising target to look for sub-MeV dark matter scattering, can be employed to hunt axion dark matter, with masses in the meV range and couplings to electrons allowing them to potentially be QCD axions. We describe the interactions between axions and the collective excitations of nickel oxide in terms of a universal effective field theory, built solely out of symmetry arguments. The processes of conversion into one or two excitations provide, respectively, a narrowband and a broadband channel for the axion search, and the possibility of varying an external magnetic field up to a phase transition point allows to cover a large portion of a yet unexplored parameter space, reaching axion masses down to few fractions of an meV. Our results underline nickel oxide as an ideal candidate for a multi-purpose target for light dark matter searches.</description>

      <title>Non-local effective field theory in general relativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11990v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by known facts about effective field theory and non-Abelian gauge theory, we argue that the post-Newtonian approximation might fail even in the limit of weak fields and small velocities under certain conditions. Namely, the post-Newtonian approximation might break down for wide extended bodies with angular momentum, where angular momentum spans significant spacetime curvature. We construct a novel dimensionless quantity that samples this breakdown, and we evaluate it by means of existing analytical solutions of rotating extended bodies and observational data. We give estimates for galaxies and binary systems, as well as our home in the Cosmos, Laniakea. We thus propose that a novel effective field theory of general relativity is needed to account for the onset of nonlocal angular momentum effetcs, with significant consequences for gravitational physics and cosmology at large.</description>

      <title>Estimating Dark Matter Halo Masses in Simulated Galaxy Clusters with Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12629v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Galaxies grow and evolve in dark matter halos. Because dark matter is not visible, galaxies' halo masses ($\rm{M}_{\rm{halo}}$) must be inferred indirectly. We present a graph neural network (GNN) model for predicting $\rm{M}_{\rm{halo}}$ from stellar mass ($\rm{M}_{*}$) in simulated galaxy clusters using data from the IllustrisTNG simulation suite. Unlike traditional machine learning models like random forests, our GNN captures the information-rich substructure of galaxy clusters by using spatial and kinematic relationships between galaxy neighbour. A GNN model trained on the TNG-Cluster dataset and independently tested on the TNG300 simulation achieves superior predictive performance compared to other baseline models we tested. Future work will extend this approach to different simulations and real observational datasets to further validate the GNN model's ability to generalise.</description>

      <title>Large non-Gaussianities corresponding to first-order phase transitions during inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12699v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we explore the back reaction of phase transitions in the spectator sector on the inflaton field during slow-roll inflation. Due to the significant excursion of the inflaton field, these phase transitions are likely to occur and can induce substantial non-Gaussian correlations in the curvature perturbation. Our results suggest that these correlations could be detectable by future observations of the cosmic microwave background radiation and large-scale structure surveys. Furthermore, we demonstrate that in certain parameter spaces, a scaling non-Gaussian signal can be produced, offering deeper insights into both the inflaton and spectator sectors. Additionally, phase transitions during inflation can generate gravitational wave signals with distinctive signatures, potentially explaining observations made by pulsar timing array experiments. The associated non-Gaussian correlations provide collateral evidence for these phase transitions.</description>

      <title>High-Efficiency and Low-Noise Detectors for the Upgraded CLASS 90 GHz Focal Plane</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12705v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the in-lab and on-sky performance for the upgraded 90 GHz focal plane of the Cosmology Large Angular Scale Surveyor (CLASS), which had four of its seven detector wafers updated during the austral winter of 2022. The update aimed to improve the transition-edge-sensor (TES) stability and bias range and to realize the high optical efficiency of the sensor design. Modifications included revised circuit terminations, electrical contact between the TES superconductor and the normal metal providing the bulk of the bolometer's heat capacity, and additional filtering on the TES bias lines. The upgrade was successful: 94% of detectors are stable down to 15% of the normal resistance, providing a wide overlapping range of bias voltages for all TESs on a wafer. The median telescope efficiency improved from $0.42^{+0.15}_{-0.22}$ to $0.60^{+0.10}_{-0.32}$ (68% quantiles). For the four upgraded wafers alone, median telescope efficiency increased to $0.65^{+0.06}_{-0.06}$. Given our efficiency estimate for the receiver optics, this telescope efficiency implies a detector efficiency exceeding $0.90$. The overall noise-equivalent temperature of the 90 GHz focal plane improved from 19 $\mu$K$\sqrt{s}$ to 11.3 $\mu$K$\sqrt{s}$.</description>

Abstract: We propose a mechanism of electroweak baryogenesis based on the Standard Model and explaining the coincidence between the baryon and Dark Matter (DM) densities. Large curvature fluctuations slightly below the threshold for Primordial Black Hole (PBH) formation locally reheat the plasma above the sphaleron barrier when they collapse gravitationally, leading to regions with a maximal baryogenesis at the Quantum Chromodynamics epoch. Using numerical relativity simulations, we calculate the overdensity threshold for baryogenesis. If PBH significantly contribute to the DM, aborted PBHs can generate a baryon density and an averaged baryon-to-photon ratio consistent with observations.</description>

      <title>Semi-analytical covariance matrices for two-point correlation function for DESI 2024 data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03007v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an optimized way of producing the fast semi-analytical covariance matrices for the Legendre moments of the two-point correlation function, taking into account survey geometry and mimicking the non-Gaussian effects. We validate the approach on simulated (mock) catalogs for different galaxy types, representative of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Data Release 1, used in 2024 analyses. We find only a few percent differences between the mock sample covariance matrix and our results, which can be expected given the approximate nature of the mocks, although we do identify discrepancies between the shot-noise properties of the DESI fiber assignment algorithm and the faster approximation (emulator) used in the mocks. Importantly, we find a close agreement (&lt;=8% relative differences) in the projected errorbars for distance scale parameters for the baryon acoustic oscillation measurements. This confirms our method as an attractive alternative to simulation-based covariance matrices, especially for non-standard models or galaxy sample selections, making it particularly relevant to the broad current and future analyses of DESI data.</description>

      <title>Quantifying Scalar Field Dynamics with DESI 2024 Y1 BAO measurements</title>

Abstract: Quintessence scalar fields are a natural candidate for evolving dark energy. Unlike the phenomenological $w_0w_a$ parameterization of the dark energy equation of state, they cannot accommodate the phantom regime of dark energy $w(z) &lt; -1$, or crossings into the phantom regime. Recent baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements by the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) indicate a preference for evolving dark energy over a cosmological constant, ranging from $2.6\sigma-3.9\sigma$ when fitting to $w_0w_a$, and combining the DESI BAO measurements with other cosmological probes. In this work, we directly fit three simple scalar field models to the DESI BAO data, combined with cosmic microwave background anisotropy measurements and supernova data sets. We find the best fit model to include a $2-4\%$ kinetic scalar field energy $\Omega_{\rm scf,k}$, for a canonical scalar field with a quadratic or linear potential. However, only the DESY-Y5 supernova data set combination shows a preference for quintessence over $\Lambda$CDM at the $95\%$ confidence level. Fitting to the supernova data sets Pantheon, Pantheon+, DES-Y5, and Union3, we show that the mild tension ($n_{\sigma}&lt; 3.4 $) under $\Lambda$CDM emerges from a BAO preference for smaller values of fractional mass-energy density $\Omega_m &lt; 0.29$, while all supernova data sets, except for Pantheon, prefer larger values, $\Omega_m &gt; 0.3$. The tension under $\Lambda$CDM remains noticeable ($n_{\sigma} &lt;2.8$), when replacing two of the DESI BAO redshift bins with effective redshifts $z_{\text{eff}} =0.51$, and $z_{\text{eff}}= 0.706$ with comparable BOSS DR 12 BAO measurements at $z_{\text{eff}} =0.51$, and $z_{\text{eff}}= 0.61$. Canonical scalar fields as dark energy are successful in mitigating that tension.</description>

      <title>Invariance transformations in wave-optics lensing: implications for gravitational-wave astrophysics and cosmology</title>

Abstract: Gravitational lensing offers unique opportunities to learn about the astrophysical origin of distant sources, the abundance of intervening objects acting as lenses, and gravity and cosmology in general. However, all this information can only be retrieved as long as one can disentangle each effect from the finite number of observables. In the geometric optics regime, typical of electromagnetic radiation, when the wavelength of the lensed signal is small compared to the size of the lens, there are invariance transformations that change the mass of the lens and the source-lens configuration but leave the observables unchanged. Neglecting this ``mass-sheet degeneracy'' can lead to biased lens parameters or unrealistic low uncertainties, which could then transfer to an incorrect cosmography study. This might be different for gravitational waves as their long wavelengths can be comparable to the lens size and lensing enters into the wave-optics limit. We explore the existence of invariance transformations in the wave-optics regime of gravitational-wave lensing, extending previous work and examining the implications for astrophysical and cosmological studies. We study these invariance transformations using three different methods of increasing level of complexity: template mismatch, Fisher Matrix, and Bayesian parameter estimation. We find that, for a sufficiently loud signal, the degeneracy is partially broken and the lens and cosmological parameters, e.g. $H_0$, can be retrieved independently and unbiased. In current ground-based detectors, though, considering also population studies, a strong constraint on these parameters seems quite remote and the prevailing degeneracy implies a larger uncertainty in the lens model reconstruction. However, with better sensitivity of the third-generation ground-based detectors, a meaningful constraint on $H_0$ is possible to obtain.</description>

      <title>Running gravitational constant induced dark energy as a solution to $\sigma_8$ tension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05965v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a modified gravity model with a running gravitational constant coupled to a varying dark energy fluid and test its imprint on the growth of structure in the universe. Using Redshift Space Distortion (RSD) measurement results, we show a tension at the $3 \sigma$ level between the best fit $\Lambda$CDM and the corresponding parameters obtained from the Planck data. Unlike many modified gravity-based solutions that overlook scale dependence and model-specific background evolution, we study this problem in the broadest possible context by incorporating both factors into our investigation. We performed a full perturbation analysis to demonstrate a scale dependence in the growth equation. Fixing the scale to $k = 0.1 h$ Mpc$^{-1}$ and introducing a phenomenological functional form for the varying Newton coupling $G$ with only one free parameter, we conduct a likelihood analysis of the RSD selected data. The analysis reveals that the model can bring the tension level within $1 \sigma$ while maintaining the deviation of $G$ from Newton's gravitational constant at the fifth order.</description>

      <title>Constraints on local primordial non-Gaussianity with 3d Velocity Reconstruction from the Kinetic Sunyaev-Zeldovich Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08240v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The cosmic velocity field is an unbiased probe of the total matter distribution but is challenging to measure directly at intermediate and high redshifts. The large-scale velocity field imprints a signal in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) through the kinetic Sunyaev-Zeldovich (kSZ) effect. We perform the first 3d reconstruction of the large-scale velocity field from the kSZ effect by applying a quadratic estimator to CMB temperature maps and the 3d positions of galaxies. We do so by combining CMB data from the fifth data release of the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (in combination with Planck) and a spectroscopic galaxy sample from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. We then measure the galaxy-velocity cross-power spectrum and detect the presence of the kSZ signal at a signal-to-noise ratio of 7.2$\sigma$. Using this galaxy-velocity cross-correlation alone, we constrain the amplitude of local primordial non-Gaussianity finding $f_{\rm NL}=-90^{+210}_{-350}$. This pathfinder measurement sets the stage for joint galaxy-CMB kSZ constraints to significantly enhance the $f_{\rm NL}$ information obtained from galaxy surveys through sample variance cancellation.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Wave and CMB Probes of Axion Kination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.09299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2108.09299v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Rotations of an axion field in field space provide a natural origin for an era of kination domination, where the energy density is dominated by the kinetic term of the axion field, preceded by an early era of matter domination. Remarkably, no entropy is produced at the end of matter domination and hence these eras of matter and kination domination may occur even after Big Bang Nucleosynthesis. We derive constraints on these eras from both the cosmic microwave background and Big Bang Nucleosynthesis. We investigate how this cosmological scenario affects the spectrum of possible primordial gravitational waves and find that the spectrum features a triangular peak. We discuss how future observations of gravitational waves can probe the viable parameter space, including regions that produce axion dark matter by the kinetic misalignment mechanism or the baryon asymmetry by axiogenesis. For QCD axion dark matter produced by the kinetic misalignment mechanism, a modification to the inflationary gravitational wave spectrum occurs above 0.01 Hz and, for high values of the energy scale of inflation, the prospects for discovery are good. We briefly comment on implications for structure formation of the universe.</description>

      <title>Strong-lensing cosmography using third-generation gravitational-wave detectors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17805v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a detailed exposition of a statistical method for estimating cosmological parameters from the observation of a large number of strongly lensed binary-black-hole (BBH) mergers observable by next (third) generation (XG) gravitational-wave (GW) detectors. This method, first presented in Jana (2023 Phys. Rev. Lett. 130 261401), compares the observed number of strongly lensed GW events and their time delay distribution (between lensed images) with observed events to infer cosmological parameters. We show that the precision of the estimation of the cosmological parameters does not have a strong dependance on the assumed BBH redshift distribution model. Using the large number of unlensed mergers, XG detectors are expected to measure the BBH redshift distribution with sufficient precision for the cosmological inference. However, a biased inference of the BBH redshift distribution will bias the estimation of cosmological parameters. An incorrect model for the distribution of lens properties can also lead to a biased cosmological inference. However, Bayesian model selection can assist in selecting the right model from a set of available parametric models for the lens distribution. We also present a way to incorporate the effect of contamination in the data due to the limited efficiency of lensing identification methods, so that it will not bias the cosmological inference.</description>

      <title>New insights into axion freeze-in</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01678v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Freeze-in via the axion-photon coupling, $g_{\phi\gamma}$, can produce axions in the early Universe. At low reheating temperatures close to the minimum allowed value $T_{\rm reh}\approx T_{\rm BBN}\approx 10\,{\rm MeV}$, the abundance peaks for axion masses $m_\phi\approx T_{\rm reh}$. Such heavy axions are unstable and subsequently decay, leading to strong constraints on $g_{\phi\gamma}$ from astrophysics and cosmology. In this work, we revisit the computation of the freeze-in abundance and clarify important issues. We begin with a complete computation of the collision terms for the Primakoff process, electron-positron annihilation, and photon-to-axion (inverse-)decay, while approximately taking into account plasma screening and threshold effects. We then solve the Boltzmann equation for the full axion distribution function. We confirm previous results about the importance of both processes to the effective "relic abundance" (defined as density prior to decay), and provide useful fitting formulae to estimate the freeze-in abundance from the equilibrium interaction rate. For the distribution function, we find an out-of-equilibrium population of axions and introduce an effective temperature for them. We follow the evolution right up until decay, and find that the average axion kinetic energy is larger than a thermal relic by between 20\% and 80\%, which may have implications for limits on decaying axions from X-ray spectra. We extend our study to a two-axion system with quartic cross-coupling, and find that for typical/expected couplings, freeze-in of a second axion flavour by annihilations leads to a negligibly small contribution to the relic density.</description>

      <title>On a Generating Function for the Isotropic Basis Functions and Other Connected Results</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15385v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently isotropic basis functions of $N$ unit vector arguments were presented; these are of significant use in measuring the N-Point Correlation Functions (NPCFs) of galaxy clustering. Here we develop the generating function for these basis functions -- $i.e.$ that function which, expanded in a power series, has as its angular part the isotropic functions. We show that this can be developed using basic properties of the plane wave. A main use of the generating function is as an efficient route to obtaining the Cartesian basis expressions for the isotropic functions. We show that the methods here enable computing difficult overlap integrals of multiple spherical Bessel functions, and we also give related expansions of the Dirac Delta function into the isotropic basis. Finally, we outline how the Cartesian expressions for the isotropic basis functions might be used to enable a faster NPCF algorithm on the CPU.</description>

      <title>Axion signals from neutron star populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19028v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neutron stars provide a powerful probe of axion dark matter, especially in higher frequency ranges where there remain fewer laboratory constraints. Populations of neutron stars near the Galactic Centre have been proposed as a means to place strong constraints on axion dark matter. One downside of this approach is that there are very few direct observations of neutron stars in this region, introducing uncertainties in the total number of neutron stars in this ``invisible" population at the Galactic Centre, whose size must be inferred through birth rate modelling. We suggest this number could also be reduced due to stellar dynamics carrying stars away from the Galactic Centre via large kick velocities at birth. We attempt to circumvent the uncertainty on the Galactic Centre population size by modelling the axion signal from better understood populations outside the Galactic Centre using {\tt PsrPopPy} which is normalised against pulsar observations. We consider lower-frequency, wider-angle searches for this signal via a range of instruments including MeerKAT and SKA-low but find that the sensitivity is not competitive with existing constraints. Finally, returning to the Galactic Centre, we compare populations to single objects as targets for axion detection. Using the latest modelling of axion-photon conversion in the Galactic Centre magnetar, we conclude that within astrophysical uncertainties, the Galactic Centre population and the magnetar could give comparable sensitivities to axion dark matter, suggesting one should continue to search for both signals in future surveys.</description>

      <title>Low injection rate of cosmic-ray protons in the turbulent reacceleration model of radio halos in galaxy clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13846v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A giant radio halo (RH) is a diffuse synchrotron emission observed on the scale of megaparsecs (Mpc), typically found in the central region of merging galaxy clusters. Its large size and steep spectrum suggest that it originates from the re-energization of an aged population of cosmic ray electrons (CREs), while the secondary leptons produced in the $pp$ hadronic collision of cosmic ray protons (CRPs) may contribute to the emission. In this study, we investigate the reacceleration model including both primary and secondary CREs, assuming that the primary CRs originate from internal galaxies. In our new method, we follow the cosmological evolution of each cluster and calculate the energy spectra and one-dimensional spatial distributions of CRs. The primary CRE model with $\sim 3$ Gyr duration of reacceleration successfully reproduces the statistical properties of the RHs observed in the recent LOFAR survey, as well as the spectrum and profile of the Coma cluster. The gamma-ray and neutrino emissions produced by reaccelerated CRPs are consistent with the upper limits. However, if the CRP injection rate is high and the secondary CREs become significant, the model with the required $\sim 3$ Gyr reacceleration overproduces the number of RHs. The limit on the CRP injection rate, $L_{\rm p} \lesssim 10^{41}$ erg/s, is significantly lower than that expected from the early starburst activity or jets from active galactic nuclei. This discrepancy requires a revision of either the model of CR supply from galaxies or the turbulent reacceleration model.</description>

      <title>Which gravitational lensing degeneracies are broken in wave-optics?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00145v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper studies gravitational lensing degeneracies in the wave-optics regime, focusing on lensed gravitational waves (GWs). Considering lensing degeneracies as re-scaling (or transformations) of arrival time delay surface, we can divide them into local and global types. Local degeneracies only affect the time delay surface in localized regions, whereas global degeneracies re-scale the whole time delay surface by a constant while keeping the various observed image properties unchanged. We show that local degeneracies can be broken in the wave-optics regime since lensing effects become sensitive to the overall arrival time delay surface and not only to the time delay values at the image positions. On the other hand, global degeneracies (such as similarity transformation, prismatic transformation, and mass-sheet degeneracy) multiply the amplification factor by a constant factor (let us say, $\lambda$). However, in GW lensing, as the GW signal amplitude depends on the source distance, it turns out that $\lambda$ is completely degenerate with the Hubble constant, similar to what we see in geometric optics. Hence, with the lensing of GWs, global degeneracies are as hard to break in wave optics as they are in geometric optics.</description>

      <title>Reconciling PTA and JWST and preparing for LISA with POMPOCO: a Parametrisation Of the Massive black hole POpulation for Comparison to Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17916v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a parametrised model to describe the formation and evolution of massive black holes, designed for comparisons with both electromagnetic and gravitational wave observations. Using an extended Press-Schechter formalism, we generate dark matter halo merger trees. We then seed and evolve massive black holes through parameterised prescriptions. This approach, which avoids solving differential equations, is computationally efficient, enabling us to analyse observational data and infer the parameters of our model in a fully Bayesian framework. We find that observations of the black hole luminosity function are compatible with the nHz gravitational wave signal (likely) measured by PTAs, provided we allow for an increased luminosity function at high redshift ($4-7$), as recently suggested by JWST observations. Our model can simultaneously reproduce the bulk of the $M_*-M_{\rm BH}$ relation at $z-0$, as well as its outliers, something cosmological simulations struggle to do. The inferred model parameters are consistent with expectations from observations and more complex simulations: They favour heavier black hole seeds and short delays between halo and black hole mergers, while requiring supper-Edington accretion episodes lasting a few tens of million years, which in our model are linked to galaxy mergers. We find accretion to be suppressed in the most massive black holes below $z\simeq 2.5$, consistently with the anti-hierarchical growth hypothesis. Finally, our predictions for LISA, although fairly broad, are in agreement with previous models. Our model offers a new perspective on the apparent tensions between the black hole luminosity function and the latest JWST and PTA results. Its flexibility makes it ideal to fully exploit the potential of future gravitational wave observations of massive black hole binaries with LISA.</description>

      <title>Stability analysis of power-law cosmological models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18925v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we revisit the stability of power-law models, focusing on an alternative approach that differs significantly from the standard approaches used in studying power-law models. In the standard approach, stability is studied by reducing the system of background FRW equations to a one-dimensional system for a new background variable $X$ in terms of the number of e-foldings. However, we rewrote the equations, incorporating $H$ into the system and went on to do the calculations up to the second order. We demonstrate by computing the deviations from the power-law exact solution to second-order in time and show that power-law contraction is never an attractor in time, regardless of parameter values. Our analysis shows that while first-order corrections align with existing interpretations, second-order corrections introduce significant deviations that cannot be explained by a simple time shift that explains the first-order diverging terms. With importance, we note that in the number of e-folds, the system remains an attractor, while in cosmic time, it is unstable. We also support our claim with numerical results. This new insight has broader implications for the study of attractor behaviour of differential equation solutions and raises questions about the stability of scenarios like the ekpyrotic bounce driven by an exponential potential. Our work also hints that the different temporal variables we use might not be equivalent.</description>

      <title>Reconstruction of the scalar field potential in non-metricity gravity through Gaussian processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00051v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The accelerated expansion of the universe has been widely confirmed, posing challenges to the standard $\Lambda$CDM model, particularly the cosmological coincidence problem. This has motivated the exploration of modified gravity theories, including non-metricity gravity, which explains cosmic acceleration without dark energy. In this work, we incorporate a quintessence scalar field into the non-metricity framework to model both inflation and late-time acceleration. Employing the Gaussian process method with a square exponential kernel, we reconstruct the scalar field potential, $V(\phi)$, from observational Hubble data sets coming from cosmic chronometers (CC) as well as from the method of radial baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) in a model-independent approach. This approach allows us to obtain a suitable quintessence scalar field model that aligns with the observational Hubble data under the framework of power-law non-metricity gravity. Additionally, we compare our reconstructed potential with power-law scalar field potentials, revealing that these models show better agreement with the observational data, providing new insights into the dynamics of the universe. In contrast, we find that the early dark energy has minimal effect on the present-time accelerated expansion of the universe.</description>

Abstract: We propose a new class of inflationary attractors in metric-affine gravity. Such class features a non-minimal coupling $\tilde\xi \, \Omega(\phi)$ with the Holst invariant $\tilde{R}$ and an inflaton potential proportional to $\Omega(\phi)^2$. The attractor behaviour of the class takes place with two combined strong coupling limits. The first limit is realized at large $\tilde\xi$, which makes the theory equivalent to a $\tilde{R}^2$ model. Then, the second limit considers a very small Barbero-Immirzi parameter which leads the inflationary predictions of the $\tilde{R}^2$ model towards the ones of Starobinsky inflation. Because of the analogy with the renown $\xi$-attractors, we label this new class as $\tilde\xi$-attractors.</description>
