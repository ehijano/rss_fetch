      <title>A lipidated peptide derived from the C-terminal tail of the vasopressin 2 receptor shows promise as a new $\beta$-arrestin inhibitor</title>

Abstract: $\beta$-arrestins play pivotal roles in seven transmembrane receptor (7TMR) signalling and trafficking. To study their functional role in the regulation of specific receptor systems, current research relies mainly on genetic tools, as few pharmacological options are available. To address this issue, we designed and synthesised a novel lipidated phosphomimetic peptide inhibitor targeting $\beta$-arrestins, called ARIP, which was developed based on the C-terminal tail (A343-S371) of the vasopressin V2 receptor. As the V2R sequence has been shown to bind $\beta$-arrestins with high affinity and stability, we added an N-terminal palmitate residue to allow membrane tethering and subsequent cell entry. Here, using BRET2-based biosensors, we demonstrated the ability of ARIP to inhibit agonist-induced $\beta$-arrestin recruitment on a series of 7TMRs belonging to class A (low stable associations with arrestins) or class B (high stability), with efficiencies that dependent on receptor type. In addition, we showed that ARIP was unable to recruit $\beta$-arrestins to the cell membrane by itself, and that it did not interfere with canonical G protein signalling. Molecular modelling studies also revealed that ARIP binds $\beta$-arrestins in the same way as V2Rpp, the phosphorylated peptide derived from the V2R C-terminal domain, and that replacing the p-Ser and p-Thr residues of V2Rpp with Glu residues does not alter the inhibitory activity of ARIP on $\beta$-arrestin recruitment. Importantly, ARIP exerted an opioid-sparing effect in vivo, as intrathecal injection of ARIP potentiated the analgesic effect of morphine in the tail-flick nociceptive model, a behavioural response consistent with $\beta$-arrestin genetic inhibition. ARIP therefore represents a promising pharmacological tool for investigating the fine-tuning roles of $\beta$-arrestins in 7TMR-driven pathophysiological processes.</description>

      <title>Optimal Inference of Asynchronous Boolean Network Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02634v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Associations between phenotype and genomic and epigenomic markers are often derived by correlation. Systems Biology aims to make more robust connections and uncover broader insights by modeling the cellular mechanisms that produce a phenotype. The question of choosing the modeling methodology is of central importance. A model that does not capture biological reality closely enough will not explain the system's behavior. At the same time, highly detailed models suffer from computational limitations and are likely to overfit the data. Boolean networks strike a balance between complexity and descriptiveness and thus have received increasing interest. We previously described an algorithm for fitting Boolean networks to high-throughout experimental data that finds the optimal network with respect to the information in a given dataset. In this work, we describe a simple extension that enables the modeling of asynchronous dynamics, i.e. different reaction times for different network nodes. Our approach greatly simplifies the construction of Boolean network models for time-series datasets, where asynchronicty often occurs. We demonstrate our methodology by integrating real data from transcriptomic experiments, and provide an implementation that can be used by the community for network reconstruction using any high-throughout dataset. Our approach significantly expands the applicability of the Boolean network model to experimental data.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Control of State Transitions in Dense Associative Memories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11336v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dense Associative Memories are dynamical systems that can encode for many attractor memory patterns through higher-order interactions. Here we analyze a continuous form of Dense Associative Memories that emerges in biological and engineered settings, including in the gene regulatory networks that control cellular identity. The dynamics are governed by the interplay between an inverse-temperature-like parameter $\beta$ and an input field $\textbf{w}$. The parameter $\beta$ controls the attractor landscape structure: at large $\beta$, memory patterns are stable attractors, while at lower $\beta$ values, the attractors are associated with progenitor states-weighted combinations of two or more memory patterns. We associate progenitor states with self-similarity of the model following a coarse-graining transformation on memory pattern subsets. We use this transformation to propose a hierarchical model for the control of the identity, stability, and basins of attraction of the progenitor states which facilitates transitions between memory patterns through an annealing-like mechanism. We use this framework to explain the dynamical regulation of blood formation, demonstrating how robust control of attractor transitions may emerge in biological networks and providing a mathematical basis for well-established experimental observations on the hierarchical control of cell identity.</description>
