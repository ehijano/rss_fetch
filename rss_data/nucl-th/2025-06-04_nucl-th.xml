      <title>The influence of nuclear short range correlations on sub-threshold particle production in proton-nucleus collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03962v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The apparent production of (multi-)strange baryons and mesons at sub-threshold energies in proton-heavy ion collisions is a consequence of short range correlations (SRC), which have recently been observed in lepton-nucleus scattering. They may enhance the available center of mass energy of individual nucleon-nucleon collisions and allow, therefore, for sub-threshold particle production in proton-nucleus collisions. Calculations demonstrate that SRC enhance the probability for particle production at nominal sub-threshold energies up to a factor of $\times 10^3$ as compared to a simple Fermi gas model. We benchmark the idea by calculating the $\Xi^-$ multiplicity in nominal sub-threshold p+Nb collisions which compare well with the data measured by the HADES collaboration. These findings are of prime relevance for upcoming experiments at the FAIR facility, especially for the study of charmed hadrons.</description>

      <title>Accessing proton number fluctuations in limited regions of phase space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In heavy ion collisions particle distributions fluctuate from event to event. It is interesting to study local fluctuations of a specific particle specie, e.g. baryons, in the transverse plane. Fluctuations of the harmonic flow provide an integrated measure of such fluctuations. An alternative approach is to study proton number fluctuations measured in a relatively narrow azimuthal angle window. Due to the transverse flow, particles registered in a narrow azimuthal angle window are emitted predominantly from a region of the fireball located at the same azimuthal angle. Similarly, it is informative to measure the covariance of the number of protons emitted in two opposite windows of azimuthal angles. The main difficulty lies in distinguishing effects of local baryon density fluctuations in the transverse plane from global particle density and collective flow fluctuations. These global volume and flow fluctuations can be estimated using some reference particles, e.g. charged mesons. Reliable estimates of such fluctuations can be constructed both for the second factorial cumulant of the proton number in an azimuthal angle window and for the covariance between two such windows. The simultaneous measurement of both quantities provides a sensitive probe of local baryon number fluctuations superimposed on top of a fluctuating fireball background density.</description>

      <title>Extremely large oblate deformation of the first excited state in $^{12}$C: a new challenge to modern nuclear theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03236v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A Coulomb-excitation study of the high-lying first excited state at 4.439 MeV in the nucleus $^{12}$C has been carried out using the $^{208}$Pb($^{12}$C,$^{12}$C$^*$)$^{208}$Pb$^*$ reaction at 56 MeV and the {\sc Q3D} magnetic spectrograph at the Maier-Leibnitz Laboratorium in Munich. High-statistics achieved with an average beam intensity of approximately 10$^{11}$ ions/s together with state-of-the-art {\it ab initio} calculations of the nuclear dipole polarizability permitted the accurate determination of the spectroscopic quadrupole moment, $Q_{_S}(2_{_1}^+) = +0.076(30)$~eb, in agreement with previous measurements. Combined with previous work, a weighted average of $Q_{_S}(2_{_1}^+) = +0.090(14)$ eb is determined, which includes the re-analysis of a similar experiment by Vermeer and collaborators, $Q_{_S}(2_{_1}^+) = +0.103(20)$~eb. Such a large oblate deformation challenges modern nuclear theory and emphasizes the need of $\alpha$ clustering and associated triaxiality effects for full convergence of $E2$ collective properties.</description>

      <title>Reducing Hadronic Uncertainty in Low-Energy Neutral-Current Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03255v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze the dominant hadronic uncertainty in low-energy neutral-current (anti)neutrino scattering, estimated at the $3$-$4$ per mille level. This uncertainty arises from limited knowledge of the charge-isospin correlation function of quark currents. We study the charge-charge and charge-isospin correlators within $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ and $\mathrm{SU}(3)$ chiral perturbation theory (ChPT). In $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ ChPT, the two correlators are identical to all orders in the chiral and electromagnetic expansions. We further perform a one-loop $\mathrm{SU}(3)$ ChPT calculation and discuss the relevant counterterms. Our findings reduce the hadronic uncertainty in neutral-current processes such as (anti)neutrino-electron and coherent elastic (anti)neutrino-nucleus scattering to the sub-permille level, $\lesssim 1$ per mille.</description>

      <title>Modelling Coincident Particle Production in Ultraperipheral Heavy Ion Collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03264v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present an analysis of coincident particle production in ultraperipheral heavy ion collisions. In particular, we present the first detailed and differential predictions for coincident $\rho^0$ meson production in association with muon pair production, motivated by the recent ATLAS measurement of this process. These are found to describe the data well, including the dependence of the coincidence fraction on the ZDC selection and/or other kinematic constraints on the muons. Differential predictions at the level of various kinematic variables are presented, and the calculation is made publicly available in the SuperChic MC generator. We also present general results for coincident two photon-initiated production, focussing on muon and electron pair production; while the former is rather suppressed, the latter will be ubiquitous near threshold. The impact of coincident production on exclusivity vetos in ultraperipheral measurements is discussed.</description>

      <title>$f$-mode oscillations in hot Neutron Stars: Effect of hyperons and neutrino trapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03288v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we present an equation of state formalism for hot Neutron Stars (NSs) which consistently includes the effects of finite temperature, hyperons as well as neutrino trapping, relevant for the study of proto-neutron stars, binary neutron star mergers and supernova explosions. Within a non-linear relativistic mean field description, the framework allows for a systematic variation of nuclear parameters within the range allowed by uncertainties in nuclear experimental data, ensuring compatibility with nuclear theory, astrophysical and heavy-ion data. We then investigate the role of nuclear and hypernuclear parameters on NS macroscopic properties and $f$-mode oscillations in hot neutron stars within Cowling approximation. Our results reveal that in hyperonic neutron stars with trapped neutrinos, the saturation nuclear density shows moderate to strong correlation with NS astrophysical observables. We also investigate the $C-Love$ universal relations for this model and provide fit relations for hot NS configurations in the neutrino-trapped regime.</description>

      <title>Permutationally-Invariant N-body gates via Tavis-Cummings Hamiltonian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03453v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Widely used in atomic and superconducting qubit systems, the Jaynes-Cummings (JC) Hamiltonian is a simple, yet powerful model for a two-level system interacting with a quantum harmonic oscillator. In this paper, we focus on a system of n qubits, identically coupled to a single oscillator via JC interaction, also known as the Tavis-Cummings (TC) Hamiltonian. We show that all permutationally-invariant unitaries on an arbitrary number of qubits can be realized using this permutationally-invariant Hamiltonian, which couples the qubits to an oscillator initialized in its vacuum state, together with global uniform x and z fields on all qubits. This includes useful gates, such as controlled-Z gate with an arbitrary number of control qubits. As a corollary, we find that all permutationally invariant states -- including useful entangled states such as GHZ and Dicke states -- can be prepared using this interaction and global fields. We also characterize unitaries that can be realized on the joint Hilbert space of the qubits and oscillator with the TC interaction and global z field, and develop new methods for preparing the state of the oscillator in an arbitrary initial state. We present various examples of explicit circuits for the case of n=2 qubits. In particular, we develop new methods for implementing controlled-Z, SWAP, iSWAP, and $\sqrt{i\text{SWAP}}$ gates using only the TC interaction and a global z field. Our work also reveals an accidental symmetry in the TC Hamiltonian and shows that it can be explained using Schwinger's oscillator model of angular momentum.</description>

      <title>Off-shell ambiguities in correlation functions: strategies to minimize them</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03669v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We face here the problem of uncertainties in correlation functions due to the freedom in the off-shell dependence of the wave functions, or equivalently, off-shell ambiguities in the scattering matrices. We make the study for the case of meson baryon interaction, choosing the $K\Lambda$, $K \Sigma$, $\eta N$ coupled channels, which are related to the $N^*(1535)$ resonance. We find that using realistic interactions based on chiral dynamics the uncertainties are small, of the order of $2-3$~\%, but could be much bigger if other methods are used. However, our study shows the way to optimally overcome these uncertainties in the analysis of correlation functions, and we provide a series of recommendations for any general analysis.</description>

      <title>Event Topology Classifiers at the Large Hadron Collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03782v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Event classifiers are the most fundamental observables to probe the system size and event topology of high-energy collisions. Significant progress has been made to establish suitable event classifiers to probe different physics processes occurring in elementary $e^{+}e^{-}$ to heavy-ion collisions in a range of center of mass energies. One of the major motivations to revisit event classifiers at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) originates from the recent measurements of high multiplicity proton-proton collisions, which have revealed that these small collision systems exhibit features similar to the formation of quark-gluon plasma (QGP), traditionally believed to be only achievable in heavy nucleus-nucleus collisions at ultra-relativistic energies. To pinpoint the origin of these QGP-like phenomena with substantially reduced auto-correlation and selection biases, and to bring all collision systems on equal footing, along with charged-particle multiplicity, lately several event topology classifiers such as transverse sphericity, transverse spherocity, relative transverse activity classifier, and charged-particle flattenicity have been used extensively in experiments as well as in the phenomenological front. In this review article, we extensively discuss the purpose, coverage, and usage guidelines of these event shape classifiers, which can be crucial given the upcoming measurements in a precision era during Runs 3 and 4 of the LHC. In most cases, the event shape observables are found to be better probes in understanding the heavy-ion-like behavior seen at the LHC, while making a multi-differential study of multihadron production dynamics in hadronic and nuclear collisions.</description>

      <title>SuSAM-v2: improved superscaling description of electron and CC neutrino quasielastic scattering using effective mass dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03934v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an improved version of the Superscaling Analysis with Relativistic Effective Mass, denoted as SuSAM-v2. In the original SuSAM model, a universal scaling function was fitted to a selected set of quasielastic electron scattering (e,e') cross section data, using a phenomenological ansatz inspired by the Relativistic Mean Field model of nuclear matter. In this work, we refine the procedure by first fitting a longitudinal scaling function directly to experimental longitudinal response data. Subsequently, a separate transverse scaling function is extracted from purely transverse data, after subtracting the longitudinal contribution already determined. We find that the resulting transverse scaling function must exhibit an explicit dependence on the momentum transfer q in order to reproduce all kinematics consistently. The resulting SuSAM-v2 model simultaneously describes inclusive quasielastic cross sections and both longitudinal and transverse response functions in electron scattering. The model is then applied to neutrino-nucleus scattering, showing an improved prediction compared to the previous SuSAM-v1 version, due to a more accurate treatment of the relative contributions of the longitudinal and transverse weak nuclear responses.</description>

Abstract: When Anderson localization entered the QCD landscape, it was almost immediately thought about in connection with thermal phases, namely as a factor in the chiral transition. However, recent developments revealed an additional structure that made Anderson-like features central to the genesis of the entirely new thermal phase: the IR phase. I will explain these developments.</description>

      <title>First-order phase transitions in the cores of neutron stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05637v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: I explore various scenarios for the phase transition within neutron-star matter. I do so by generating large model-agnostic ensemble using Gaussian processes, both with and without explicit inclusion of first-order phase transitions (FOPTs). The ensemble is conditioned with state-of-the-art astrophysical and theoretical inputs in a fully Bayesian approach. I study how the current data affect the posterior probability of the location and the strength of FOPT. I find that the previously observed peak structure of the sound speed remains stable against inclusion of FOPTs. While the current data cannot differentiate between a smooth crossover and a first-order phase transition, 91% of the total evidence consists of equations of state with some form of phase changes, such as FOPT occurring within or terminating the stable branch of neutron stars, or an indication of a crossover to quark matter.</description>

Abstract: We report on the first \textit{ab initio} informed $\alpha$ knock-out reaction in the intermediate-mass region, with the aim to probe the underlying chiral potential and its impact on the emergence of alpha clustering in this mass region. The theoretical predictions of the $\alpha+^{16}$O clustering in the $^{20}$Ne ground state, based on the \textit{ab initio} symmetry-adapted no-core shell model, yield a triple differential cross section for $^{20}$Ne(p, p$\alpha$)$^{16}$O that is in a remarkable agreement with the data. This allows us to examine predictions of surface and in-medium $\alpha$-cluster features from a chiral potential and to compare these to the successful antisymmetrized molecular dynamics approach.</description>

      <title>Thermomagnetic Effects of Quark Matter in the NJL Model: Application of Regularization Schemes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08674v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the SU(3) Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model of a thermally magnetized medium, the regularization methods adopted for the thermodynamic potential and the mass gap equation are utilized to calculate the relevant thermodynamic quantities in thermomagnetic quark matter. When dealing with the thermodynamic quantities and the gap equation, three schemes can be chosen, namely magnetic field-independent regularization, soft cut-off regularization, and Pauli-Villars regularization. These three regularization schemes have different influences on the properties of thermomagnetic quark matter, and different choices of regularization schemes will also lead to different effects in the calculation of the properties of thermomagnetic quark matter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.20442v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent observations of neutron stars, combined with causality, thermodynamic stability, and nuclear constraints, indicate a rapid stiffening of QCD matter at densities slightly above nuclear saturation density ($n_0 \simeq 0.16\,{\rm fm}^{-3}$). The evolution of the stiffening is faster than expected from purely nucleonic models with many-body repulsion. Taking into account the quark substructure of baryons, we argue that the saturation of quark states occurs at $\sim$ 2-3$n_0$, driving quark matter formation even before baryonic cores of radius $\sim$0.5 fm spatially overlap. We describe the continuous transitions from hadronic to quark matter within a quarkyonic matter model in which gluons are assumed to remain confining at densities of interest. To obtain analytic insight into the transient regime, we construct an ideal model of quarkyonic matter, the {\it IdylliQ} model, in which one can freely switch from baryonic to quark descriptions and vice versa.</description>

Abstract: Within the nuclear DFT framework, employing the Skyrme UNEDF1 functional and incorporating pairing correlations, we determined the spectroscopic electric quadrupole and magnetic dipole moments of the $\nu11/2^{-}$ and $\pi7/2^{+}$ configurations in heavy, deformed, open-shell odd nuclei with $50\leq Z \leq 64$. The notions of self-consistent shape and spin polarisations due to odd nucleons responsible for generating total electric quadrupole and magnetic dipole moments were transformed into detailed computational procedures. The alignment of intrinsic angular momentum along the axial symmetry axis, necessitating signature and time-reversal symmetry breaking, followed by the restoration of rotational symmetry, proved to be essential components of the method. In contrast, the restoration of particle number symmetry yields modifications of only about 1%. With the isovector spin-spin terms of the functional previously adjusted in near doubly magic nuclei across the mass chart, the calculations were parameter-free. Effective charges and $g$-factors were not employed. A reasonably good agreement was achieved between the calculated and measured electric quadrupole moments. A similarly fair description of the magnetic dipole moments was obtained for the intruder configurations $\nu11/2^{-}$ alongside a poor description of those for $\pi7/2^{+}$.</description>

      <title>Nuclear clustering process in heavy-ion collisions : experimental constraints on the low-temperature region of the QCD phase diagram</title>

Abstract: In this article, we study the production of Hydrogen and Helium isotopes in heavy-ion collisions in the incident energy range between 80 and 150 MeV/nucleon. We compare their inclusive multiplicities emitted in the transverse plane of the reaction with the predictions given by the thermal model. As a first step, we validate the choice of this approach to describe the experimental measurements. We also show that the transient states have to be explicitly taken into account for a good statistical description of the experimental multiplicities. From the thermodynamical parameter values obtained we complete the existing database built with the use of thermal-statistical models to reproduce particle production in the (ultra-)relativistic-energy measurements. We then proposed a new constraint on the so-called freeze-out region in the temperature (T) versus baryonic chemical potential (muB) phase diagram of the quantum chromodynamics. These new results indicate that there is a common framework to describe the hadron production and nuclear clustering processes in heavy-ion collisions.</description>

      <title>Nonequilibrium Phenomenology of Identified Particle Spectra in Heavy-Ion Collisions at LHC Energies</title>

Abstract: We employ the Zubarev approach of the non-equilibrium statistical operator to investigate the enhancement of the low-$p_T$ region of pion spectra, introducing an effective pion chemical potential to describe the overpopulation of low-energy pion states. We test a corresponding freeze-out approach by analyzing the transverse-momentum spectra of identified particles measured recently with high precision by the ALICE Collaboration in Pb+Pb collisions at CERN LHC. A blast-wave model and a blast-wave-based particle generator, coupled to a hadronic transport model, are utilized. Bayesian inference methods are applied to extract the most probable sets of thermodynamic parameters at the chemical freeze-out hypersurface. Both models for the overpopulated pion states, the hadronic transport model and the thermal model with a nonzero pion chemical potential, provide a satisfactory description of the observed pion spectra. However, both approaches contain approximations which can be improved within a systematic nonequilibrium approach. We demonstrate that the introduction of a nonequilibrium pion chemical potential offers an efficient alternative to the conventional explanation of the low-$p_T$ enhancement, typically attributed to resonance decays with subsequent thermalization. A similar discussion holds also for the kaon spectra.</description>
