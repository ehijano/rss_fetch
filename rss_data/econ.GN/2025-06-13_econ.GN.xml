      <title>An Interpretable Machine Learning Approach in Predicting Inflation Using Payments System Data: A Case Study of Indonesia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10369v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper evaluates the performance of prominent machine learning (ML) algorithms in predicting Indonesia's inflation using the payment system, capital market, and macroeconomic data. We compare the forecasting performance of each ML model, namely shrinkage regression, ensemble learning, and super vector regression, to that of the univariate time series ARIMA and SARIMA models. We examine various out-of-bag sample periods in each ML model to determine the appropriate data-splitting ratios for the regression case study. This study indicates that all ML models produced lower RMSEs and reduced average forecast errors by 45.16 percent relative to the ARIMA benchmark, with the Extreme Gradient Boosting model outperforming other ML models and the benchmark. Using the Shapley value, we discovered that numerous payment system variables significantly predict inflation. We explore the ML forecast using local Shapley decomposition and show the relationship between the explanatory variables and inflation for interpretation. The interpretation of the ML forecast highlights some significant findings and offers insightful recommendations, enhancing previous economic research that uses a more established econometric method. Our findings advocate ML models as supplementary tools for the central bank to predict inflation and support monetary policy.</description>

      <title>Getting Explicit Instruction Right</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There has been substantial public debate about the potentially deleterious effects of the long-run move to ``inquiry-based learning'' in which students are placed at the center of an educational journey and arrive at their own understanding of what is being taught. There have been numerous calls for a return to ``direct'' or ``explicit'' instruction. This paper focuses on identifying the causal effect of correctly implementing explicit instruction on student performance in standardized tests. We utilise a unique setting in Australia\textemdash a country in which all students in grades 3, 5, 7, and 9 undergo annual basic skills tests (``NAPLAN''). We use a synthetic control approach to study the effect of introducing Explicit Instruction in Charlestown South Public School\textemdash a median-performing school\textemdash on Year-3 and Year-5 NAPLAN scores in Reading and Numeracy. Importantly, this is achieved via peer modelling, with Charlestown teaching staff sitting-in during the classes of a high-performing explicit-instruction school. We find that the performance gains are substantial and persistent. JEL: I20, I21.

      <title>Asymmetric price adjustment over the business cycle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10640v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Studies of micro-level price datasets find more frequent small price increases than decreases, which can be explained by consumer inattention because time-constrained shoppers might ignore small price changes. Recent empirical studies of the link between shopping behavior and price attention over the business cycle find that consumers are more attentive to prices during economic downturns, and less attentive during economic booms. These two sets of findings have a testable implication. The asymmetry in small price changes should vary over the business cycle. It should diminish during recessions and strengthen during expansions. We test this prediction using a large US store-level dataset with more than 98 million weekly price observations for the years 1989-1997, which includes an 8-month recession period, as defined by the NBER. We compare price adjustments between periods of recession - high unemployment, and expansion - low unemployment. Focusing on small price changes, we find, consistent with our hypothesis, that there is a greater asymmetry in small price changes during periods of low unemployment compared to the periods of high unemployment, implying that firms price-setting behavior varies over the business cycle.</description>

      <title>Paired Completion: Flexible Quantification of Issue-framing at Scale with LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09742v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Detecting issue framing in text - how different perspectives approach the same topic - is valuable for social science and policy analysis, yet challenging for automated methods due to subtle linguistic differences. We introduce `paired completion', a novel approach using LLM next-token log probabilities to detect contrasting frames using minimal examples. Through extensive evaluation across synthetic datasets and a human-labeled corpus, we demonstrate that paired completion is a cost-efficient, low-bias alternative to both prompt-based and embedding-based methods, offering a scalable solution for analyzing issue framing in large text collections, especially suited to low-resource settings.</description>

      <title>Nonconvex Game and Multi Agent Reinforcement Learning for Zonal Ancillary Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03288v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We characterize zonal ancillary market coupling relying on noncooperative game theory. To that purpose, we formulate the ancillary market as a multi-leader single follower bilevel problem, that we subsequently cast as a generalized Nash game with side constraints and nonconvex feasibility sets. We determine conditions for equilibrium existence and show that the game has a generalized potential game structure. To compute market equilibrium, we rely on two exact approaches: an integrated optimization approach and Gauss-Seidel best-response, that we compare against multi-agent deep reinforcement learning. On real data from Germany and Austria, simulations indicate that multi-agent deep reinforcement learning achieves the smallest convergence rate but requires pretraining, while best-response is the slowest. On the economics side, multi-agent deep reinforcement learning results in smaller market costs compared to the exact methods, but at the cost of higher variability in the profit allocation among stakeholders. Further, stronger coupling between zones tends to reduce costs for larger zones.</description>
