      <title>Post-Match Error Mitigation for Deferred Acceptance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13604v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Real-life applications of deferred-acceptance (DA) matching algorithms sometimes exhibit errors or changes to the matching inputs that are discovered only after the algorithm has been run and the results are announced to participants. Mitigating the effects of these errors is a different problem than the original match since the decision makers are often constrained by the offers they already sent out. We propose models for this new problem, along with mitigation strategies to go with these models. We explore three different error scenarios: resource reduction, additive errors, and subtractive errors. For each error type, we compute the expected number of students directly harmed, or helped, by the error, the number indirectly harmed or helped, and the number of students with justified envy due to the errors. Error mitigation strategies need to be selected based on the goals of the administrator, which include restoring stability, avoiding direct harm to any participant, and focusing the extra burden on the schools that made the error. We provide empirical simulations of the errors and the mitigation strategies.</description>

      <title>EF1 and EFX Orientations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13616v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the problem of finding fair allocations -- EF1 and EFX -- of indivisible goods with orientations. In an orientation, every agent gets items from their own predetermined set. For EF1, we show that EF1 orientations always exist when agents have monotone valuations, via a pseudopolynomial-time algorithm. This surprisingly positive result is the main contribution of our paper. We complement this result with a comprehensive set of scenarios where our algorithm, or a slight modification of it, finds an EF1 orientation in polynomial time. For EFX, we focus on the recently proposed graph instances, where every agent corresponds to a vertex on a graph and their allowed set of items consists of the edges incident to their vertex. It was shown that finding an EFX orientation is NP-complete in general. We prove that it remains intractable even when the graph has a vertex cover of size 8, or when we have a multigraph with only 10 vertices. We essentially match these strong negative results with a fixed-parameter tractable algorithm that is virtually the best someone could hope for.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Online Fisher Markets: Static Pricing Limits and Adaptive Enhancements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.00825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.00825v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fisher markets are one of the most fundamental models for resource allocation. However, the problem of computing equilibrium prices in Fisher markets typically relies on complete knowledge of users' budgets and utility functions and requires transactions to happen in a static market where all users are present simultaneously. Motivated by these practical considerations, we study an online variant of Fisher markets, wherein users with privately known utility and budget parameters, drawn i.i.d. from a distribution, arrive sequentially. In this setting, we first study the limitations of static pricing algorithms, which set uniform prices for all users, along two performance metrics: (i) regret, i.e., the optimality gap in the objective of the Eisenberg-Gale program between an online algorithm and an oracle with complete information, and (ii) capacity violations, i.e., the over-consumption of goods relative to their capacities. Given the limitations of static pricing, we design adaptive posted-pricing algorithms, one with knowledge of the distribution of users' budget and utility parameters and another that adjusts prices solely based on past observations of user consumption, i.e., revealed preference feedback, with improved performance guarantees. Finally, we present numerical experiments to compare our revealed preference algorithm's performance to several benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Reachability of Fair Allocations via Sequential Exchanges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.07241v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the allocation of indivisible goods, a prominent fairness notion is envy-freeness up to one good (EF1). We initiate the study of reachability problems in fair division by investigating the problem of whether one EF1 allocation can be reached from another EF1 allocation via a sequence of exchanges such that every intermediate allocation is also EF1. We show that two EF1 allocations may not be reachable from each other even in the case of two agents, and deciding their reachability is PSPACE-complete in general. On the other hand, we prove that reachability is guaranteed for two agents with identical or binary utilities as well as for any number of agents with identical binary utilities. We also examine the complexity of deciding whether there is an EF1 exchange sequence that is optimal in the number of exchanges required.</description>

      <title>Learning Optimal Stable Matches in Decentralized Markets with Unknown Preferences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04669v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Matching algorithms have demonstrated great success in several practical applications, but they often require centralized coordination and plentiful information. In many modern online marketplaces, agents must independently seek out and match with another using little to no information. For these kinds of settings, can we design decentralized, limited-information matching algorithms that preserve the desirable properties of standard centralized techniques? In this work, we constructively answer this question in the affirmative. We model a two-sided matching market as a game consisting of two disjoint sets of agents, referred to as proposers and acceptors, each of whom seeks to match with their most preferable partner on the opposite side of the market. However, each proposer has no knowledge of their own preferences, so they must learn their preferences while forming matches in the market. We present a simple online learning rule that guarantees a strong notion of probabilistic convergence to the welfare-maximizing equilibrium of the game, referred to as the proposer-optimal stable match. To the best of our knowledge, this represents the first completely decoupled, communication-free algorithm that guarantees probabilistic convergence to an optimal stable match, irrespective of the structure of the matching market.</description>
