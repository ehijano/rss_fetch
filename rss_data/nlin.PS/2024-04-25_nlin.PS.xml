      <title>Collective lattice excitations in the dynamic route for melting hydrodynamic 2D-crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15912v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Surface stiffnesses engender steady patterns of Faraday waves (FWs), so called hydrodynamic crystals as correspond to ordered wave lattices made of discrete subharmonics under monochromatic driving. Mastering rules are both inertia-imposed parametric resonance for frequency-halving together with rigidity-driven nonlinearity for wavefield self-focusing. They harness the discretization needed for coherent FW-packets to localize in space and time. Collective lattice excitations are observed as dispersionless propagating dislocations that lead periodic modulations arising from explicit symmetry breaking. In a field theory perspective, a halving genesis for the collective distorting modes is revealed as the natural pathway for hydrodynamic crystal melting.</description>

      <title>When discrete fronts and pulses form a single family: FPU chain with hardening-softening springs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.16593v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a version of the classical Hamiltonian FPU (Fermi-Pasta-Ulam) problem with nonlinear force-strain relation in which a hardening response is taken over by a softening regime above a critical strain value. We show that in addition to pulses (solitary waves) this discrete system also supports non-topological and dissipation-free fronts (kinks). Moreover, we demonstrate that these two types of supersonic traveling wave solutions belong to the same family. Within this family, solitary waves exist for continuous ranges of velocity that extend up to a limiting speed corresponding to kinks. As the kink velocity limit is approached from above or below, the solitary waves become progressively more broad and acquire the structure of a kink-antikink bundle. Direct numerical simulations and Floquet analysis of linear stability suggest that all of the obtained solutions are effectively stable. To motivate and support our study of the discrete problem we also analyze a quasicontinuum approximation with temporal dispersion. We show that this model captures the main effects observed in the discrete problem both qualitatively and quantitatively.</description>

      <title>Quenching of stable pulses in slow-fast excitable media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14854v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop linear theory for the prediction of excitation wave quenching--the construction of minimal perturbations which return stable excitations to quiescence--for localized pulse solutions of models of excitable media. The theory requires accounting for an additional degree of freedom in the formulation of the linear theory, and a reconsideration of heuristics for choosing optimal reference states from their group representation. We compare the predictions made with the linear theory to direct numerical simulations across a family of perturbations and assess the accuracy of predictions for models with distinct stable excitation structures. We find that the theory achieves qualitative predictive power with only the effort of distinguishing a root from the asymptotic case, and achieves quantitative predictive power in many circumstances. Finally, we compare the computational cost of our prediction technique to other numerical methods for the determination of transitions in extended excitable systems.</description>
