      <title>Stability conditions of chemical networks in a linear framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14941v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autocatalytic chemical reaction networks can collectively replicate or maintain their constituents despite degradation reactions only above a certain threshold, which we refer to as the decay threshold. When the chemical network has a Jacobian matrix with the Metzler property, we leverage analytical methods developed for Markov processes to show that the decay threshold can be calculated by solving a linear problem, instead of the standard eigenvalue problem. We explore how this decay threshold depends on the network parameters, such as its size, the directionality of the reactions (reversible or irreversible), and its connectivity, then we deduce design principles from this that might be relevant to research on the Origin of Life.</description>

      <title>Systems-Level Analysis of Multisite Protein Phosphorylation: Mathematical Induction, Geometric Series, and Entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15050v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multisite protein phosphorylation plays a pivotal role in regulating cellular signaling and decision-making processes. In this study, we focus on the mathematical underpinnings and informational aspects of sequential, distributive phosphorylation systems. We first provide rigorous steady-state solutions derived using geometric series arguments and formal mathematical induction, demonstrating that the distribution of phosphorylation states follows a geometric progression determined by the kinase-to-phosphatase activity ratio. We then extend the analysis with entropy-based insights, quantifying uncertainty in phosphorylation states and examining the mutual information between kinase activity and phosphorylation levels through a truncated Poisson model. These results highlight how phosphorylation dynamics introduce both structured patterns and inherent signal variability. By combining exact mathematical proofs with entropy analysis, this work clarifies key quantitative features of multisite phosphorylation from a systems-level perspective.</description>

      <title>Autocatalytic cores in the diluted regime:classification and properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autocatalysis underlies the ability of chemical and biochemical systems to replicate. Autocatalysis was recently defined stoichiometrically for reaction networks; five types of minimal autocatalytic networks, termed autocatalytic cores were identified. A necessary and sufficient stoichiometric criterion was later established for dynamical autocatalysis in diluted regimes, ensuring a positive growth rate of autocatalytic species starting from infinitesimal concentrations, given that degradation rates are sufficiently low. Here, we show that minimal autocatalytic networks in the dynamical sense, in the diluted regime, follow the same classification as autocatalytic cores in the stoichiometric sense. We further prove the uniqueness of the stationary regimes of autocatalytic cores, with and without degradation, for all types, except types II with three catalytic loops or more. These results indicate that the stationary point is likely to be robust under perturbation at low concentrations. More complex behaviours are likely to arise by additional non-linear couplings between cores.</description>
