      <title>Bose-Hubbard model in the presence of artificial magnetic fields: Ground state and thermal phase diagrams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11914v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider effects of artificial magnetic fields on the ground state of the two-dimensional Bose-Hubbard model. Using an asymmetric Bose-Hubbard model, we demonstrate that the frustrating hopping energy localizes bosons and enlarges insulators and supersolid borders. We show these increments in the presence of artificial gauge fields up to a symmetric point of the field. Moreover, our calculations exhibit the real space modulations of the superfluid and supersolid phases. The bosonic current exhibits vortices in these phases, which their configurations depend on the commensuration between the magnetic field and the lattice. Although the magnetic field breaks the translational symmetry of the square lattice explicitly, this symmetry is restored in the Mott insulator phase. The filling factor exhibits a checkerboard pattern in the density-wave and supersolid phases, regardless of the magnetic field strength. We explore thermal fluctuations and demonstrate the robustness of insulators and SS phases up to temperatures comparable to the interaction energy, which support the feasibility of observing such phases in experiments.</description>

      <title>Efficient Preparation of Fermionic Superfluids in an Optical Dipole Trap through Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12152v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate a reinforcement learning (RL) based control framework for optimizing evaporative cooling in the preparation of strongly interacting degenerate Fermi gases of Li6. Using a Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) algorithm, the system autonomously explores a high-dimensional parameter space to learn optimal cooling trajectories. Compared to conventional exponential ramps, our method achieves up to 130% improvement in atomic density within a 0.5 second, revealing non-trivial control strategies that balance fast evaporation and thermalization. While our current optimization focuses on the evaporation stage, future integration of other cooling stages, such as grey molasses cooling, could further extend RL to the full preparation pipeline. Our result highlights the promise of RL as a general tool for closed-loop quantum control and automated calibration in complex atomic physics experiments.</description>

      <title>Interacting Bose gases in twisted-bilayer optical lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent experiments have realized ultra-cold gases in twisted-bilayer optical lattices. We show that interacting bosons in these lattices present a highly non-trivial ground-state physics resulting from the interplay between inter- and intra-layer hopping and interactions. This physics is crucially determined by site clusterization, which we properly take into account by developing a specifically-tailored cluster Gutzwiller approach. Clusterization results in a large variety of different Mott-like phases characterized by typically different occupations of the clusters, and in the appearance of pockets of sites in between which particles can freely move, but which remain disconnected from each other. This peculiar phase, which resembles the well-known Bose glass phase, may occur even for commensurate twist angles and is further enhanced when the twisting is incommensurate. Moreover, in the incommensurate case, the formation of mobility islands may occur even without inter-layer hopping solely due to inter-layer interactions.</description>

      <title>\nu-QSSEP: A toy model for entanglement spreading in stochastic diffusive quantum systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11674v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate out-of-equilibrium entanglement dynamics in a generalization of the so-called $QSSEP$ model, which is a free-fermion chain with stochastic in space and time hopping amplitudes. In our setup, the noisy amplitudes are spatially-modulated satisfying a $\nu$-site translation invariance but retaining their randomness in time. For each noise realization, the dynamics preserves Gaussianity, which allows to obtain noise-averaged entanglement-related quantities. The statistics of the steady-state correlators satisfy nontrivial relationships that are of topological nature. They reflect the Haar invariance under multiplication with structured momentum-dependent random $SU(\nu)$ matrices. We discuss in detail the case with $\nu=1$ and $\nu=2$. For $\nu=1$, i.e., spatially homogeneous noise we show that the entanglement dynamics is describable by a stochastic generalization of the quasiparticle picture. Precisely, entanglement is propagated by pairs of quasiparticles. The entanglement content of the pairs is the same as for the deterministic chain. However, the trajectories of the quasiparticles are random walks, giving rise to diffusive entanglement growth.</description>

      <title>Hyperfine van der Waals repulsion between open-shell polar molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12167v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We describe a novel type of interaction between open-shell polar molecules at sub-millikelvin temperatures. This hyperfine van der Waals interaction occurs between two molecules in two rotational states that differ by one quantum. Normally, this induces resonant dipolar interactions that lead to rapid collisional loss. For specific hyperfine states, however, selection rules prevent this. One can effectively turn off the dipolar interaction by merely flipping a nuclear spin. The resulting van der Waals interaction can be repulsive and can suppress collisional loss. We focus on laser-coolable CaF, but show this effect occurs universally for open-shell molecules, including MgF, SrF, BaF and YO. We propose that this effect could be measured by merging molecules in optical tweezers, where flipping a spin in one of the tweezers enables tuning of collision rates by five orders of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Mobility rings in a non-Hermitian non-Abelian quasiperiodic lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12176v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study localization and topological properties in spin-1/2 non-reciprocal Aubry-Andr\'{e} chain with SU(2) non-Abelian artificial gauge fields. The results reveal that, different from the Abelian case, mobility rings, will emerge in the non-Abelian case accompanied by the non-Hermitian topological phase transition. As the non-Hermitian extension of mobility edges, such mobility rings separate Anderson localized eigenstates from extended eigenstates in the complex energy plane under the periodic boundary condition. Based on the topological properties, we obtain the exact expression of the mobility rings. Furthermore, the corresponding indicators such as inverse participation rate, normalized participation ratio, winding number, non-Hermitian spectral structures and wave functions are numerically studied. The numerical results are in good agreement with the analytical expression, which confirms the emergence of mobility rings.</description>

      <title>Vortex to Rotons Transition in Dipolar Bose-Einstein Condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18412v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent experimental advancements enabled the creation of various systems exhibiting superfluid behavior, with one notable achievement being the development of dipolar Bose-Einstein condensates (dBECs). When confined along one or more spatial dimensions, these condensates exhibit a dispersion relation reminiscent of superfluid liquid helium, featuring a roton-like minimum. This study investigates the existence of two-dimensional solitary waves in dBECs characterised by topological defects (quantised vortices) and their transition to vortex-free Jones-Roberts solitons. The explicit connection between solitary waves and roton excitation is demonstrated, supporting Feynman's hypothesis regarding the nature of rotons as fading vortex excitations.</description>

      <title>Vortices in D-dimensional anisotropic Bose-Einstein condensates: dimensional perturbation theory with hypercylindrical symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18355v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate D-dimensional atomic Bose-Einstein condensates in a hypercylindrical trap with a vortex core along the z-axis and quantized circulation $\hbar m$. We analytically approximate the hypercylindrical Gross-Pitaevskii equation using dimensional perturbation theory with perturbation parameter $\delta=1/(D+2|m|-d)$, \textcolor{black}{where $d$ controls the contribution of kinetic energy at zeroth order}. We derive the zeroth-order ($\delta \to 0$) semiclassical approximations for the condensate energy, density, chemical potential, and critical vortex rotation speed in arbitrary dimensions. We investigate the effect of trap anisotropy on lower effective dimensionality and compute properties of vortices in higher dimensions motivated by the study of synthetic dimensions and holographic duality, where a higher-dimensional gravitational model corresponds to a lower-dimensional quantum model. In the zeroth-order approximation, we observe crossings between energy levels for different dimensions as a function of interaction strength and anisotropy parameters.</description>

      <title>Fault-tolerant fermionic quantum computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08955v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Simulating the dynamics of electrons and other fermionic particles in quantum chemistry, materials science, and high-energy physics is one of the most promising applications of fault-tolerant quantum computers. However, the overhead in mapping time evolution under fermionic Hamiltonians to qubit gates renders this endeavor challenging. We introduce fermionic fault-tolerant quantum computing, a framework which removes this overhead altogether. Using native fermionic operations we first construct a repetition code which corrects phase errors only. Within a fermionic color code, which corrects for both phase and loss errors, we then realize a universal fermionic gate set, including transversal fermionic Clifford gates. Interfacing with qubit color codes we introduce qubit-fermion fault-tolerant computation, which allows for qubit-controlled fermionic time evolution, a crucial subroutine in state-of-the-art quantum algorithms. As an application, we consider simulating crystalline materials, finding an exponential improvement in circuit depth for a single time step from $\mathcal{O}(N)$ to $\mathcal{O}(\log(N))$ with respect to lattice site number $N$ while retaining a site count of $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(N)$, implying a linear-in-$N$ end-to-end gate depth for simulating materials, as opposed to quadratic in previous approaches. We also introduce a fermion-inspired qubit algorithm with $O(\mathrm{log}(N)$ depth, but a prohibitive number of additional ancilla qubits. We show how our framework can be implemented in neutral atoms, overcoming the apparent inability of neutral atoms to implement non-number-conserving gates. Our work opens the door to fermion-qubit fault-tolerant quantum computation in platforms with native fermions such as neutral atoms, quantum dots and donors in silicon, with applications in quantum chemistry, material science, and high-energy physics.</description>

      <title>Edge-Edge Correlations without Edge-States: $\eta$-clustering State as Ground State of the Extended Attractive SU(3) Hubbard Chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14724v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the phase diagram of the extended attractive SU($3$) Hubbard chain with two-body hopping and nearest-neighbor attraction at half-filling. In the large on-site attraction limit, we identify three different phases: phase separation (PS), Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid (TLL), and charge density wave (CDW). Our analysis reveals that the $\eta$-clustering state, a three-component generalization of the $\eta$-pairing state, becomes the ground state at the boundary between the PS and TLL phases. On an open chain, this state exhibits an edge-edge correlation, which we call boundary off-diagonal long-range order (bODLRO). Using the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) method, we numerically study the phase diagram of the model with large but finite on-site interactions and find that the numerical results align with those obtained in the strong coupling limit.</description>

      <title>Fine-grained dynamics of entanglement in non-integrable quenches far across the Ising quantum critical point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15203v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The task of exploring and understanding various aspects of far-from-equilibrium dynamics of closed and generic quantum many-body systems has received a thrust of attention in recent years, driven partly by remarkable advances in ultracold experimental technologies. In this work, for the paradigmatic Ising spin chain with transverse and longitudinal fields and partly motivated by the practice of site-resolved control in contemporary ultracold experiments, we present numerical observations of several $\textit{fine-grained}$ (small-subsystem level) features of far-from-equilibrium dynamics from a quantum informational point of view, induced by quantum quenches far across the Ising critical point between states deep inside the para- and ferro-magnetic regimes. Rather featureless dynamics is seen for ferromagnetic to paramagnetic quenches, but paramagnetic to ferromagnetic quenches exhibit rich behaviour, including recurrences of an approximately Page-like dynamics of entanglement entropies of one- and two-spin subsystems, periodic but short-lived occurrences of approximately $1-$uniform states, a series of sudden deaths and revivals of entanglement between two spins in the system's bulk, non-analytic cusps in single-copy entanglement entropy for three-spin and bigger subsystems, insufficient mixedness and a series of scrambling-$\textit{un}$scrambling of local mutual information between neighboring spins. Moreover, essentially indistinguishable dynamics is seen at very early times between the integrable limit (zero longitudinal field) and non-integrable cases, with the former eventually showing signatures of better mixing and faster approach to equilibration than the latter. These features are expected to hold for quench dynamics across Ising quantum critical points in more complicated systems.</description>
