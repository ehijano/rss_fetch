      <title>Free energy fluctuations in SK and related spin glass models: A literature survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the past 50 years, spin glass models have generated a broad range of literature in mathematics, physics, and computer science. There has been much progress in characterizing and proving the limiting free energy of various models, stemming from the original formulas of Parisi. Comparatively less is known about the more detailed topic of free energy fluctuations. This paper concerns a family of models in which there has been considerable progress on fluctuations, namely the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick (SK) and spherical Sherrington-Kirkpatrick (SSK) models, along with their multi-species analogs. We present a survey of the literature on free energy fluctuations in these 2-spin models, discussing results from different temperature regimes, with and without an external field, including results on phase transitions.</description>

      <title>On the Exact Distribution of the Sum of Two CIR Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27081v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper derives the exact transition density and cumulative distribution function of a linear combination of two independent Cox-Ingersoll-Ross (CIR) processes. By combining the Poisson Gamma mixture representation of the noncentral chi-square law with the Kummer type convolution of Gamma densities, we obtain a closed-form analytical expression involving confluent hypergeometric functions. This result extends the classical single-factor CIR transition law to a multifactor framework, providing the first explicit analytical characterization of the sum of two independent CIR diffusions. The proposed density admits stable numerical evaluation and facilitates exact likelihood computation, enabling rigorous parameter estimation in multifactor affine term-structure, stochastic volatility, and credit risk models. Numerical experiments confirm that the analytical density and CDF closely match Monte Carlo simulations across various parameter regimes, demonstrating high accuracy and computational efficiency. Beyond financial mathematics, the derived distribution has potential applications in fields involving interacting mean-reverting processes, such as insurance mathematics, reliability theory, and biophysical modeling</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.27154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work develops, from a functional analytic perspective, the construction of random variables in Lebesgue spaces L^p. It extends classical notions of measurability, integrability, and expectation to L^p valued functions, using Pettis's theorem and the Riesz representation theorem to define the Bochner integral as a natural generalization of classical expectation.</description>

      <title>Regularization by regular noise: a numerical result</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27225v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a singular stochastic equation driven by a regular noise of fractional Brownian type with Hurst index $H \in (1,\infty)\setminus\mathbb{Z}$ and drift coefficient $b \in \mathcal{C}^\alpha$, where $\alpha &gt; 1 - \frac{1}{2H}$. The strong well-posedness of this equation was first established in [Ger23], a phenomenon referred to as regularization by regular noise. In this note, we provide a corresponding numerical analysis. Specifically, we show that the Euler-Maruyama approximation $X^n$ converges strongly to the unique solution $X$ with rate $n^{-1}$. Furthermore, under the additional assumption $b \in \mathcal{C}^1$, we show that $n(X - X^n)$ converges to a non-trivial limit as $n \to \infty$, thereby confirming that the rate $n^{-1}$ is in fact optimal upper bound for this scheme.</description>

      <title>Sample Path Moderate Deviation Principle for Queues with Waiting-time Dependent Interarrival and Service Times</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a single-server queue where interarrival and service times depend linearly and randomly on customer waiting times, and establish a sample-path moderate deviation principle (MDP) for the waiting time process. The waiting times for the queue can be written as a modified Lindley recursion with a random weight coefficient. Under a natural scaling of the random coefficients, we analyze the fluid behavior of the workload process and derive the stable equilibrium point, which can be zero or a positive value. The moderate-deviation-scaled process is centered around the stable equilibrium point and then represented as a linear stochastic differential equation driven by two random walks together with additional asymptotically negligible error terms and possibly a reflection at zero. The rate functions of MDPs in the two scenarios can be characterized explicitly, and they differ in that the case with zero centering term involves the linearly generalized Skorokhod reflection mapping while the case with positive centering term does not (similar to the corresponding diffusion limits). Our analysis involves the MDP for the associated linearly recursive Markov chains, invoking a perturbation of two independent random walks, and employing martingale techniques to prove the asymptotically exponentially vanishing error terms.</description>

      <title>The memory-dependent FPK equation for fractional Gaussian noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27303v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper aims to explore non-Markovian dynamics of nonlinear dynamical systems subjected to fractional Gaussian noise (FGN) and Gaussian white noise (GWN). A novel memory-dependent Fokker-Planck-Kolmogorov (memFPK) equation is developed to characterize the probability structure in such non-Markovian systems. The main challenge in this research comes from the long-memory characteristics of FGN. These features make it impossible to model the FGN-excited nonlinear dynamical systems as finite dimensional GWN-driven Markovian augmented filtering systems, so the classical FPK equation is no longer applicable. To solve this problem, based on fractional Wick-It\^o-Skorohod integral theory, this study first derives the fractional It\^o formula. Then, a memory kernel function is constructed to reflect the long-memory characteristics from FGN. By using fractional It\^o formula and integration by parts, the memFPK equation is established. {Importantly, the proposed memFPK equation is not limited to specific forms of drift and diffusion terms, making it broadly applicable to a wide class of nonlinear dynamical systems subjected to FGN and GWN.} Due to the historical dependence of the memory kernel function, a Volterra adjustable decoupling approximation is used to reconstruct the memory kernel dependence term. This approximation method can effectively solve the memFPK equation, thereby obtaining probabilistic responses of nonlinear dynamical systems subjected to FGN and GWN excitations. Finally, some numerical examples verify the accuracy and effectiveness of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Compound Poisson Approximation for Stochastic Volterra Equations with Singular Kernels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27323v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper establishes the strong convergence of solutions to stochastic differential equations (SDEs) and Volterra-type SDEs when approximated by compound Poisson processes. An explicit rate of convergence is derived. A key advantage of the compound Poisson approach over the classical Euler-Maruyama method is that it does not require the drift coefficient to be continuous in the time variable and can even accommodate singularities. Numerical experiments demonstrate the stability of our approach.</description>

      <title>Bi-martingale optimal transport and its applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27451v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a new non-linear optimal transport formulation for a pair of probability measures on $\mathbb{R}^d$ sharing a common barycentre, in which admissible transference plans satisfy two martingale-type constraints. This bi-martingale framework underlies and interconnects several variational problems on the space of probability measures. For the quadratic cost, it provides an optimal transport interpretation of the second Zolotarev distance on $\mathrm{P}_2(\mathbb{R}^d)$. For a broader class of convex costs, it leads to optimization problems under convex order constraints, encompassing in particular the Zolotarev projection onto the cone of dominating probability measures. As a main application, we construct a $\Gamma$-convergent bi-martingale approximation of the classical martingale optimal transport problem. This scheme robustly accommodates deviations from convex order between the marginal distributions and overcomes the well-known instability of MOT with respect to variations of the marginals in higher dimensions.</description>

      <title>Geodesic switches and exceptional times in dynamical Brownian last passage percolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27589v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider Brownian last passage percolation evolving dynamically via a discrete resampling procedure. Using $\Gamma_{(0,0)}^{(n,n),r}$ to denote a geodesic from $(0,0)$ to $(n,n)$ at time $r$, we prove that the expected total number of coarse-grained changes (or "switches") accumulated by $\Gamma_{(0,0)}^{(n,n),r}$ away from its endpoints during a time interval $[s,t]$ is at most $n^{5/3+o(1)}(t-s)$; we expect the exponent $5/3$ to be tight. Using the above estimate, we establish that the set $\mathscr{T}$ of exceptional times at which a non-trivial bi-infinite geodesic exists a.s. has Hausdorff dimension at most $1/2$. Further, for any fixed direction $\theta$, we show that the set $\mathscr{T}^\theta\subseteq \mathscr{T}$ of times at which a non-trivial bi-infinite geodesic directed along $\theta$ exists a.s. has Hausdorff dimension equal to $0$.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of stochastic oscillator chains with harmonic and FPUT potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26820v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inspired by recent studies on deterministic oscillator models, we introduce a stochastic one-dimensional model for a chain of interacting particles. The model consists of $N$ oscillators performing continuous-time random walks on the integer lattice $\mathbb{Z}$ with exponentially distributed waiting times. The oscillators are bound by confining forces to two particles that do not move, placed at positions $x_0$ and $x_{N+1}$, respectively, and they feel the presence of baths with given inverse temperatures: $\beta_L$ to the left, $\beta_B$ in the middle, and $\beta_R$ to the right. Each particle has an index and interacts with its nearest neighbors in index space through either a quadratic potential or a Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou type coupling. This local interaction in index space can give rise to effective long-range interactions on the spatial lattice, depending on the instantaneous configuration. Particle hopping rates are governed either by the Metropolis rule or by a modified version that breaks detailed balance at the interfaces between regions with different baths.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.27302v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The paper considers the numerical solution of nonlinear integral equations using the Newton-Kantorovich method with the mpmath library. High-precision quadrature of the kernel K(t, s, u) with respect to the variable s for fixed t increases stability and accuracy in problems sensitive to rounding and dispersion. The presented implementation surpasses traditional low-precision methods, especially for strongly nonlinear kernels and stiff regimes, thereby expanding the applicability of the method in scientific and engineering computations.</description>

Abstract: We quantitatively study the mixing rate of randomly shifted alternating shears on the torus. This flow was introduced by Pierrehumbert '94, and was recently shown to be exponentially mixing. In this work, we quantify the dependence of the exponential mixing rate on the flow amplitude. Our approach is based on constructing an explicit Lyapunov function and a coupling trajectory for the associated two-point Markov chain, together with an application of the quantitative Harris theorem.</description>

      <title>Arm exponent for the Gaussian free field on metric graphs in intermediate dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.10030v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the bond percolation model on transient weighted graphs ${G}$ induced by the excursion sets of the Gaussian free field on the corresponding metric graph. We assume that balls in ${G}$ have polynomial volume growth with growth exponent $\alpha $ and that the Green's function for the random on ${G}$ exhibits a power law decay with exponent $\nu $, in the regime $1\leq \nu \leq \frac{\alpha}{2}$. In particular, this includes the cases of ${G}=\mathbb{Z}^{3}$ for which $\nu =1$, and ${G}= \mathbb{Z}^{4}$ for which $\nu =\frac{\alpha}{2}=2$. For all such graphs, we determine the leading-order asymptotic behavior for the critical one-arm probability, which we prove decays with distance $R$, like $R^{-\frac{\nu}{2}+o(1)}$. Our results are, in fact, more precise and yield logarithmic corrections when $\nu &gt;1$ as well as corrections of order $\log \log R$ when $\nu =1$. We further obtain very sharp upper bounds on truncated two-point functions close to criticality, which are new when $\nu &gt;1$ and essentially optimal when $\nu =1$. This extends previous results from arXiv:2101.05801 and arXiv:1807.11117.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the H\"older continuity of solutions to stochastic partial differential equations of the form $\frac{\partial u}{\partial t}=\mathcal{L}u+\sigma(u)\dot{F}$, subject to a suitable initial condition. The noise term $\dot{F}$ is white in time, colored in space, and $\mathcal{L}$ is the $\mathcal{L}^{2}$-generator of a L\'evy process. Under a growth assumption on the characteristic exponent of the L\'{e}vy process, we derive sufficient conditions for the solution to be locally H\"older continuous. Moreover, we show that these conditions are equivalent to those derived in related papers by Khoshnevisan-Sanz-Sol\'e (2023) and Sanz-Sol\'e-Sarr\'a (2000, 20002).</description>

      <title>Graph-Based Product Form</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.13890v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Product-form stationary distributions in Markov chains have been a foundational advance and driving force in our understanding of stochastic systems. In this paper, we introduce a new product-form relationship that we call "graph-based product form". As our first main contribution, we prove that two states of the Markov chain are in graph-based product form if and only if the following two equivalent conditions are satisfied: (i) a cut-based condition, reminiscent of classical results on product-form queueing systems, and (ii) a novel characterization that we call joint-ancestor freeness. The latter characterization allows us in particular to introduce a graph-traversal algorithm that checks product-form relationships for all pairs of states, with time complexity $O(|V|^2 |E|)$, if the Markov chain has a finite transition graph $G = (V, E)$. We then generalize graph-based product form to encompass more complex relationships, which we call "higher-level product form", and we again show these can be identified via a graph-traversal algorithm when the Markov chain has a finite state space. Lastly, we identify several examples from queueing theory that satisfy this product-form relationship.</description>

      <title>Near-existence of bigeodesics in dynamical exponential last passage percolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12293v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is believed that, under very general conditions, bi-infinite geodesics (or bigeodesics) do not exist for planar first and last passage percolation (LPP) models. However, if one endows the model with a natural dynamics, thereby gradually perturbing the geometry, then it is plausible that there could exist a non-trivial set $\mathscr{T}$ of exceptional times at which such bigeodesics exist. For dynamical exponential LPP, we show that $\mathscr{T}$ is "very close" to being non-trivial; namely, we obtain an $\Omega( 1/\log n)$ lower bound on the probability that there exists a random time $t\in [0,1]$ at which a non-trivial geodesic of length $n$ passes through the origin at its midpoint; note that if the above probability were $\Omega(1)$, then it would imply the non-triviality of $\mathscr{T}$. We conjecture that, even if $\mathscr{T}\neq \emptyset$, it a.s. has Hausdorff dimension exactly zero.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.16349v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide an extension of the unbiased simulation method for SDEs developed in Henry-Labordere et al. [Ann Appl Probab. 27:6 (2017) 1-37] to a class of path-dependent dynamics, pertaining for Asian options. In our setting, both the payoff and the SDE's coefficients depend on the (weighted) average of the process or, more precisely, on the integral of the solution to the SDE against a continuous function with bounded variations. In particular, this applies to the numerical resolution of the class of path-dependent PDEs whose regularity, in the sens of Dupire, is studied in Bouchard and Tan [Ann. I.H.P., to appear].</description>

      <title>Large Deviation Principle for Last Passage Percolation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17172v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Study of the KPZ universality class has seen the emergence of universal objects over the past decade which arise as the scaling limit of the member models. One such object is the directed landscape, and it is known that exactly solvable last passage percolation (LPP) models converge to the directed landscape under the KPZ scaling (see \cite{DV21}). Large deviations of the directed landscape on the metric level were recently studied in \cite{DDV24}, which also provides a general framework for establishing such large deviation principle (LDP). The main goal of the article is to apply and refine that framework to establish a LDP for LPP models at the metric level without relying on exact solvability. We then use the LDP on the metric level to establish a LDP for geodesics in these models, thus providing a streamlined way to study large transversal fluctuations of geodesics in these models. We briefly touch on how the theory extends to other planar models like directed polymers and Poisson LPP.</description>

      <title>New Sufficient Conditions for Moment-determinacy via Probability Density Tails</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05615v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One of the ways to characterize a probability distribution is to show that it is moment-determinate, uniquely determined by knowing all its moments. The uniqueness, in the absolutely continuous case, depends entirely on the behaviour of the tails of the density function f. We find and exploit a condition, (D), in terms only of f which is of a `general' form and easy to check. Condition (D), showing the `speed' for f to tend to zero, is sufficient to conclude the moment determinacy. We establish a series of theorems and corollaries in both Stieltjes and Hamburger cases and provide an interesting illustrative example. The results in this paper are either new or extend some recently published results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.03922v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a long-range percolation model on homogeneous oriented trees with several lengths. We obtain the critical surface as the set of zeros of a specific polynomial with coefficients depending explicitly on the lengths and the degree of the tree. Restricting to the case of two lengths, we obtain new bounds on the critical parameters, monotonicity properties, as well as continuity of the critical curve, plus some partial results concerning its convexity. Our proofs rely on the study of the properties of the characteristic polynomial of the transition matrix of a multi-step Markov chain related to the model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.25019v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish conformal invariance of Ising spin correlations on critical doubly periodic graphs, showing that their scaling limit coincides with that of the critical square lattice, as originally proved by Chelkak, Hongler and Izyurov. To overcome the absence of integrability and quantitative full plane constructions in the periodic setting, we combine discrete analytic tools with random cluster methods. This result completes the universality picture for periodic lattices, whose criticality condition was identified by Cimasoni and Duminil-Copin and whose conformal structure and interface convergence were obtained by Chelkak.</description>

      <title>On the instability of local learning algorithms: Q-learning can fail in infinite state spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25572v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the challenges of applying model-free reinforcement learning algorithms, like online Q-learning, to infinite state space Markov Decision Processes (MDPs). We first introduce the notion of Local Learning Processes (LLPs), where agents make decisions based solely on local information, and we show that Q-learning can be seen as a specific instance of an LLP. Using renewal techniques, we analyze LLPs and demonstrate their instability under certain drift and initial conditions, revealing fundamental limitations in infinite state spaces. In particular, we show that while asymptotically optimal in finite settings, Q-learning can face instability and strict sub-optimality in infinite spaces. Our findings are illustrated through queueing system examples drawn from load balancing and server allocation. The study underscores the need for new theoretical frameworks and suggests future research into nonlocal Q-learning variants.</description>

      <title>Random Systems of Holomorphic Sections of a Sequence of Line bundles on Compact K\"{a}hler Manifolds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.08243v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper primarily establishes an asymptotic variance estimate for smooth linear statistics associated with zero sets of systems of random holomorphic sections in a sequence of positive Hermitian holomorphic line bundles on a compact K\"ahler manifold $(X, \omega)$ in a general non-Gaussian setting. Using this variance estimate and the expected distribution, we derive an equidistribution result for zeros of these random systems, which proves that the smooth positive closed form $\omega^{k}$ can be approximated by currents of integration along analytic subsets of $X$ of codimension $k$, $k \in \{1, \ldots, n\}$. The probability measures taken into consideration in this paper are sufficiently general to include a wide range of the measures commonly encountered in the literature, for which we give equidistribution results at the end, such as the standard Gaussian measure, Fubini-Study measure, the area measure of spheres, probability measures whose distributions have bounded densities with logarithmic decaying tails and locally moderate measures among others.</description>

      <title>Moderate Deviations of Triangle Counts in the Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi Random Graph $G(n,m)$: The Lower Tail</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13792v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $N_{\triangle}(G)$ be the number of triangles in a graph $G$. In [14] and [25] (respectively) the following bounds were proved on the lower tail behaviour of triangle counts in the dense Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random graphs $G_m\sim G(n,m)$:
  \[ \mathbb{P}\big(N_{\triangle}(G_m) \, &lt; \, (1-\delta)\mathbb{E}[N_{\triangle}(G_m)]\big) \,=\,
  \exp\left(-\Theta\left(\delta^2n^3\right)\right) \qquad \text{if $n^{-3/2}\ll \delta\ll n^{-1}$} \] and \[
  \mathbb{P}\big(N_{\triangle}(G_m) \, &lt; \, (1-\delta)\mathbb{E}[N_{\triangle}(G_m)]\big) \,=\,
  \exp\left(-\Theta(\delta^{2/3}n^2) \right) \qquad \text{if $n^{-3/4} \ll \delta \ll 1$.}
  \]
  Neeman, Radin and Sadun [25] also conjectured that the probability should be of the form $\exp\left(-\Theta\left(\delta^2n^3\right)\right)$ in the "missing interval" $n^{-1}\ll \delta\ll n^{-3/4}$. We prove this conjecture.
  As part of our proof we also prove that some random graph statistics, related to degrees and codegrees, are normally distributed with high probability.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.02721v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study weakly interacting diffusion processes on random graphs. Our main focus is on the properties of the mean-field limit and, in particular, on the nonuniqueness and bifurcation structure of stationary states. By extending classical bifurcation analysis to include multichromatic interaction potentials and random graph structures, we explicitly identify bifurcation points and relate them to the spectral properties of the graphon integral operator. In addition, we develop a self-consistency formulation of stationary states that recovers the primary critical threshold and reveals secondary bifurcations along non-uniform branches. Furthermore, we characterize the resulting McKean-Vlasov PDE as a gradient flow with respect to a suitable metric. In addition, we provide strong evidence that (minus) the interaction energy of the interacting particle system serves as a natural order parameter. In particular, beyond the transition point and for multichromatic interactions, we observe an energy cascade that is strongly linked to dynamical metastability.</description>

      <title>Finite $N$ precursors of the free cumulants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21483v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study $\mathrm{U}(N)$ invariant polynomials on the space of $N\times N$ matrices first introduced by Capitaine and Casalis, that are precursors of free cumulants in various respects. First, they are polynomials of deterministic matrices, that are not yet evaluated over some probability law, contrary to what is usually meant by cumulants. Secondly, they converge towards the algebraic expression of free cumulants in terms of moments as $N\to \infty$, with $1/N^2$ corrections expressed in terms of monotone Hurwitz numbers. Their most crucial property is their additivity with respect to averaging over sums of $\mathrm{U}(N)$ conjugacy orbits, providing a finite $N$ version of the well-known additivity of free cumulants in free probability. Finally, they extend several properties of free cumulants at finite $N$, including a Wick rule for their average over a Gaussian weight and their appearance in various matrix integrals. Building on the additivity property of these precursors, we also define and compute a coproduct describing the behaviour of general invariant polynomials with respect to the addition of $\mathrm{U}(N)$ conjugacy orbits, as well as their expectation values on sums of $\mathrm{U}(N)$-invariant random matrices. In our construction, a central role is played by the so-called HCIZ integral, both for the definition of the precursors and for the derivation of their properties.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.01301v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the occurrence of additive and multiplicative structures in random subsets of the natural numbers. Specifically, for a Bernoulli random subset of $\mathbb{N}$ where each integer is included independently with probability $p\in (0,1)$, we prove that almost surely such a set contains finite sumsets (FS-sets) and finite product sets (FP-sets) of every finite length. In addition, we establish a novel connection between Hindman's partition theorem and the central limit theorem, providing a probabilistic perspective on the asymptotic Gaussian behavior of monochromatic finite sums and products. These results can be interpreted as probabilistic analogues of finite-dimensional versions of Hindman's theorem. Applications, implications, and open questions related to infinite FS-sets and FP-sets are discussed.</description>

      <title>Demystifying MaskGIT Sampler and Beyond: Adaptive Order Selection in Masked Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04525v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Masked diffusion models have shown promising performance in generating high-quality samples in a wide range of domains, but accelerating their sampling process remains relatively underexplored. To investigate efficient samplers for masked diffusion, this paper theoretically analyzes the MaskGIT sampler for image modeling, revealing its implicit temperature sampling mechanism. Through this analysis, we introduce the "moment sampler," an asymptotically equivalent but more tractable and interpretable alternative to MaskGIT, which employs a "choose-then-sample" approach by selecting unmasking positions before sampling tokens. In addition, we improve the efficiency of choose-then-sample algorithms through two key innovations: a partial caching technique for transformers that approximates longer sampling trajectories without proportional computational cost, and a hybrid approach formalizing the exploration-exploitation trade-off in adaptive unmasking. Experiments in image and text domains demonstrate our theory as well as the efficiency of our proposed methods, advancing both theoretical understanding and practical implementation of masked diffusion samplers.</description>
