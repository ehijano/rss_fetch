      <title>Clear Messages, Ambiguous Audiences: Measuring Interpretability in Political Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20912v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Text-based measurement in political research often treats classi6ication disagreement as random noise. We examine this assumption using con6idence-weighted human annotations of 5,000 social media messages by U.S. politicians. We 6ind that political communication is generally highly legible, with mean con6idence exceeding 0.99 across message type, partisan bias, and audience classi6ications. However, systematic variation concentrates in the constituency category, which exhibits a 1.79 percentage point penalty in audience classi6ication con6idence. Given the high baseline of agreement, this penalty represents a sharp relative increase in interpretive uncertainty. Within messages, intent remains clear while audience targeting becomes ambiguous. These patterns persist with politician 6ixed effects, suggesting that measurement error in political text is structured by strategic incentives rather than idiosyncratic coder error.</description>

      <title>The Effects of Higher Education on Midlife Depression: Quasi-Experimental Evidence from South Korea</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20976v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Higher education has expanded worldwide, with women outpacing men in many regions. While educational attainment is consistently linked to better physical health, its mental health effects - particularly for women - remain underexplored, and causal evidence is limited. We estimate the impact of college completion on depression among middle-aged women in South Korea, leveraging the 1993 higher education reform, which raised women's college attainment by 45 percentage points (pp) over the following decade. We use two nationally representative datasets to triangulate evidence, including the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (KNHANES, 2007-2021) for physician-diagnosed depression, and the Korean Longitudinal Survey of Women and Families (KLoWF, 2007-2022) to validate findings using self-reports of depressive symptoms. We implement two-stage least squares (2SLS) with a birth-cohort instrument based on exposure to the reform (within 3 years of the cutoff in KNHANES and within 1 to 3 years in KLoWF). In KNHANES, college completion lowers physician-diagnosed depression by 2.4 pp, attenuating to 1.6 pp after adjusting for income, employment, and physical health. In KLoWF, college completion improves self-reported mental health. The weekly depressive-symptoms composite declines by 17.4 pp, attenuating to 16.4 pp after covariate adjustment. Placebo tests on unaffected cohorts yield null results. This study contributes to the growing quasi-experimental literature on education and mental health with convergent evidence across clinical diagnoses and self-reported depressive symptoms in South Korea. By focusing on college education in a non-Western setting, it extends the external validity of existing findings and highlights educational policy as a potential lever to reduce the burden of midlife depression among women.</description>

      <title>Electoral Polls and Economic Uncertainty: an Analysis of the Last Two U.S. Presidential Elections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21534v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper examines the dynamic relationship between electoral polls and indicators of economic and financial uncertainty during the last two U.S. presidential elections (2020 and 2024). Using daily polling data on Donald Trump and measures such as the Aruoba-Diebold-Scotti Business Conditions Index, the 5-year Breakeven Inflation Rate, the Trade Policy Uncertainty index, and the VIX, we estimate conditional correlation models to capture time-varying interactions. The analysis reveals that in 2020, correlations between polls and uncertainty measures were highly dynamic and event-driven, reflecting the influence of exogenous shocks (COVID-19, oil price collapse) and political milestones (primaries, debates). In contrast, during the 2024 campaign, correlations remained close to zero, stable, and largely unresponsive to shocks, suggesting that entrenched polarization and non-economic events (e.g., assassination attempt, candidate changes) muted the economic channel. The study highlights how the interplay between voter sentiment, financial markets, and uncertainty varies across electoral contexts, offering a methodological contribution through the application of Dynamic Conditional Correlation models to political data and policy-relevant insights on the conditions under which economic fundamentals influence electoral dynamics.</description>

      <title>The Latin Monetary Union and Trade: A Closer Look</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25487v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper reexamines the effects of the Latin Monetary Union (LMU) - a 19th century agreement among several European countries to standardize their currencies through a bimetallic system based on fixed gold and silver content - on trade. Unlike previous studies, this paper adopts the latest advances in gravity modeling and a more rigorous approach to defining the control group by accounting for the diversity of currency regimes during the early years of the LMU. My findings suggest that the LMU had a positive effect on trade between its members until the early 1870s, when bimetallism was still considered a viable monetary system. These effects then faded, converging to zero. Results are robust to the inclusion of additional potential confounders, the use of various samples spanning different countries and trade data sources, and alternative methodological choices.</description>

      <title>How Disruptive is Financial Technology?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14071v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study whether Fintech disrupts the banking sector by intensifying competition for scarce deposits funds and raising deposit rates. Using difference-in-difference estimation around the exogenous removal of marketplace platform investing restrictions by US states, we show the cost of deposits increase by approximately 11.5% within small financial institutions. However, these price changes are effective in preventing a drain of liquidity. Size and geographical diversification through branch networks can mitigate the effects of Fintech competition by sourcing deposits from less competitive markets. The findings highlight the unintended consequences of the growing Fintech sector on banks and offer policy insights for regulators and managers into the ongoing development and impact of technology on the banking sector.</description>

      <title>Normative Equivalence in Human-AI Cooperation: Behaviour, Not Identity, Drives Cooperation in Mixed-Agent Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20487v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The introduction of artificial intelligence (AI) agents into human group settings raises essential questions about how these novel participants influence cooperative social norms. While previous studies on human-AI cooperation have primarily focused on dyadic interactions, little is known about how integrating AI agents affects the emergence and maintenance of cooperative norms in small groups. This study addresses this gap through an online experiment using a repeated four-player Public Goods Game (PGG). Each group consisted of three human participants and one bot, which was framed either as human or AI and followed one of three predefined decision strategies: unconditional cooperation, conditional cooperation, or free-riding. In our sample of 236 participants, we found that reciprocal group dynamics and behavioural inertia primarily drove cooperation. These normative mechanisms operated identically across conditions, resulting in cooperation levels that did not differ significantly between human and AI labels. Furthermore, we found no evidence of differences in norm persistence in a follow-up Prisoner's Dilemma, or in participants' normative perceptions. Participants' behaviour followed the same normative logic across human and AI conditions, indicating that cooperation depended on group behaviour rather than partner identity. This supports a pattern of normative equivalence, in which the mechanisms that sustain cooperation function similarly in mixed human-AI and all human groups. These findings suggest that cooperative norms are flexible enough to extend to artificial agents, blurring the boundary between humans and AI in collective decision-making.</description>
