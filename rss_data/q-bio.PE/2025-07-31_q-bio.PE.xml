      <title>Determining disease attributes from epidemic trajectories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22087v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Effective public health decisions require early reliable inference of the infectious disease properties. In this paper we assess the ability to infer infectious disease attributes from population-level stochastic epidemic trajectories. In particular, we construct stochastic Kermack-McKendrick model trajectories, sample them with and without measurement error, and evaluate inversions for the population mean infectiousness as a function of time since infection, the infection duration distribution, and its complementary cumulative distribution, the infection survival distribution. Based on an integro-differential equation formulation we employ a natural regression approach to fit the corresponding integral kernels and show that these disease attributes are recoverable from both un-regularized multi-trajectory inversions and regularized single trajectory inversions. Moreover, we demonstrate that the infection duration distributions (or alternatively the infection survival distributions) and population mean infectiousness kernels recovered can be used to solve for the individual infectiousness profile, the infectiousness of an individual over the duration of their infection. The work suggests that, aggressive monitoring of the stochastic evolution of a novel infectious disease outbreak in a single local well-mixed population can allow determination of the underlying disease attributes that characterize its spread.</description>

      <title>Self-organized biodiversity and species abundance distribution patterns in ecosystems with higher-order interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22287v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Explaining the emergence of self-organized biodiversity and species abundance distribution patterns remians a fundamental challenge in ecology. While classical frameworks, such as neutral theory and models based on pairwise species interactions, have provided valuable insights, they often neglect higher-order interactions (HOIs), whose role in stabilizing ecological communities is increasingly recognized. Here, we extend the Generalized Lotka-Volterra framework to incorporate HOIs and demonstrate that these interactions can enhance ecosystem stability and prevent collapse. Our model exhibits a diverse range of emergent dynamics, including self-sustained oscillations, quasi-periodic (torus) trajectories, and intermittent chaos. Remarkably, it also reproduces empirical species abundance distributions observed across diverse natural communities. These results underscore the critical role of HOIs in structuring biodiversity and offer a broadly applicable theoretical framework for capturing complexity in ecological systems</description>

      <title>Spatiodynamic inference using vision-based generative modelling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22256v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Biological systems commonly exhibit complex spatiotemporal patterns whose underlying generative mechanisms pose a significant analytical challenge. Traditional approaches to spatiodynamic inference rely on dimensionality reduction through summary statistics, which sacrifice complexity and interdependent structure intrinsic to these data in favor of parameter identifiability. This imposes a fundamental constraint on reliably extracting mechanistic insights from spatiotemporal data, highlighting the need for analytical frameworks that preserve the full richness of these dynamical systems. To address this, we developed a simulation-based inference framework that employs vision transformer-driven variational encoding to generate compact representations of the data, exploiting the inherent contextual dependencies. These representations are subsequently integrated into a likelihood-free Bayesian approach for parameter inference. The central idea is to construct a fine-grained, structured mesh of latent representations from simulated dynamics through systematic exploration of the parameter space. This encoded mesh of latent embeddings then serves as a reference map for retrieving parameter values that correspond to observed data. By integrating generative modeling with Bayesian principles, our approach provides a unified inference framework to identify both spatial and temporal patterns that manifest in multivariate dynamical systems.</description>

      <title>A hybrid framework for compartmental models enabling simulation-based inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13239v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multi-scale systems often exhibit a combination of stochastic and deterministic dynamics. In compartmental models, low occupancy compartments tend to exhibit stochastic dynamics while high occupancy compartments tend to follow deterministic dynamics. Representing both dynamics with existing methods is challenging. Failing to account for stochasticity in small populations can produce ``atto-foxes'', for example in the Lotka-Volterra ordinary differential equation (ODE) model. This limitation becomes problematic when studying the extinction of species or the clearance of infection, but it can be overcome by using discrete stochastic models, such as continuous time Markov chains (CTMCs). Unfortunately, simulating CTMCs is impractical for many realistic models, where discrete events have very high frequencies.
  In this work, we develop a novel mathematical framework to couple continuous ODEs and discrete CTMCs: ``Jump-Switch-Flow'' (JSF). In this framework, compartments can reach extinct states (``absorbing states''), thereby resolving atto-fox-type problems. JSF has the desired behaviours of exact CTMC simulation, but is substantially computationally faster than existing alternatives, by at least one order of magnitude, and can even obtain constant scaling, irrespective of compartment occupancy.
  We demonstrate JSF's utility for simulation-based inference, particularly multi-scale problems, with several case-studies. In a simulation study, we demonstrate how JSF can enable a more nuanced analysis of the efficacy of public health interventions. We also carry out a novel analysis of longitudinal within-host data from SARS-CoV-2 infections to quantify the timing of viral clearance. In this work, we show how JSF offers a novel approach to compartmental model simulation.</description>

      <title>An age-structured diffusive model for epidemic modelling: Lie symmetries and exact solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08083v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A new age-structured diffusive model for the mathematical modelling of epidemics is suggested. The model can be considered as a generalization of two models suggested earlier for the same purposes. The Lie symmetry classification of the model is derived. It is shown that the model admits an infinite-dimensional Lie algebra of invariance. Using the Lie symmetries, exact solutions, in particular those of the travelling wave types and in terms of special functions, are constructed. An example of application of the correctly-specified exact solution for calculation of total numbers of infected individuals during an epidemic is presented.</description>

      <title>Metaconcepts of rooted tree balance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08614v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Measures of tree balance play an important role in many different research areas such as mathematical phylogenetics or theoretical computer science. Typically, tree balance is quantified by a single number which is assigned to the tree by a balance or imbalance index, of which several exist in the literature. Most of these indices are based on structural aspects of tree shape, such as clade sizes or leaf depths. For instance, indices like the Sackin index, total cophenetic index, and $\widehat{s}$-shape statistic all quantify tree balance through clade sizes, albeit with different definitions and properties.
  In this paper, we formalize the idea that many tree (im)balance indices are functions of similar underlying tree shape characteristics by introducing metaconcepts of tree balance. A metaconcept is a function $\Phi_f$ that depends on a function $f$ capturing some aspect of tree shape, such as balance values, clade sizes, or leaf depths. These metaconcepts encompass existing indices but also provide new means of measuring tree balance. The versatility and generality of metaconcepts allow for the systematic study of entire families of (im)balance indices, providing deeper insights that extend beyond index-by-index analysis.</description>
