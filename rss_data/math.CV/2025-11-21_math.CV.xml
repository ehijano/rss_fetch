      <title>Subtlety of oscillation indices of oscillatory integrals of real analytic functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16257v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a locally defined real analytic function, we study the relation between the oscillation index of oscillatory integrals and the real log canonical threshold. The former is always negative, and its absolute value is greater than or equal to the latter. They coincide very often, but there are certain exceptional cases even in the Newton nondegenerate convenient homogeneous case where the number of variables is even and smaller than the degree.</description>

      <title>On the Injectivity of STFT Phase Retrieval with super-exponential decaying window function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15894v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the uniqueness of short-time Fourier transform phase retrieval problems in $L^2(\mathbb{R})$. In particular, for underlying window functions whose Fourier transform decay faster than any exponential function, we derive sufficient conditions on discrete sampling sets for unique phase retrieval from the spectrogram. This result generalizes previous uniqueness guarantees on sampling sets for Gaussian windows.</description>

      <title>Nilpotent Holomorphic Foliations on $(\mathbb{C}^n,\mathbf{0})$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15924v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study nilpotent holomorphic foliations in complex dimension $n+1$, at the origin, defined by germs of integrable 1-forms whose linear part is given by \(zdz\). These foliations generalize the classical nilpotent foliations in dimension two. We show that every nilpotent foliation in higher dimensions can be described as the pullback of Takens' normal form, which naturally leads to the existence of cuspidal hypersurfaces as invariant sets.
  We focus on the case where the separatrix is a quasi-ordinary cuspidal hypersurface, and we provide a characterization of those foliations that are of generalized hypersurface type. Furthermore, we recall the Newton polyhedron of a foliation and prove that, for foliations with a quasi-ordinary cuspidal separatrix, being of generalized hypersurface type is equivalent to the coincidence of the Newton polyhedra of the foliation and its separatrix. This provides a new criterion that extends previous results studied by Fern\'andez-S\'anchez and J. Mozo (2006), and later partially generalized by the second-named author.</description>

      <title>Existence and uniqueness of the conformally covariant geodesic metric on simple conformal loop ensemble carpets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16208v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that for each $\kappa \in (8/3, 4)$ there exists a geodesic metric on the carpet of a CLE$_\kappa$ which is canonical in the sense that it is characterized by a certain list of axioms. Our metric can be constructed explicitly as the scaling limit of Minkowski first passage percolation (MFPP), i.e., the metric obtained by taking the infimum of the Lebesgue measure of the $\varepsilon$-neighborhood of all paths connecting each pair of points. Earlier work by the first co-author showed that MFPP admits nontrivial subsequential limits. The present paper shows that this subsequential limit is unique and is characterized by our list of axioms. We conjecture that our metric describes the scaling limit of the chemical distance metric for discrete loop models that converge to CLE$_\kappa$ for $\kappa \in (8/3, 4)$ in the scaling limit, e.g., the critical Ising model for $\kappa=3$. Our argument is inspired by recent works of Gwynne and Miller and Ding and Gwynne on the uniqueness of Liouville quantum gravity metrics.</description>

      <title>On the Bergman Kernel of hyperbolic Riemann surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16240v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove an exact formula for the Bergman kernel function of hyperbolic Riemann surfaces either of finite topology or of positive injectivity radius. The formula involves summation over all geodesic loops based at a point, which has a striking analogy with the Selberg trace formula. As an application, we prove a result about the maximum and minimum of the Bergman kernel function. We also prove an estimate of the off-diagonal Bergman kernel.</description>

      <title>Infinite Ideal Polyhedra in Hyperbolic 3-Space: Existence and Rigidity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19528v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the seminal work [27], Rivin obtained a complete characterization of finite ideal polyhedra in hyperbolic 3-space by the exterior dihedral angles. Since then,the characterization of infinite hyperbolic polyhedra has become an extremely challenging open problem. By studying ideal circle patterns (ICPs), we characterize the infinite ideal polyhedra (IIP) and resolve this problem. Specifically, we establish the existence and rigidity of embedded ICPs on the plane. We further prove the uniformization theorem for the embedded ICPs, which solves the type problem of infinite ICPs. This is an analog of the uniformization theorem obtained by He and Schramm in [22, 23]. Moreover, we demonstrate that, unlike He-Schramm's work, the type theory for infinite ICPs depends not only on the structure of the cellular decomposition but also on the selection of intersection angles. In fact, we construct Example 4.13 to show the difference. Consequently, we obtain the existence and rigidity of IIP with prescribed exterior angles. Due to the example, our results on the type problem of infinite ICPs and the existence of IIP are sharp. For ICPs with arbitrary angles, our example also demonstrates that the VEL-parabolicity and ICP-parabolicity are not equivalent (while in He and Schramm's settings, VEL-parabolicity and CP-parabolicity are equivalent), indicating that our setting is extremely distinct from He and Schramm's. To prove our results, we develop a uniform Ring Lemma via the technique of pointed Gromov-Hausdorff convergence for ICPs.</description>
