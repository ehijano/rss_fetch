      <title>Gauge-invariant projector calculus for quantum state geometry and applications to observables in crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The importance of simple geometrical invariants, such as the Berry curvature and quantum metric, constructed from the Bloch states of a crystal has become well-established over four decades of research. More complex aspects of geometry emerge in properties linking multiple bands, such as optical responses. In the companion work [arXiv:2409.16358], we identified novel multi-state geometrical invariants using an explicitly gauge-invariant formalism based on projection operators, which we used to clarify the relation between the shift current and the theory of electronic polarization among other advancements for second-order non-linear optics. Here, we provide considerably more detail on the projector formalism and the geometrical invariants arising in the vicinity of a specific value of crystal momentum. We combine the introduction to multi-state quantum geometry with broadly relevant algebraic relationships and detailed example calculations, enabling extensions toward future applications to topological and geometrical properties of insulators and metals.</description>

      <title>Itinerant Ferromagnetism from One-Dimensional Mobility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03638v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a universal kinetic mechanism for a half-metallic ferromagnet -- a metallic state with full spin polarization -- arising from strong on-site Coulomb repulsions between particles that exhibit constrained one-dimensional (1D) dynamics. We illustrate the mechanism in the context of a solvable model on a Lieb lattice in which doped electrons have 1D mobility. Such 1D motion is shown to induce only multi-spin ring exchanges of even parity, which mediate ferromagnetism and result in a unique half-metallic ground state. In contrast to the Nagaoka mechanism of ferromagnetism, this result pertains to any doped electron density in the {\it thermodynamic} limit. We explore various microscopic routes to such (approximate) 1D dynamics, highlighting two examples: doped holes in the strong-coupling limit of the Emery model and vacancies in a two-dimensional Wigner crystal. Finally, we demonstrate an intriguing exact equivalence between the bosonic and fermionic versions of these models, which implies a novel mechanism for the conjectured Bose metallic phase.</description>

      <title>A solvable model for strongly interacting nonequilibrium excitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03641v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the driven-dissipative Bose-Hubbard model with all-to-all hopping and subject to incoherent pumping and decay, as is naturally probed in several recent experiments on excitons in WS2/WSe2 moir\'e systems, as well as quantum simulators. By positing a particular form of coupling to the environment, we derive the Lindblad jump operators and show that, in certain limits, the system admits a closed-form expression for the steady-state density matrix. Away from the exactly solvable regions, the steady-state can be obtained numerically for 100s-1000s of sites. We study the nonequilibrium phase diagram and phase transitions, which qualitatively matches the equilibrium phase diagram, agreeing with the intuition that increasing the intensity of the light is equivalent to changing the bosonic chemical potential. However, the steady-states are far from thermal states and the nature of the phase transitions is changed.</description>

      <title>Phase Diagram of the Easy-Axis Triangular-Lattice $J_1\!-\!J_2$ Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03648v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The phase diagram of the $S\!=\!1/2$ easy-axis triangular-lattice $J_1\!-\!J_2$ model is investigated using the density-matrix renormalization group and analytical insights. We find a significant spin-liquid region extending from the Heisenberg limit and residing between the Y phase-known as the magnetic analogue of the "supersolid"-and collinear stripe phase. The order parameters of the supersolid are analyzed and an understanding of its lack of ferromagnetic moment is suggested.</description>

      <title>Long-lived population inversion in resonantly driven excitonic antiferromagnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03705v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Van der Waals magnets are an emerging material family for investigating light-matter interactions and spin-correlated excitations. Here, we report the discovery of a photo-induced state with a lifetime of 17 ps in the van der Waals antiferromagnet NiPS$_3$, which appears exclusively with resonant pumping at 1.476 eV in the antiferromagnetic state. The long-lived state comes with a negative photoconductivity, a characteristic optical response of population inversion. Our findings demonstrate a promising pathway to potentially achieve long-lived lasing at terahertz frequencies in reduced dimensions.</description>

      <title>Signatures of Floquet Engineering in the proximal Kitaev Quantum Spin Liquid H$_3$LiIr$_2$O$_6$ by tr-RIXS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03777v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first circularly polarized Floquet engineering time-resolved Resonant Inelastic X-ray Scattering (tr-RIXS) experiment in H$_3$LiIr$_2$O$_6$, an iridium-based Kitaev system. Our calculations and experimental results are consistent with the modification of the low energy magnetic excitations in H$_3$LiIr$_2$O$_6$ only during illumination by the laser pulse, consistent with the Floquet engineering of the exchange interactions. However, the penetration length mismatch between the X-ray probe and laser pump and the intrinsic complexity of Kitaev magnets prevented us from unequivocally extracting towards which ground H$_3$LiIr$_2$O$_6$ was driven. We outline possible solutions to these challenges for Floquet stabilization and observation of the Kitaev Quantum Spin Liquid limit by RIXS.</description>

      <title>Nonuniform Parafermion Chains: Low-Energy Physics and Finite-Size Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The nonuniform $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetric Kitaev chain, comprising alternating topological and normal regions, hosts localized states known as edge-zero modes (EZMs) at its interfaces. These EZMs can pair to form qubits that are resilient to quantum decoherence, a feature expected to extend to higher symmetric chains, i.e., parafermion chains. However, finite-size effects may impact this ideal picture. Diagnosing these effects requires first a thorough understanding of the low-energy physics where EZMs may emerge. Previous studies have largely focused on uniform chains, with nonuniform cases inferred from these results. While recent work [Narozhny, Sci. Rep. 7, 1447 (2017)] provides an insightful analytical solution for a nonuniform $\mathbb{Z}_2$ chain with two topological regions separated by a normal one, its complexity limits its applicability to chains with more regions or higher symmetries. Here, we present a new approach based on decimating the highest-energy terms, facilitating the scalable analysis of $\mathbb{Z}_n$ chains with any number of regions. We provide analytical results for both $\mathbb{Z}_2$ and$\mathbb{Z}_3$ chains, supported by numerical findings, and identify the critical lengths necessary to preserve well-separated EZMs.</description>

      <title>Hubbard Model on the Honeycomb Lattice with an Indefinite Long-Range Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03794v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Several studies have emphasized the impact of long-range Coulomb interactions in lattice fermions, yet conventional Auxiliary Field Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) methods face limitations due to their reliance on positive definite interaction matrices. We address this by decomposing the interaction matrix into positive- and negative-definite components, allowing for QMC calculations with manageable sign properties. This technique enables effective simulations on large lattices. Applying it to a honeycomb lattice with an indefinite interaction matrix, we identify a semi-metal to charge density wave phase transition within the Gross-Neveu criticality class. Notably, the phase transition boundary aligns with regions where the average sign sharply decreases, providing new evidence to the increasingly compelling research on the relationship between phase transitions and the sign problem.</description>

      <title>Topological Aspects of Dirac Fermions in a Kagom\'e Lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Dirac fermion with linear dispersion in the kagom\'e lattice governs the low-energy physics of different valleys at two inequivalent corners of hexagonal Brillouin zone. The effective Hamiltonian based on the cyclic permutation symmetry of sublattices is constructed to show that the topology of Dirac fermions at these two valleys is characterized by opposite winding numbers. For spinless fermions, the Dirac semimetal phase is unstable against the many-particle interactions due to the intervalley scattering, which spontaneously breaks the translation symmetry. The Dirac fermions acquire a mass term from the simultaneous charge and bond orderings. In this phase, the developed bond texture underlies a hollow-star-of-David pattern in a tripled Wigner-Seitz cell of kagom\'e lattice. It is further demonstrated that the twisting of Dirac mass with vorticity leads to zero Dirac modes at the vortex core, which are intimately related to the fractionalization. The hollow-star-of-David phase is shown to have a distinct $\mathbb{Z}_6$ Berry phase with its sign-change counterpart of Dirac mass, i.e. the hexagonal phase, shedding light on the topological origin of zero Dirac modes around the vortex core.</description>

      <title>Restricted Boltzmann machine network versus Jastrow correlated wave function for the two-dimensional Hubbard model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) correlated BCS wave function as the ground state of the two-dimensional Hubbard model and study its electronic and magnetic properties as a function of hole doping. We compare the results with those obtained by using conventional Jastrow projectors. The results show that the RBM wave function outperforms the Jastrow projected ones in the underdoped region inmterms of the variational energy. Computation of superconducting (SC) correlations in the model shows that the RBM wave function gives slightly weaker SC correlations as compared to the Jastrow projected wave functions. A significant advantage of the RBM wave function is that it spontaneously gives rise to strong antiferromagnetic (AF) correlations in the underdoped region even though the wave function does not incorporate any explicit AF order. In comparison, AF correlations in the Jastrow projected wave functions are found to be very weak. These and other results obtained show that the RBM wave function provides an improved description of the phase diagram of the model. The work also demonstrates the power of neural-network quantum state (NQS) wave functions in the study of strongly correlated electron systems.</description>

      <title>A minimal tensor network beyond free fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04216v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work proposes a minimal model extending the duality between classical statistical spin systems and fermionic systems beyond the case of free fermions. A Jordan-Wigner transformation applied to a two-dimensional tensor network maps the partition sum of a classical statistical mechanics model to a Grassmann variable integral, structurally similar to the path integral for interacting fermions in two dimensions. The resulting model is simple, featuring only two parameters: one governing spin-spin interaction (dual to effective hopping strength in the fermionic picture), the other measuring the deviation from the free fermion limit. Nevertheless, it exhibits a rich phase diagram, partially stabilized by elements of topology, and featuring three phases meeting at a tricritical point. Besides the interpretation as a spin and fermionic system, the model is closely related to loop gas and vertex models and can be interpreted as a parity-preserving (non-unitary) circuit. Its minimal construction makes it an ideal reference system for studying non-linearities in tensor networks and deriving results by means of duality.</description>

      <title>Strange metal transport from coupling to fluctuating spins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04322v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metals hosting strong electronic interactions, including high-temperature superconductors, behave in ways that do not conform to the normal Fermi liquid theory. To pinpoint the microscopic origin of this strange metal behavior, here we reexamine the transport and optical properties of the two-dimensional t-J model taking advantage of recent improvements made on the finite temperature Lanczos method (FTLM), enabling numerically exact calculations at unprecedentedly low temperatures and high spectral resolution. We find that strange metallicity is pervasive in the temperature-doping phase diagram wherever magnetic order is suppressed: it is driven by the presence of a fluctuating spin background, and it is therefore independent on hole concentration and unrelated to quantum criticality. Our results point to a two-step transport mechanism, with short- and long-time processes associated respectively with the charge and spin dynamics, the latter being responsible for both the strange metal character and the unconventional optical conductivities seen in experiments.</description>

      <title>Fractionalized Magnetization Plateaus in the Shastry-Sutherland Lattice Material Er$_2$Be$_2$GeO$_7$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The experimental study of magnetism on the Shastry-Sutherland lattice has been ongoing for more than two decades, following the discovery of the first Shastry-Sutherland lattice materials SrCu$_2$(BO$_3$)$_2$. However, the study of Shastry-Sutherland systems is often complicated by the requirements of high magnetic fields ($&gt;$~20~T SrCu$_2$(BO$_3$)$_2$) or the presence of itinerate electrons (e.g. REB$_4$). In this paper, we present the magnetic properties of the Shastry-Sutherland lattice material Er$_2$Be$_2$GeO$_7$. Like SrCu$_2$(BO$_3$)$_2$, Er$_2$Be$_2$GeO$_7$ exhibits fractionalized magnetization plateaus. Unlike SrCu$_2$(BO$_3$)$_2$, Er$_2$Be$_2$GeO$_7$ exhibits long-range order below $\sim1~$K, and the plateaus are accessible using commercial laboratory equipment, occurring for fields &lt;~1~T. The fractions of magnetization present are closest to $\frac{1}{4}$ and $\frac{1}{2}$ of the full powder moment; we show that the $\frac{1}{4}$ magnetization plateau in Er$_2$Be$_2$GeO$_7$ has a classical analog, well represented by the magnetic structure (canted antiferromagnetic) observed in powder neutron diffraction. The lack of itinerate electrons, chemical disorder, and the low fields required to access the fractionalized magnetization plateaus promises Er$_2$Be$_2$GeO$_7$ to be a prime candidate for the study of frustrated magnetism on the Shastry-Sutherland lattice.</description>

      <title>Power spectrum of magnetic relaxation in spin ice: anomalous diffusion in a Coulomb fluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04376v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetization noise measurements on the spin ice Dy${}_2$Ti${}_2$O${}_7$ have revealed a remarkable `pink noise' power spectrum $S(f,T)$ below 4 K, including evidence of magnetic monopole excitations diffusing in a fractal landscape. However, at higher temperatures, the reported values of the anomalous exponent $b(T)$ describing the high frequency tail of $S(f,T)$ are not easy to reconcile with other results in the literature, which generally suggest significantly smaller deviations from the Brownian motion value of $b=2$, that become negligible above $T=20$ K. We accurately estimate $b(T)$ at temperatures between 2~K and 20~K, using a.c. susceptibility measurements that, crucially, stretch up to the relatively high frequency of $f = 10^6$ Hz. We show that previous noise measurements underestimate $b(T)$ and we suggest reasons for this. Our results establish deviations in $b(T)$ from $b=2$ up to about 20 K. However studies on different samples confirms that $b(T)$ is sample dependent: the details of this dependence agree in part, though not completely, with previous studies of the effect of crystal defects on monopole population and diffusion. Our results establish the form of $b(T)$ which characterises the subtle, and evolving, nature of monopole diffusion in the dense Coulomb fluid, a highly correlated state, where several dynamical processes combine. They do not rule out the importance of a fractal landscape picture emerging at lower temperatures where the monopole gas is dilute.</description>

      <title>Spinon Singlet in Quantum Colored String: Origin of $d$-Wave Pairing in a Partially-Filled Stripe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although both experimental observations and numerical simulations have reached a consensus that the stripe phase is intertwined with superconductivity in cuprates, the microscopic mechanism behind $d$-wave pairing in the presence of stripes remains unclear. Using the effective theory of quantum colored strings, we derive the wavefunction in Fock space. Our results show that two spinons with opposite chiralities tend to pair into a spinon singlet, which in turn facilitates the formation of negative pair-pair correlations between distant $x$-bonds and $y$-bonds, a hallmark of the $d$-wave pairing pattern. The same pair-pair correlation pattern is observed across various models, as confirmed by large-scale density matrix renormalization group calculations. Based on these results, we conclude that the spinon singlet is the origin of $d$-wave superconductivity in a fluctuating, partially-filled stripe, and this mechanism may also extend to multi-stripe configurations.</description>

      <title>Effects of non-integrability in a non-Hermitian time crystal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time crystals are systems that spontaneously break time-translation symmetry, exhibiting repeating patterns in time. Recent work has shown that non-Hermitian Floquet systems can host a time crystalline phase with quasi-long-range order. In this work, we investigate the effect of introducing a non-integrable interaction term into this non-Hermitian time crystal model. Using a combination of numerical TEBD simulations, mean-field analysis, and perturbation theory, we find that the interaction term has two notable effects. First, it induces a shift in the phase diagram, moving the boundaries between different phases. Second, a sufficiently strong interaction induces an unexpected symmetry-breaking transition, which is not captured by the mean-field approach. Within average Hamiltonian theory, we trace this back to a ferromagnetic transition in the anisotropic non-Hermitian XXZ model. Our results demonstrate that the interplay between non-Hermitian dynamics and many-body interactions can lead to novel symmetry breaking.</description>

      <title>Magnetic impurities in a strongly coupled superconductor</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03646v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit certain aspects of a problem concerning the influence of carrier scattering induced by magnetic impurities in metals on their superconducting properties. Superconductivity is assumed to be driven by strong electron-phonon interaction. We use the self-consistent solution of the Nagaoka equations for the scattering matrix together with the Migdal-Eliashberg theory of superconductivity to compute the energy of the in-gap bound states, superconducting critical temperature and tunneling density of states for a wide range of values of the Kondo temperature and impurity concentrations. It is found that similar to the case of the weak coupling (BCS) superconductors there is only one pair of the bound states inside the gap as well as re-entrant superconductivity for the case of antiferromagnetic exchange coupling between the conduction electrons and magnetic impurities. In agreement with the earlier studies we find that the gapless superconductivity can be realized which in the case of antiferromagnetic exchange requires much smaller impurity concentration. Surprisingly, in contrast with the weakly coupled superconductors we find that superconducting transition exhibits two critical temperatures for the ferromagnetic exchange coupling.</description>

      <title>Entanglement asymmetry in periodically driven quantum systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03654v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of entanglement asymmetry in periodically driven quantum systems. Using a periodically driven XY chain as a model for a driven integrable quantum system, we provide semi-analytic results for the behavior of the dynamics of the entanglement asymmetry, $\Delta S$, as a function of the drive frequency. Our analysis identifies special drive frequencies at which the driven XY chain exhibits dynamic symmetry restoration and displays quantum Mpemba effect over a long timescale; we identify an emergent approximate symmetry in its Floquet Hamiltonian which plays a crucial role for realization of both these phenomena. We follow these results by numerical computation of $\Delta S$ for the non-integrable driven Rydberg atom chain and obtain similar emergent-symmetry-induced symmetry restoration and quantum Mpemba effect in the prethermal regime for such a system. Finally, we provide an exact analytic computation of the entanglement asymmetry for a periodically driven conformal field theory (CFT) on a strip. Such a driven CFT, depending on the drive amplitude and frequency, exhibits two distinct phases, heating and non-heating, that are separated by a critical line. Our results show that for $m$ cycles of a periodic drive with time period $T$, $\Delta S \sim \ln mT$ [$\ln (\ln mT)$] in the heating phase [on the critical line] for a generic CFT; in contrast, in the non-heating phase, $\Delta S$ displays small amplitude oscillations around it's initial value as a function of $mT$. We provide a phase diagram for the behavior of $\Delta S$ for such driven CFTs as a function of the drive frequency and amplitude.</description>

      <title>Non-BCS behavior of the pairing susceptibility near the onset of superconductivity in a quantum-critical metal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03698v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze the dynamical pairing susceptibility $\chi_{pp} (\omega_m)$ at $T=0$ in a quantum-critical metal, where superconductivity emerges out of a non-Fermi liquid ground state once the pairing interaction exceeds a certain threshold. We obtain $\chi_{pp} (\omega_m)$ as the ratio of the fully dressed dynamical pairing vertex $\Phi (\omega_m)$ and the bare $\Phi_0 (\omega_m)$ (both infinitesimally small). For superconductivity out of a Fermi liquid, the pairing susceptibility is positive above $T_c$, diverges at $T_c$, and becomes negative below it. For superconductivity out of a non-Fermi liquid, the behavior of $\chi_{pp} (\omega_m)$ is different in two aspects: (i) it diverges at the onset of pairing at $T=0$ only for a certain subclass of bare $\Phi_0 (\omega_m)$ and remains non-singular for other $\Phi_0 (\omega_m)$, and (ii) below the instability, it becomes a non-unique function of a continuous parameter $\phi$ for an arbitrary $\Phi_0 (\omega_m)$. The susceptibility is negative in some range of $\phi$ and diverges at the boundary of this range. We argue that this behavior of the susceptibility reflects a multi-critical nature of a superconducting transition in a quantum-critical metal when immediately below the instability an infinite number of superconducting states emerges simultaneously with different amplitudes of the order parameter down to an infinitesimally small one.</description>

      <title>Prediction of polarization vortices, charge modulation, flat bands, and moir\'e magnetism in twisted oxide bilayers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03798v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent surge of interest in moir\'e superlattices of twisted van der Waals compounds has spotlighted the emergence of unconventional superconductivity and novel electronic phases. However, the range of moir\'e phenomena can be dramatically expanded by incorporating complex oxide materials into twisted heterostructures. In this study, motivated by the recent breakthroughs in synthesis of free-standing oxide membranes, we explore the emergent structural and electronic properties of twisted oxide bilayers. We focus on the classic perovskite oxide, SrTiO3, and design SrTiO3 bilayers with a relative twist between the individual layers. Using density functional theory calculations, we predict the appearance of vortex-antivortex polarization patterns at the interface of the SrTiO3 bilayers driven by twist. We also predict charge modulation of the interfacial Ti ions induced by varying local coordination which follow the moir\'e pattern. Furthermore, we forecast the emergence of flat bands at large twist angles and the associated localized electronic states with moir\'e-periodic charge density, originating from the interlayer bonding effects resulting in the formation of dangling bonds. Finally, we predict that hole doping induces unconventional d0 magnetism in otherwise nonmagnetic SrTiO3, driven by the exchange splitting of the high-density O-p bands and producing the spin density with moir\'e periodicity. These results demonstrate a broad landscape of emergent phenomena which may occur in moir\'e-engineered oxide heterostructures showing far-reaching perspectives of these material systems for further fundamental studies and potential applications.</description>

      <title>Confined Magnetization at the Sublattice-Matched Ruthenium Oxide Heterointerface</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03830v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Creating a heterostructure by combining two magnetically and structurally distinct ruthenium oxides is a crucial approach for investigating their emergent magnetic states and interactions. Previously, research has predominantly concentrated on the intrinsic properties of the ferromagnet SrRuO3 and recently discovered altermagnet RuO2 solely. Here, we engineered an ultrasharp sublattice-matched heterointerface using pseudo-cubic SrRuO3 and rutile RuO2, conducting an in-depth analysis of their spin interactions. Structurally, to accommodate the lattice symmetry mismatch, the inverted RuO2 layer undergoes an in-plane rotation of 18 degrees during epitaxial growth on SrRuO3 layer, resulting in an interesting and rotational interface with perfect crystallinity and negligible chemical intermixing. Performance-wise, the interfacial layer of 6 nm in RuO2 adjacent to SrRuO3 exhibits a nonzero magnetic moment, contributing to an enhanced anomalous Hall effect (AHE) at low temperatures. Furthermore, our observations indicate that, in contrast to SrRuO3 single layers, the AHE of [(RuO2)15/(SrRuO3)n] heterostructures shows nonlinear behavior and reaches its maximum when the SrRuO3 thickness reaches tens of nm. These results suggest that the interfacial magnetic interaction surpasses that of all-perovskite oxides (~5-unit cells). This study underscores the significance and potential applications of magnetic interactions based on the crystallographic asymmetric interfaces in the design of spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Magnetically-controlled Vortex Dynamics in a Ferromagnetic Superconductor</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04098v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ferromagnetic superconductors are exceptionally rare because the strong ferromagnetic exchange field usually destroys singlet superconductivity. EuFe$_2$(As$_{1-x}$P$_x$)$_2$, an iron-based superconductor with a maximum critical temperature of $\sim$25 K, is a unique material that exhibits full coexistence with ferromagnetic order below $T_\mathrm{FM} \approx 19$ K. The interplay between the two leads to a narrowing of ferromagnetic domains at higher temperatures and the spontaneous nucleation of vortices/antivortices at lower temperatures. Here we demonstrate how the underlying magnetic structure directly controls the superconducting vortex dynamics in applied magnetic fields. Just below $T_\mathrm{FM}$ we observe a pronounced temperature-dependent peak in both the coercivity and the creep activation energy, the latter becoming rapidly suppressed in large applied magnetic fields. We attribute this behaviour to the formation of vortex polarons arising from the unique interaction between free vortices and magnetic stripe domains. We present a theoretical description of the properties of vortex polarons that explains our main observations, showing how they lead to vortex trapping and an attractive vortex-vortex interaction at short distances. In stark contrast, strong magnetic irreversibility at low temperatures is linked to a critical current governed by giant flux creep over an activation barrier for vortex-antivortex annihilation near domain walls. Our work reveals unexplored new routes for the magnetic enhancement of vortex pinning with particularly important applications in high-current conductors for operation at high magnetic fields.</description>

Abstract: Matrix models, as quantum mechanical systems without explicit spatial dependence, provide valuable insights into higher-dimensional gauge and gravitational theories, especially within the framework of string theory, where they can describe quantum black holes via the holographic principle. Simulating these models allows for exploration of their kinematic and dynamic properties, particularly in parameter regimes that are analytically intractable. In this study, we examine the potential of tensor network techniques for such simulations. Specifically, we construct ground states as matrix product states and analyse features such as their entanglement structure.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.15733v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the physics of dilute magnetic impurities in a two-dimensional altermagnetic metal. For the single impurity case, although the spin degeneracy is broken in an altermagnetic metal, we show that the antiferromagnetic Kondo coupling still flows to the strong coupling regime at low energies in terms of the one-loop renormalization-group equation. Moreover, the Kondo temperature may be enhanced or reduced, depending on the band structure and the electron density. To study the ground-state properties, we employ the variational wavefunction approach. We find that the impurity spin is completely screened at long distances, in contrast to the usual antiferromagnet. The $d$-wave nature of the spin-split Fermi surfaces in an altermagnetic metal is reflected in the correlation between the impurity and conduction electron spins, which exhibits the $C_{4z}$ symmetry of the altermagnet at long distances. The spin correlation decays as $1/r^3$ at long distances, and its amplitude oscillates with four different periods due to the interference between the spin splitting Fermi surfaces. Moreover, the values of these periods depend on the direction of observation. Similar phenomena also occur in the RKKY interaction in an AM metal.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08782v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Correlated systems represent a class of materials that are difficult to describe through traditional electronic structure methods. The computational demand to simulate the structural dynamics of such systems, with correlation effects considered, is substantial. Here, we investigate the structural dynamics of $f$- and $d$-electron correlated systems by integrating quantum embedding techniques with interatomic potentials derived from graph neural networks. For Cerium, a prototypical correlated $f$-electron system, we use Density Functional Theory with the Gutzwiller approximation to generate training data due to efficiency with which correlations effects are included for large multi-orbital systems. For Nickel Oxide, a prototypical correlated $d$-electron system, advancements in computational capabilities now permit the use of full Dynamical Mean Field Theory to obtain energies and forces. We train neural networks on this data to create a model of the potential energy surface, enabling rapid and effective exploration of structural dynamics. Utilizing these potentials, we delineate transition pathways between the $\alpha$, $\alpha'$, and $\alpha''$ phases of Cerium and predict the melting curve of Nickel Oxide. Our results demonstrate the potential of machine learning potentials to accelerate the study of strongly correlated systems, offering a scalable approach to explore and understand the complex physics governing these materials.</description>

      <title>Double Magnon-Roton Excitations in the Triangular-Lattice Spin Supersolid</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15997v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Supersolid is an exotic quantum state of matter that spontaneously hosts the features of both solid and superfluid, which breaks the translation and U(1) gauge symmetries. Here we study the spin dynamics in the triangular-lattice compound Na$_2$BaCo(PO$_4$)$_2$, which is revealed in [Xiang et al., Nature 625, 270-275 (2024)] as a quantum magnetic analog of supersolid. We simulate the easy-axis Heisenberg model with tensor network approach and uncover unique dynamic traits. These features are manifested in two branches of excitations that can be associated with the spin solidity and superfluidity, respectively. One branch contains the U(1) Goldstone and roton modes, while the other comprises pseudo-Goldstone and roton modes. The gapless Goldstone modes of the in-plane superfluid order are confirmed by our inelastic neutron scattering measurements. Together with the evident out-of-plane solid order indicated by the magnetic Bragg peaks, our findings provide spectroscopic evidence for spin supersolidity in this easy-axis antiferromagnet. Akin to the role of phonon-roton modes -- Landau elementary excitations -- in shaping the helium superfluid thermodynamics, the intriguing double magnon-roton dispersion here determines the low-temperature thermodynamics of spin supersolid down to sub-Kelvin regime, explaining the recently observed giant magnetocaloric effect in Na$_2$BaCo(PO$_4$)$_2$.</description>

Abstract: Anomaly analysis has been an important and powerful tool in studying nonperturbative physics for decades. The anomaly inflow mechanism provides an intuitive interpretation of the bulk-boundary correspondence in topological systems. In this work, we study global anomalies in systems with symmetry-preserving Luttinger surfaces, i.e. the manifolds of fermionic Green's function zeros in the momentum space at zero energy, described by nonlocal effective theories. We view the nonlocal effective theories as a result of integrating out some low energy states. Assuming that the states integrated out do not make extra contributions to the anomalies, we discuss the simplest Lagrangian describing a gapless Dirac zero and a two-pole variant, their global anomalies, and the bulk-boundary correspondence. We then consider the constraints on possible phases with Green's function zeros of Dirac type, such as non-Fermi liquids and emergent gapless quasiparticles on Luttinger surfaces. We also provide some perspectives on why the nonlocal fermionic effective theory discussed by Golterman and Shamir (arXiv: 2311.12790) is not a suitable starting point for a symmetrically gapped phase.</description>

Abstract: The antiferromagnetic structure of Yb$_{3}$Ga$_{5}$O$_{12}$ is identified by neutron diffraction experiments below the previously-known transition at $T_{\lambda}=54$ mK. The magnetic propagation vector is found to be ${\bf k}=(1/2, 1/2, 0)$, an unusual wave-vector in the garnet structure. The associated complex magnetic structure highlights the role of exchange interactions in a nearly isotropic system dominated by dipolar interactions and finds echos with exotic structures theoretically proposed. Reduced values of the ordered moments may indicate significant quantum fluctuations in this effective spin-1/2 geometrically frustrated magnet.</description>

      <title>Hubbard and Heisenberg models on hyperbolic lattices: Metal-insulator transitions, global antiferromagnetism, and enhanced boundary fluctuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03416v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the Hubbard and Heisenberg models on hyperbolic lattices with open boundary conditions by means of mean-field approximations, spin-wave theory, and quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) simulations. For the Hubbard model we use the auxiliary-field approach and for Heisenberg systems the stochastic series expansion algorithm and concentrate on bipartite lattices where the QMC simulations are free of the negative sign problem. The hyperbolic lattices have an extensive number of sites on the boundary, such that one has to distinguish between bulk and total density of states (DOS). The considered lattices are characterized by a Dirac-like total DOS, Schl\"afli indices $\{p,q\}=\{10,3\}$ and $\{8,3\}$, as well as by flat bands, $\{8,8\}$. The Dirac total DOS cuts off the logarithmic divergence of the staggered spin susceptibility and allows for a finite $U$ metal-to-insulator transition. This transition has the same mean-field exponents as for the Gross-Neveu transition in Euclidean space. We argue that this transition is induced by the open-boundary conditions and that it will be absent in the periodic case. In the presence of flat bands we observe the onset of magnetic ordering at any finite $U$. This conclusion holds even though the bulk DOS is constant at the Fermi energy for the three considered lattices. The magnetic state at intermediate coupling can be described as a global antiferromagnet. It breaks the $C_p$ rotational and time-reversal symmetries but remains invariant under combined $C_p \mathcal{T}$ transformations. The state is characterized by macroscopic ferromagnetic moments, that globally cancel. We observe that fluctuations on the boundary of the system are greatly enhanced: While spin-wave calculations predict the breakdown of antiferromagnetism on the boundary but not in the bulk, QMC simulations show a marked reduction of the staggered moment on the edge of the system.</description>

      <title>Phonon Dynamics in the Chiral Kitaev Spin Liquid</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07990v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the effect of a magnetic field on the extended Kitaev spin liquid state through phonon dynamics. Using a constrained fermionic self-consistent mean field method, we analyze the quantum spin liquid (QSL) ground state for the extended Kitaev model with both the Zeeman term and the perturbative three-spin interaction term $\kappa$. Our results demonstrate the dependence of the stability of the Kitaev QSL state on the field direction, consistent with findings in the literature. Additionally, we calculate the phonon dynamics for acoustic phonons coupled to the Majorana fermion excitations of the Kitaev spin liquid state, discussing the temperature and field evolution of these quantities.</description>

      <title>Theory of magnetism for rare-earth magnets on the Shastry-Sutherland lattice with non-Kramers ions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12534v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by the rapid experimental progress on the rare-earth Shastry-Sutherland lattice magnets, we propose a generic effective spin model that describes interacting non-Kramers local moments on the Shastry-Sutherland lattice. We point out that the local moments consist of both magnetic dipole and quadrupole components and the effective model turns out to be an extended XYZ model with an intrinsic field that accounts for the crystal field splitting. We then study the ground-state phase diagram of the model and find that pure quadrupole orders, which are invisible to conventional experimental probes, can be stabilized over a broad regime. In particular, we show that a hidden ``1/3 magnetization plateau'' with quadrupole orders generally exists and discuss its experimental signatures. Finally, we discuss the relevance of our results to the rare-earth Shastry-Sutherland lattice magnets Pr$_{2}$Ga$_{2}$BeO$_{7}$ and Pr$_{2}$Be$_{2}$GeO$_{7}$.</description>

      <title>Immersed figure-8 annuli and anyons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.17155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.17155v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Immersion (i.e., local embedding) is relevant to the physics of topologically ordered phases through entanglement bootstrap. An annulus can immerse in a disk or a sphere as a "figure-8", which cannot be smoothly deformed to an embedded annulus. We investigate a simple problem: is there an Abelian state on the immersed figure-8 annulus, locally indistinguishable from the ground state of the background physical system? We show that if the answer is affirmative, a strong sense of isomorphism must hold: two homeomorphic immersed regions must have isomorphic information convex sets, even if they cannot smoothly deform to each other on the background physical system. We explain why to care about strong isomorphism in physical systems with anyons and give proof in the context of Abelian anyon theory. We further discuss a connection between immersed annuli and anyon transportation in the presence of topological defects. In appendices, we discuss related problems in broader contexts.</description>

      <title>Charge-conserving equilibration of quantum Hall edge states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.07189v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We address the experimentally relevant situation, where a non-equilibrium state is created at the edge of a quantum Hall system by injecting charge current into a chiral edge state with the help of a quantum point contact, quantum dots, or mesoscopic Ohmic contact. We show that the commonly accepted picture of the full equilibration of a non-equilibrium state at finite distances longer than a characteristic length scale contradicts to the charge conservation requirement. We use a phenomenological transmission line model to account for the local equilibration process and the charge and energy conserving dynamics of the collective mode. By solving this model in the limit of long distances $L$ from the injection point, we demonstrate that the correction of the electron distribution function to its eventual equilibrium form scales down slowly as $1/\sqrt{L}$.</description>

      <title>Qubit encoding for a mixture of localized functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18529v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: One of the crucial generic techniques for quantum computation is amplitude encoding. Although several approaches have been proposed, each of them often requires exponential classical-computational cost or an oracle whose explicit construction is not provided. Given the growing demands for practical quantum computation, we develop moderately specialized encoding techniques that generate an arbitrary linear combination of localized complex functions. We demonstrate that $n_{\mathrm{loc}}$ discrete Lorentzian functions as an expansion basis set lead to eficient probabilistic encoding, whose computational time is $\mathcal{O}( \max ( n_{\mathrm{loc}}^2 \log n_{\mathrm{loc}},n_{\mathrm{loc}}^2 \log n_q, n_q ))$ for $n_q$ data qubits equipped with $\log_2 n_{\mathrm{loc}}$ ancillae. Furthermore, amplitude amplification in combination with amplitude reduction renders it deterministic analytically with controllable errors and the computational time is reduced to $\mathcal{O}( \max ( n_{\mathrm{loc}}^{3/2} \log n_{\mathrm{loc}}, n_{\mathrm{loc}}^{3/2} \log n_q, n_q )).$ We estimate required resources for applying our scheme to quantum chemistry in real space. We also show the results on real superconducting quantum computers to confirm the validity of our techniques.</description>

      <title>Exotic d-wave Cooper Pair Bose Metal in two dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13405v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The study of non-Fermi liquids sheds light on unconventional phenomena in condensed matter systems that lie beyond the scope of Landau Fermi liquid theory. One intriguing example is the Bose metal, characterized by an uncondensed bosonic ground state. However, constructing a Bose metal phase in two dimensions (2D) remains a significant challenge.} Utilizing constraint path quantum Monte Carlo and functional renormalization group methods on a fermionic system with spin anisotropy in a 2D lattice, we reveal the emergence of a Cooper pair Bose metal (CPBM) phase in a highly anisotropic regime ($\alpha &lt; 0.30$) with wide range of filling, as proposed in [A. E. Feiguin and M. P. A. Fisher, Phys. Rev. Lett. 103, 025303 (2009)]. Our findings exhibit a visible nonzero momentum Bose surface in the Cooper-pair distribution function, accompanied by a distinct signal of $d_{xy}$ correlation between pairs. Our results highlight that spin-dependent anisotropy in the Fermi surface leads to versatile pairing forms. Platforms such as ultracold atoms in optical lattices and recently proposed altermagnets hold promise for realizing this intriguing phase.</description>

      <title>Quasiperiodicity protects quantized transport in disordered systems without gaps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07049v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The robustness of topological properties, such as quantized currents, generally depends on the existence of gaps surrounding the relevant energy levels or on symmetry-forbidden transitions. Here, we observe quantized currents that survive the addition of bounded local disorder beyond the closing of the relevant instantaneous energy gaps in a driven Aubry-Andr\'e-Harper chain, a prototypical model of quasiperiodic systems. We explain the robustness using a local picture in \textit{configuration-space} based on Landau-Zener transitions, which rests on the Anderson localisation of the eigenstates. Moreover, we propose a protocol, directly realizable in for instance cold atoms or photonic experiments, which leverages this stability to prepare topological many-body states with high Chern numbers and opens new experimental avenues for the study of both the integer and fractional quantum Hall effects.</description>

      <title>Noninvertible Symmetry-Resolved Affleck-Ludwig-Cardy Formula and Entanglement Entropy from the Boundary Tube Algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02806v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive a refined version of the Affleck-Ludwig-Cardy formula for a 1+1d conformal field theory, which controls the asymptotic density of high energy states on an interval transforming under a given representation of a noninvertible global symmetry. We use this to determine the universal leading and sub-leading contributions to the noninvertible symmetry-resolved entanglement entropy of a single interval. As a concrete example, we show that the ground state entanglement Hamiltonian for a single interval in the critical double Ising model enjoys a Kac-Paljutkin $H_8$ Hopf algebra symmetry when the boundary conditions at the entanglement cuts are chosen to preserve the product of two Kramers-Wannier symmetries, and we present the corresponding symmetry-resolved entanglement entropies. Our analysis utilizes recent developments in symmetry topological field theories (SymTFTs).</description>

      <title>A Nonlocal Schwinger Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02514v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We solve a system of massless fermions constrained to two space-time dimensions interacting via a $d$ space-time dimensional Maxwell field. Through dimensional reduction to the defect and bosonization, the system maps to a massless scalar interacting with a nonlocal Maxwell field through a $F \phi$-coupling. The $d=2$ dimensional case is the usual Schwinger model where the photon gets a mass. More generally, in $2&lt;d&lt;4$ dimensions, the degrees of freedom map to a scalar which undergoes a renormalization group flow; in the ultraviolet, the scalar is free, while in the infrared it has scaling dimension $(4-d)/2$.
  The infrared is similar to the Wilson-Fisher fixed point, and the physically relevant case $d=4$ becomes infrared trivial in the limit of infinite ultraviolet cut-off, consistent with earlier work on the triviality of conformal surface defects in Maxwell theory.</description>
