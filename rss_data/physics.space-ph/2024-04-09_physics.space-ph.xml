      <title>Self-referencing photothermal common-path interferometry to measure absorption of Si3N4 membranes for laser-light sails</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04449</link>

Abstract: Laser-light sails are a spacecraft concept wherein lightweight "sails" are propelled to high speeds by lasers with high intensities. The sails must comprise materials with low optical loss, to minimize the risk of laser damage. Stoichiometric silicon nitride (Si$_3$N$_4$) is a candidate material with low loss in the near infrared, but the precise absorption coefficient has not been characterized in the membrane form-factor needed for sails. We use photothermal common-path interferometry (PCI), a sensitive pump-probe technique, to measure the absorption coefficient of stoichiometric and nonstoichiometric silicon nitride. To calibrate PCI measurements of membranes, we developed a self-referencing technique where a measurement is performed twice: once on a bare membrane, and a second time with a monolayer of graphene deposited on the membrane. The absorption of the sample with graphene can be measured by both PCI and more-conventional spectroscopic techniques, enabling the calibration of the PCI measurement. We find that with an absorption coefficient of (2.09 $\pm$ 0.76) $\times$ 10$^{-2}$ cm$^{-1}$ at 1064 nm, Si$_3$N$_4$ is a suitable laser-sail material for laser intensities as high as ~10 GW/m$^{2}$, which have been proposed for some laser-sail missions, while silicon-rich SiN$_x$ (x~1), with an absorption coefficient of 7.94 $\pm$ 0.50 cm$^{-1}$, is unlikely to survive such high laser intensities.</description>

      <title>Origin and Properties of the Near Subsonic Solar Wind Observed by Parker Solar Probe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05557v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We identify and examine the solar wind intervals near the sonic critical point (i.e., $M_S \sim 1$) observed by the Parker Solar Probe (PSP). The near subsonic wind intervals show similar properties: a low density, an extremely low velocity, a low proton temperature, and essentially no magnetic field deflections compared with the surrounding solar wind. The extremely low velocity is the primary contributor to the near crossing of the sonic critical point rather than the sound speed, which is roughly constant in these intervals. Source tracing with a potential field source surface (PFSS) model suggests that the near subsonic intervals all connect to the boundaries inside coronal holes. Heliospheric current sheet (HCS) and partial HCS crossings around the near subsonic intervals indicate that the near subsonic wind is a transition layer between the slow and fast wind. The above scenario is consistent with the nature of the near subsonic wind as a low Mach-number boundary layer (LMBL), which facilitates the crossing of the sonic critical point at 15-20 $R_S$. Moreover, we find a dependence of the amplitude of switchbacks on the radial sonic Mach number. Magnetic field deflections essentially disappear near the sonic critical point, which suggests that switchbacks originate from above the sonic critical point.</description>

      <title>A Computational Model for Ion and Electron Energization during Macroscale Magnetic Reconnection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.14500v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A set of equations are developed that extend the macroscale magnetic reconnection simulation model kglobal to include particle ions. The extension from earlier versions of kglobal, which included only particle electrons, requires the inclusion of the inertia of particle ions in the fluid momentum equation, which was not required in the electron-only model. The new equations will facilitate the exploration of the simultaneous non-thermal energization of ions and electrons during magnetic reconnection in macroscale systems. Numerical tests of the propagation of Alfv\'en waves in a plasma with anisotropic electron and ion pressure are presented to benchmark the new model.</description>

      <title>Effect of magnetospheric conditions on the morphology of Jupiter's UV main auroral emission, as observed by Juno-UVS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04030v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Auroral emissions are a reflection of magnetospheric processes, and, at Jupiter, it is not entirely certain how the morphology of the UV main emission (ME) varies with magnetospheric compression or the strength of the central current sheet. This work leverages the observations from Juno-UVS to link ME variability with magnetospheric states. Novel arc-detection techniques are used to determine new reference ovals for the ME from perijoves 1 through 54, in both hemispheres, and analyse how the size and shape of the ME vary compared to this reference oval. The morphology and brightness of the ME vary in local time: the dawn-side ME is typically expanded and the dusk-side ME typically contracted compared to the reference oval, and the dusk-side ME being typically twice as bright as the dawn-side ME. Both the northern and southern ME, and the day-side and night-side ME, expand and contract from their reference ovals synchronously, which indicates that the variable size of the ME is caused by a process occurring throughout the jovian magnetosphere. The poleward latitudinal shift of the auroral footprint of Ganymede correlates with the poleward motion of the ME, whereas a similar relation is not present for the footprint of Io. Additionally, the expansion of the ME correlates well with an increase in magnetodisc current. These two results suggest that a changing current-sheet magnetic field is partially responsible for the variable size of the ME. Finally, magnetospheric compression is linked to a global ME contraction and brightening, though this brightening occurs predominantly in the day-side ME. This observation, and the observation that the dusk-side ME is typically brighter than the dawn-side ME, stands in contrast to the modelled and observed behaviour of field-aligned currents and thus weakens the theoretical link between field-aligned currents and the generation of the auroral ME.</description>
