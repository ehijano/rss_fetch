      <title>Possibilistic Computation Tree Logic: Decidability and Complete Axiomatization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Possibilistic computation tree Logic (PoCTL) is one kind of branching temporal logic combined with uncertain information in possibility theory, which was introduced in order to cope with the systematic verification on systems with uncertain information in possibility theory. There are two decision problems related to PoCTL: the model checking problem and the satisfiability problem. The model checking problem of PoCTL has been studied, while the satisfiability problem of PoCTL was not discussed. One of the purpose of this work is to study the satisfiability problem of PoCTL. By introducing some techniques to extract possibility information from PoCTL formulae and constructing their possibilistic Hintikka structures, we show that the satisfiability problem of PoCTL is decidable in exponential time. Furthermore, we give a complete axiomatization of PoCTL, which is another important inference problem of PoCTL.</description>

      <title>Parametric Iteration in Resource Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23413v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many algorithms are specified with respect to a fixed but unspecified parameter. Examples of this are especially common in cryptography, where protocols often feature a security parameter such as the bit length of a secret key.
  Our aim is to capture this phenomenon in a more abstract setting. We focus on resource theories -- general calculi of processes with a string diagrammatic syntax -- introducing a general parametric iteration construction. By instantiating this construction within the Markov category of probabilistic Boolean circuits and equipping it with a suitable metric, we are able to capture the notion of negligibility via asymptotic equivalence, in a compositional way. This allows us to use diagrammatic reasoning to prove simple cryptographic theorems -- for instance, proving that guessing a randomly generated key has negligible success.</description>

Abstract: We show that the entailment problem, for a given entailment problem for DL-Lite$_{core}$ ontology, and given conjunctive query with inequalities, is undecidable.
  We also show that this problem remains undecidable if conjunctive queries with safe negation are considered instead of conjunctive queries with inequalities.</description>

      <title>Generalized Kantorovich-Rubinstein Duality beyond Hausdorff and Kantorovich</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23552v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The classical Kantorovich-Rubinstein duality guarantees coincidence between metrics on the space of probability distributions defined on the one hand via transport plans (couplings) and on the other hand via price functions. Both constructions have been lifted to the level of generality of set functors, with the coupling-based construction referred to as the Wasserstein lifting, and the price-function-based construction as the Kantorovich lifting, both based on a choice of quantitative modalities for the given functor. It is known that every Wasserstein lifting can be expressed as a Kantorovich lifting; however, the latter in general needs to use additional modalities. We give an example showing that this cannot be avoided in general. We refer to cases in which the same modalities can be used as satisfying the generalized Kantorovich-Rubinstein duality. We establish the generalized Kantorovich-Rubinstein duality in this sense for two important cases: The L\'evy-Prokhorov distance on distributions, which finds wide-spread applications in machine learning due to its favourable stability properties, and the standard metric on convex sets of distributions that arises by combining the Hausdorff and Wasserstein distances.</description>

      <title>Taming Silent Failures: A Framework for Verifiable AI Reliability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22224v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into safety-critical systems introduces a new reliability paradigm: silent failures, where AI produces confident but incorrect outputs that can be dangerous. This paper introduces the Formal Assurance and Monitoring Environment (FAME), a novel framework that confronts this challenge. FAME synergizes the mathematical rigor of offline formal synthesis with the vigilance of online runtime monitoring to create a verifiable safety net around opaque AI components. We demonstrate its efficacy in an autonomous vehicle perception system, where FAME successfully detected 93.5% of critical safety violations that were otherwise silent. By contextualizing our framework within the ISO 26262 and ISO/PAS 8800 standards, we provide reliability engineers with a practical, certifiable pathway for deploying trustworthy AI. FAME represents a crucial shift from accepting probabilistic performance to enforcing provable safety in next-generation systems.</description>

      <title>Logical GANs: Adversarial Learning through Ehrenfeucht Fraisse Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22824v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: GANs promise indistinguishability, logic explains it. We put the two on a budget: a discriminator that can only ``see'' up to a logical depth $k$, and a generator that must look correct to that bounded observer. \textbf{LOGAN} (LOGical GANs) casts the discriminator as a depth-$k$ Ehrenfeucht--Fra\"iss\'e (EF) \emph{Opponent} that searches for small, legible faults (odd cycles, nonplanar crossings, directed bridges), while the generator plays \emph{Builder}, producing samples that admit a $k$-round matching to a target theory $T$. We ship a minimal toolkit -- an EF-probe simulator and MSO-style graph checkers -- and four experiments including real neural GAN training with PyTorch. Beyond verification, we score samples with a \emph{logical loss} that mixes budgeted EF round-resilience with cheap certificate terms, enabling a practical curriculum on depth. Framework validation demonstrates $92\%$--$98\%$ property satisfaction via simulation (Exp.~3), while real neural GAN training achieves $5\%$--$14\%$ improvements on challenging properties and $98\%$ satisfaction on connectivity (matching simulation) through adversarial learning (Exp.~4). LOGAN is a compact, reproducible path toward logic-bounded generation with interpretable failures, proven effectiveness (both simulated and real training), and dials for control.</description>

      <title>Linear effects, exceptions, and resource safety: a Curry-Howard correspondence for destructors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23517v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyse the problem of combining linearity, effects, and exceptions, in abstract models of programming languages, as the issue of providing some kind of strength for a monad $T(- \oplus E)$ in a linear setting. We consider in particular for $T$ the allocation monad, which we introduce to model and study resource-safety properties. We apply these results to a series of two linear effectful calculi for which we establish their resource-safety properties.
  The first calculus is a linear call-by-push-value language with two allocation effects $\mathit{new}$ and $\mathit{delete}$. The resource-safety properties follow from the linear (and even ordered) character of the typing rules.
  We then explain how to integrate exceptions on top of linearity and effects by adjoining default destruction actions to types, as inspired by C++/Rust destructors. We see destructors as objects $\delta : A\rightarrow TI$ in the slice category over $TI$. This construction gives rise to a second calculus, an affine ordered call-by-push-value language with exceptions and destructors, in which the weakening rule performs a side-effect. As in C++/Rust, a ``move'' operation is necessary to allow random-order release of resources, as opposed to last-in-first-out order. Moving resources is modelled as an exchange rule that performs a side-effect.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1612.01630v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Temporal logic provided an appealing approach to specifying properties of operating systems and other "reactive" software by making referencing the state graph implicitly. This paper shows how to get the same effect, with a finer control over specification and a compositional notion of state, using ordinary working mathematics, without the weight of formal logic, by using parametric state variables.</description>

      <title>From Thin Concurrent Games to Generalized Species of Structures (Extended Version)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.01082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.01082v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two families of denotational models have emerged from the semantic analysis of linear logic: dynamic models, typically presented as game semantics, and static models, typically based on a category of relations. In this paper we introduce a formal bridge between a dynamic model and a static model: the model of thin concurrent games and strategies, based on event structures, and the model of generalized species of structures, based on distributors. A special focus of this paper is the two-dimensional nature of the dynamic-static relationship, which we formalize with double categories and bicategories.

In the first part of the paper, we construct a symmetric monoidal oplax functor from linear concurrent strategies to distributors. We highlight two fundamental differences between the two models: the composition mechanism, and the representation of resource symmetries. In the second part of the paper, we adapt established methods from game semantics (visible strategies, payoff structure) to enforce a tighter connection between the two models. We obtain a cartesian closed pseudofunctor, which we exploit to shed new light on recent results in the theory of the lambda-calculus.</description>

      <title>Classical notions of computation and the Hasegawa-Thielecke theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13033v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the spirit of the Curry-Howard correspondence between proofs and programs, we define and study a syntax and semantics for classical logic equipped with a computationally involutive negation, using a polarised effect calculus, the linear classical L-calculus. A main challenge in designing a denotational semantics for the calculus is to accommodate both call-by-value and call-by-name evaluation strategies, which leads to a failure of associativity of composition. In order to tackle this issue, we define a notion of adjunction between graph morphisms on non-associative categories, which we use to formulate polarized and non-associative notions of symmetric monoidal closed duploid and of dialogue duploid. We show that they provide a direct style counterpart to adjunction models: linear effect adjunctions for the (linear) call-by-push-value calculus and dialogue chiralities for linear continuations, respectively. In particular, we show that the syntax of the linear classical L-calculus can be interpreted in any dialogue duploid, and that it defines in fact a syntactic dialogue duploid. As an application, we establish, by semantic as well as syntactic means, the Hasegawa-Thielecke theorem, which states that the notions of central map and of thunkable map coincide in any dialogue duploid (in particular, for any double negation monad on a symmetric monoidal category).</description>

Abstract: In this article we propose an extension to the typed natural deduction calculus TNDPQ to model verification of individual fairness and intersectionality in probabilistic classifiers. Their interpretation is obtained by formulating specific conditions for the application of the structural rule of Weakening.

      <title>Monoidal closure of Grothendieck constructions via $\Sigma$-tractable monoidal structures and Dialectica formulas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07724v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We examine the categorical structure of the Grothendieck construction $\Sigma_{\mathsf{C}}\mathsf{L}$ of an indexed category $\mathsf{L} \colon \mathsf{C}^{op} \to \mathsf{CAT}$. Our analysis begins with characterisations of fibred limits, colimits, and monoidal (closed) structures. The study of fibred colimits leads naturally to a generalisation of the notion of extensive indexed category introduced in CHAD for Expressive Total Languages, and gives rise to the concept of left Kan extensivity, which provides a uniform framework for computing colimits in Grothendieck constructions.
  We then establish sufficient conditions for the (non-fibred) monoidal closure of the total category $\Sigma_{\mathsf{C}}\mathsf{L}$. This extends G\"odel's Dialectica interpretation and rests upon a new notion of $\Sigma$-tractable monoidal structure. Under this notion, $\Sigma$-tractable coproducts unify and extend cocartesian coclosed structures, biproducts, and extensive coproducts. Finally, we consider when the induced closed structure is fibred, showing that this need not hold in general, even in the presence of a fibred monoidal structure.</description>

      <title>Symbolic Sets for Proving Bounds on Rado Numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12085v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a linear equation $\cal E$ of the form $ax + by = cz$ where $a$, $b$, $c$ are positive integers, the $k$-colour Rado number $R_k({\cal E})$ is the smallest positive integer $n$, if it exists, such that every $k$-colouring of the positive integers $\{1, 2, \dotsc, n\}$ contains a monochromatic solution to $\cal E$. In this paper, we consider $k = 3$ and the linear equations $ax + by = bz$ and $ax + ay = bz$. Using SAT solvers, we compute a number of previously unknown Rado numbers corresponding to these equations. We prove new general bounds on Rado numbers inspired by the satisfying assignments discovered by the SAT solver. Our proofs require extensive case-based analyses that are difficult to check for correctness by hand, so we automate checking the correctness of our proofs via an approach which makes use of a new tool we developed with support for operations on symbolically-defined sets -- e.g., unions or intersections of sets of the form $\{f(1), f(2), \dotsc, f(a)\}$ where $a$ is a symbolic variable and $f$ is a function possibly dependent on $a$. No computer algebra system that we are aware of currently has sufficiently capable support for symbolic sets, leading us to develop a tool supporting symbolic sets using the Python symbolic computation library SymPy coupled with the Satisfiability Modulo Theories solver Z3.</description>

      <title>Algebraic Closure of Matrix Sets Recognized by 1-VASS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09373v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is known how to compute the Zariski closure of a finitely generated monoid of matrices and, more generally, of a set of matrices specified by a regular language. This result was recently used to give a procedure to compute all polynomial invariants of a given affine program. Decidability of the more general problem of computing all polynomial invariants of affine programs with recursive procedure calls remains open. Mathematically speaking, the core challenge is to compute the Zariski closure of a set of matrices defined by a context-free language. In this paper, we approach the problem from two sides: Towards decidability, we give a procedure to compute the Zariski closure of sets of matrices given by one-counter languages (that is, languages accepted by one-dimensional vector addition systems with states and zero tests), a proper subclass of context-free languages. On the other side, we show that the problem becomes undecidable for indexed languages, a natural extension of context-free languages corresponding to nested pushdown automata. One of our main technical tools is a novel adaptation of Simon's factorization forests to infinite monoids of matrices.</description>
