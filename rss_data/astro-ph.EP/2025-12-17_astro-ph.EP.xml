      <title>Hot Jupiters in Old Wide-Binary Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13773v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hot Jupiters (HJs) are giant planets with orbital periods shorter than $10$ days, found around $\sim 0.5$-$1\%$ of Sun-like stars. Their origins remain debated despite decades of study. The high prevalence of stellar companions, the eccentricity distribution of 'Cold' Jupiters on longer orbits, and the wide range of stellar spin-orbit misalignments support high-eccentricity migration: planets are excited to eccentric orbits and subsequently circularised via tidal dissipation. Existing high-eccentricity migration models, however, are inefficient in converting the initial population of Cold Jupiters to HJs. Current models reproduce at most $\lesssim 30\%$ of observed HJs, while the resulting Cold/Hot Jupiter ratios ($\gtrsim 30$) overproduce the observed values of $10$-$15$. These models also fail to form HJs around old stars ($\gtrsim 3$ Gyr) on short tidal decay timescales (e.g., $&lt;40$ Myr). Here we show that wide binaries ($a &gt; 10^3$ au) perturbed by the Galactic tidal field produce $1.8\pm 0.14$ more HJs compared to isolated binary systems, accounting for $26$-$40\%$ of the observed population under conservative assumptions. Wide-binaries predominantly produce Gyr-old systems, consistent with the host-age distribution for $t \ge 2.5\ \rm Gyr$. In $\sim 20\%$ of cases, wide-binary perturbations eject giant planets entirely, resolving the Cold/Hot Jupiter ratio discrepancy while naturally seeding the population of free-floating giant planets. In our dynamical framework, wide binaries emerge as active agents that reshape planetary demographics across billions of years. These results will be decisively tested by forthcoming exoplanet and microlensing surveys.</description>

      <title>Spirals and Vertical Motions in the Planet-Forming Disk around HD 100546. A multi-line study of its gas kinematics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13814v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: HD100546 represents a particularly interesting target to study dynamical planet-disk interactions as various features have been observed in both the dust and gas that provide direct and indirect evidence for ongoing planet formation. In this work, we aim to characterize the gas kinematics of five molecular CO emission lines observed with ALMA in HD 100546, to reveal deviations from Keplerian rotation as well as substructures in the peak intensity and line width. We fit the molecular intensity channels with the Discminer package to model the line profiles. Aside from fitting the full cube, we also conduct runs where the blue- and redshifted sides are modeled separately to search for possible asymmetries. Our analysis reveals prominent kinematical spiral features in all five lines on large scales of the disk and we reproduce their morphology with both a linear and logarithmic spiral. In 12CO 2-1, spirals are also seen in the peak intensity residuals, the line width residuals exhibit a prominent ring of enhanced line widths around 125-330 au. The models further show, that the emission from the redshifted side may originate from higher disk layers than that from the blueshifted side. The pitch angles of the spirals are consistent with those driven by an embedded companion inside of 50 au and they suggest a dynamical mechanism rather than gravitational instabilities. We further find indications of a companion around 90-150 au, where tentative dips are present in the radial profiles of the integrated intensity of 13CO and C18O and pressure minima are observed in the azimuthal velocities. For the first time, we also detect downward vertical flows in this region, which coincide with the observed dust gap. The asymmetry in the emission heights may be a result of infall from the disk's environment. Another explanation is provided by a warped inner disk, casting a shadow onto one side of the disk.</description>

      <title>ExoMol line lists -- LXIII: ExoMol line lists for 12 isotopologues of CO$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13889v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extensive rovibrational line lists are constructed for 12 isotopologues of carbon dioxide: $^{12}$C$^{16}$O$_2$, $^{13}$C$^{16}$O$_2$, $^{12}$C$^{17}$O$_2$, $^{13}$C$^{17}$O$_2$, $^{12}$C$^{18}$O$_2$, $^{13}$C$^{18}$O$_2$, $^{16}$O$^{12}$C$^{17}$O, $^{16}$O$^{12}$C$^{18}$O, $^{16}$O$^{13}$C$^{17}$O, $^{16}$O$^{13}$C$^{18}$O, $^{17}$O$^{12}$C$^{18}$O, and $^{17}$O$^{13}$C$^{18}$O. The variational program TROVE was employed together with an exact kinetic energy operator, accurate empirical potential energy surface (Ames-2) and the ab initio dipole moment surface Ames-2021-40K. Empirical energy levels from the most recent MARVEL analyses, as well as from the HITRAN and CDSD databases, are used to replace calculated values where available. The line lists are further supplemented by assigning AFGL quantum numbers using machine-learning based estimators. The resulting data were employed to generate opacities with four radiative transfer codes, TauREx, ARCiS, NEMESIS, and petitRADTRANS, both for individual isotopologues and for CO$_2$ at terrestrial isotopic natural abundance. All line lists and associated data are available at www.exomol.com.</description>

      <title>Doomed Worlds II: Reassessing Suggestions of Orbital Decay for TrES-5 b</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13937v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: TrES-5b is one of only three ultra-hot Jupiters (UHJs) with suggestions of a possibly decreasing orbital period that have persisted through multiple independent analyses (G. Maciejewski et al. 2021; S. R. Hagey et al. 2022; E. S. Ivshina &amp; J. N. Winn 2022; W. Wang et al. 2024; L. C. Yeh et al. 2024). While WASP-12 b's decreasing period is well-explained by tidally induced orbital decay (K. C. Patra et al. 2017), and stellar acceleration has been proposed for WASP-4 b (L. G. Bouma et al. 2020), the cause of the apparent trend for TrES-5 b has not been satisfactorily explained. This work extends the previous observations with 14 new ground-based transits from 2016-2024 and two newly-published midtimes for data from 2007 and 2009. Four TESS sectors (75, 77, 82, and 84) have also been included for the first time. With the new data, the case for a decreasing orbital period is much weaker than before. The revised rate of period change, dP/dt=-5.3 +/- 2.2 ms yr^-1, is less than half that was found in previous work and the preference for a quadratic over a linear model, as measured through Delta BIC_LQ, has been falling since 2020, with a current value of 11. Furthermore, these results are not robust to outliers; removing a single early transit midtime causes the effect to vanish (Delta BIC_LQ = -1). Additionally, no significant periodic signals in the transit timing data are identified. The current data are well explained by a linear ephemeris.</description>

      <title>Vertically resolved minimal-set k-distribution for thermal infrared absorption in the Venus atmosphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14120v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The original k-distribution technique is applied to parameterize absorption of thermal radiation in the lower and middle atmosphere of Venus. It is developed for modeling scenarios in which the cost of full radiative transfer calculations necessitates the use of efficient and simplified parameterizations, such as climate modeling. Line-by-line reference modeling based on a Monte Carlo radiative transfer method is embedded into the construction of the k-terms, providing explicit control over accuracy. Using 16 spectral bands spanning 10--6000 cm^{-1}, the method produces 32 k-terms and 16 per-band spectral points for computing Venus cloud optical properties. Vertical resolution of the resulting k-terms is a key advantage, as it avoids the inter-level correlation assumption inherent to the correlated-k method. Height-dependent k(z) functions are supplied on the same vertical grid as the input temperature-pressure profile, enabling direct use in radiative transfer solvers and eliminating the need for vertical interpolation. The implementation yields plausible accuracy below 90 km, with cooling-rate errors of about 1 K day^{-1} and flux errors below 1 percent, while reducing the number of k-terms by a factor of approximately 2.5--3 relative to typical correlated-k approaches. A Fortran driver for generating k(z) functions for arbitrary Venus atmospheric profiles is provided in a public repository.</description>

      <title>A Possible Indication of Metallic Iron in White Dwarf Dusty Disks from their "Dirtiness"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14254v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polluted white dwarfs provide unique constraints on the elemental compositions of planetary bodies. The tidal disruption of accreting bodies is thought to form circumstellar dusty disks, whose emission spectra could offer additional insights into the mineral phases of the accreted solid material. Silicates are detected in the mid-infrared spectra of several disks, but do not fully account for the near-infrared excess in the disks' spectra. Conductive materials, such as metallic iron, are potential sources of near-infrared emissivity. We investigate the role of metallic iron within silicate dust in the observed spectra of the white dwarfs G29-38 and GD56. Using thermal emission spectra calculations, we analyze the abundance of metallic iron in the dust and the disk structure parameters that best fit the observed spectra. We find that metallic-iron-bearing dust enhances the near-infrared opacity, thereby providing a better fit to the G29-38 spectrum for various silicate compositions than metallic-iron-free dust. The best-fit metal-to-silicate mixing ratio is approximately unity, and for Mg-rich pyroxenes, this value is also consistent with G29-38's stellar atmospheric composition within 1-$\sigma$ observational uncertainties. Based on the spectral fitting and compositional consistency, Fe-rich silicates without metallic iron cannot be ruled out. The observed GD56 spectrum also favors iron-bearing dust. However, the large observational uncertainties of GD56's stellar elemental abundances hinder a precise comparison between the stellar and dust iron abundances. Upcoming high-precision JWST observations will provide a larger sample, enabling statistical analysis of the correlation between the iron abundances in the atmospheres and circumstellar dust of polluted white dwarfs.</description>

      <title>The Role of Self-Gravity in Debris Disk Warp Formation: The Case of HD 110058</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14398v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the crucial role of self-gravity in the formation of warps in debris disks, focusing on the HD 110058 system as an example. Using advanced, GPU-accelerated $N$-body simulations, we model the gravitational dynamics of a massive planetesimal disk perturbed by an inclined, inner planet. Our simulations reveal that self-gravity fundamentally alters the disk's evolution compared to massless models. It enforces a coherent, semi-rigid precession of the disk and enables the rapid formation of a global warp structure within 0.5 Myr. The warp angle undergoes a damped oscillation, eventually settling into a quasi-equilibrium state. By generating synthetic scattered-light images, we demonstrate that our model successfully reproduces the observed S-shaped warp morphology of the debris disk in HD 110058, supporting the existence of an unseen planet. Furthermore, we derive an empirical relationship that connects the equilibrium warp angle to the physical parameters of the disk and the planet. Applying this relation to HD 110058, we constrain its disk mass to be likely less than 1,000 $M_\oplus$, offering a new dynamical perspective on the debris disk mass problem.</description>

      <title>Coexistence of coagulation and streaming instabilities in protoplanetary discs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14443v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The streaming instability is considered one of the leading candidates for the formation of planetesimals, due to its ability to overcome the bouncing and fragmentation barriers. The formation of dense dust clumps through this process, however, is possible provided it involves solids with dimensionless stopping times $\sim 0.1$ in standard discs, which typically corresponds to 1-10 cm-sized particles. This implies that dust coagulation is required for the SI to be an efficient process. Here, we employ unstratified, shearing-box simulations combined with a moment equation for solving the coagulation equation to examine the effect of dust growth on the SI. In dust-rich discs with a dust-to-gas ratio $\epsilon\gtrsim 1$, coagulation is found to have little impact on the SI; while in dust-poor discs with $\epsilon\sim 0.01$, we observe the formation of vertically extended filaments through the action of the coagulation instability (CI), which is triggered due to the dependence of coagulation efficiency on dust density. For moderate dust-to-gas ratios $\epsilon\sim 0.1$ and Stokes numbers $St \lesssim 0.1$, we find onset of the SI within these filaments, with a linear growth rate significantly higher compared to standard SI. We refer to this regime as coagulation-assisted SI. The synergy between both instabilities in that case leads to isotropic turbulence and dust concentrations that are increased by a factor of $30-40$. As dust continues to grow, SI tends to overcome the effect of the CI such that the nonlinear saturation phase is similar to pure SI. Our results suggest that coagulation, by simply increasing dust size, may facilitate the formation of dense clumps through the SI; even though it has only little effect on its nonlinear evolution.</description>

      <title>The quest for Magrathea planets. II. Orbital stability of exoplanets formed around double white dwarfs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Planetary formation might occur at different stages of the stellar evolution of compact binaries. In recent years, the formation of second-generation planets has been tested in circumbinary discs formed by the ejection of stellar material from double white dwarf (DWD) binaries. In these environments, planets ranging from sub-Neptunian to giant masses can form and migrate to within 1 au of the central binary. Nevertheless, studies on the orbital stability of such systems have yet to be undertaken. In this work, we use N-body simulations to study the stability of multi-planet systems formed around compact DWDs in both resonant and non-resonant configurations over timescales of a few million years. We track the occurrence of catastrophic events and employ a variety of metrics, e.g., orbital spacing, centre-of-mass variations and Normalized Angular Momentum Deficit, to explore the outcomes of their evolution. Furthermore, we evaluate the potential for detecting these systems in their final configurations with the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) mission by measuring the overall gravitational-wave frequency shift amplitude induced by their planets. Our results show that planets orbiting DWDs can be stable over the studied timescales. While planetary systems starting with two-planets are more likely to survive unaltered, planetary systems with three, four or five planets, experience catastrophic events that cause them to lose some of their original planets, ending up hosting only two surviving planets in the majority of cases. This increases the number of two-planet systems by 122% with respect to their initial abundance and creates a single-planet population amounting to 7% of the totality of systems. The majority of these single-planet systems are potential candidates for LISA. Concerning multi-planet systems, a handful of systems could be detected.</description>

      <title>Geminids are initially cracked by atmospheric thermal stress</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Geminids have the highest bulk density of all major meteor showers and their mechanical strength appears to depend on their mass. They are also the most active annual shower, enabling detailed studies of the dependence of their physical and mechanical properties on mass. We calculated the fragmentation cascades of 39 bright Geminid fireballs, as well as faint video meteors, to derive fragmentation pressures and other physical properties characterizing the meteoroids, such as their bulk densities. Our goal is to describe the mechanical properties across a broad range of initial masses and explain the cause of the observed behavior. We used a physical fragmentation model with a semiautomatic method based on parallel genetic algorithms to fit the radiometric and regular light curve and dynamics data. We also calculated the thermal stress of model bodies with the type of physical properties and trajectories as the observed Geminids. Then, we compared the outcomes of these simulations to our observations. We find that the Geminids are probably cracked by thermal stress in the atmosphere first and then eroded by mechanical forces. The most compact Geminids are in the 20-200 g mass range. The largest observed meteoroids have a wide range of grain sizes, from about 20 um to large, non-fragmenting parts of 1-20 mm in size. The derived bulk densities range from about 1400 to 2800 kg/m3 for smaller meteoroids and approach the assumed grain density of 3000 kg/m3 for larger Geminids.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.13743v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a differential formulation of the Loeb Scale that extends the original static framework into a radially evolving, real time classification scheme for interstellar objects. By promoting each anomaly metric to a function of heliocentric distance and introducing a relaxation equation for the effective score, our method incorporates memory, hysteresis and predictive capability. This allows us to have early, stable forecasts of an object's eventual Loeb level based on sparse data obtained at large distances, which is more helpful to quantify its true nature when near Earth.</description>

      <title>The next frontier in exoplanet science: Imaging our neighbouring planetary systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13756v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transmission and eclipse spectroscopy have been invaluable tools for the characterisation of extrasolar planet atmospheres. While they will continue to provide many new insights and discoveries in the decade(s) to come, these methods are running up against sources of stellar noise from stellar surface inhomogeneities and variability. In this white paper we discuss how the next steps in the characterisation of small, temperate rocky planets requires high-contrast imaging, making the planetary systems around our closest neighbouring stars the new frontier in exoplanet science. The Extremely Large Telescopes (ELTs) will be at the forefront of this quest. The Planetary Camera and Spectrograph (PCS) on ESO's ELT and GmagAO-X on the GMT are planned to become operational in the 2035-2040 time-frame, allowing the characterisation of up to dozen(s) of rocky planets around nearby red dwarf stars. We discuss what role there will be still to play for ground-based exoplanet characterisation in the era of the space-borne Habitable Worlds Observatory and LIFE missions.</description>

Abstract: Cool gas giant exoplanets, particularly those with properties similar to those of Jupiter and Saturn, remain poorly characterized due to current observational limitations. This white paper outlines the transformative science case for the Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO) to directly image and spectroscopically characterize a broad range of gaseous exoplanets with effective temperatures below 400 K. The study focuses on determining key atmospheric properties, including molecular composition, cloud and haze characteristics, and temperature structure, across planets of varying sizes and orbital separations. Leveraging reflected light spectroscopy and polarimetry, HWO will enable comparative planetology of cool gas giants orbiting both solar-type and M-dwarf stars, bridging the observational gap between hot exoplanets and Solar System giants. We present observational requirements and survey strategies necessary to uncover correlations between atmospheric properties and planetary or stellar parameters. This effort will establish critical constraints on planetary formation, cloud microphysics, and the role of photochemistry under diverse irradiation conditions. The unique capabilities of HWO will make it the first facility capable of characterizing true exo-Jupiters in reflected light, thus offering an unprecedented opportunity to place the Solar System in a broader galactic context.</description>

      <title>A Bridge between Young Stars Formed by Gravitational Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14299v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The majority of stars are born in clustered environments. In these environments, close encounters between young stars with planet-forming disks are expected to occur frequently. However, direct evidence of such interactions remains rare. Here, we report clear signatures of a recent dynamical interaction between the young stellar systems L1448 IRS3A and L1448 IRS3B. Millimeter wavelength observations reveal a distinct, tidally stripped bridge between the two systems. Together with previously reported spiral arm structures at the outer edge of the IRS3A disk and at the inner and outer regions of the IRS3B disk, these features imply that the systems are undergoing a dynamical flyby. Hydrodynamical simulations reproduce these features and suggest that the closest approach occurred about 15,000 yr ago. These findings offer rare insight into how stellar interactions can reshape disk structures and influence the formation of young multiple stellar systems.</description>

      <title>The stellar activity-rotation-age relationship under the lens of asteroseismology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14517v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In low-mass stars, the connection between magnetic activity, rotation period, and age provides key insights into the functioning of dynamos. Fully understanding the activity-rotation-age relationship requires stars with precise fundamental parameters, measured rotation periods, and reliable magnetic activity indicators (e.g. X-ray luminosity). Thanks to space-based photometry, asteroseismology is now the leading method for determining stellar parameters with unprecedented precision and accuracy. The best-characterized solar-like stars compose the Kepler LEGACY sample, with highest-quality asteroseismic data for 66 stars, most of which have measured rotation periods. In the X-ray band, these stars were observed by the ROentgen Survey with an Imaging Telescope Array (eROSITA) telescope on the Russian Spektrum-Roentgen-Gamma (SRG) satellite in the course of its all-sky survey. We reviewed different components of the stellar activity-rotation-age relationship using the largest sample of solar-like stars with highly accurate fundamental parameters from asteroseismology, along with measured rotation periods and X-ray luminosities. We cross-correlated the Kepler LEGACY sample with the SRG/eROSITA source catalogue, finding X-ray detections for 13 of them. We derived their fundamental parameters using the Forward and Inversion COmbination procedure and revisited widely studied activity-age and activity-rotation relationships by consistently incorporating our 13-star subsample with literature samples. By implementing revised activity-rotation-age relationships in a Star-Planet Interaction code to compute X-ray luminosity tracks and comparing the results with observations, we found improved agreement for 7 stars of our subsample. We explored the effect of the revised relationships on the mass loss of planets in the radius valley, finding a modest impact on planet size distributions.</description>

      <title>Selection and characterisation of the M-dwarf targets in the PLATO Input Catalogue</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14593v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ESA's PLAnetary Transits and Oscillations of Stars (PLATO) mission aims to detect planets orbiting around dwarfs and subgiant stars with spectral type F5 or later, including M-dwarfs. The PLATO Input Catalogue (PIC) contains all targets available for observation by the nominal science. The latest version, PIC2.1.0.1, focuses on the Southern PLATO field, named LOPS2, selected as the first long observation field, and includes the P4 sample, one of the four target samples outlined in the Science Requirement Document. P4 includes the M-dwarfs with magnitudes V &lt; 16 located within LOPS2. A characterisation of the M-dwarfs in the PIC is essential for assessing their potentiality to host exoplanets, and eventually estimate the hosted planet(s) properties. The purpose of this paper is to describe how we selected the P4 M-dwarf targets, and obtained their fundamental parameters and properties. In this work, we introduce the P4 sample and detail the methodologies adopted for the measurement of their stellar parameters. Based on a statistical analysis of the P4 sample, we assess both the photometric and volume completeness, and classify the stellar populations according to their Galactic spatial-velocity components. The adopted stellar parameters are validated by comparison with independent methods from the literature used to estimate stellar radii. The P4 sample is compliant with the PLATO science requirements. Being magnitude limited, its volume completeness decreases going towards distances larger than 30 pc, where late-type targets are progressively less covered. The observed large spread in the colour-magnitude diagram is likely due to the combination of several effects such as metallicity, age, binarity and activity. The strategy we adopted for deriving stellar parameters provides results consistent with those obtained in the literature with different and independent methods.</description>

      <title>Detection of CO$_2$, CO, and H$_2$O in the atmosphere of the warm sub-Saturn HAT-P-12b</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18722v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The chemical composition of warm gas giant exoplanet atmospheres (with Teq &lt; 1000 K) is not well known due to the lack of observational constraints. HAT-P-12 b is a warm, sub-Saturn-mass transiting exoplanet that is ideal for transmission spectroscopy. One transit of HAT-P-12 b was observed with JWST NIRSpec in the 2.87--5.10 $\mu$m range with a resolving power of $\sim$1000. The JWST data are combined with archival observations from HST WFC3 covering the 1.1--1.7 $\mu$m range. The data were analysed using two data reduction pipelines and two atmospheric retrieval tools. Atmospheric simulations using chemical forward models were performed. CO2, CO, and H2O are detected at 12.2, 4.1, and 6.0 $\sigma$ confidence, respectively. Their volume mixing ratios are consistent with an atmosphere of $\sim10\times$ solar metallicity and production of CO2 by photochemistry. CH4 is not detected and seems to be lacking, which could be due to a high intrinsic temperature with strong vertical mixing or other phenomena. SO2 is also not detected and its production seems limited by low upper atmosphere temperatures ($\sim$500 K at $P&lt;10^{-3}$ bar derived from one-dimensional retrievals), insufficient to produce it in detectable quantities ($\gtrsim$ 800 K required according to photochemical models). Retrievals indicate the presence of clouds between 2 and 269 mbar. This study points towards an atmosphere for HAT-P-12 b that could be enriched in carbon and oxygen with respect to its host star. When including the production of CO2 via photochemistry, an atmospheric metallicity that is close to Saturn's can explain the observations. Metallicities inferred for other gas giant exoplanets based on their CO2 mixing ratios may need to account for its photochemical production pathways. This may impact studies on mass-metallicity trends and links between exoplanet atmospheres, interiors, and formation history.</description>

      <title>JWST-TST High Contrast: Medium-resolution spectroscopy reveals a carbon-rich circumplanetary disk around the young accreting exoplanet Delorme 1 AB b</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07253v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Young accreting planetary-mass objects are thought to draw material from a circumplanetary disk (CPD) composed of gas and dust. While the gas within the disk is expected to disperse within the first million years, strong accretion has nonetheless been detected in older systems, including the 30--45 Myr-old planetary-mass companion Delorme 1 AB b. We conducted spectroscopic observations with JWST/MIRI to investigate the presence of circumplanetary material around this young, accreting planet, and to characterize the planet's atmospheric properties and composition. We perform forward modeling using atmospheric models to characterize the planet's atmosphere. Beyond 10 microns, the SED becomes dominated by this CPD rather than the planet itself. We detect strong emission from HCN and C$_2$H$_2$, while no O-bearing species are observed in the CPD spectrum, suggesting the gas in the CPD has an elevated C/O. We also identify spatially extended H$_2$ emission around the planet, tracing warm gas, with indications that it may be at a higher temperature than the non-extended component. The mid-infrared spectrum of the planetary-mass companion Delorme 1 AB b reveals the first detection of bright C-bearing species in a CPD, together with an outflow traced by H$_2$ extended emission, that could be interpreted as a disk wind. The hot dust continuum emission suggests an inner cavity in the CPD. The presence of warm gas in the CPD provides constraints on the disk's chemical composition and physical conditions, opening up new avenues for disk studies. The study of these long-lived "Peter Pan" disks will enhance our understanding of how accretion persists in evolved low-mass systems, shedding light on their formation, longevity, and evolutionary pathways in planetary systems.</description>

      <title>A search for transit timing variations in the transiting hot Jupiter systems HIP 65, NGTS-6, NGTS-10 and WASP-173</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14634v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hot Jupiters are Jupiter-mass planets with orbital periods of less than ten days. Their short orbital separations make tidal dissipation within the stellar host especially efficient, potentially leading to a measurable evolution of the orbit. One possible manifestation of this is orbital decay, which presents itself observationally through variations in the orbital period and thus times of transit. Here we select four promising exoplanetary systems for detecting this effect: HIP 65, NGTS-6, NGTS-10 and WASP-173. We present 33 new transit light curves taken with the 1.54 m Danish Telescope, and analyse these alongside photometric data from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite and transit timing data from the literature. We construct two ephemeris models for each target: a linear ephemeris and a shrinking orbital period due to tidal decay. The linear ephemeris is preferred for three of the four models - the highest significance for the quadratic ephemeris is over 3-sigma for WASP-173. We compare these results to theoretical predictions for tidal dissipation of gravity waves in radiation zones, and find that wave breaking is predicted only in WASP-173, making rapid decay plausible in this system but unclear in the other three. The sensitivity of transit timings to orbital decay depends on the square of the time interval covered by available observations, so our results establish a useful baseline against which future measurements can be compared. NGTS-6 and NGTS-10 are important objects for future study as they are in the first field to be observed by the upcoming PLATO mission.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.21840v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spectroscopic parameters of methane from many different studies were gathered to improve the HITRAN database towards its 2024 version. After a validation process using high-resolution FTS and CRDS spectra, about 80,000 lines of the four most abundant isotopologues were replaced from the dyad to the triacontad regions. These changes amount to 51,000 transition wavenumbers, 18,000 line intensities, 33,000 pressure-broadening half-widths, and 3300 assignments. 44,000 new lines were added with 16,000 old lines removed, extending the database from 12,000 cm$^{-1}$ up to 14,000 cm$^{-1}$, and covering some gaps. A greater focus was brought on the pentad, octad, and tetradecad regions, targeted by several remote sensing instruments. In these regions, comparisons of spectral fits from multiple line lists were performed, taking only the parameters that provide best fit for each line. In the $\nu _3$ band, in addition to replacing the previous values, speed-independent pressure broadening parameters of $^{12}$CH$_4$ were gathered and used to fit Pad\'e-approximant functions. These functions then replaced any outdated experimental data in $\nu _3$, missing data in the new lines, as well as the values that were determined to be outside their physical boundaries. The CH$_3$D broadening parameters were replaced in the same manner, for missing and low or high values, using a semi-empirical formula instead.</description>

      <title>Supervised Classification of LEO Debris Families Using Multi-Set Proper Elements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08495v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Machine learning techniques using proper elements to reconnect families of satellite fragmentation debris have recently advanced, becoming key to space sustainability and domain awareness. However, an evolving circumterrestrial environment may limit their applicability, particularly when models are trained on outdated debris representations. In this work, we devise a computational pipeline using synthetic fragmentation data from explosive breakup events, generated via a Standard Breakup Model and propagated under a high-fidelity dynamical model. Proper elements are extracted using adapted algorithms for modified equinoctial (MEE), Poincar'e (PNC), and quaternion (QTN) sets.
  Extending beyond previous approaches limited to MEE space, we include PNC and QTN sets to broaden the dynamical fingerprints available to the classifier. Neural networks trained on various element combinations are used to determine if fragment pairs share a parent. Crucially, we identify a fundamental limitation when applying standard quaternion sets to neural networks: the loss of orbital size information during feature normalization. We introduce an augmented representation (QTN$_p$) that explicitly restores the semi-latus rectum, improving accuracy from 0.31 to 0.60 compared to the standard set. In synthetic Starlink-like LEO experiments, expanding proper-element sets generally improves discrimination. The best model, using a joint feature set (MEE + PNC + QTN), achieves an ROC-AUC of 0.858 compared to 0.789 for the MEE-only baseline, alongside higher accuracy and F1 scores.</description>

      <title>Alpha effect and dynamo in density-stratified turbulence with large-scale shear: applications to protoplanetary discs and astrophysical clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03248v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A joint effect of the density-stratified turbulence (or inhomogeneous turbulence) and a large-scale shear for arbitrary Mach numbers results in the $\alpha$ effect and mean-field dynamo action. These effects also produce the effective pumping velocity of a large-scale magnetic field. Compressibility of the turbulent velocity field (i.e., finite Mach number effects) does not affect the contributions to the $\alpha$ tensor caused by the joint effect of inhomogeneity of turbulence and a large-scale shear. The isotropic part of the $\alpha$ tensor is independent of the exponent of the turbulent kinetic energy spectrum. There is also an additional contribution to the effective pumping velocity of the mean magnetic field that is proportional to the product of the fluid density gradient and the divergence of the mean fluid velocity caused, e.g., by collapsing (or expanding) astrophysical clouds. Applications of these effects to protoplanetary discs, proto-galactic and proto-stellar clouds are discussed.</description>
