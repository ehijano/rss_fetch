      <title>In-situ tunable, room-temperature polariton condensation in individual states of a 1D topological lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10468v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, exciton-polariton microcavity arrays have emerged as a promising semiconductor-based platform for analogue simulations of model Hamiltonians and topological effects. To realize experimentally a variety of Hamiltonians and change their parameters, it is essential to have highly tunable and easily engineerable structures. Here, we demonstrate in-situ tunable, room-temperature polariton condensation in individual states of a one-dimensional topological lattice, by utilizing an open-cavity configuration with an organic polymer layer. Angle-resolved photoluminescence measurements reveal the band structure of the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger chain, comprised of S-like and P-like bands, along with the appearance of discrete topological edge states with distinct symmetries. Changing the cavity length in combination with vibron-mediated relaxation in the polymer allows us to achieve selective polariton condensation into different states of the band structure, unveiled by nonlinear emission, linewidth narrowing, energy blue-shift and extended macroscopic coherence. Furthermore, we engineer the bandgap and the edge state localization by adjusting the interaction between adjacent lattice sites. Comparison to first-principles calculations showcases the precision of the polariton simulator. These results demonstrate the versatility and accuracy of the platform for the investigation of quantum fluids in complex potential landscapes and topological effects at room temperature.</description>

      <title>Fluctuations in Spin Dynamics Excited by Pulsed Light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10522v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate nonequilibrium spin fluctuations in a ferromagnet induced by a light pulse. Using a Lindblad equation consistent with the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation, we compute the autocorrelation function of magnetization. Our analysis reveals that this function comprises both thermal and nonequilibrium components. To examine the latter in detail, we introduce a Fano factor similar to nonequilibrium current noise in electronic circuits. We demonstrate that this factor encapsulates insights into the transfer of spin units to the environment. Our findings lay the groundwork for nonequilibrium spin noise spectroscopy, offering valuable insights into spin relaxation dynamics.</description>

      <title>Stability and dynamics of magnetic skyrmions in FM/AFM heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10571v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic skyrmions have garnered attention for their potential roles in spintronic applications, such as information carriers in computation, data storage, and nano-oscillators due to their small size, topological stability, and the requirement of small electric currents to manipulate them. Two key challenges in harnessing skyrmions are the stabilization requirement through a strong out-of-plane field, and the skyrmion Hall effect (SkHE). Here, we present a systematic model study of skyrmions in FM/AFM multi-layer structures by employing both atomistic Monte Carlo and atomistic spin dynamics simulations. We demonstrate that skyrmions stabilized by exchange bias have superior stability than field-stabilized skyrmions due to the formation of a magnetic imprint within the AFM layer. Additionally, stacking two skyrmion hosting FM layers between two antiferromagnetic (AFM) layers suppresses the SkHE and enables the transport of AFM-coupled skyrmions with high velocity in the order of a few Km/s. This proposed multi-layer configuration could serve as a pathway to overcome existing limitations in the development of skyrmion-based devices, and the insights obtained through this study contribute significantly to the broader understanding of topological spin textures in magnetic materials.</description>

      <title>Coherence limit due to hyperfine interaction with nuclei in the barrier material of Si spin qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10667v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: On the quest to understand and reduce environmental noise in Si spin qubits, hyperfine interactions between electron and nuclear spins impose a major challenge. Silicon is a promising host material because one can enhance the spin coherence time by removing spinful $^{29}$Si isotopes. As more experiments rely on isotopic purification of Si, the role of other spinful atoms in the device should be clarified. This is not a straightforward task, as the hyperfine interactions with atoms in the barrier layers are poorly understood. We utilize density functional theory to determine the hyperfine tensors of both Si and Ge in a crystalline epitaxial Si/SiGe quantum well as well as Si and O atoms in an amorphous Si/SiO$_2$ (MOS) interface structure. Based on these results, we estimate the dephasing time $T_2^*$ due to magnetic noise from the spin bath and show that the coherence is limited by interactions with non-Si barrier atoms to a few \textmu s in Si/SiGe (for non-purified Ge) and about 100\,\textmu s in Si-MOS. Expressing these numbers alternatively, in Si/SiGe the interactions with Ge dominate below 1000\,ppm of $^{29}$Si content, and, due to low natural concentration of the spinful oxygen isotopes, the interactions with oxygen in Si-MOS become significant only below 1\,ppm of $^{29}$Si content.</description>

      <title>Monitoring electrochemical dynamics through single-molecule imaging of hBN surface emitters in organic solvents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10686v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electrochemical techniques conventionally lack spatial resolution and average local information over an entire electrode. While advancements in spatial resolution have been made through scanning probe methods, monitoring dynamics over large areas is still challenging, and it would be beneficial to be able to decouple the probe from the electrode itself. In this work, we leverage single molecule microscopy to spatiotemporally monitor analyte surface concentrations over a wide area using unmodified hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) in organic solvents. Through a sensing scheme based on redox-active species interactions with fluorescent emitters at the surface of hBN, we observe a linear decrease in the number of emitters under positive voltages applied to a nearby electrode. We find consistent trends in electrode reaction kinetics vs overpotentials between potentiostat-reported currents and optically-read emitter dynamics, showing Tafel slopes greater than 290 mV per decade. Finally, we draw on the capabilities of spectral single molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) to monitor the fluorescent species identity, enabling multiplexed readout. Overall, we show dynamic measurements of analyte concentration gradients at a micrometer-length scale with nanometer-scale depth and precision. Considering the many scalable options for engineering fluorescent emitters with 2D materials, our method holds promise for optically detecting a range of interacting species with unprecedented localization precision.</description>

      <title>Topological spin-torque diode effect in skyrmion-based magnetic tunnel junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10753v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growing market and massive use of Internet of Things nodes is placing unprecedented demands of energy efficient hardware for edge computing and microwave devices. In particular, magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs), as main building blocks of spintronic microwave technology, can offer a path for the development of compact and high-performance microwave detectors. On the other hand, the fascinating field of skyrmionics is bridging together concepts from topology and spintronics. Here, we show the proof of concept of a topological spin-torque diode realized with an MTJ on top of a skyrmionic material at room temperature and for a wide region of applied fields, including the zero-field case. Our spin torque diode electrical measurements show the electrical excitation of a skyrmion resonant mode with frequencies near 4 GHz and a selectivity one order of magnitude smaller than the uniform modes excited in the same device. Micromagnetic simulations identify these dynamics with the excitation of the breathing mode and point out the role of thickness dependent magnetic parameters (magnetic anisotropy field and Dzyaloshinkii Moriya interaction) in both stabilizing and exciting the magnetic skyrmions. This work marks a milestone for the development of topological spin-torque diodes.</description>

      <title>A coherence sweet spot with enhanced dipolar coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Qubits require a compromise between operation speed and coherence. Here, we demonstrate a compromise-free singlet-triplet (ST) qubit, where the qubit couples maximally to the driving field while simultaneously coupling minimally to the dominant noise sources. The qubit is implemented in a crystal-phase defined double-quantum dot in an InAs nanowire. Using a superconducting resonator, we measure the spin-orbit interaction (SOI) gap, the spin-photon coupling strength and the qubit decoherence rate as a function of the in-plane magnetic-field orientation. We demonstrate a spin qubit sweet spot maximizing the dipolar coupling and simultaneously minimizing the decoherence. Our theoretical description postulates phonons as the most likely dominant noise source. The compromise-free sweet spot originates from the SOI suggesting that it is not restricted to this material platform, but might find applications in any material with SOI. These findings pave the way for enhanced engineering of these nanomaterials for next-generation qubit technologies.</description>

      <title>Anomalous Seebeck effect and counter-propagating ballistic currents in graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10807v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Seebeck effect consists in the induction of a voltage drop due to the temperature difference in a conductor. In the middle of XIXth century, Lord Kelvin has proposed a relation between the Seebeck coefficient and the derivative of the chemical potential over temperature in the broken circuit regime. This relation appears to be nearly universal as it equally well applies to metals, semimetals and semiconductors. We show that it may fail, however, in graphene, due to the non-locality effects in the ballistic electronic transport regime. The correction to the Kelvin's formula emerges due to the coexistence of counter-propagating non-dissipative currents of cold and hot electrons. The external magnetic field normal to the graphene sample allows separating hot and cold currents in real space. The developed formalism may help interpreting the recent experimental data on ballistic edge currents in graphene bi-layers in the quantum Hall regime [1].</description>

      <title>Emergent magnetic field and vector potential of the toroidal magnetic hopfions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10811v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic hopfions are localized magnetic solitons with non-zero 3D topological charge (Hopf index). Here I present an analytical calculation of the toroidal magnetic hopfion vector potential, emergent magnetic field, the Hopf index, and the magnetization configuration. The calculation method is based on the concept of the spinor representation of the Hopf mapping. The hopfions with arbitrary values of the azimuthal and poloidal vorticities are considered. The special role of the toroidal coordinates and their connection with the emergent vector po tential gauge are demonstrated. The hopfion magnetization field is found explicitly for the arbitrary Hopf indices. It is shown that the Hopf charge density can be represented as a Jacobian of the transformation from the toroidal to the cylindrical coordinates.</description>

      <title>Strain-induced activation of chiral-phonon emission in monolayer WS$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10816v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report a theoretical investigation of the ultrafast dynamics of electrons and phonons in strained monolayer WS$_2$ following photoexcitation. We show that strain substantially modifies the phase space for electron-phonon scattering, unlocking new relaxation pathways that are unavailable in the pristine monolayer. In particular, strain triggers a transition between distinct dynamical regimes of the non-equilibrium lattice dynamics characterized by the emission of chiral phonons under high strain and linearly-polarized phonons under low strain. For valley-polarized electronic excitations, this mechanism can be exploited to selectively activate the emission of chiral phonons -- phonons carrying a net angular momentum. Our simulations are based on state-of-the-art ab-initio methods and focus exclusively on realistic excitation and strain conditions that have already been achieved in recent experimental studies. Overall, strain emerges as a powerful tool for controlling chiral phonons emission and relaxation pathways in multivalley quantum materials.</description>

      <title>Skyrmions in synthetic antiferromagnet nanorings for electrical signal generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10819v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current-driven magnetic skyrmions show promise as carriers of information bits in racetrack magnetic memory applications. Specifically, the utilization of skyrmions in synthetic antiferromagnetic (SAF) systems is highly attractive due to the potential to suppress the Skyrmion Hall effect, which causes a transverse displacement of driven skyrmions relative to the drift direction. In this study, we demonstrate, through analytical calculations and micromagnetic simulations, that in the case of a nanoring geometry, current-driven skyrmions achieve a stable circular motion with a constant frequency, which is a prerequisite for a skyrmion-based clock device. Notably, the operational frequency in a SAF nanoring surpasses that in a bilayer ferromagnetic-heavy metal nanoring and lies in the GHz regime for current densities of 20 MA/cm^2. We also find that the performance of skyrmions in SAF nanorings is comparable to that of radial Neel domain walls for low current densities (approximately 15 MA/cm^2) and low skyrmion densities (Nsk~6). Additionally, we introduce a novel skyrmionic three-phase AC alternator based on a SAF nanoring, which operates at frequencies in the GHz regime. Our findings underscore the potential of SAF nanorings as constituent materials in clock devices with tunable frequencies operating in the GHz regime</description>

      <title>Unconventional Unidirectional Magnetoresistance in vdW Heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10889v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electrical readout of magnetic states is a key to realize novel spintronics devices for efficient computing and data storage. Unidirectional magnetoresistance (UMR) in bilayer systems, consisting of a spin source material and a magnetic layer, refers to a change in the longitudinal resistance upon the reversal of magnetization, which typically originates from the interaction of spin-current and magnetization at the interface. Because of UMR s linear dependence on applied charge current and magnetization, it can be used to electrically read the magnetization state. However, in conventional spin source materials, the spin polarization of an electric field induced spin current is restricted to be in the film plane and hence the ensuing UMR can only respond to the in plane component of the magnetization. On the other hand, magnets with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA) are highly desired for magnetic memory and spin-logic devices, while the electrical read out of PMA magnets through UMR is critically missing. Here, we report the discovery of an unconventional UMR in bilayer heterostructures of a topological semimetal (WTe2) and a PMA ferromagnetic insulator (Cr2Ge2Te6, CGT), which allows to electrically read the up and down magnetic states of the CGT layer by measuring the longitudinal resistance. Our theoretical calculations based on a tight binding model show that the unconventional UMR originates from the interplay of crystal symmetry breaking in WTe2 and magnetic exchange interaction across the WTe2 and CGT interface. Combining with the ability of WTe2 to obtain magnetic field free switching of the PMA magnets, our discoveries open an exciting pathway to achieve two terminal magnetic memory devices that operate solely on the spin orbit torque and UMR, which is critical for developing next-generation non volatile and low power consumption data storage technologies.</description>

Abstract: We study the Josephson effect in a superconductor/altermagnet/superconductor (S/AM/S) junction. We find anomalous phenomena including $0$-$\pi$ transition as well as multi-nodal current-phase relations. Similar to $d$-wave superconductor, $d$-wave altermagnet can support $\varphi$ junction where free energy minima locate neither $\varphi=0$ nor $\pm \pi$ with double degeneracy. These properties can be tunable by parameters e.g., the exchange energy, the orientation of crystal axis, the length, and the applied gate voltage of altermagnet. These rich features lead to accessible functionality of S/AM/S junction.</description>

      <title>Effect of substrate and thickness on spin-wave propagation properties in ferrimagnetic thulium iron garnet thin films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10740v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rare-earth iron garnets have distinctive spin-wave (SW) properties such as low magnetic damping and long SW coherence length making them ideal candidates for magnonics. Among them, thulium iron garnet (TmIG) is a ferrimagnetic insulator with unique magnetic properties including perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA) and topological hall effect at room temperature when grown down to a few nanometers, extending its application to magnon spintronics. Here, the SW propagation properties of TmIG films (thickness of 7 - 34 nm) grown on GGG and sGGG substrates are studied at room temperature. Magnetic measurements show in-plane magnetic anisotropy for TmIG films grown on GGG and out-of-plane magnetic anisotropy for films grown on sGGG substrates with PMA. SW electrical transmission spectroscopy measurements on TmIG /GGG films unveil magnetostatic surface spin waves (MSSWs) propagating up to 80 um with a SW group velocity of 3 - 8 km/s. Intriguingly, these MSSWs exhibit nonreciprocal propagation, opening new applications in SW functional devices. TmIG films grown on sGGG substrates exhibit forward volume spin waves with a reciprocal propagation behavior up to 32 um.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.16159v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Strongly-interacting nanomagnetic arrays are ideal systems for exploring reconfigurable magnonics. They provide huge microstate spaces and integrated solutions for storage and neuromorphic computing alongside GHz functionality. These systems may be broadly assessed by their range of reliably accessible states and the strength of magnon coupling phenomena and nonlinearities.
  Increasingly, nanomagnetic systems are expanding into three-dimensional architectures. This has enhanced the range of available magnetic microstates and functional behaviours, but engineering control over 3D states and dynamics remains challenging.
  Here, we introduce a 3D magnonic metamaterial composed from multilayered artificial spin ice nanoarrays. Comprising two magnetic layers separated by a non-magnetic spacer, each nanoisland may assume four macrospin or vortex states per magnetic layer. This creates a system with a rich $16^N$ microstate space and intense static and dynamic dipolar magnetic coupling.
  The system exhibits a broad range of emergent phenomena driven by the strong inter-layer dipolar interaction, including ultrastrong magnon-magnon coupling with normalised coupling rates of $\frac{\Delta \omega}{\gamma} = 0.57$, GHz mode shifts in zero applied field and chirality-selective magneto-toroidal microstate programming and corresponding magnonic spectral control.</description>

      <title>Magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene under orthogonal and in-plane magnetic fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.09960v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the effect of a magnetic field on the band structure of bilayer graphene with a magic twist angle of 1.08{\deg}. The coupling of a tight-binding model and the Peierls phase allows the calculation of the energy bands of periodic two-dimensional systems. For an orthogonal magnetic field, the Landau levels are dispersive, particularly for magnetic lengths comparable to or larger than the twisted bilayer cell size. A high in-plane magnetic field modifies the low-energy bands and gap, which we demonstrate to be a direct consequence of the minimal coupling.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.04064v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a mechanism to obtain chiral phonon-like excitations from the bond-dependent magnetoelastic couplings in the absence of out-of-plane magnetization and magnetic fields. By mapping the hybrid excitation to its phononic analog, we reveal the impact of the lattice symmetry on the origin of the chirality. In the example of a triangular lattice ferromagnet, we recognize that the system is equivalent to the class D of topological phonons, and show the tunable chirality and topology by an in-plane magnetic field. As a possible experimental probe, we evaluate the phonon magnetization and planar thermal Hall conductivity. Our study gives a new perspective on tunable topological and chiral excitations beyond the Raman spin-lattice coupling, suggesting possible applications of spintronics and phononics in various anisotropic magnets and/or Kitaev materials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.00331v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Based on the full Hamiltonian of bilayer graphene, phase transitions are realized by the change of the in-plane magnetic field and the electrical bias in bilayer graphene. We show that the engineering of Chern numbers of four bands is possible by an applied in-plane magnetic field and an electrical bias in bilayer graphene. Our results are promising for the exploration of new topological phenomena in 2D materials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.07590v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magnetic and topological properties along with quantum correlations in terms of several entanglement measures have been investigated for an antiferromagnetic spin-1/2 XY model in the presence of transverse magnetic field and XZX$-$YZY type of three-spin interactions. Symmetries of the spin Hamiltonian have been identified. Under the Jordan-Wigner transformation, the spin Hamiltonian converted into spinless superconducting model with nearest neighbor hopping and Cooper pairing terms in addition to next nearest neighbor Cooper pairing potential. Long range antiferromagnetic order has been studied in terms of staggered spin-spin correlation functions, while the topological orders have been characterized by winding numbers. Magnetic and topological phase diagrams have been prepared. Faithful coexistence of magnetic and topological superconducting phases is found in the entire parameter regime. Boundaries of various quantum phases have been marked and positions of bicritical points have been identified.</description>

      <title>Dual Symmetry Classification of Non-Hermitian Systems and $\mathbb{Z}_2$ Point-Gap Topology of a Non-Unitary Quantum Walk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04147v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Non-Hermitian systems exhibit richer topological properties compared to their Hermitian counterparts. It is well known that non-Hermitian systems have been classified based on either the symmetry relations for non-Hermitian Hamiltonians or the symmetry relations for non-unitary time-evolution operators in the context of Floquet topological phases. In this work, we propose that non-Hermitian systems can always be classified in two ways; a non-Hermitian system can be classified using the symmetry relations for non-Hermitian Hamiltonians or time-evolution operator regardless of the Floquet topological phases or not. We refer to this as dual symmetry classification. To demonstrate this, we successfully introduce a new non-unitary quantum walk that exhibits point gaps with a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ point-gap topological phase applying the dual symmetry classification and treating the time-evolution operator of this quantum walk as the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.17809v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The electronic structure of surfaces and interfaces plays a key role in the properties of quantum devices. Here, we study the electronic structure of realistic Al/InAs/Al heterojunctions using a combination of density functional theory (DFT) with hybrid functionals and state-of-the-art quasi-particle $GW$ (QS$GW$) calculations. We find a good agreement between QS$GW$ calculations and hybrid functional calculations which themselves compare favourably well with ARPES experiments. Our study confirm the need of well controlled quality of the interfaces to obtain the needed properties of InAs/Al heterojunctions. A detailed analysis of the effects of spin-orbit coupling on the spin-splitting of the electronic states show a linear scaling in $k$-space, related to the two-dimensional nature of some interface states. The good agreement by QS$GW$ and hybrid functional calculations open the door towards trust-able use of an effective approximation to QS$GW$ for studying very large heterojunctions.</description>

      <title>The effect of temperature oscillations on energy storage rectification in harmonic systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09774v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Rectification, the preferential transport of a current in one direction through a system, has garnered significant attention in molecules because of its importance for controlling thermal and electronic currents at the nanoscale. Here, we report the presence of energy storage rectification effects in a molecular chain. This phenomenon is generated by subjecting a harmonic molecular chain to an oscillating temperature gradient and showing that the energy absorption rate of the system depends on the direction of the gradient. We examine how the energy storage rectification ratios in the chain are affected by the oscillating gradient, asymmetry in the chain, and the system parameters. We find that energy storage rectification can be observed in harmonic lattice structures with time-dependent temperatures and that, correspondingly, anharmonicity is not required to generate this rectification mechanism in such systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.11402v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a massive fermionic quantum field localized on a plane in external constant and homogeneous electric and magnetic fields. The magnetic field is perpendicular to the plane and the electric field is parallel. The complete set of solutions to the Dirac equation is presented. As important physical characteristics of the vacuum state, the fermion condensate and the expectation value of the energy-momentum tensor are investigated. The renormalization is performed using the Hurwitz function. The results are compared with those previously studied in the case of zero electric field. We discuss the behavior of the vacuum expectation values in different regions for the values of the problem parameters. Applications of the results include the electronic subsystem of graphene sheet described by the Dirac model in the long-wavelength approximation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.02655v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many emergent phases of matter stem from the intertwined dynamics of quasiparticles. Here we show that a topological superconducting phase emerges as the result of interactions between electrons and magnons in a quantum wire and a helical magnet. The magnon-mediated interaction favors triplet superconductivity over a large magnetic phase space region, and stabilizes topological superconductivity over an extended region of chemical potentials. The superconducting gap depends exponentially on the spin-electron coupling, allowing it to be enhanced through material engineering techniques.</description>

      <title>Pentagonal nanowires from topological crystalline insulators: a platform for intrinsic core-shell nanowires and higher-order topology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.03455v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report on the experimental realization of Pb1-xSnxTe pentagonal nanowires (NWs) with [110] orientation using molecular beam epitaxy techniques. Using first-principles calculations, we investigate the structural stability in NWs of SnTe and PbTe in three different structural phases: cubic, pentagonal with [001] orientation and pentagonal with [110] orientation. Within a semiclassical approach, we show that the interplay between ionic and covalent bonds favors the formation of pentagonal NWs. Additionally, we find that this pentagonal structure is more likely to occur in tellurides than in selenides. The disclination and twin boundary cause the electronic states originating from the NW core region to generate a conducting band connecting the valence and conduction bands, creating a symmetry-enforced metallic phase. The metallic core band has opposite slopes in the cases of Sn and Te twin boundary, while the bands from the shell are insulating. We finally study the electronic and topological properties of pentagonal NWs unveiling their potential as a new platform for higher-order topology and fractional charge. These pentagonal NWs represent a unique case of intrinsic core-shell one-dimensional nanostructures with distinct structural, electronic and topological properties between the core and the shell region.</description>

      <title>From a fractional quantum anomalous Hall state to a smectic state with equal Hall conductance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06745v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recent developments in twisted MoTe$_2$ and rhombohedral multilayer graphene have generated widespread attention to the general features of fractional quantum anomalous Hall (FQAH) states, including their possible coexistence with and transition to various symmetry breaking charge ordered states. These attentions are pushing forward our knowledge of the relation between the topological order in FQAH states and the Landau-type of symmetry breaking order such as the 1D smectic electronic liquid crystal and 2D charge-density-wave (CDW) solid. Although the transitions from topological states to symmetry breaking states with trivial topology have been discussed, the road from one topological ordered state to another with the same Hall conductance and broken translational symmetry has not been found. Here we show the intriguing evidence that the FQAH to FQAH Smectic (FQAHS) transition is robustly realizable in the archetypal correlated flat Chern-band model at filling $\nu$ = 2/3. This transition is novel in that: i) the FQAHS acquires the same fractional Hall conductance as FQAH, which cannot be explained by mean-field band folding. The formation of smectic order can be viewed as perturbation around the transition point, and thus, do not destroy or change the original topology; ii) the charge excitation remains gapped across the transition although the neutral gap is closed at transition point; and iii) the transition is triggered by the softening of roton mode with the same wave vector as the smectic order. Our discovery opens countless new possibilities, both theoretical and experimental, in the fast-growing field of robust fractional Chern insulators.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09666v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In strongly correlated quantum materials, electrons behave in ways that often extend beyond the confines of conventional Fermi-liquid theory. Interesting results include the observation of low-temperature metallic behavior in systems that are highly resistive. Here we provide an overview of experiments in which insulators exhibit characteristics of a metal such as the Shubnikov de Haas like quantum oscillations, focusing on recent findings in the correlated insulating states of two-dimensional WTe2. We discuss the status of current research, clarify the debates and challenges in interpreting the experiments, rule out extrinsic explanations and discuss promising future directions.</description>
