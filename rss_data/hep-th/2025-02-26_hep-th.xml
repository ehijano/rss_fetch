      <title>Hyperbolic Monopoles, (Semi-)Holomorphic Chern-Simons Theories, and Generalized Chiral Potts Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17545v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the relation between spectral data of magnetic monopoles in hyperbolic space and the curve of the spectral parameter of generalized chiral Potts models (gCPM) through the lens of (semi-)holomorphic field theories. We realize the identification of the data on the two sides, which we call the hyperbolic monopole/gCPM correspondence. For the group $\text{SU}(2)$, this correspondence had been observed by Atiyah and Murray in the 80s. Here, we revisit and generalize this correspondence and establish its origin. By invoking the work of Murray and Singer on hyperbolic monopoles, we first generalize the observation of Atiyah and Murray to the group $\text{SU}(n)$. We then propose a technology to engineer gCPM within the 4d Chern-Simons (CS) theory, which explains various features of the model, including the lack of rapidity-difference property of its R-matrix and its peculiarity of having a genus$\,\ge 2$ curve of the spectral parameter. Finally, we investigate the origin of the correspondence. We first clarify how the two sides of the correspondence can be realized from the 6d holomorphic CS theory on $\mathbb{P}S(M)$, the projective spinor bundle of the Minkowski space $M=\mathbb{R}^{1,3}$, for hyperbolic $\text{SU}(n)$-monopoles, and the Euclidean space $M=\mathbb{R}^4$, for the gCPM. We then establish that $\mathbb{P}S(M)$ can be holomorphically embedded into $\mathbb{P}S(\mathbb{C}^{1,3})$, the projective spinor bundle of $\mathbb{C}^{1,3}$, of complex dimension five with a fixed complex structure. We finally explain how the 6d CS theory on $\mathbb{P}S(M)$ can be realized as the dimensional reduction of the 10d holomorphic CS theory on $\mathbb{P}S(\mathbb{C}^{1,3})$. As the latter theory is only sensitive to the complex structure of $\mathbb{P}S(\mathbb{C}^{1,3})$, which has been fixed, we realize the correspondence as two incarnations of the same physics in ten dimensions.</description>

      <title>Amplitubes: Graph Cosmohedra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17564v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The tree-level scattering amplitudes for $\text{tr}(\phi^3)$ theory can be interpreted as a sum over the vertices of a polytope known as the associahedron. For each graph $G$, there exists a natural generalisation of the associahedron, which is constructed by considering tubes and tubings of the underling graph. This family of polytopes are called graph associahedra. The classical associahedra then arise as the graph associahedron for the path graphs. It is therefore natural to associate to each graph associahedron an amplitude-like object, we refer to as the amplitube, defined via a sum over its vertices. Recently, also in the context of trace $\text{tr}(\phi^3)$ theory, progress has been made towards defining a new geometric object, coined the cosmohedron, which computes not the amplitude, but the cosmological wavefunction as a sum over its vertices. This polytope can be constructed by consistently blowing up all boundaries of the associahedron to co-dimension one. Building on these results, in the present paper, we generalise the notion of the wavefunction for arbitrary graphs. These new expressions, which we call cosmological amplitubes, are defined via a sum over the vertices of a corresponding polytope, the graph cosmohedron. The graph cosmohedra are constructed by considering regions and regional tubings of the underlying graph which we introduce. Like the cosmohedron, the graph cosmohedra can be obtained by consistently blowing up all boundaries of the corresponding graph associahedron to co-dimension one. This new family of polytopes constitutes a vast generalisation of the cosmohedron, and we provide explicit embeddings for them, which builds upon an ABHY-like embedding for the graph associahedra.</description>

      <title>On the quantum mechanics of entropic forces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17575v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It was conjectured thirty years ago that gravity could arise from the entropic re-arrangement of information. In this paper, we offer a set of microscopic quantum models which realize this idea in detail. In particular, we suggest a simple mechanism by which Newton's law of gravity arises from extremization of the free energy of a collection of qubits or oscillators, rather than from the exchange of virtual quanta of a fundamental field. We give both a local and non-local version of the construction, and show how to distinguish a range of these entropic models from ordinary perturbative quantum gravity using existing observations and near-term experiments.</description>

      <title>QFT on Fuzzy AdS Spaces: Classical Limit and Boundary Correlation Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17595v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum field theory on two- and three-dimensional fuzzy anti-de Sitter spaces is introduced and studied. We find a complete set of solutions to the fuzzy Klein-Gordon equation and identify the commutative limit in which they reduce to classical scalar field modes. After introducing the noncommutative boundary via semi-classical states, the fuzzy modes are used to obtain the boundary two-point function. In both two and three dimensions, this gives an interesting two-parameter deformation of the conformal two-point function. For the fuzzy AdS$_2$, the two-point function is given explicitly in terms of the Appell function $F_1$.</description>

      <title>Transitions of three-charge black hole microstates in the D1D5 CFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using the D1D5 CFT we investigate transitions involving a member of a certain class of states called superstrata states, which are holographically dual to certain smooth, horizonless, $1/8$-BPS, three-charge black hole microstates known as superstrata. We study these transitions by deforming the CFT away from the free orbifold point using a marginal deformation which contains a twist operator and a supercharge operator. We apply two marginal deformations to an initial state containing a graviton acting on a superstratum state. We compute amplitudes capturing transitions from this state to a graviton acting on a microstratum state, a member of a class of states which are holographically dual to certain smooth, horizonless, non-BPS, three-charge black hole microstates known as microstrata, non-BPS analogues of superstrata. We compare the resulting amplitude for various initial and final state energies to determine the preferred transition process. This may give hints as to how the dual superstratum geometry may preferentially back-react in this setting.</description>

      <title>Worldline geometries for scattering amplitudes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we construct the path integral for infinite and semi-infinite scalar worldlines. We show that, at the asymptotic endpoints, on-shell physical states can be generated by inserting vertex operators at infinity. This procedure implements automatically the LSZ reduction, thus leading to a direct worldline representation of scattering amplitudes. To obtain it, we introduce generalized vertex operators, to be viewed as the gluing of entire tree subdiagrams to a given worldline. We demonstrate that the subdiagrams themselves are given, via a recursive relation, by correlation functions on the semi-infinite line. In this sense, the approach we take is fully first-quantized, in that it does not need any field theoretic quantity as input. We envisage that, when suitably extended to gauge theories, it could provide useful insights in addressing current research issues, such as color-kinematics duality.</description>

      <title>Analysis of s-t symmetric classical S-matrices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.18033v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the complex analytic properties of Classical (tree-level) S-matrices for four scalar particles with s-t crossing symmetry, involving an infinite number of exchanges. Under suitable analytic conditions, we demonstrate that such S-matrices exhibit a spectrum of poles that is equally spaced. We extend this result to S-matrices with accumulating poles, proving that under analogous conditions, their pole spectrum coincides with that of the Coon S-matrix. The boundedness of the S-matrix in the Regge limit is not essential for our results. While studying S-matrices that do not meet the conditions of our theorems, we encounter functions that have novel non-isolated singularities akin to what is called the natural boundary.</description>

      <title>$\mathcal{N}=4$ line defect correlators of type BCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the line defect correlation functions decorating the supersymmetric indices of $\mathcal{N}=4$ super Yang-Mills theories with orthogonal and symplectic gauge groups. We obtain exact closed-form expressions for the correlators by means of combinatorial methods associated with the group characters, including the generalized Murnaghan-Nakayama rules. The exact results for the large $N$ correlators lead to the gravity indices for the gravity dual spectrum of the fluctuations of the fundamental string wrapping $AdS_2$ and those of the fat string, the D5-brane wrapping $AdS_2$ $\times$ $\mathbb{RP}^4$.</description>

      <title>Logarithmic Corrections for Near-extremal Kerr-Newman Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18173v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we have computed the logarithmic corrections of entropy for the near-extremal Kerr-Newman black holes in $\mathcal{N}=2$ supergravity theory applying the Euclidean path integral approach in the near-horizon geometry. In the near-horizon extremal Kerr geometry, analogous to the $AdS_{2} \times S^2 $ structure, there exists a set of normalizable zero modes associated with reparametrizations of boundary time. The one-loop approximation to the Euclidean near-horizon extremal Kerr partition function exhibits an infrared divergence due to the path integral over these zero modes. Carrying out the leading finite temperature correction in the near-horizon extremal Kerr scaling limit, we control this divergence. Considering the near-extremal near-horizon geometry as a perturbation around the extremal near-horizon geometry, we determine these corrections implementing a modified heat kernel approach which involves both the extremal and near-extremal corrections and is novel in the literature for the charged rotating black holes in supergravity theory. This result should be reproduced by any microscopic theory that explains the entropy of the black hole.</description>

      <title>Bispectrum at NLO in single field inflation: conservation and squeezed limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a recent paper, we computed the bispectrum of primordial density perturbations in CMB to second order in the slow-roll parameters of single field inflation, and found logarithmic infrared contributions that diverge in both large physical distances and squeezed limit where one momentum vanishes. In this work, we provide an independent test of the result by checking its conservation and the validity of the consistency relation between the squeezed limit of the bispectrum and the square of the power spectrum. Despite the violation of the main assumption for its general proofs which is the finiteness of the relevant observables in these limits, we find that the identity continues to hold in the vicinity of the squeezed limit and large time.</description>

      <title>Viscosity, entanglement and acceleration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18199v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Minkowski vacuum in an accelerated frame behaves like a fluid that has not only a finite temperature due to the Unruh effect, but also a finite shear viscosity. Moreover, the ratio of this viscosity to the entropy density exactly satisfies the Kovtun-Son-Starinets (KSS) bound, inspired by the string theory $ \eta/s=1/4\pi $. The origin of this viscosity is purely kinematical and is believed to be related to entanglement introduced by the Rindler horizon. We directly calculate the viscosity, entropy density, and their ratio for massless fields with spins 1/2 and 1. We show that locally the ratio of viscosity to entropy density can be below the limiting value $ 1/4\pi $ at distances of the order of the thickness of the membrane corresponding to the stretched horizon, and is described by the universal function for different spins. In particular, on the membrane surface $ \eta/s=1/8\pi $.</description>

      <title>Scalar fields with impurities in arbitrary dimensions: first-order framework and exact solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18287v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a class of scalar field models coupled to impurities in arbitrary spacetime dimensions. The system admits the introduction of a second-order tensor that can be forced to obey an equality, if a first-order differential equation is satisfied, compatible with the equation of motion when the potential engenders a very specific form. In the case of static solutions, the energy density of the system can equal the divergence of an auxiliary vector function, which is included to help us solve the model. Stability of the field configuration under rescale of argument is investigated, and the procedure is illustrated considering distinct canonical models. The results show that exact solutions can be obtained in arbitrary dimensions, related to the presence of the first-order equation.</description>

Abstract: The Lie algebra of symmetries generated by the left-moving current $j=\partial_-\phi$ in the $2d$ single scalar conformal field theory is infinite dimensional, exhibiting mutually commuting subalgebras. The infinite dimensional mutually commuting subalgebras define integrable deformations of the $2d$ single scalar conformal field theory which preserve the Poisson bracket structure. We study these mutually commuting subalgebras, finding general properties that the generators of such a subalgebra must satisfy. In so doing, we find constraints on all possible integrable equations of the Korteweg-de Vries type.</description>

      <title>General Einstein-Cartan quadratic gravity with derivative couplings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16980v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Within the framework of Einstein-Cartan gravity we consider an action, containing up to quadratic terms of the Ricci scalar and the Holst invariant, coupled non-minimal to a scalar field, including couplings of its derivatives to curvature. We derive the equivalent metric theory, featuring an extra dynamical pseudoscalar degree of freedom associated with the presence of the Holst term in the action. We study the evolution of the resulting two-field system in a FRW background and show that it evolves rapidly into an effective single-field inflationary model. We find that the model is consistent with the latest observational data for a wide range of its parameters, determining the necessary upper limits on derivative coupling parameters.</description>

      <title>Kerr-Newman quasinormal modes and Seiberg-Witten theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17488v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It was recently suggested the quasinormal-mode spectrum of black holes is related to a class of four-dimensional $\mathcal{N}=2$ super Yang-Mills theories described by Seiberg-Witten curves, a proposal that has been tested for a number of black hole spacetimes. The aim of this study is to clarify the key ideas of this conjecture to a non-high-energy-physics audience, and test it in a setting that has not yet been explored: the electromagnetic and gravitational perturbations of Kerr-Newman black holes in the Dudley-Finley approximation. In the parameter space we explore, we find numerical evidence that the conjecture is valid for sub-extremal black holes and its slowest damped quasinormal frequencies, thereby providing further support for the conjecture's validity. In addition, we exploit the symmetries of the four-dimensional $\mathcal{N}=2$ super Yang-Mills theory to obtain a strikingly simple isospectral version of the radial Dudley-Finley equation.</description>

      <title>Maximal Magic for Two-qubit States</title>

Abstract: Magic is a quantum resource essential for universal quantum computation and represents the deviation of quantum states from those that can be simulated efficiently using classical algorithms. Using the Stabilizer R\'enyi Entropy (SRE), we investigate two-qubit states with maximal magic, which are most distinct from classical simulability, and provide strong numerical evidence that the maximal second order SRE is $\log (16/7)\approx 0.827$, establishing a tighter bound than the prior $\log(5/2)\approx 0.916$. We identity 480 states saturating the new bound, which turn out to be the fiducial states for the mutually unbiased bases (MUBs) generated by the orbits of the Weyl-Heisenberg (WH) group, and conjecture that WH-MUBs are the maximal magic states for $n$-qubit, when $n\neq 1$ and 3. We also reveal a striking interplay between magic and entanglement: the entanglement of maximal magic states is restricted to two possible values, $1/2$ and $1/\sqrt{2}$, as quantified by the concurrence; none is maximally entangled.</description>

      <title>Detecting emergent 1-form symmetries with quantum error correction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17572v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Higher-from symmetries act on sub-dimensional spatial manifolds of a quantum system and they can emerge as an exact symmetry at low energies even when they are explicitly broken at the microscopic level, making them difficult to characterize. In this work, we propose a quantitative criterion for the existence of 1-form symmetries motivated by quantum error correction (QEC). We show that the loss of the emergent 1-form symmetry is an information-theoretic transition revealed from the ensemble of post-measurement states. We analytically determine the regimes in which a 1-form symmetry emerges in product states on one- and two-dimensional lattices. The latter can be solved by mapping the ensemble of post-measurement states to the partition sum of a random bond Ising model along the Nishimori line. In analytically intractable regimes, we demonstrate how to detect 1-form symmetries with a global Minimal-Weight Perfect Matching (MWPM) decoder and numerically examine the information-theoretic transition of the 1-form symmetry, including systems with $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological order. As an application of our protocol, we show that once the 1-form symmetry is detected to exist, a topological quantum phase transitions characterized by the spontaneous breaking of the 1-form symmetry can be accurately detected by a disorder parameter. By exploiting ideas from quantum error correction, our work develops an information-theoretic criterion for emergent 1-from symmetries, which furthers our understanding of exotic symmetries and offers practical routes toward their characterization.</description>

      <title>Invariance under quantum permutations rules out parastatistics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17576v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum systems invariant under particle exchange are either Bosons or Fermions, even though quantum theory could in principle admit further types of behavior under permutations. But why do we not observe such "paraparticles" in nature? The analysis of this question was previously limited primarily to specific quantum field theory models. Here we give two independent arguments that rule out parastatistics universally, originating in quantum information theory and recent research on internal quantum reference frames. First, we introduce a notion of complete invariance: quantum systems should not only preserve their local state under permutations, but also the quantum information that they carry about other systems, in analogy to the notion of complete positivity in quantum information theory. Second, we demand that quantum systems are invariant under quantum permutations, i.e. permutations that are conditioned on the values of permutation-invariant observables. For both, we show that the respective principle is fulfilled if and only if the particle is a Boson or Fermion. Our results show how quantum reference frames can shed light on a longstanding problem of quantum physics, they underline the crucial role played by the compositional structure of quantum information, and they demonstrate the explanatory power but also subtle limitations of recently proposed quantum covariance principles.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17993v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning is rapidly making its pathway across all of the natural sciences, including physical sciences. The rate at which ML is impacting non-scientific disciplines is incomparable to that in the physical sciences. This is partly due to the uninterpretable nature of deep neural networks. Symbolic machine learning stands as an equal and complementary partner to numerical machine learning in speeding up scientific discovery in physics. This perspective discusses the main differences between the ML and scientific approaches. It stresses the need to develop and apply symbolic machine learning to physics problems equally, in parallel to numerical machine learning, because of the dual nature of physics research.</description>

      <title>Hairless Black Hole by Superradiance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18003v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the interplaying effects of black hole scalarization and superradiance in the context of the Einstein-Maxwell-scalar model, with the scalar field possessing electric charge. Restricted to spherical symmetry, our linear analysis about a Reissner-Nordstr\"om background confirms the persistence of tachyonic scalar modes upon inclusion of electric charge. However, fully nonlinear numerical simulations reveal that the system no longer evolves into a scalarized, hairy black hole state. Instead, we find that the superradiance phenomenon (specifically the electromagnetic version of the effect) causes the scalar condensate to become fully depleted through accretion into the black hole and radiation to spatial infinity. The combination of the two effects, which we refer to as "tachyonic superradiance", may thus be seen as a particularly efficient mechanism for the extraction of energy from a black hole, exploiting both the tachyonic growth and superradiant emission. We accurately compute the amounts of energy transfer in different channels by deriving formulae for the energy fluxes of matter fields in the presence of a dynamical horizon, which are amenable for evaluation in numerical relativity calculations.</description>

Abstract: We discuss general criteria that could guide us in applying quantum algorithms/computers to problems in high-energy physics. We then discuss the particular example of parton showers with quantum interference. We summarize the basic ideas behind the classical and quantum parton shower Monte Carlo algorithms and highlight the importance of quantum/classical hybrid algorithms. Our finding in quantum parton showers could serve as a useful case study for further exploration of quantum algorithms/computers in high-energy physics.</description>

      <title>Symplectic (Non-)Invariance of the Free Energy in Topological Recursion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18115v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $F_g$ be the free energy derived from Topological Recursion for a given spectral curve on a compact Riemann surface, and let $F_g^\vee$ be its $x$-$y$ dual, that is, the free energy derived from the same spectral curve with the roles of $x$ and $y$ interchanged. $F_g$ is sometimes called a symplectic invariant due to its invariance under certain symplectomorphisms of the formal symplectic form $dx\wedge dy$. However, the free energy is not generally invariant under the swap of $x$ and $y$; thus, the difference $F_g - F_g^\vee$ is nonzero.
  We derive a new formula for this difference for all $g\geq 2$ in terms of a residue calculation at the singularities of $x$ and $y$, including cases where $x$ and $y$ have logarithmic singularities. For the derivation, we apply recent developments from $x$-$y$ duality within the theory of (Logarithmic) Topological Recursion. The derived formulas are particularly useful for spectral curves with a trivial $x$-$y$ dual side, meaning those with vanishing $F_g^\vee$. In such cases, one obtains an explicit result for $F_{g\geq 2}$ itself.
  We apply this to several classes of spectral curves and prove, for instance, a recent conjecture by Borot et al. that the free energies $F_g$ computed by Topological Recursion for the "Gaiotto curve" coincide with the perturbative part (in the $\Omega$-background) of the Nekrasov partition function of $\mathcal{N}=2$ pure supersymmetric gauge theory. Similar computations also provide $F_g$ for the CDO curve related to Hurwitz numbers.</description>

      <title>On the momentum space structure of the quark propagator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18335v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The structure of the quark propagator in momentum space is explored taking into account non-perturbative QCD dynamics constraints for the quark spectral densities derived previously. We assume that the scalar and vector component of the quark propagator share a simple pole but not its residuum, together with other structures. Furthermore, a connection between the poles of the quark propagator and the zeros of the quark wave function $Z(p^2)$ is established. Asymptotic scaling laws for the representation of the quark propagator, after removing the shared pole, are also derived. The confrontation of our results with lattice data for the full QCD quark propagator data are in good agreement. Exploring the link with the lattice data and looking at the Bethe-Salpeter vertex and amplitude, in the chiral limit, we are able to provide estimations for these quantities, for $f_\pi$ and for the shared pole mass. The pole mass reproduces the constituent quark mass used in the quark models.</description>

Abstract: Renyi reflected entropies of order $n \geq 2$ are correlation measures that have been introduced in the field of holography. In this work, we put the spotlight on the min-reflected entropy, i.e., the Renyi reflected entropy in the limit $n \rightarrow \infty$. We show that, for general bipartite quantum states, this measure is identical to another measure originating from the field of quantum information theory: the doubly minimized Petz Renyi mutual information of order $1/2$. Furthermore, we demonstrate how this equality enables us to answer several previously open questions, each concerning one of the two correlation measures (or generalizations of them).</description>

      <title>Non-minimal Elliptic Threefolds at Infinite Distance I: Log Calabi-Yau Resolutions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.07761v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study infinite-distance limits in the complex structure moduli space of elliptic Calabi-Yau threefolds. In F-theory compactifications to six dimensions, such limits include infinite-distance trajectories in the non-perturbative open string moduli space. The limits are described as degenerations of elliptic threefolds whose central elements exhibit non-minimal elliptic fibers, in the Kodaira sense, over curves on the base. We show how these non-crepant singularities can be removed by a systematic sequence of blow-ups of the base, leading to a union of log Calabi-Yau spaces glued together along their boundaries. We identify criteria for the blow-ups to give rise to open chains or more complicated trees of components and analyse the blow-up geometry. While our results are general and applicable to all non-minimal degenerations of Calabi-Yau threefolds in codimension one, we exemplify them in particular for elliptic threefolds over Hirzebruch surface base spaces. We also explain how to extract the gauge algebra for F-theory probing such reducible asymptotic geometries. This analysis is the basis for a detailed F-theory interpretation of the associated infinite-distance limits that will be provided in a companion paper.</description>

      <title>Non-minimal Elliptic Threefolds at Infinite Distance II: Asymptotic Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.11611v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We interpret infinite-distance limits in the complex structure moduli space of F-theory compactifications to six dimensions in the light of general ideas in quantum gravity. The limits we focus on arise from non-minimal singularities in the elliptic fiber over curves in a Hirzebruch surface base, which do not admit a crepant resolution. Such degenerations take place along infinite directions in the non-perturbative brane moduli space in F-theory. A blow-up procedure, detailed generally in Part I of this project, gives rise to an internal space consisting of a union of log Calabi-Yau threefolds glued together along their boundaries. We geometrically classify the resulting configurations for genus-zero single infinite-distance limits. Special emphasis is put on the structure of singular fibers in codimension zero and one. As our main result, we interpret the central fiber of these degenerations as endpoints of a decompactification limit with six-dimensional defects. The conclusions rely on an adiabatic limit to gain information on the asymptotically massless states from the structure of vanishing cycles. We also compare our analysis to the heterotic dual description where available. Our findings are in agreement with general expectations from quantum gravity and provide further evidence for the Emergent String Conjecture.</description>

Abstract: The standard geometric description of $d$-dimensional anti-de Sitter (AdS) space is a quadric in ${\mathbb R}^{d-1,2}$ defined by $(X^0)^2 - (X^1)^2 - \dots - (X^{d-1})^2 + (X^d)^2 = \ell^2 = \text{const}$. In this paper we provide a supersymmetric generalisation of this embedding construction in the $d=5$ case. Specifically, a bi-supertwistor realisation is given for the ${\cal N}$-extended AdS superspace $\text{AdS}^{5|8\cal N}$, with ${\cal N}\geq 1$. The proposed formalism offers a simple construction of AdS super-invariants. As an example, we present a new model for a massive superparticle in $\text{AdS}^{5|8\cal N}$ which is manifestly invariant under the AdS isometry supergroup $\mathsf{SU}(2,2|{\cal N})$ and involves two independent two-derivative terms.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we classify integrable conformal defects in N=4 SYM theory for which the scalar fields pick up a non-trivial vacuum expectation value. Defects of this form correspond to Dirichlet boundary conditions that have a pole at the defect. These set-ups typically appear on the field theory side of probe brane set-ups in the AdS/CFT correspondence. We show that such defects, for any codimension, are related to fuzzy spheres. We discuss the properties of the different possible fuzzy spheres that can appear and present the corresponding Matrix Product States. We furthermore set-up the quantum field theoretic framework by computing the mass matrix and finding the propagators.</description>

      <title>Energy-time uncertainty relation from entropy measures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.21746v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a previous study, it was shown that the Generalized Uncertainty Principle (GUP) can be derived from non-extensive entropies, particularly those depending only on the probability, denoted as $S_\pm$ in the literature. This finding reveals an intriguing connection between non-extensive statistics and quantum gravity. In the present work, we extend our previous result and derive a generalized energy-time uncertainty relation based on a measure of non-extensive entropies. Consequently, the dispersion relation undergoes modifications consistent with those obtained in other approaches to quantum gravity. We interpret these modifications as evidence of the non-extensive behavior of spacetime fluctuations at scales close to the Planck scale. While these effects are significant in this regime, they become negligible in the classical one, i.e. at low energies where the spacetime is smooth. As a consequence of the non-extensive behavior exhibited by spacetime at very small scales, the black hole radiation temperature undergoes quantum-level corrections, increasing in the case of \( S_{-} \) and decreasing for the case of \( S_{+} \). Moreover, the modified uncertainty relation derived here predicts a maximum uncertainty in energy, of the order of Planck energy, and a minimum time interval, of the order of the Planck time, offering new insights into the fundamental structure of spacetime in the quantum regime.</description>

The model consists of three dimensional general relativity coupled to a real scalar field with self-interaction potential. Our analysis focuses on handlebody spacetimes, which correspond to boundary wormhole fluctuations. These fluctuations result in variations in the spacetime genus. Using the dilute wormhole gas approximation, we computed the boundary wormhole creation rate in the semiclassical region. Our results indicate that boundary wormholes are more likely to be created in spacetimes with larger absolute values of the cosmological constant. Furthermore, we find that smaller wormholes are more easily created compared to larger ones. Additionally, we investigated the impact of boundary wormhole fluctuations on false vacuum decay. The vacuum decay rate increases when the effects of wormhole fluctuations are considered. We show that all results remain qualitatively unchanged when certain parameter values are varied.</description>

Abstract: Linearised gravity has a global symmetry under which the graviton is shifted by a symmetric tensor satisfying a certain flatness condition. There is also a dual symmetry that can be associated with a global shift symmetry of the dual graviton theory. The corresponding conserved charges are shown to satisfy a centrally-extended algebra. We discuss the gauging of these global symmetries, finding an obstruction to the simultaneous gauging of both symmetries which we interpret as a mixed 't Hooft anomaly for the ungauged theory. We discuss the implications of this, analogous to those resulting from a similar structure in Maxwell theory, and interpret the graviton and dual graviton as Nambu-Goldstone modes for these shift symmetries.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we extend the study of holographic superfluids from planar topology to spherical topology, inspired by recent studies on Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) on shell-shaped geometry. We investigate the superfluid phase transition from normal fluid and its Quasi-Normal Modes (QNMs) on the sphere. It turns out that the critical temperature for the superfluid phase transition on the sphere is higher than that in the planar case. We investigated four different solutions in the backgrounds of large and small black holes. The calculation of free energy selects the most stable solution. Finally, after calculating the quasi-normal modes and their dynamic behavior, we obtained three different channels similar to the planar superfluid case, along with the ``first" hydrodynamic excitation mode.</description>

      <title>One Loop Thermal Effective Action</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.14146v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compute the one loop effective action for a Quantum Field Theory at finite temperature, in the presence of background gauge fields, employing the Heat-Kernel method. This method enables us to compute the thermal corrections to the Wilson coefficients associated with effective operators up to arbitrary mass dimension, which emerge after integrating out heavy scalars and fermions from a generic UV theory. The Heat-Kernel coefficients are functions of non-zero background `electric', `magnetic' fields, and Polyakov loops. A major application of our formalism is the calculation of the finite temperature Coleman-Weinberg potential in effective theories, necessary for the study of phase transitions. A novel feature of this work is the systematic calculation of the dependence of Polyakov loops on the thermal factors of Heat-Kernel coefficients and the Coleman-Weinberg potential. We study the effect of Polyakov loop factors on phase transitions and comment on future directions in applications of the results derived in this work.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16854v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze the stability properties of a simple holographic model for a confining field theory. The gravity dual consists of an Abelian gauge field, with non-trivial magnetic flux, coupled to six-dimensional gravity with a negative cosmological constant. We construct a one-parameter family of regular solitonic solutions, where the gauge field carries flux along a compact circle that smoothly shrinks. The free energy of these solitonic backgrounds is compared to that of domain-wall solutions. This reveals a zero-temperature first-order phase transition in the dual field theory, separating confining and conformal phases. We compute the spectrum of bound states by analysing field fluctuations in the gravity background, after dimensional reduction on the circle. A tachyonic instability emerges near a turning point in the free energy. The phase transition prevents the realisation of this instability. Near the phase transition and beyond, in metastable and unstable regions, we find evidence that the lightest scalar may be interpreted as an approximate dilaton.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19570v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Extending a recent development in the bosonic string field theory, we construct a map from the Witten-type gauge-invariant superstring field theory based on an $A_{\infty}$ structure to a light-cone-gauge superstring field theory via two intermediate theories, which we call the Kaku-type and Kugo-Zwiebach-type superstring field theories. We find that a naive extension only gives us an inconsistent light-cone-gauge theory that suffers from the well-known problem caused by divergence due to collisions of local operators. However, we also find that this difficulty may be resolved by considering the stubbed theory and propose it as a consistent light-cone-gauge superstring field theory. The result possibly gives a proof of the unitarity of the Witten-type superstring field theory.</description>

Abstract: Using the hybrid formalism with manifest $N=1$ $d=4$ spacetime supersymmetry, we construct the quadratic term in the heterotic superstring field theory action. As in open superstring field theory using the hybrid formalism, the heterotic string field theory action is constructed with three string fields and the massless sector describes $N=1$ $d=10$ supergravity in terms of $N=1$ $d=4$ superfields.</description>

      <title>The unitarity crisis, nonviolent unitarization, and implications for quantum spacetime</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.18650v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This contribution overviews the information paradox, or perhaps more aptly "unitarity crisis," and a proposed resolution called nonviolent unitarization. It begins by examining the conflict of principles that yields the crisis, which can be phrased in terms of a "black hole theorem" summarizing how basic assumptions come into conflict. Proposed resolutions of the conflict, along with problems with them, are overviewed. The very important underlying question of localization of information and its role is discussed at some length, taking into account effects of perturbative gravity. The difficulty in finding a consistent scenario for black hole evolution strongly suggests new interactions on event horizon scales; a "minimal" set of assumptions about these are parameterized in nonviolent unitarization. Possible criticisms of this scenario, and some responses, are given. New interactions at event horizon scales potentially lead to observable effects, via gravitational wave or electromagnetic channels, which are briefly discussed. A possible origin of nonviolent unitarization effects from a more fundamental description of quantum spacetime, and possible implications for such a description, are also briefly discussed.</description>

Abstract: We revisit the problem of constructing a color superconducting phase in bottom-up holography. We introduce a model that describes the five-dimensional dynamics of a scalar field dual to a chiral symmetry breaking condensate, which is coupled to the RR 4-form. The coupling is given by a topological WZ term, which is elegantly responsible both for scalar condensation at high density, and color Higgsing in the condensed phase. This construction realizes both properties at finite density and Higgsing fraction.</description>

Abstract: The holographic heavy quark potential is investigated via holographic Wilson loops in the AdS soliton with gauge potential. We analyze two types of holographic Wilson loops. {In the first type, holographic heavy quark potential shows the area law behavior. In the second type, the potential becomes zero at a critical length and physics analogous to the dissociation occurs. The mass of heavy quarkonia and the binding energy are examined.} Lastly, the mass of $0^{++}$ glueball-like operators dual to massless dilaton is calculated. The mass of $0^{++}$ glueball-like operator decreases with increase of the gauge potential as expected in arXiv:2309.03491 [hep-th]. The results are comparable with lattice QCD.</description>

      <title>Smearing out contact terms in ghost-free infinite derivative quantum gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.18694v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the context of ghost-free infinite derivative gravity, we consider the single graviton exchange between two spinless particles, a spinless particle and a photon, or between a spinless particle and a spin-1/2 particle. To this end, we compute the gravitational potential for the three aforementioned cases and derive the $\mathcal{O}(G\hbar^2)$ correction that arises at the linearised level. In the local theory, it is well-known that such a correction appears in the form of a Dirac delta function. Here, we show that this correction is smeared out for the nonlocal theory and, in contrast to the local theory, takes on non-zero values for a non-zero separation between the two particles. In the case of the single graviton exchange between a spinless particle and a spin-1/2 particle, we also compute the $\mathcal{O}(G\hbar)$ correction that arises in the non-static case within the non-relativistic approximation and show that it is finite in the nonlocal theory.</description>

      <title>Are accelerated detectors sensitive to Planck scale changes?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12136v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: One of the foremost concerns in the analysis of quantum gravity is whether the locations of classical horizons are stable under a full quantum analysis. In principle, any classical description, when interpolated to the microscopic level, can become prone to fluctuations. The curious question in that case is if there indeed are such fluctuations at the Planck scale, do they have any significance for physics taking place at scales much away from the Planck scale? In this work, we address the question of small scales and address whether there are definitive signatures of Planck scale shifts in the horizon structure. In a recent work (arXiv:2107.03406), it was suggested that in a nested sequence of Rindler causal wedges, the vacua of preceding Rindler frames appear thermally populated to a shifted Rindler frame. The Bogoliubov analysis relies on the global notion of the quantum field theory and turns out to be insensitive to the local character of these horizon shifts. We investigate this system by means of the Unruh-DeWitt detector and see if this local probe of the quantum field theory is sensitive enough to the shift parameters to reveal any microscopic effects. For the case of infinite-time response, we recover the thermal spectrum, thus reaffirming that the infinite-time response probes the global properties of the field. On the other hand, the finite-time response turns out to be sensitive to the shift parameter in a peculiar way that any detector with energy gap $\Omega c/a \sim 1$ and is operational for timescale $T a/c \sim 1$ has a measurably different response for a macroscopic and microscopic shift of the horizon, giving us a direct probe to the tiniest separation between the Rindler wedges. Thus, this study provides an operational method to identify Planck scale effects that can be generalized to various other interesting gravitational settings.</description>

      <title>Perturbative Construction of Equilibrium States for Interacting Fermionic Field Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06249v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we aim to extend to interacting massive and massless fermionic theories the recent perturbative construction of equilibrium states developed within the framework of perturbative algebraic quantum field theory on Lorentzian spacetime. We analyze the case of interactions which depend on time by a smooth switch-on function and on space by a suitably bounded function that multiplies an interaction Lagrangian density constructed with the field of the theory. The construction is achieved by first considering the case of compact support and, in a second step, by removing the space cutoff with a suitable limit (adiabatic limit). As an application, we consider a Dirac field interacting with a classical stationary background electromagnetic potential, and we compute at first perturbative order (linear response) the expectation value of the conserved current on the equilibrium state for the interacting theory. The resulting expectation value is written as a convolution, in the space coordinates, between the electromagnetic potential and an integral kernel which, at vanishing conjugate momentum, gives the inverse of the square Debye screening length at finite temperature. The corresponding Debye screening effect is visible in the backreaction treated semiclassically of this current on the classical background electromagnetic potential sourced by a classical external current.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07039v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate black holes and gravitational perturbations when both the scalar Gauss-Bonnet and dynamical Chern-Simons gravity sectors coexist in addition to the Einstein-Hilbert term, and both sectors are coupled to a single canonically normalized scalar field. The presence of the scalar Gauss-Bonnet gravity sector allows the scalar field to possess a non-vanishing background solution, resulting in additional couplings between odd and even-type gravitational perturbations arising from the dynamical Chern-Simons gravity sector. We illustrate the impact of these even-odd gravitational couplings in gravitational perturbations around a static spherically symmetric black hole. Although the couplings between the odd and even-type gravitational perturbations are known to appear in purely tensorial gravity theories with higher curvature corrections, we demonstrate it in scalar-tensor theories.</description>

Abstract: We consider a class of $q$-hypergeometric equations describing the quantum difference equation for the cotangent bundles over projective spaces $X=T^{*}\mathbb{P}^{n-1}$ . We show that over $\mathbb{Q}_p$ these equations are equipped with the Frobenius action $(q,z)\to (q^p,z^p)$. We obtain an explicit formula for the constant term of the Frobenius intertwiner in terms of the $p$-adic $q$-gamma function of Koblitz. In the limit $q\to 1$ we arrive at the Frobenius structures for the $p$-adic hypergeometric and Bessel differential equations studied by Dwork. In particular, we find closed formulas for $p$-adic constants appearing in works of Dwork and Sperber in terms of $p$-adic zeta functions.</description>

      <title>Four no-go theorems on the existence of spin and orbital angular momentum of massless bosons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06276v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The past decades have seen substantial interest in the so-called orbital angular momentum (OAM) of light, driven largely by its diverse range of applications. However, there are fundamental theoretical issues with decomposing the angular momentum of massless particles, such as photons, into spin (SAM) and orbital angular momentum parts. While the angular momentum of massive particles has a natural splitting into the Wigner SAM and OAM, there are numerous proposed splittings for photons and no consensus about which is correct. Moreover, it has been shown that most of the proposed SAM and OAM operators do not satisfy the defining commutation relations of angular momentum operators and are thus not legitimate splittings. Here, we prove that it is generally impossible to split the total angular momentum operator of massless bosons, such as photons and gravitons, into spin and orbital parts. We prove two further generalizations of this result, showing that there are no SAM-OAM splittings even if (1) the SAM operator generates non-internal symmetries or (2) if one allows the SAM and OAM operators to generate non-SO(3) symmetries.</description>

Abstract: We study the Heisenberg $S=1/2$ chain with random ferro- and antiferromagnetic couplings using quantum Monte Carlo simulations at ultra-low temperatures, converging to the ground state. Finite-size scaling of correlation functions and excitation gaps demonstrate an exotic critical state in qualitative agreement with previous strong-disorder renormalization group calculations but with scaling exponents depending on the coupling distribution. We find dual scaling regimes of the transverse correlations versus the distance, with an $L$ independent form $C(r)=r^{-\mu}$ for $r \ll L$ and $C(r,L)=L^{-\eta}f(r/L)$ for $r/L &gt; 0$, where $\mu &gt; \eta$ and the scaling function is delivered by our analysis. These results are at variance with previous spin-wave and density-matrix renormalization group calculations, thus highlighting the power of unbiased quantum Monte Carlo simulations.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Gravitational Radiation Reaction: Failed Tail, Memories &amp; Squares</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05860v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using the Schwinger-Keldysh "in-in" effective field theory (EFT) framework, we complete the knowledge of nonlinear gravitational radiation-reaction effects in the (relative) dynamics of binary systems at fifth Post-Newtonian (5PN) order. Diffeomorphism invariance plays a key role guaranteeing that the Ward identities are obeyed (in background-field gauge). Nonlocal-in-time (memory) effects appear in the soft-frequency limit as boundary terms in the effective action, consistently with the loss of (canonical) angular momentum. We identify a conservative sector through Feynman's $i0^+$-prescription. Notably, terms at second order in the (linear) radiation-reaction force also produce conservative-like effects (as we likewise demonstrate in electromagnetism). For the sake of comparison, we derive the ${\cal O}(G^4)$ contribution to the total (even-in-velocity) 5PN relative scattering angle. We find perfect agreement in the overlap with the state of the art in the Post-Minkowskian expansion, both in the conservative and dissipative sectors, resolving the (apparent) discrepancy with previous EFT results. We will return to the full conservative part of the 5PN dynamics elsewhere.</description>

      <title>Kinetic dynamics of neutral spin particles in a spacetime with torsion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20988v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A kinetic model for the dynamics of collisionless spin neutral particles in a spacetime with torsion is proposed. The fundamental matter field is the kinetic density $f(x,u,s)$ of particles with four-velocity $u$ and four-spin $s$. The stress-energy tensor and the spin current of the particles distribution are defined as suitable integral moments of $f$ in the $(u,s)$ variables. By requiring compatibility with the contracted Bianchi identity in Einstein-Cartan theory, we derive a transport equation on the kinetic density $f$ that generalizes the well-known Vlasov equation for spinless particles. The total number of particles in the new model is not conserved. To restore this important property we assume the existence in spacetime of a second species of particles with the same mass and spin magnitude. The Vlasov equation on the kinetic density $\overline{f}$ of the new particles is derived by requiring that the sum of total numbers of particles of the two species should be conserved.</description>

      <title>Self-congruent point in critical matrix product states: An effective field theory for finite-entanglement scaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03954v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We set up an effective field theory formulation for the renormalization flow of matrix product states (MPS) with finite bond dimension, focusing on systems exhibiting finite-entanglement scaling close to a conformally invariant critical fixed point. We show that the finite MPS bond dimension $\chi$ is equivalent to introducing a perturbation by a relevant operator to the fixed-point Hamiltonian. The fingerprint of this mechanism is encoded in the $\chi$-independent universal transfer matrix's gap ratios, which are distinct from those predicted by the unperturbed Conformal Field Theory. This phenomenon defines a renormalization group self-congruent point, where the relevant coupling constant ceases to flow due to a balance of two effects; When increasing $\chi$, the infrared scale, set by the correlation length $\xi(\chi)$, increases, while the strength of the perturbation at the lattice scale decreases. The presence of a self-congruent point does not alter the validity of the finite-entanglement scaling hypothesis, since the self-congruent point is located at a finite distance from the critical fixed point, well inside the scaling regime of the CFT. We corroborate this framework with numerical evidences from the exact solution of the Ising model and density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) simulations of an effective lattice model.</description>

      <title>The $SO(1,4)$ flux-balance laws of de Sitter at quadrupolar order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16215v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The linear solution for quadrupolar perturbations around de Sitter spacetime was recently constructed. In this paper, we provide the flux-balance laws for each background symmetry (dilatations, rotations, spatial translations and cosmological boosts) in terms of source moments at quadrupolar order. We write the dilatation flux-balance law in two distinct ways, which allows to contrast two distinct proposals for the negative definite energy flux. The standard Poincar\'e flux balance laws at future null infinity are recovered in the flat limit of the $SO(1,4)$ flux-balance laws.</description>

      <title>Twist-tuned quantum criticality in moir\'e bilayer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16042v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We argue that moir\'e bilayer graphene at charge neutrality hosts a continuous semimetal-to-insulator quantum phase transition that can be accessed experimentally by tuning the twist angle between the two layers. For small twist angles near the first magic angle, the system realizes a Kramers intervalley-coherent insulator, characterized by circulating currents and spontaneously broken time reversal and U(1) valley symmetries. For larger twist angles above a critical value, the spectrum remains gapless down to the lowest temperatures, with a fully symmetric Dirac semimetal ground state. Using self-consistent Hartree-Fock theory applied to a realistic model of twisted bilayer graphene, based on the Bistritzer-MacDonald Hamiltonian augmented by screened Coulomb interactions, we find that the twist-tuned quantum phase transition is continuous. We argue that the quantum critical behavior belongs to the relativistic Gross-Neveu-XY universality class, and we characterize it through an effective field theory analysis. Our theoretical predictions can be directly tested using current experimental setups incorporating the recently developed quantum twisting microscope.</description>

      <title>The role of the counterterms in the conservation of superhorizon curvature perturbations at one loop</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12112v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, several papers have claimed that superhorizon curvature perturbations are not conserved at the one-loop level in single-field inflation models if there is a transient ultra-slow-roll period. In this work, we point out that the contributions from the counterterms were overlooked in the recent papers. We show that the counterterm contributions play a crucial role in canceling the one-loop power spectrum of superhorizon curvature perturbations in the comoving gauge.</description>

      <title>Influence of dark matter on the structure of strange quark stars in one-fluid model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16317v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work studies the influence of scalar dark matter on the structural properties of strange quark stars (SQS) within a one-fluid framework, considering Yukawa interactions between dark matter and quark matter. Contributions from perturbative QCD, Yukawa interaction between scalar dark matter and quarks, and Bose-Einstein condensation of dark matter are included in the model. We first determine the allowable range of Yukawa interaction coupling by imposing the stability condition for strange quark matter (SQM). Using this range, we derive the equation of state (EOS) for different fractions of dark matter within the total pressure of SQS. These fractions are constrained by the tidal deformability limit from GW170817. The presence of dark matter alters the EOS, leading to changes in the mass-radius relationship, tidal deformability, and stability of SQS. We demonstrate that increasing the mass of dark matter softens the EOS, whereas higher fractions of dark matter lead to stiffer EOSs. We also explore the reasons behind this behavior. Our EOSs not only describe massive objects, such as PSR J0952-0607 and PSR J2215+5135, but also satisfy the tidal deformability constraint from GW170817. These results reveal that incorporating dark matter modifies the EOS, enabling the support of higher stellar masses while maintaining consistency with observational data.</description>
