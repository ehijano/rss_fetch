      <title>Deposition simulations of realistic dosages in patient-specific airways with two- and four-way coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inhalers spray over 100 million drug particles into the mouth, where a significant portion of the drug may deposit. Understanding how the complex interplay between particle and solid phases influence deposition is crucial for optimising treatments. Existing modelling studies neglect any effect of particle momentum on the fluid (one-way coupling), which may cause poor prediction of forces acting on particles. In this study, we simulate a realistic number of particles (up to 160 million) in a patient-specific geometry. We study the effect of momentum transfer from particles to the fluid (two-way coupling) and particle-particle interactions (four-way coupling) on deposition. We also explore the effect of tracking groups of particles (`parcels') to lower computational cost. Upper airway deposition fraction increased from 0.33 (one-way coupled) to 0.87 with two-way coupling and $10 \mu m$ particle diameter. Four-way coupling lowers upper airway deposition by approximately 10% at $100 \mu g$ dosages. We use parcel modelling to study deposition of $4 - 20 \mu m$ particles, observing significant influence of two-way coupling in each simulation. These results show that future studies should model realistic dosages for accurate prediction of deposition which may inform clinical decision-making.</description>

      <title>Ionization detail parameters and cluster dose: A mathematical model for selection of nanodosimetric quantities for use in treatment planning in charged particle radiotherapy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15725v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Objective: To propose a mathematical model for applying Ionization Detail (ID), the detailed spatial distribution of ionization along a particle track, to proton and ion beam radiotherapy treatment planning (RTP). Approach: Our model provides for selection of preferred ID parameters (I_p) for RTP, that associate closest to biological effects. Cluster dose is proposed to bridge the large gap between nanoscopic I_p and macroscopic RTP. Selection of I_p is demonstrated using published cell survival measurements for protons through argon, comparing results for nineteen Ip: N_k; k = 2,3,...,10, the number of ionizations in clusters of k or more per particle, and F_k; k = 1,2,...,10, the number of clusters of k or more per particle. We then describe application of the model to ID-based RTP and propose a path to clinical translation. Main results: The preferred I_p were N_4 and F_5 for aerobic cells, N_5 and F_7 for hypoxic cells. Signifcant differences were found in cell survival for beams having the same LET or the preferred N_k. Conversely, there was no signi?cant difference for F_5 for aerobic cells and F_7 for hypoxic cells, regardless of ion beam atomic number or energy. Further, cells irradiated with the same cluster dose for these I_p had the same cell survival. Based on these preliminary results and other compelling results in nanodosimetry, it is reasonable to assert that I_p exist that are more closely associated with biological effects than current LET-based approaches and microdosimetric RBE-based models used in particle RTP. However, more biological variables such as cell line and cycle phase, as well as ion beam pulse structure and rate still need investigation. Signifcance: Our model provides a practical means to select preferred I_p from radiobiological data, and to convert I_p to the macroscopic cluster dose for particle RTP.</description>

      <title>Deep convolutional framelets for dose reconstruction in BNCT with Compton camera detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Boron Neutron Capture Therapy (BNCT) is an innovative binary form of radiation therapy with high selectivity towards cancer tissue based on the neutron capture reaction 10B(n,$\alpha$)7Li, consisting in the exposition of patients to neutron beams after administration of a boron compound with preferential accumulation in cancer cells. The high linear energy transfer products of the ensuing reaction deposit their energy at cell level, sparing normal tissue. Although progress in accelerator-based BNCT has led to renewed interest in this cancer treatment modality, in vivo dose monitoring during treatment still remains not feasible and several approaches are under investigation. While Compton imaging presents various advantages over other imaging methods, it typically requires long reconstruction times, comparable with BNCT treatment duration. This study aims to develop deep neural network models to estimate the dose distribution by using a simulated dataset of BNCT Compton camera images. The models pursue the avoidance of the iteration time associated with the maximum-likelihood expectation-maximization algorithm (MLEM), enabling a prompt dose reconstruction during the treatment. The U-Net architecture and two variants based on the deep convolutional framelets framework have been used for noise and artifacts reduction in few-iterations reconstructed images, leading to promising results in terms of reconstruction accuracy and processing time.</description>

      <title>Super-resolution positron emission tomography by intensity modulation: Proof of concept</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16085v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a new approach for increasing the resolution of clinical positron emission tomography (PET). It is inspired by the method of super-resolution (SR) structured illumination microscopy (SIM) for overcoming the intrinsic resolution limit in microscopy due to diffraction of light. For implementing the key idea underlying SIM, we propose using a rotating intensity modulator of the radiation beams in front of the stationary PET detector ring to masquerade above-the-bandwidth signals of the projection data into detectable, lower-frequency ones. Then, an SR image whose resolution is above the system's bandwidth due to instrumentation is computed from several such measurements obtained at several rotational positions of the modulator. We formulated an imaging model that relates the SR image to the measurements and implemented an ordered-subsets expectation-maximization algorithm for solving the model. Based on simulation data produced by using an analytic projector, we showed that 0.9~mm sources can be resolved in the SR image obtained from noise-free data when using 4.2~mm detectors. Noisy data were produced either by adding Poisson noise to the noise-free data and by Monte-Carlo simulation. With noisy data, as expected, the SR performance is diminished but the results remain promising. In particular, 1.2~mm sources were resolvable, and the visibility and quantification of small sources are improved despite considerable sensitivity loss incurred by the modulator. Further studies are needed to better understand the theoretical aspects of the proposed approach and for optimizing the design of the modulator and the reconstruction algorithm in the presence of noise.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of post-processing pipelines for in vivo $^{31}$P MR imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16221v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: BACKGROUND: Low SNR is a persistent problem in X-nuclei imaging because of lower, gyromagnetic ratios and natural abundance as compared to hydrogen. Techniques to combat this is for example, high field MRI, multiple coil acquisitions, and denoising methods. PURPOSE: The purpose is to evaluate well established methods, such as Kaiser-Bessel regridding, NUFFT, adaptive coil combination, whitened-SVD, compress sensing, and MP-PCA on in vivo phosphor data. To establish which method is optimal under different circumstances for phosphor-GRE and bSSFP-like MRF imaging. SUBJECTS: 2 males, aged 18 and 45 years participated in the study, along with a 31-P phantom. SEQUENCE: 7T/stack of spiral acquisition using a double-tuned (Tx/Rx) birdcage coil along with a 32-channel receive (31-P) phased array coil. The GRE acquisition parameters were: readout 18.62 ms, flip angle (FA) 59{\deg}, repetition time (TR) 5400 ms, echo time (TE) 0.3 ms. The MRF acquisition used a bSSFP-like acquisition scheme with a readout of 9.12 ms, TR 19.8 ms, TE 0.3 ms. ASSESSMENT: The assessments were made through SNR-maps of the scans using different reconstruction, coil combination and denoising methods. Which were examined visually and numerically by applying masks. RESULTS(must have numerical data and statistical testing for each phrase): On the GRE-data (both phantom and in vivo) adaptive combine with Kaiser-Bessel regridding (KB) outperformed all other alternatives with SNRs of 38 a.u and 3.4 a.u compared to the second best performers with 17 a.u and 2.4 a.u. For MRF wSVD with KB outperformed the second best with a SNR of 18 a.u compared to 16 a.u. DATA CONCLUSION: For X-nuclei optimization of SNR and contrast we recommend on: GRE data using: KB, AC and MP-PCA, on MRF data: KB or NUFFT, wSVD, and MP-PCA on data with CS on images.</description>
