      <title>Shill-Proof Auctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00475v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a single-item auction, a duplicitous seller may masquerade as one or more bidders in order to manipulate the clearing price. This paper characterizes auction formats that are shill-proof: a profit-maximizing seller has no incentive to submit any shill bids. We distinguish between strong shill-proofness, in which a seller with full knowledge of bidders' valuations can never profit from shilling, and weak shill-proofness, which requires only that the expected equilibrium profit from shilling is nonpositive. The Dutch auction (with suitable reserve) is the unique optimal and strongly shill-proof auction. Moreover, the Dutch auction (with no reserve) is the unique prior-independent auction that is both efficient and weakly shill-proof. While there are a multiplicity of strategy-proof, weakly shill-proof, and optimal auctions; any optimal auction can satisfy only two properties in the set {static, strategy-proof, weakly shill-proof}.</description>

      <title>Call the Dentist! A (Con-)Cavity in the Value of Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A natural way of quantifying the ``amount of information'' in decision problems yields a globally concave value for information. Another (in contrast, adversarial) way almost never does.</description>

      <title>Non-Smooth Integrability Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.04770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.04770v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a method for calculating the utility function from a candidate of a demand function that is not differentiable, but is locally Lipschitz. Using this method, we obtain two new necessary and sufficient conditions for a candidate of a demand function to be a demand function. The first concerns the Slutsky matrix, and the second is the existence of a concave solution to a partial differential equation. Moreover, we show that the upper semi-continuous weak order that corresponds to the demand function is unique, and that this weak order is represented by our calculated utility function. We provide applications of these results to econometric theory. First, we show that, under several requirements, if a sequence of demand functions converges to some function with respect to the metric of compact convergence, then the limit is also a demand function. Second, the space of demand functions that have uniform Lipschitz constants on any compact set is compact under the above metric. Third, the mapping from a demand function to the calculated utility function becomes continuous. We also show a similar result on the topology of pointwise convergence.</description>

      <title>Strategy-proofness with single-peaked and single-dipped preferences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.05781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.05781v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze the problem of locating a public facility in a domain of single-peaked and single-dipped preferences when the social planner knows the type of preference (single-peaked or single-dipped) of each agent. Our main result characterizes all strategy-proof rules and shows that they can be decomposed into two steps. In the first step, the agents with single-peaked preferences are asked about their peaks and, for each profile of reported peaks, at most two alternatives are preselected. In the second step, the agents with single-dipped preferences are asked to reveal their dips to complete the decision between the preselected alternatives. Our result generalizes the findings of Moulin (1980) and Barber\`a and Jackson (1994) for single-peaked and of Manjunath (2014) for single-dipped preferences. Finally, we show that all strategy-proof rules are also group strategy-proof and analyze the implications of Pareto efficiency.</description>

      <title>Can One Hear the Shape of a Decision Problem?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06344v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the connection between an agent's decision problem and her ranking of information structures. We find that a finite amount of ordinal data on the agent's ranking of experiments is enough to identify her (finite) set of undominated actions (up to relabeling and duplication) and the beliefs rendering each such action optimal. An additional smattering of cardinal data, comparing the relative value to the agent of finitely many pairs of experiments, identifies her utility function up to an action-independent payoff.</description>

      <title>Structural Complexities of Matching Mechanisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.08709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.08709v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study various novel complexity measures for two-sided matching mechanisms, applied to the two canonical strategyproof matching mechanisms, Deferred Acceptance (DA) and Top Trading Cycles (TTC). Our metrics are designed to capture the complexity of various structural (rather than computational) concerns, in particular ones of recent interest within economics. We consider a unified, flexible approach to formalizing our questions: Define a protocol or data structure performing some task, and bound the number of bits that it requires. Our main results apply this approach to four questions of general interest; for mechanisms matching applicants to institutions, our questions are:
  (1) How can one applicant affect the outcome matching?
  (2) How can one applicant affect another applicant's set of options?
  (3) How can the outcome matching be represented / communicated?
  (4) How can the outcome matching be verified?
  Holistically, our results show that TTC is more complex than DA, formalizing previous intuitions that DA has a simpler structure than TTC. For question (2), our result gives a new combinatorial characterization of which institutions are removed from each applicant's set of options when a new applicant is added in DA; this characterization may be of independent interest. For question (3), our result gives new tight lower bounds proving that the relationship between the matching and the priorities is more complex in TTC than in DA. We nonetheless showcase that this higher complexity of TTC is nuanced: By constructing new tight lower-bound instances and new verification protocols, we prove that DA and TTC are comparable in complexity under questions (1) and (4). This more precisely delineates the ways in which TTC is more complex than DA, and emphasizes that diverse considerations must factor into gauging the complexity of matching mechanisms.</description>
