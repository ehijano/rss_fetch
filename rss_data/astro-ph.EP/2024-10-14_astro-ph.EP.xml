      <title>Thousands of planetesimals: Simulating the streaming Instability in very large computational domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08347v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The streaming instability is a mechanism whereby pebble-sized particles in protoplanetary discs spontaneously come together in dense filaments, which collapse gravitationally to form planetesimals upon reaching the Roche density. The extent of the filaments along the orbital direction is nevertheless poorly characterised, due to a focus in the literature on small simulation domains where the behaviour of the streaming instability on large scales cannot be determined. We present here computer simulations of the streaming instability in boxes with side lengths up to 6.4 scale heights in the plane. This is 32 times larger than typically considered simulation domains and nearly a factor 1,000 times the volume. We show that the azimuthal extent of filaments in the non-linear state of the streaming instability is limited to approximately one gas scale height. The streaming instability will therefore not transform the pebble density field into axisymmetric rings; rather the non-linear state of the streaming instability appears as a complex structure of loosely connected filaments. Including the self-gravity of the pebbles, our simulations form up to 4,000 planetesimals. This allows us to probe the high-mass end of the initial mass function of planetesimals with much higher statistical confidence than previously. We find that this end is well-described by a steep exponential tapering. Since the resolution of our simulations is moderate -- a necessary trade-off given the large domains -- the mass distribution is incomplete at the low-mass end. When putting comparatively less weight on the numbers at low masses, at intermediate masses we nevertheless reproduce the power-law shape of the distribution established in previous studies.</description>

      <title>Assessing Core-Powered Mass Loss in the Context of Early Boil-Off: Minimal Long-Lived Mass Loss for the Sub-Neptune Population</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08577v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a python-based state-of-the-art sub-Neptune evolution model that incorporates both the post-formation boil-off at young ages $\leq$ 1 Myr and long-lived core-powered mass loss ($\sim$ Gyrs) from interior cooling. We investigate the roles of initial H/He entropy, core luminosity, energy advection, radiative atmospheric structure, and the transition to an XUV-driven mass-loss phase, with an eye on relevant timescales for planetary mass loss and thermal evolution. With particular attention to the re-equilibration process of the H/He envelope, including the energy sources that fuel the hydrodynamic wind, and energy transport timescales, we find boil-off and core-powered escape are primarily driven by stellar bolometric radiation. We further find that both boil-off and core-powered escape are decoupled from the thermal evolution. We show that, with a boil-off phase that accounts for the initial H/He mass fraction and initial entropy, post-boil-off core-powered escape has an insignificant influence on the demographics of small planets, as it is only able to remove at most 0.1% of the H/He mass fraction. Our numerical results are directly compared to previous work on analytical core-powered mass loss modeling for individual evolutionary trajectories and populations of small planets. We examine a number of assumptions made in previous studies that cause significant differences compared to our findings. We find that boil-off, though able to completely strip the gaseous envelope from a highly irradiated ($F \geq 100 F_\oplus$) planet that has a low-mass core ($M_c \leq 4M_\oplus$), cannot by itself form a pronounced radius gap as is seen in the observed population.</description>

      <title>Solid-liquid phase change in planetary cores</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08685v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ubiquitous phenomena of crystallization and melting occur in various geophysical contexts across many spatial and temporal scales. In particular, they take place in the iron core of terrestrial planets and moons, profoundly influencing their dynamics and magnetic field generation. Crystallization and melting entail intricate multiphase flows, buoyancy effects, and out-of-equilibrium thermodynamics, posing challenges for theoretical modeling and numerical simulations. Besides, due to the inaccessible nature of the planetary deep interior, our understanding relies on indirect data from seismology, mineral physics, geochemistry, and magnetism. Consequently, phase-change-driven flows in planetary cores constitute a compelling yet challenging area of research. This paper provides an overview of the role of laboratory fluid dynamics experiments in elucidating the solid-liquid phase change phenomena occurring thousands of kilometers beneath our feet and within other planetary depths, along with their dynamic repercussions. Drawing parallel with metallurgy, it navigates through all scales of phase change dynamics, from microscopic processes (nucleation and crystal growth) to macroscopic consequences (solid-liquid segregation and large-scale flows). The review delves into the two primary planetary solidification regimes, top-down and bottom-up, and elucidates the formation of mushy and/or slurry layers in the various relevant configurations. Additionally, it outlines remaining challenges, including insights from ongoing space missions poised to unveil the diverse planetary regimes.</description>

      <title>Evidence for Abiotic Dimethyl Sulfide in Cometary Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Technological progress related to astronomical observatories such as the recently launched James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) allows searching for signs of life beyond our Solar System, namely in the form of unambiguous biosignature gases in exoplanetary atmospheres. The tentative assignment of a $1-2.4\sigma$ spectral feature observed with JWST in the atmosphere of exoplanet K2-18b to the biosignature gas dimethyl sulfide (DMS; sum formula C$_2$H$_6$S) raised hopes that, although controversial, a second genesis had been found. Terrestrial atmospheric DMS is exclusively stemming from marine biological activity and no natural abiotic source has been identified - neither on Earth nor in space. Therefore, DMS is considered a robust biosignature. Since comets possess a pristine inventory of complex organic molecules of abiotic origin, we have searched high-resolution mass spectra collected at comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, target of the European Space Agency's Rosetta mission, for the signatures of DMS. Previous work reported the presence of a C2H6S signal when the comet was near its equinox but distinction of DMS from its structural isomer ethanethiol remained elusive. Here we reassess these and evaluate additional data. Based on differences in the electron ionization induced fragmentation pattern of the two isomers, we show that DMS is significantly better compatible with the observations. Deviations between expected and observed signal intensities for DMS are $&lt;1\sigma$, while for ethanethiol they are $2-4\sigma$. The local abundance of DMS relative to methanol deduced from these data is (0.13$\pm$0.04)%. Our results provide the first evidence for the existence of an abiotic synthetic pathway to DMS in pristine cometary matter and hence motivate more detailed studies of the sulfur chemistry in such matter and its analogs.

      <title>Atmospheric escape in hot Jupiters under sub-Alfv\'enic interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08881v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hot Jupiters might reside inside the Alfv\'en surface of their host star wind, where the stellar wind is dominated by magnetic energy. The implications of such a sub-Alfv\'enic environment for atmospheric escape are not fully understood. Here, we employ 3-D radiation-magnetohydrodynamic simulations and Lyman-$\alpha$ transit calculations to investigate atmospheric escape properties of magnetised hot Jupiters. By varying the planetary magnetic field strength ($B_p$) and obliquity, we find that the structure of the outflowing atmosphere transitions from a magnetically unconfined regime, where a tail of material streams from the nightside of the planet, to a magnetically confined regime, where material escapes through the polar regions. Notably, we find an increase in the planet escape rate with $B_p$ in both regimes, with a local decrease when the planet transitions from the unconfined to the confined regime. Contrary to super-Alfv\'enic interactions, which predicted two polar outflows from the planet, our sub-Alfv\'enic models show only one significant polar outflow. In the opposing pole, the planetary field lines connect to the star. Finally, our synthetic Ly-$\alpha$ transits show that both the red-wing and blue-wing absorptions increase with $B_p$. Furthermore, there is a degeneracy between $B_p$ and the stellar wind mass-loss rate when considering absorption of individual Lyman-$\alpha$ wings. This degeneracy can be broken by considering the ratio between the blue-wing and the red-wing absorptions, as stronger stellar winds result in higher blue-to-red absorption ratios. We show that, by using the absorption ratios, Lyman-$\alpha$ transits can probe stellar wind properties and exoplanetary magnetic fields.</description>

      <title>Hidden under a warm blanket: If planets existed in protostellar disks, they would hardly produce observable substructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09042v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The onset of planet formation is actively under debate. Recent mass measurements of disks around protostars suggest an early start of planet formation in the Class 0/I disks. However, dust substructures, one possible signature of forming planets, are rarely observed in the young Class 0/I disks, while they are ubiquitous in the mature Class II disks. It is not clear whether the lack of dust substructures in the Class 0/I disks indicates absence of planets or whether it is due to other physical effects such as temperature and dust opacity. Here we consider the effect of temperature on the ability of planets to produce dust substructures. We prescribe the evolution of the disk and the protostar from Class 0 to Class II phase and calculate the disk temperature using radiative transfer models at various stages of the evolution. We use the mid-plane temperature to calculate the disk scale height and the minimum planet mass needed to open observable dust gaps using the thermal criterion. We find that this minimum planet mass decreases as a function of time. Particularly, we find that if a planet up to ${\sim}5$ M$_{\oplus}$ in the inner ${\sim}5$ au or up to ${\sim}10-50$ M$_{\oplus}$ at radii ${\gtrsim}5$ au was already formed in the early protostellar phase ($t&lt; 2\times 10^5$ yr) it would barely produce any dust substructures. We conclude that a major contribution to the observed lack of substructures (if produced by planets) in the early protostellar phase - lowering their frequency by ${\sim}50\%$ - could be elevated temperatures rather than the absence of planets.</description>

Abstract: In this third installment of SETI in 20xx, we very briefly and subjectively review developments in SETI in 2022. Our primary focus is 80 papers and books published or made public in 2022, which we sort into six broad categories: results from actual searches, new search methods and instrumentation, target and frequency selection, the development of technosignatures, theory of ETIs, and social aspects of SETI.</description>

      <title>The evolutionary history of GD1400, a white dwarf-brown dwarf binary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08716v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: GD1400AB was one of the first known white dwarf$+$brown dwarf binaries, and is the only one of these systems where the white dwarf is a ZZ Ceti pulsator. Here we present both radial velocity measurements and time series photometry, analysing both the white dwarf pulsations and the effects of irradiation on the brown dwarf. We find the brightness temperatures of 1760$/pm$10 K for the night side and 1860$/pm$10 K for the day side indicate the brown dwarf is hotter than spectra have previously suggested, although brightness temperatures calculated using a larger radius for the brown dwarf are consistent with previously determined spectral types. We also discuss the likely evolutionary pathway of this binary, and put its common envelope phase into context with the other known systems.</description>

      <title>BD+44 493: Chemo-Dynamical Analysis and Constraints on Companion Planetary Masses from WIYN/NEID Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08943v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we present high-resolution (R~100,000), high signal-to-noise (S/N~800) spectroscopic observations for the well-known, bright, extremely metal-poor, carbon-enhanced star BD+44 493. We determined chemical abundances and upper limits for 17 elements from WIYN/NEID data, complemented with 11 abundances re-determined from Subaru and Hubble data, using the new, more accurate, stellar atmospheric parameters calculated in this work. Our analysis suggests that BD+44 493 is a low-mass (0.83Msun) old (12.1-13.2Gyr) second-generation star likely formed from a gas cloud enriched by a single metal-free 20.5Msun Population III star in the early Universe. With a disk-like orbit, BD+44 493 does not appear to be associated with any major merger event in the early history of the Milky Way. From the precision radial-velocity NEID measurements (median absolute deviation - MAD=16m/s), we were able to constrain companion planetary masses around BD+44 493 and rule out the presence of planets as small as msin(i)=2MJ out to periods of 100 days. This study opens a new avenue of exploration for the intersection between stellar archaeology and exoplanet science using NEID.</description>

      <title>Microphysical Prescriptions for Parameterized Water Cloud Formation on Ultra-cool Substellar Objects</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08958v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Water must condense into ice clouds in the coldest brown dwarfs and exoplanets. When they form, these icy clouds change the emergent spectra, temperature structure, and albedo of the substellar atmosphere. The properties of clouds are governed by complex microphysics but these complexities are often not captured by the simpler parameterized cloud models used in climate models or retrieval models. Here, we combine microphysical cloud modeling and 1D climate modeling to incorporate insights from microphysical models into a self-consistent, parameterized cloud model. Using the 1D Community Aerosol and Radiation Model for Atmospheres (CARMA), we generate microphysical water clouds and compare their properties with those from the widely-used EddySed cloud model (Ackerman &amp; Marley 2001) for a grid of Y dwarfs. We find that the mass of water condensate in our CARMA water clouds is significantly limited by available condensation nuclei; in models without additional seed particles for clouds added, the atmosphere becomes supersaturated. We incorporate water latent heat release in the convective and radiative parts of the atmosphere and find no significant impact on water-ice cloud formation for typical gas giant compositions. Our analysis reveals the CARMA cloud profiles have a gradual decrease in opacity of approximately 4% per bar below the cloud base. Incorporating this gradual cloud base falloff and a variable $f_{sed}$ parameter allows spectra generated from the parameterized Eddysed model to better match those of the microphysical CARMA model. This work provides recommendations for efficiently generating microphysically-informed water clouds for future models of cold substellar objects with H/He atmospheres.</description>

      <title>Effect of different stickiness between icy and silicate particles on carbon depletion in protoplanetary disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07047v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Earth and other rocky bodies in the inner Solar System are significantly depleted in carbon compared to the Sun and interstellar medium (ISM) dust. Observations indicate that over half of carbon in the ISM and comets is in refractory forms, like amorphous hydrocarbons and complex organics, which can be building blocks of rocky bodies. While amorphous hydrocarbons are destroyed by photolysis and oxidation, radial transport of solid particles can limit carbon depletion, except when complex organics, which are less refractory, are the main carbon source. We aim to identify conditions for severe carbon depletion in the inner Solar System by introducing more realistic factors: differences in stickiness between icy and silicate particles, and high-temperature regions in the disk's upper optically-thin layer, which were not considered in previous studies. We perform a 3D Monte Carlo simulation of radial drift and turbulent diffusion in a steady accretion disk, incorporating ice evaporation/re-condensation, photolysis/oxidation of hydrocarbons in the upper layer, and pyrolysis of complex organics. Our results show that the carbon fraction drops by two orders of magnitude inside the snow line under two conditions: i) silicate particles are much less sticky than icy particles, leading to a rapid decline in icy pebble flux while silicates accumulate inside the snow line, and ii) high-temperature regions in the disk's upper layer stir silicate particles into UV-exposed areas. These conditions reproduce carbon depletion patterns consistent with observations and allow for diverse carbon fractions in rocky bodies. This diversity may explain the wide variation of metals in white dwarf photospheres and suggest different surface environments for rocky planets in habitable zones.</description>

      <title>A network of cooler white dwarfs as infrared standards for flux calibration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06754v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The accurate flux calibration of observational data is vital for astrophysics and cosmology because absolute flux uncertainties of stellar standards propagate into scientific results. With the ever higher precision achieved by telescopic missions (e.g. JWST) in the infrared (IR), suitable calibrators are required for this regime. The basis of the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) flux scale is defined by model fits of three hot (Teff &gt; 30000 K) hydrogen-atmosphere (DA) white dwarfs, which achieve an accuracy better than 1 per cent at optical wavelengths but falls below this level in the IR range. We present a network of 17 cooler DA white dwarfs with Teff &lt; 20000 K as spectrophotometric flux standards that are equally, if not more, accurate at IR wavelengths. Cooler white dwarfs do not suffer from non-local thermal equilibrium (NLTE) effects in continuum flux or from UV metal line blanketing, have a larger sky density, are generally closer to Earth with little or negligible interstellar reddening, and have energy distributions peaking in the optical or near-IR. Using the latest grid of DA LTE atmosphere models with three-dimensional (3D) convection, the observed Space Telescope Imaging Spectrometer (STIS) and Wide Field Camera three (WFC3) fluxes of our network are accurate to 3 per cent over most of the range 1450 - 16000 AA, with a median standard deviation of 1.41 per cent. Fitting the HST STIS and WFC3 white dwarf SEDs and Balmer lines independently yields SEDs that agree within 3$\sigma$, which demonstrates the precision of the models for our network.</description>
