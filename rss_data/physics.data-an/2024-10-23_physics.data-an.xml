      <title>An Analytical Approach to the Jaccard Similarity Index</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Jaccard similarity index has often been employed in science and technology as a means to quantify the similarity between two sets. When modified to operate on real-valued values, the Jaccard similarity index can be applied to compare vectors, an operation which plays a central role in visualization, classification, and modeling. The present work aims at developing an analytical approach for estimating the probability density of the Jaccard similarity values as implied by set of data elements characterized by specific statistical densities, with emphasis on the uniform and normal cases. Several theoretical and practical situations can benefit directly from such an approach, as it allows several of the properties of the similarity comparisons among a given dataset to be better understood and anticipated. Situations in which the described approach can be applied include the estimation and visualization of data interrelationships in terms of similarity networks, as well as diverse problems in data analysis, pattern recognition and scientific modeling. In addition to presenting the analytical developments and results, examples are also provided in order to illustrate the potential of the approach. The work also includes extension of the reported developments to modifications of the Jaccard index intended for regularization and control of the sharpness of the implemented comparisons.</description>

      <title>Exploring how deep learning decodes anomalous diffusion via Grad-CAM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16345v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While deep learning has been successfully applied to the data-driven classification of anomalous diffusion mechanisms, how the algorithm achieves the feat still remains a mystery. In this study, we use a well-known technique aimed at achieving explainable AI, namely the Gradient-weighted Class Activation Map (Grad-CAM), to investigate how deep learning (implemented by ResNets) recognizes the distinctive features of a particular anomalous diffusion model from the raw trajectory data. Our results show that Grad-CAM reveals the portions of the trajectory that hold crucial information about the underlying mechanism of anomalous diffusion, which can be utilized to enhance the robustness of the trained classifier against the measurement noise. Moreover, we observe that deep learning distills unique statistical characteristics of different diffusion mechanisms at various spatiotemporal scales, with larger-scale (smaller-scale) features identified at higher (lower) layers.</description>

      <title>Measuring spin-noise correlation function via time reversal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16413v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a simple method of measuring the autocorrelation function of a spin noise based on multiplication and averaging two digitized signal traces, with one of them being a time-reversed copy of the other. This procedure allows one to obtain, with lower computational expenses, all the information usually derived in the Fourier transform spin-noise spectroscopy, retaining all the merits of the latter. We successfully applied this method to the measurements of spin noise in cesium vapors by using a digital oscilloscope in the capacity of the analog-to-digital converter. Specific opportunities of this experimental approach as applied to a more general problem of studying the nature of light-intensity noise are discussed.</description>

      <title>Parsimonious Dynamic Mode Decomposition: A Robust and Automated Approach for Optimally Sparse Mode Selection in Complex Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16656v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces the Parsimonious Dynamic Mode Decomposition (parsDMD), a novel algorithm designed to automatically select an optimally sparse subset of dynamic modes for both spatiotemporal and purely temporal data. By incorporating time-delay embedding and leveraging Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP), parsDMD ensures robustness against noise and effectively handles complex, nonlinear dynamics. The algorithm is validated on a diverse range of datasets, including standing wave signals, identifying hidden dynamics, fluid dynamics simulations (flow past a cylinder and transonic buffet), and atmospheric sea-surface temperature (SST) data. ParsDMD addresses a significant limitation of the traditional sparsity-promoting DMD (spDMD), which requires manual tuning of sparsity parameters through a rigorous trial-and-error process to balance between single-mode and all-mode solutions. In contrast, parsDMD autonomously determines the optimally sparse subset of modes without user intervention, while maintaining minimal computational complexity. Comparative analyses demonstrate that parsDMD consistently outperforms spDMD by providing more accurate mode identification and effective reconstruction in noisy environments. These advantages render parsDMD an effective tool for real-time diagnostics, forecasting, and reduced-order model construction across various disciplines.</description>

      <title>Why aphids are not pests in cacao? An approach based on a predator-prey model with aging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06861v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We studied a mean-field predator-prey model with aging to simulate
  the \mbox{interaction} between aphids (\textit{Toxoptera aurantii})
  and syrphid larvae in \mbox{cacao} farms in Ilheus, Bahia. Based on
  the classical predator-prey model, we \mbox{propose} a system of
  differential equations with three rate equations. \mbox{Unlike} the
  original Lotka-Volterra model, our model includes two aphid
  population classes: juveniles (non-breeding) and adult females
  (asexually breeding). We obtained steady-state solutions for
  juvenile and adult populations by \mbox{analyzing} the stability of
  the fixed points as a function of model \mbox{parameters}. The
  results show that the absorbing state (zero prey population) is
  always possible, but not consistently stable. A nonzero stationary
  solution is achievable with appropriate parameter values. Using
  phase diagrams, we analyzed the \mbox{stationary} solution,
  providing a comprehensive understanding of the \mbox{dynamics}
  involved. Simulations on complete graphs yielded \mbox{results}
  closely matching the differential equations. We also
  \mbox{performed} simulations on \mbox{random} networks to highlight
  the influence of \mbox{network} topology on \mbox{system}
  behavior. Our findings highlight the critical role of life-stage
  structure, \mbox{predation}, and spatial variation in stabilizing
  predator-prey \mbox{systems}. This emphasizes the importance of
  network effects in population dynamics and refines the framework for
  biological pest control in agriculture. Ultimately, our research
  contributes to sustainable agricultural practices.</description>
