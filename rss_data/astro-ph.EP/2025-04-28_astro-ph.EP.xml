      <title>Explainable Deep-Learning Based Potentially Hazardous Asteroids Classification Using Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18605v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classifying potentially hazardous asteroids (PHAs) is crucial for planetary defense and deep space navigation, yet traditional methods often overlook the dynamical relationships among asteroids. We introduce a Graph Neural Network (GNN) approach that models asteroids as nodes with orbital and physical features, connected by edges representing their similarities, using a NASA dataset of 958,524 records. Despite an extreme class imbalance with only 0.22% of the dataset with the hazardous label, our model achieves an overall accuracy of 99% and an AUC of 0.99, with a recall of 78% and an F1-score of 37% for hazardous asteroids after applying the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique. Feature importance analysis highlights albedo, perihelion distance, and semi-major axis as main predictors. This framework supports planetary defense missions and confirms AI's potential in enabling autonomous navigation for future missions such as NASA's NEO Surveyor and ESA's Ramses, offering an interpretable and scalable solution for asteroid hazard assessment.</description>

      <title>exoALMA VII: Benchmarking Hydrodynamics and Radiative Transfer Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Forward modeling is often used to interpret substructures observed in protoplanetary disks. To ensure the robustness and consistency of the current forward modeling approach from the community, we conducted a systematic comparison of various hydrodynamics and radiative transfer codes. Using four grid-based hydrodynamics codes (FARGO3D, Idefix, Athena++, PLUTO) and a smoothed particle hydrodynamics code (Phantom), we simulated a protoplanetary disk with an embedded giant planet. We then used two radiative transfer codes (mcfost, RADMC-3D) to calculate disk temperatures and create synthetic 12CO cubes. Finally, we retrieved the location of the planet from the synthetic cubes using DISCMINER. We found strong consistency between the hydrodynamics codes, particularly in the density and velocity perturbations associated with planet-driven spirals. We also found a good agreement between the two radiative transfer codes: the disk temperature in mcfost and RADMC-3D models agrees within $\lesssim 3~\%$ everywhere in the domain. In synthetic $^{12}$CO channel maps, this results in brightness temperature differences within $\pm1.5$ K in all our models. This good agreement ensures consistent retrieval of planet's radial/azimuthal location with only a few % of scatter, with velocity perturbations varying $\lesssim 20~\%$ among the models. Notably, while the planet-opened gap is shallower in the Phantom simulation, we found that this does not impact the planet location retrieval. In summary, our results demonstrate that any combination of the tested hydrodynamics and radiative transfer codes can be used to reliably model and interpret planet-driven kinematic perturbations.</description>

      <title>exoALMA I. Science Goals, Project Design and Data Products</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.18688v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Planet formation is a hugely dynamic process requiring the transport, concentration and assimilation of gas and dust to form the first planetesimals and cores. With access to extremely high spatial and spectral resolution observations at unprecedented sensitivities, it is now possible to probe the planet forming environment in detail. To this end, the exoALMA Large Program targeted fifteen large protoplanetary disks ranging between ${\sim}1\arcsec$ and ${\sim}7\arcsec$ in radius, and mapped the gas and dust distributions. $^{12}$CO J=3-2, $^{13}$CO J=3-2 and CS J=7-6 molecular emission was imaged at high angular (${\sim}~0\farcs15$) and spectral (${\sim}~100~{\rm m\,s^{-1}}$) resolution, achieving a surface brightness temperature sensitivity of ${\sim}1.5$~K over a single channel, while the 330~GHz continuum emission was imaged at 90~mas resolution and achieved a point source sensitivity of ${\sim}\,40~\mu{\rm Jy~beam^{-1}}$. These observations constitute some of the deepest observations of protoplanetary disks to date. Extensive substructure was found in all but one disk, traced by both dust continuum and molecular line emission. In addition, the molecular emission allowed for the velocity structure of the disks to be mapped with excellent precision (uncertainties on the order of $10~{\rm m\,s^{-1}}$), revealing a variety of kinematic perturbations across all sources. From this sample it is clear that, when observed in detail, all disks appear to exhibit physical and dynamical substructure indicative of on-going dynamical processing due to young, embedded planets, large-scale, (magneto-)hydrodynamical instabilities or winds.</description>

      <title>A Search for Exoplanet Candidates in TESS 2-min Light Curves using Joint Bayesian Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18706v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we apply an exploratory joint Bayesian transit detector (Taaki et al. 2020), previously evaluated using Kepler data, to the 2 min simple aperture photometry light curve data in the continuous viewing zone for the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) over three years of observation. The detector uses Bayesian priors, adaptively estimated, to model unknown systematic noise and stellar variability incorporated in a Neyman-Pearson likelihood ratio test for a candidate transit signal; a primary goal of the algorithm is to reduce overfitting. The detector was adapted to the TESS data and refined to improve outlier rejection and suppress false alarm detections in post-processing. The statistical performance of the detector was evaluated using transit injection tests, where the joint Bayesian detector achieves an 80.0 % detection rate and a 19.1% quasi-false alarm rate at a detection threshold {\tau} = 10; this is a marginal, although not statistically significant, improvement of 0.2% over a reference sequential detrending and detection algorithm. In addition, a full search of the input TESS data was performed to evaluate the recovery rate of known TESS objects of interest (TOI) and to perform an independent search for new exoplanet candidates. The joint detector has a 73% recall rate and a 63% detection rate for known TOI; the former considers a match against all detection statistics above threshold while the latter considers only the maximum detection statistic.</description>

      <title>exoALMA. X. channel maps reveal complex $^{12}$CO abundance distributions and a variety of kinematic structures with evidence for embedded planets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18717v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the $^{12}$CO $J=3-2$ data cubes of the disks in the exoALMA program. 13/15 disks reveal a variety of kinematic substructures in individual channels: large-scale arcs or spiral arms, localized velocity kinks, and/or multiple faints arcs that appear like filamentary structures on the disk surface. We find kinematic signatures that are consistent with planet wakes in six disks: AA Tau, SY Cha, J1842, J1615, LkCa 15 and HD 143006. Comparison with hydrodynamical and radiative transfer simulations suggests planets with orbital radii between 80 and 310\,au and masses between 1 and 5 M$_\mathrm{Jup}$. Additional kinematic substructures limit our ability to place tight constraints on the planet masses. When the inclination is favorable to separate the upper and lower surfaces (near 45$^\mathrm{o}$, i.e. in 7/15 disks), we always detect the vertical CO snowline and find that the $^{12}$CO freeze-out is partial in the disk midplane, with a depletion factor of $\approx 10^{-3}$ - $10^{-2}$ compared to the warm molecular layer. In these same seven disks, we also systematically detect evidence of CO desorption in the outer regions.</description>

      <title>exoALMA IV: Substructures, Asymmetries, and the Faint Outer Disk in Continuum Emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18725v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The exoALMA Large Program targeted a sample of 15 disks to study gas dynamics within these systems, and these observations simultaneously produced continuum data at 0.9 mm (331.6 GHz) with exceptional surface brightness sensitivity at high angular resolution. To provide a robust characterization of the observed substructures, we performed a visibility space analysis of the continuum emission from the exoALMA data, characterizing axisymmetric substructures and nonaxisymmetric residuals obtained by subtracting an axisymmetric model from the observed data. We defined a nonaxisymmetry index and found that the most asymmetric disks predominantly show an inner cavity and consistently present higher values of mass accretion rate and near-infrared excess. This suggests a connection between outer disk dust substructures and inner disk properties. The depth of the data allowed us to describe the azimuthally averaged continuum emission in the outer disk, revealing that larger disks (both in dust and gas) in our sample tend to be gradually tapered compared to the sharper outer edge of more compact sources. Additionally, the data quality revealed peculiar features in various sources, such as shadows, inner disk offsets, tentative external substructures, and a possible dust cavity wall.</description>

      <title>exoALMA XII: Weighing and sizing exoALMA disks with rotation curve modelling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18726v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The exoALMA large program offers a unique opportunity to investigate the fundamental properties of protoplanetary disks, such as their masses and sizes, providing important insights in the mechanism responsible for the transport of angular momentum. In this work, we model the rotation curves of CO isotopologues $^{12}$CO and $^{13}$CO of ten sources within the exoALMA sample, and we constrain the stellar mass, the disk mass and the density scale radius through precise characterization of the pressure gradient and disk self gravity. We obtain dynamical disk masses for our sample measuring the self-gravitating contribution to the gravitational potential. We are able to parametrically describe their surface density, and all of them appear gravitationally stable. By combining dynamical disk masses with dust continuum emission data, we determine an averaged gas-to-dust ratio of approximately 400, not statistically consistent with the standard value of 100, assuming optically thin dust emission. In addition, the measurement of the dynamical scale radius allows for direct comparison with flux-based radii of gas and dust. This comparison suggests that substructures may influence the size of the dust disk, and that CO depletion might reconcile our measurements with thermochemical models. Finally, with the stellar mass, disk mass, scale radius, and accretion rate, and assuming self-similar evolution of the surface density, we constrain the effective $\alpha_S$ for these systems. We find a broad range of $\alpha_S$ values ranging between $10^{-5}$ and $10^{-2}$.</description>

      <title>Global Simulations of Gravitational Instability in Protostellar Disks with Full Radiation Transport II. Locality of Gravitoturbulence, Clumpy Spirals, and Implications for Observable Substructure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18751v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spiral perturbations in a gravitationally unstable accretion disk regulate disk evolution through angular-momentum transport and heating and provide an observational signature of gravitational instability (GI). We use global 3D simulations to systematically characterize and understand these spiral perturbations. The spiral perturbations and the resulting transport are overall insensitive to the cooling type, with the exception that radiative cooling, especially in the optically thick regime, reduces the amplitude of temperature perturbations. Spiral perturbations are localized around corotation, allowing transport to be approximated by a local $\alpha$ viscosity to zeroth order in aspect ratio ($H/R$), but only after averaging over multiple orbits in time and/or multiple scale heights in space. Meanwhile, large-amplitude perturbations from strong gravitoturbulence can cause $\mathcal O(\alpha^{1/2})$ deviation in the cooling rate of the disk. We develop empirical prescriptions for the angular-momentum transport, heating, and cooling in a gravitoturbulent disk that capture the deviation from a viscous, unperturbed disk to first order in $H/R$ and $\alpha^{1/2}$. The spiral perturbations in saturated gravitoturbulence are clumpy, with dense clumps forming through the nonlinear coupling between multiple modes at different $m$. Observationally, the clumpy gravitoturbulence produced by saturated GI can be mistaken with observational noise or embedded companions, especially under finite resolution. Meanwhile, grand-design spirals with $m$-fold symmetry may be uncommon among disks in saturated gravitoturbulence, and we speculate that they may instead be a signature of recently triggered or decaying GI.</description>

      <title>A Next-Generation Exoplanet Atmospheric Retrieval Framework for Transmission Spectroscopy (NEXOTRANS): Comparative Characterization for WASP-39 b Using JWST NIRISS, NIRSpec PRISM, and MIRI Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18815v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The advent of JWST has marked a new era in exoplanetary atmospheric studies, offering higher-resolution data and greater precision across a broader spectral range than previous space-based telescopes. Accurate analysis of these datasets requires advanced retrieval frameworks capable of navigating complex parameter spaces. We present NEXOTRANS, an atmospheric retrieval framework that integrates Bayesian inference using UltraNest/PyMultiNest with four machine learning algorithms: Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, K-Nearest Neighbor, and Stacking Regressor. This hybrid approach enables a comparison between traditional Bayesian methods and computationally efficient machine learning techniques. Additionally, NEXOTRANS incorporates NEXOCHEM, a module for solving equilibrium chemistry. We applied NEXOTRANS to JWST observations of the Saturn-mass exoplanet WASP-39 b, spanning wavelengths from 0.6 microns to 12.0 microns using NIRISS, NIRSpec PRISM, and MIRI. Four chemistry models-free, equilibrium, modified hybrid equilibrium, and modified equilibrium-offset chemistry-were explored to retrieve precise Volume Mixing Ratios (VMRs) for H2O, CO2, CO, H2S, and SO2. Absorption features in both NIRSpec PRISM and MIRI data constrained SO2 log VMRs to values between -6.67 and -5.31 for all models except equilibrium chemistry. High-altitude aerosols, including ZnS and MgSiO3, were inferred, with constraints on their VMRs, particle sizes, and terminator coverage fractions, providing insights into cloud composition. For the best-fit modified hybrid equilibrium model, we derived super-solar elemental abundances of O/H = 7.94 (+0.18/-0.18) x solar, C/H = 10.96 (+0.42/-0.41) x solar, and S/H = 3.98 (+0.29/-0.35) x solar, along with a C/O ratio of 1.17 (+0.03/-0.03) x solar, demonstrating NEXOTRANS's potential for atmospheric characterization in the JWST era and beyond.</description>

      <title>exoALMA IX: Regularized Maximum Likelihood Imaging of Non-Keplerian Features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19111v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The planet-hunting ALMA large program exoALMA observed 15 protoplanetary disks at ~0.15" angular resolution and ~100 m/s spectral resolution, characterizing disk structures and kinematics in enough detail to detect non-Keplerian features (NKFs) in the gas emission. As these features are often small and low-contrast, robust imaging procedures are critical for identifying and characterizing NKFs, including determining which features may be signatures of young planets. The exoALMA collaboration employed two different imaging procedures to ensure the consistent detection of NKFs: CLEAN, the standard iterative deconvolution algorithm, and regularized maximum likelihood (RML) imaging. This paper presents the exoALMA RML images, obtained by maximizing the likelihood of the visibility data given a model image and subject to regularizer penalties. Crucially, in the context of exoALMA, RML images serve as an independent verification of marginal features seen in the fiducial CLEAN images. However, best practices for synthesizing RML images of multi-channeled (i.e. velocity-resolved) data remain undefined, as prior work on RML imaging for protoplanetary disk data has primarily addressed single-image cases. We used the open source Python package MPoL to explore RML image validation methods for multi-channeled data and synthesize RML images from the exoALMA observations of 7 protoplanetary disks with apparent NKFs in the 12CO J=3-2 CLEAN images. We find that RML imaging methods independently reproduce the NKFs seen in the CLEAN images of these sources, suggesting that the NKFs are robust features rather than artifacts from a specific imaging procedure.</description>

Abstract: Icy ocean worlds attract significant interest for their astrobiological potential due to subsurface oceans, organics, and chemical energy sources. We quantify thermodynamic viability of metabolism-relevant reactions at pressure-temperature conditions of Enceladus, Europa, Titan, Ganymede, and the Lost City Hydrothermal Field for comparison. We examine the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and a plausible prebiotic reaction network leading to it, using DEWPython (based on the Deep Earth Water model) and SUPCRT to compute equilibrium constants and Gibbs free energy changes across temperatures from 0-1200{\deg}C and pressures between 1 bar-60 kbar. We found that across most oceanic P-T profiles, certain TCA cycle species accumulate (citrate, succinate) while others diminish (fumarate, oxaloacetate), suggesting ocean worlds' conditions may not thermodynamically favor a unidirectional TCA cycle, requiring additional energy to overcome bottlenecks. Similar bottlenecks exist at Lost City, which is inhabited. In the prebiotic network, pyruvate and acetate show remarkable stability, feeding the TCA cycle through citrate production, bypassing the oxaloacetate bottleneck. Formation of most TCA cycle species from inorganic compounds (CO$_2$ + H$_2$) is highly favored throughout ocean world geotherms, except for oxaloacetate. While based on uncertain chemical concentrations, our non-equilibrium thermodynamic predictions are relatively insensitive to activity changes and may aid interpretation of future mission data.

      <title>ExoALMA XIII. gas masses from N2H+ and C18O: a comparison of protoplanetary gas disk mass measurement techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19371v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The gas masses of protoplanetary disks are important but elusive quantities. In this work we present new ALMA observations of N2H+ (3-2) for 11 exoALMA disks. N2H+ is a molecule sensitive to CO freeze-out and has recently been shown to significantly improve the accuracy of gas masses estimated from CO line emission. We combine these new observations with archival N2H+ and CO isotopologue observations to measure gas masses for 19 disks, predominantly from the exoALMA Large program. For 15 of these disks the gas mass has also been measured using gas rotation curves. We show that the CO + N2H+ line emission-based gas masses typically agree with the kinematically measured ones within a factor 3 (1-2{\sigma}). Gas disk masses from CO + N2H+ are on average a factor 2.3(+0.7,-1.0) x lower than the kinematic disk masses, which could suggest slightly lower N2 abundances and/or lower midplane ionization rates than typically assumed. Herbig disks are found to have ISM level CO gas abundances based on their CO and N2H+ fluxes, which sets them apart from T-Tauri disks where abundances are typically 3-30x lower. The agreement between CO + N2H+ -based and kinematically measured gas masses is promising and shows that multi-molecule line fluxes are a robust tool to accurately measure disk masses at least for extended disks.</description>

      <title>exoALMA. VIII. Probabilistic Moment Maps and Data Products using Non-parametric Linear Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extracting robust inferences on physical quantities from disk kinematics measured from Doppler-shifted molecular line emission is challenging due to the data's size and complexity. In this paper we develop a flexible linear model of the intensity distribution in each frequency channel, accounting for spatial correlations from the point spread function. The analytic form of the model's posterior enables probabilistic data products through sampling. Our method debiases peak intensity, peak velocity, and line width maps, particularly in disk substructures that are only partially resolved. These are needed in order to measure disk mass, turbulence, pressure gradients, and to detect embedded planets. We analyse HD 135344B, MWC 758, and CQ Tau, finding velocity substructures 50--200 ${\rm m s^{-1}}$ greater than with conventional methods. Additionally, we combine our approach with discminer in a case study of J1842. We find that uncertainties in stellar mass and inclination increase by an order of magnitude due to the more realistic noise model. More broadly, our method can be applied to any problem requiring a probabilistic model of an intensity distribution conditioned on a point spread function.</description>

      <title>exoALMA XIV. Gas Surface Densities in the RX J1604.3-2130 A Disk from Pressure-broadened CO Line Wings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The gas surface density is one of the most relevant physical quantities in protoplanetary disks. However, its precise measurement remains highly challenging due to the lack of a direct tracer. In this study, we report the spatially-resolved detection of pressure-broadened line wings in the CO $J=3-2$ line in the RX J1604.3-2130 A transition disk as part of the exoALMA large program. Since pressure-broadened line wings are sensitive to the total gas volume density, we robustly constrain the radial dependence of the gas surface density and midplane pressure in the region located $50-110$ au from the central star, which encompasses the dust ring of the system. The peak radius of the midplane pressure profile matches the dust ring radial location, directly proving radial dust trapping at a gas pressure maximum. The peak gas surface density is $18-44\ {\rm g\ cm^{-2}}$} and decreases at radii interior to and exterior of the dust ring. A comparison of the gas and dust surface densities suggests that the disk turbulence is as low as $\alpha_{\rm turb} \sim 2\times10^{-4}$. Despite dust trapping, the gas-to-dust surface density ratio at the ring peak is { $70-400$}, which implies already-formed protoplanets and/or less efficient dust trapping. The gas surface density drop at radii interior to the ring is consistent with a gas gap induced by a Jupiter-mass planet. The total gas mass within $50 &lt; r &lt; 110$ au is estimated to be $\sim 0.05-0.1\ M_\odot$ ($50-100\ {M_{\rm Jup}}$), suggesting that planetary system formation is possible.</description>

      <title>Strong Toroidal Recirculation Zones at the Inner Dust Rim as the Origin of Meteoric Chondrules and Calcium-Aluminum Inclusions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We hypothesize strong (transonic) twin toroidal recirculation zones above and below the accretion disk midplane, rather close-in to the protosun, to be the source of chondrules and calcium-aluminum inclusions (CAIs). The recirculation zones act as centrifugal separators. In the case of chondrules, we suggest this happens during Class II (T~Tauri) stage of protostellar accretion, and in the case of CAIs, during an earlier higher-$\dot M$ phase of accretion. The recirculation zones advect and raise dust and solid aggregates above the midplane, making a ``mushroom-cap,'' and they also generate weak standing oblique shocks that heat and fuse protochondrules. We do not model the emission of these shocks, but point out that they will produce Doppler-broadened, possibly twin-peaked line emission with width of the order of $\simeq 200\ {\rm km\ s^{-1}}$. For concreteness, we focus on chondrules in the paper. Small ($\lessapprox 10 {\rm\ \mu m}$) diameter protochondrules are evaporated by the standing shocks, whereas large ($\gtrapprox 1\ {\rm cm}$) protochondrules are too heavy to be entrained and accelerated by the outer recirculation zone and outflow. Intermediate-size protochondrules, however, are centrifugally ejected and carried by high-speed diffuse gas outflow to the outer regions of the disk, where they rain down. The recirculation-induced dust mushroom caps will create significant IR continuum emission. We suggest they coincide with observed inner ``puffed-up'' dust rims. We also suggest that the recent interferometric inferences of arcs or ellipses in the sub-AU continuum IR of low-mass Class II protostars may be observations of corresponding chondrule-producing recirculation zones in those systems.</description>

      <title>Protoplanetary disk insights from the first ERIS/APP survey at 4 {\mu}m</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19810v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present high-contrast imaging observations of seven protoplanetary disks at 4um using the ERIS on the VLT. This study focuses on detecting scattered light from micron-sized dust particles and assessing the potential of the vAPP coronagraph for disk and planet characterization. Observations were performed in pupil-stabilized mode with the vAPP coronagraph. Data were reduced using reference differential imaging and angular differential imaging techniques, incorporating principal component analysis for point-source detection. Contrast curves and detection limits were computed for planetary companions and disk features. The infrared disk signal was resolved in all systems, with first-time 4um detections around AS 209 and Elias 2-24, revealing mostly axisymmetric structures extending up to 60au. Two gaps were detected in the radial profiles of TW Hya (22au, 35au) and AS 209 (50au, 100au). For Elias 2-24, scattered light emission matched ALMA observations of inner disk structures, marking their first mid-infrared detection. In the case of HD 100546, the vAPP uncovered flared disk structures and faint spiral arms consistent with previous observations. HD 163296 shows a bright inner dust ring, confirming disk asymmetries and features, but we did not detect any planet candidate within the achieved contrast limits. The disk around PDS 70 exhibits clear features, with faint structures detected within the cavity. The observations achieved contrasts enabling the detection of planets down to 800 K, but no companions were detected, implying either low-mass planets, cooler formation scenarios, or a large dust extinction of Av&gt;20 mag. The vAPP performed robustly for imaging structures in protoplanetary disks at 4um, providing critical insights into disk morphology and constraints on planet formation processes. No planetary-mass companions with temperatures &gt;1000K are present in our sample.</description>

      <title>A JWST Study of the Remarkable Oort Cloud Comet C/2017 K2 (PanSTARRS)</title>

Abstract: Comets, during their journeys into the inner solar system, deliver volatile gases, organics, and particulates into their comae that provide crucial information for assessing the physico-chemical conditions in the outer disk from which they formed. Here we present observational and modeling results of a JWST NIRSpec and MIRI MRS integral-field-unit (IFU) spatial-spectral study of the inner coma of the Oort Cloud comet C/2017 K2 (PanSTARRS) at a heliocentric distance of 2.35 au. We find the comet is hyperactive (water ice active fraction greater than or equal to 86%), with a nucleus radius of $&lt;$4.2 km, exhibiting strong emission from H$_{2}$O, $^{12}$CO, $^{13}$CO, and CO$_{2}$ as well as CN, H$_2$CO, CH$_3$OH, CH$_4$, C$_2$H$_6$, HCN, NH$_2$, and OH prompt emission. The water ortho-to-para ratio is greater than or equal to 2.75. The modeled dust composition (relative mass fraction of the sub-micron grains) in the coma is dominated by amorphous carbon ($\simeq 25$%), amorphous Mg:Fe olivine ($\simeq 19$%), amorphous Mg:Fe pyroxene ($\simeq 16$%), and Mg-rich crystalline olivine ($\simeq 39$%) and the crystalline mass fraction of the sub-micron grains in the coma is, $f_{cryst} \simeq 0.384 \pm 0.065$. Analysis of residuals in 3 to 8 $\mu$m region of the spectral energy distribution strongly suggests the presence of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAHs) species in the coma.</description>

      <title>exoALMA. XVI. Predicting Signatures of Large-scale Turbulence in Protoplanetary Disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19853v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Turbulent gas motions drive planet formation and protoplanetary disk evolution. However, empirical constraints on turbulence are scarce, halting our understanding of its nature. Resolving signatures of the large-scale perturbations driven by disk instabilities may reveal clues on the origin of turbulence in the outer regions of planet-forming disks. We aim to predict the observational signatures of such large-scale flows, as they would appear in high-resolution Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array observations of CO rotational lines, such as those conducted by the exoALMA Large Program. Post-processing 3D numerical simulations, we explored the observational signatures produced by three candidate (magneto-)hydrodynamical instabilities to operate in the outer regions of protoplanetary disks: the vertical shear instability (VSI), the magneto-rotational instability (MRI), and the gravitational instability (GI). We found that exoALMA-quality observations should capture signatures of the large-scale motions induced by these instabilities. Mainly, flows with ring, arc, and spiral morphologies are apparent in the residuals of synthetic velocity centroid maps. A qualitative comparison between our predictions and the perturbations recovered from exoALMA data suggests the presence of two laminar disks and a scarcity of ring- and arc-like VSI signatures within the sample. Spiral features produced by the MRI or the GI are still plausible in explaining observed disk perturbations. Supporting these scenarios requires further methodically comparing the predicted perturbations and the observed disks' complex dynamic structure.</description>

      <title>exoALMA XI: ALMA Observations and Hydrodynamic Models of LkCa 15: Implications for Planetary Mass Companions in the Dust Continuum Cavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19868v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the past decade, the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) has revealed a plethora of substructures in the disks surrounding young stars. These substructures have several proposed formation mechanisms, with one leading theory being the interaction between the disk and newly formed planets. In this Letter, we present high angular resolution ALMA observations of LkCa~15's disk that reveal a striking difference in dust and CO emission morphology. The dust continuum emission shows a ring-like structure characterized by a dust-depleted inner region of $\sim$40 au in radius. Conversely, the CO emission is radially smoother and shows no sign of gas depletion within the dust cavity. We compare the observations with models for the disk-planet interaction, including radiative transfer calculation in the dust and CO emission. This source is particularly interesting as the presence of massive planets within the dust cavity has been suggested based on previous NIR observations. We find that the level of CO emission observed within the dust cavity is inconsistent with the presence of planets more massive than Jupiter orbiting between 10-40 au. Instead, we argue that the LkCa~15 innermost dust cavity might be created either by a chain of low-mass planets, or by other processes that do not require the presence of planets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.19870v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The exoALMA Large Program was designed to search for subtle kinematic deviations from Keplerian motion, indicative of embedded planets, in high angular and spectral resolution Band 7 observations of $^{12}$CO, $^{13}$CO and CS emission from protoplanetary disks. This paper summarizes the calibration and imaging pipelines used by the exoALMA collaboration. With sources ranging in diameter from 2.4" to 13.8" when probed by $^{12}$CO, multiple antennae configurations were required to maximally recover all spatial information (including the ACA for 7 sources). Combining these datasets warranted particular care in their alignment during calibration and prior to imaging, so as not to introduce spurious features that might resemble the kinematic deviations being investigated. Phase decoherence was found in several datasets, which was corrected by an iterative self-calibration procedure, and we explored the effects of the order of operations of spatial alignment, flux scaling, and self-calibration. A number of different imaging sets were produced for the continuum and line emission, employing an iterative masking procedure that minimizes bias due to non-Keplerian motions in the disk.</description>

      <title>The Cosmic Shoreline Revisited: A Metric for Atmospheric Retention Informed by Hydrodynamic Escape</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19872v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The "cosmic shoreline", a semi-empirical relation that separates airless worlds from worlds with atmospheres as proposed by Zahnle &amp; Catling (2017), is now guiding large-scale JWST surveys aimed at detecting rocky exoplanet atmospheres. We expand upon this framework by revisiting the shorelines using existing hydrodynamic escape models applied to Earth-like, Venus-like, and steam atmospheres for rocky exoplanets, and we estimate energy-limited escape rates for CH4 atmospheres. We determine the critical instellation required for atmospheric retention by calculating time-integrated atmospheric mass loss. Our analysis introduces a new metric for target selection in the Rocky Worlds DDT and refines expectations for rocky planet atmosphere searches in Cycle 4. Exploring initial volatile inventory ranging from 0.01% to 1% of planetary mass, we find that its variation prevents the definition of a unique clear-cut shoreline, though non-linear escape physics can reduce this sensitivity to initial conditions. Additionally, uncertain distributions of high-energy stellar evolution and planet age further blur the critical instellations for atmospheric retention, yielding broad shorelines. Hydrodynamic escape models find atmospheric retention is markedly more favorable for higher-mass planets orbiting higher-mass stars, with carbon-rich atmospheres remaining plausible for 55 Cancri e despite its extreme instellation. Dedicated modeling efforts are needed to better constrain the escape dynamics of secondary atmospheres, such as the role of atomic line cooling, especially for Earth-sized planets. Finally, we illustrate how density measurements can be used to statistically test the existence of the cosmic shorelines, emphasizing the need for more precise mass and radius measurements.</description>

      <title>Lightning activity on a tidally locked terrestrial exoplanet in storm-resolving simulations for a range of surface pressures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19883v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cloudy atmospheres produce electric discharges, including lightning. Lightning, in turn, provides sufficient energy to break down air molecules into reactive species and thereby affects the atmospheric composition. The climate of tidally locked rocky exoplanets orbiting M-dwarf stars may have intense and highly localised thunderstorm activity associated with moist convection on their day side. The distribution and structure of lightning-producing convective clouds is shaped by various climate parameters, of which a key one is atmospheric mass, i.e. surface air pressure. In this study, we use a global storm-resolving climate model to predict thunderstorm occurrence for a tidally locked exoplanet over a range of surface pressures. We compare two lightning parameterisations: one based on ice cloud microphysics and one based on the vertical extent of convective clouds. We find that both parameterisations predict that the amount of lightning monotonically decreases with surface pressure due to weaker convection and fewer ice clouds. The spatial distribution of lightning on the planet changes with respect to the surface pressure, responding to the changes in the large-scale circulation and the vertical stratification of the atmosphere. Our study provides revised, high-resolution estimates for lightning activity on a tidally locked Earth-like exoplanet, with implications for global atmospheric chemistry.</description>

      <title>exoALMA V: Gaseous Emission Surfaces and Temperature Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19902v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Analysis of the gaseous component in protoplanetary disks can inform us about their thermal and physical structure, chemical composition, and kinematic properties, all of which are crucial for understanding various processes within the disks. By exploiting the asymmetry of the line emission, or via line profile analysis, we can locate the emitting surfaces. Here, we present the emission surfaces of the exoALMA sources in $^{12}$CO $J=3-2$, $^{13}$CO $J=3-2$, and CS $J=7-6$. We find that $^{12}$CO traces the upper disk atmosphere, with mean &lt;$z/r$&gt; values of $\approx$ 0.28, while $^{13}$CO and CS trace lower regions of the disk with mean &lt;z/r&gt; values of $\approx$ 0.16 and $\approx$ 0.18, respectively. We find that $^{12}$CO &lt;$z/r$&gt; and the disk mass are positively correlated with each other; this relationship offers a straightforward way to infer the disk mass. We derive 2-D $r-z$ temperature distributions of the disks. Additionally, we search for substructure in the surfaces and radial intensity profiles; we find evidence of localized substructure in the emission surfaces and peak intensity profiles of nearly every disk, with this substructure often being co-incident between molecular tracers, intensity profiles, and kinematic perturbations. Four disks display evidence of potential photo-desorption, implying that this effect may be common even in low FUV star-forming regions. For most disks, we find that the physical and thermal structure is more complex than analytical models can account for, highlighting a need for more theoretical work and a better understanding of the role of projection effects on our observations.</description>

      <title>exoALMA III: Line-intensity Modeling and System Property Extraction from Protoplanetary Disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19986v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ALMA large program exoALMA offers a unique window into the three-dimensional physical and dynamical properties of 15 circumstellar disks where planets may be actively forming. Here, we present an analysis methodology to map the gas disk structure and substructure encoded in 12CO, 13CO, and CS line emission from our targets. To model and characterize the disk structure probed by optically thin species, such as CS and, in some cases, 13CO, we introduce a composite line profile kernel that accounts for increased intensities caused by the projected overlap between the disk's front and back side emission. Our workflow, built on the Discminer modelling framework, incorporates an improved iterative two-component fitting method for inclined sources ($i&gt;40^\circ$), to mitigate the impact of the disk backside on the extraction of velocity maps. Also, we report best-fit parameters for the Keplerian stellar masses, as well as inclinations, position angles, systemic velocities, rotation direction, and emission surfaces of the disks in our sample.</description>

      <title>exoALMA XV: Interpreting the height of CO emission layer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20012v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The availability of exquisite data and the development of new analysis techniques have enabled the study of emitting heights in proto-planetary disks. In this paper we introduce a simple model linking the emitting height of CO to the disk surface density and temperature structure. We then apply the model to measurements of the emitting height and disk temperature conducted as part of exoALMA, integrated with additional legacy measurements from the MAPS Large Programme, to derive CO column densities and surface density profiles (assuming a CO abundance) for a total of 14 disks. A unique feature of the method we introduce to measure surface densities is that it can be applied to optically thick observations, rather than optically thin as conventionally done. While we use our method on a sample of well studied disks where temperature structures have been derived using two emission lines, we show that reasonably accurate estimates can be obtained also when only one molecular transition is available. With our method we obtain independent constraints from $^{12}$CO and $^{13}$CO and we find they are in general good agreement using the standard $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C isotopic ratio. The masses derived from our method are systematically lower compared with the values derived dynamically from the rotation curve if using an ISM CO abundance, implying that CO is depleted by a median factor $\sim$20 with respect to the ISM value, in line with other works that find that CO is depleted in proto-planetary disks.</description>

      <title>exoALMA. XVII. Characterizing the Gas Dynamics around Dust Asymmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The key planet-formation processes in protoplanetary disks remain an active matter of research. One promising mechanism to radially and azimuthally trap millimeter-emitting dust grains, enabling them to concentrate and grow into planetesimals, is anticyclonic vortices. While dust observations have revealed crescent structures in several disks, observations of their kinematic signatures are still lacking. Studying the gas dynamics is, however, essential to confirm the presence of a vortex and understand its dust trapping properties. In this work, we make use of the high-resolution and sensitivity observations conducted by the exoALMA large program to search for such signatures in the $^{12}$CO and $^{13}$CO molecular line emission of four disks with azimuthal dust asymmetries: HD 135344B, HD 143006, HD 34282, and MWC 758. To assess the vortex features, we constructed an analytical vortex model and performed hydrodynamical simulations. For the latter, we assumed two scenarios: a vortex triggered at the edge of a dead zone and of a gap created by a massive embedded planet. These models reveal a complex kinematical morphology of the vortex. When compared to the data, we find that none of the sources show a distinctive vortex signature around the dust crescents in the kinematics.</description>

      <title>exoALMA. VI. Rotating under Pressure: Rotation curves, azimuthal velocity substructures, and pressure variations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The bulk motion of the gas in protoplanetary disks around newborn stars is nearly Keplerian. By leveraging the high angular and spectral resolution of ALMA, we can detect small-scale velocity perturbations in molecular line observations caused by local gas pressure variations in the disk, possibly induced by embedded protoplanets. This paper presents the azimuthally averaged rotational velocity and its deviations from Keplerian rotation ($\delta\upsilon_{\phi}$) for the exoALMA sample, as measured in the $^{12}$CO and $^{13}$CO emission lines. The rotation signatures show evidence for vertically stratified disks, in which $^{13}$CO rotates faster than $^{12}$CO due to a distinct thermal gas pressure gradient at their emitting heights. We find $\delta\upsilon_{\phi}$-substructures in the sample on both small ($\sim$10 au) and large ($\sim$100 au) radial scales, reaching deviations up to 15% from background Keplerian velocity in the most extreme cases. More than 75% of the rings and 80% of the gaps in the dust continuum emission resolved in $\delta\upsilon_{\phi}$ are co-located with gas pressure maxima and minima, respectively. Additionally, gas pressure substructures are observed far beyond the dust continuum emission. For the first time, we determined the gas pressure derivative at the midplane from observations and found it to align well with the dust substructures within the given uncertainties. Based on our findings, we conclude that gas pressure variations are likely the dominant mechanism for ring and gap formation in the dust continuum.</description>

      <title>Using the Translation Theorem for the Automated Stationkeeping of Extremely-Low Lunar Missions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19559v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Extremely-Low Lunar Orbits (eLLOs) (altitudes $\leq 50$ km) exhibit severe perturbations due to the highly non-spherical lunar gravitational field, presenting unique challenges to orbit maintenance. These altitudes are too low for the existence of stable `frozen' orbits, and naive stationkeeping methods, such as circularization, perform poorly. However, mission designers have noticed a particular characteristic of low lunar orbits, which they have found useful for stationkeeping and dubbed the "translation theorem", wherein the eccentricity vector follows a predictable monthly pattern that is independent of its starting value. We demonstrate this feature results from the low orbital eccentricity combined with the dominant effect of a particular subset of sectoral and tesseral harmonics. Subsequently, automated stationkeeping strategies for eLLOs are presented, utilizing this theorem for eccentricity vector control. Several constraints within the eccentricity vector plane are explored, including circular, annular, and elevation-model derived regions, each forming distinct stationkeeping strategies for varying orbital configurations. Subsequently, the optimal control profiles for these maneuvers within the eccentricity plane are obtained using Sequential Convex Programming (SCP). The proposed strategies offer computational simplicity and clear advantages when compared to traditional methods and are comparable to full trajectory optimization.</description>

      <title>SHINS, the SHARK-NIR Instrument Control Software</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.19709v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: SHARK-NIR is a new compact instrument for coronagraphic imaging, direct imaging, and coronagraphic spectroscopy in the near-infrared wavelengths mounted at LBT. Taking advantage of the telescope's adaptive optics system, it provides high contrast imaging with coronagraphic and spectroscopic capabilities and is focused on the direct imaging of exoplanets and circumstellar discs. We present SHINS, the SHARK-NIR instrument control software, mainly realized with the TwiceAsNice framework from MPIA - Heidelberg and the ICE framework using the C++ programming language. We describe how we implemented the software components controlling several instrument subsystems, through the adaptation of already tested libraries from other instruments at LBT, such as LINC-NIRVANA. The scientific detector comes with its own readout electronic and control software interfaced with our software through INDI. We describe the C++ core software Observation Control Software, responsible for dispatching commands to the subsystems, also implementing a software solution to avoid a potential collision between motorized components, fully transparent to final users. It exposes an ICE interface and can be controlled by clients developed in different languages. Observation, calibration, and maintenance procedures are implemented by means of template scripts, written in python language, controlling Observation Control Software through its ICE interface. These templates and their parameters are configured using "ESO-style", XML Observation Blocks prepared by observers, or in general SHARK-NIR users. The high-level control is carried out by REST HTTP APIs implemented in a python back-end, also acting as a web server for the several browser-based front-end GUIs. Finally, we present the first scientific results obtained by SHARK-NIR using coronagraphic mode.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Moment-Field Interactions, A Universal Mechanism for Particle Energization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19711v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic reconnection is a pivotal mechanisms in the energization and heating of cosmic plasmas, yet the exact process of energy transfer during these events remain elusive. Traditional models, which focus on acoustic and magnetohydrodynamic waves and micro/nano-flares, fall short of explaining the extreme heating of the solar corona and the origins of the supersonic solar wind. In this study, we provide compelling observational evidence from Wind spacecraft data supporting the Raghav effect, a mechanism where interactions between the magnetic moments of charged particles and dynamic magnetic fields result in abrupt kinetic energy changes. Our analysis demonstrates that the observed proton plasma heating is consistent with theoretical predictions, establishing the Raghav effect as a universal mechanism for particle energization. This discovery offers a unified framework for understanding energy dynamics across a wide range of astrophysical magnetised plasma environments.</description>

      <title>Wind erosion and transport on planetesimals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.09572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.09572v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the possibility that aeolian (wind blown) processes occur on small, 1 to 100~km diameter, planetesimals when they were embedded in the protosolar nebula. Drag from a headwind within a protostellar disk is sufficiently large to loft cm and smaller sized particles off the surface of a 10 km diameter asteroid in the inner solar system (at a few AU), and micron sized particles off the surface of a 10 km diameter object in the Transneptunian region. The headwind is sufficiently strong to overcome surface cohesion in the inner solar system, but not in the outer solar system. However, in the outer solar system, surface particles can be redistributed or escape due to impacts from particles that are in the protosolar disk's wind. Based on scaling crater ejecta, we estimate that impacts from particles in the headwind will lead to erosion of mass rather than accretion for planetesimals below about 6 km in diameter. The erosion limit is independent of material strength but proportional to the wind velocity. We explore the sensitivity of splash particle trajectories to particle size, headwind velocity and Reynolds number. Winds from a protostellar disk could account for Kuiper Belt Object (486958) Arrokoth's smooth undulating terrain but only during an epoch of high particle flux and low wind velocity. These conditions could have been present during and just after coalescence of Arrokoth's building blocks.</description>

      <title>Spirals, rings, and vortices shaped by shadows in protoplanetary disks: from radiative hydrodynamical simulations to observable signatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13932v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Numerous protoplanetary disks exhibit shadows in scattered light observations. These shadows are typically cast by misaligned inner disks and are associated with observable structures in the outer disk such as bright arcs and spirals. Investigating the dynamics of the shadowed outer disk is therefore essential in understanding the formation and evolution of these structures. We carry out twodimensional radiation hydrodynamics simulations that include radiative diffusion and dust-gas dynamics to study the formation of substructure in shadowed disks. We find that spiral arms are launched at the edge of each shadow, permeating the entire disk. The local dissipation of these spirals results in an angular momentum flux, opening multiple gaps and leading to a series of concentric, regularly-spaced rings We find that ring formation is favored in weakly turbulent disks where dust growth is taking place. These conditions are met for typical class-II disks, in which bright rings should form well within a fraction of their lifetime (0.1-0.2 Myr). For hotter disks gap opening is more efficient, such that the gap edges quickly collapse into vortices that can appear as bright arcs in continuum emission before decaying into rings or merging into massive, long-lived structures. Synthetic observations show that these structures should be observable in scattered light and millimeter continuum emission, providing a new way to probe the presence of substructure in protoplanetary disks. Our results suggest that the formation of rings and gaps is a common process in shadowed disks, and can explain the rich radial substructure observed in several protoplanetary disks.</description>

Abstract: Recent James Webb Space Telescope observations of cool, rocky exoplanets reveal a probable lack of thick atmospheres, suggesting prevalent escape of the secondary atmospheres formed after losing primordial hydrogen. Yet, simulations indicate that hydrodynamic escape of secondary atmospheres, composed of nitrogen and carbon dioxide, requires intense fluxes of ionizing radiation (XUV) to overcome the effects of high molecular weight and efficient line cooling. This transonic outflow of hot, ionized metals (not hydrogen) presents a novel astrophysical regime ripe for exploration. We introduce an analytic framework to determine which planets retain or lose their atmospheres, positioning them on either side of the cosmic shoreline. We model the radial structure of escaping atmospheres as polytropic expansions - power-law relationships between density and temperature driven by local XUV heating. Our approach diagnoses line cooling with a three-level atom model and incorporates how ion-electron interactions reduce mean molecular weight. Crucially, hydrodynamic escape onsets for a threshold XUV flux dependent upon the atmosphere's gravitational binding. Ensuing escape rates either scale linearly with XUV flux when weakly ionized (energy-limited) or are controlled by a collisional-radiative thermostat when strongly ionized. Thus, airlessness is determined by whether the XUV flux surpasses the critical threshold during the star's active periods, accounting for expendable primordial hydrogen and revival by volcanism. We explore atmospheric escape from Young-Sun Mars and Earth, LHS 1140 b and c, and TRAPPIST-1 b. Our modeling characterizes the bottleneck of atmospheric loss on the occurrence of observable Earth-like habitats and offers analytic tools for future studies.</description>

      <title>Planetary Dynamos in Evolving Cold Gas Giants</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.07551v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magnetic fields remain one of the least understood aspects of exoplanetary systems. A deeper understanding of planetary dynamos and the evolution of surface magnetic properties throughout a planet's lifetime is a key scientific purpose, with implications for planetary evolution, habitability, and atmospheric dynamics. This study models the evolution of magnetic fields generated by dynamo action in cold giant gaseous planets. We solve the resistive magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equations under anelastic approximation with a 3D pseudo-spectral spherical shell MHD code. We employ 1D thermodynamical hydrostatic profiles taken from gas giant evolutionary models as the background states of our MHD models. Numerical integration leads to saturated dynamo solutions. Such calculations are performed with radial profiles corresponding to different planetary ages so that we can interpret them as different snapshots of the magnetoconvection evolution during the long-term planetary evolution. We characterize magnetic fields across different evolutionary stages of a cold gaseous planet in terms of topology and strength. We find the occurrence of a transition from multipolar to dipolar-dominated dynamo regime throughout the life of a Jovian planet. During the planetary evolution and the cooling down phase, we observe a decrease in the average magnetic field strength near the dynamo surface as $\sim t^{-0.2}-t^{-0.3}$, a trend compatible with previously proposed scaling laws. We also find that some dimensionless parameters evolve differently for the multipolar to dipolar branch, possibly reflecting a force balance change. This approach can be extended to study hot gaseous planets, offering a versatile tool for interpreting the magnetic properties of giant planets.</description>

      <title>Fluorescent Biomolecules Detectable in Near-Surface Ice on Europa</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.06971v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Europa, Jupiter's second Galilean moon, is believed to host a subsurface ocean in contact with a rocky mantle, where hydrothermal activity may drive the synthesis of organic molecules. Of these molecules, abiotic synthesis of aromatic amino acids is unlikely, and their detection on Europa could be considered a biosignature. Fluorescence from aromatic amino acids, with characteristic emissions in the 200-400 nanometer wavelength range, can be induced by a laser and may be detectable where ocean material has been relatively recently emplaced on Europa's surface, as indicated by geologically young terrain and surface features. However, surface bombardment by charged particles from the Jovian magnetosphere and solar ultraviolet (UV) radiation degrades organic molecules, limiting their longevity. We model radiolysis and photolysis of aromatic amino acids embedded in ice, showing dependencies on hemispheric and latitudinal patterns of charged particle bombardment and ice phase. We demonstrate that biosignatures contained within freshly deposited ice in high-latitude regions on the surface of Europa are detectable using laser-induced UV fluorescence, even from an orbiting spacecraft.</description>

      <title>Systematic Reanalysis of KMTNet Microlensing Events, Paper II: Two New Planets in Giant-Source Events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19471v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we continue to apply the updated KMTNet tender-love care (TLC) photometric pipeline to historical microlensing events. We apply the pipeline to a subsample of events from the KMTNet database, which we refer to as the giant source sample. Leveraging the improved photometric data, we conduct a systematic search for anomalies within this sample. The search successfully uncovers four new planet-like anomalies and recovers two previously known planetary signals. After detailed analysis, two of the newly discovered anomalies are confirmed as clear planets: KMT-2019-BLG-0578 and KMT-2021-BLG-0736. Their planet-to-host mass ratios are $q\sim4\times10^{-3}$ and $q\sim1\times10^{-4}$, respectively. Another event, OGLE-2018-BLG-0421 (KMT-2018-BLG-0831), remains ambiguous. Both a stellar companion and a giant planet in the lens system could potentially explain the observed anomaly. The anomaly signal of the last event, MOA-2022-BLG-038 (KMT-2022-BLG-2342), is attributed to an extra source star. Within this sample, our procedure doubles the number of confirmed planets, demonstrating a significant enhancement in the survey sensitivity.</description>

      <title>Dust Growth in ALMA Rings: II. Dusty Rossby Wave Instability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05095v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Annular substructures serve as ideal venues for planetesimal formation. In this series, we investigate the linear stage of dust growth within rings. The first paper examines the global streaming instability, while this study focuses on the dusty Rossby wave instability (DRWI). We perform a linear analysis of the two-fluid equations on a background pressure bump, representing annular substructures. The spectral code \textsc{Dedalus} is used to solve the linear eigenvalue problem. We identify two distinct DRWI modes: Type I, which originates from dust-modified gas RWI, and Type II, which results from dust-gas coupling. These modes never coexist for a given azimuthal wavenumber $\ky$, but transition between each other as $\ky$ varies. Type I modes are driven by the advection of background vorticity, whereas Type II modes involve two primary waves: Rossby waves, driven by advection, and thin waves, driven by dust-gas drag. Finally, we assess the relevance of DRWI in ALMA rings using DSHARP sources. Our findings suggest that Type I modes could explain the absence of azimuthal asymmetries in many ALMA disks, whereas Type II modes are entirely absent in all eight observed rings, implying that unresolved narrow rings or alternative mechanisms may play a role in dust growth within annular substructures.</description>

      <title>A Revised Density Estimate for the Largest Known Exoplanet, HAT-P-67 b</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13997v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Low-density ($\rho &lt; 0.1 \rm{~g~cm^{-3}}$) hot Saturns are expected to quickly ($&lt;100$ Myr) lose their atmospheres due to stellar irradiation, explaining their rarity. HAT-P-67 b seems to be an exception, with $\rho &lt; 0.09 \rm{~g~cm^{-3}}$ and maintaining its atmosphere to well after 1 Gyr. We present a photometric and spectroscopic follow-up of HAT-P-67 b to determine how it avoided mass loss. HAT-P-67 b orbits a $V=10.1$ evolved F-type star in a 4.81 day orbit. We present new radial velocity observations of the system from the NEID spectrograph on the WIYN 3.5m Telescope from a follow-up campaign robust to stellar activity. We characterize the activity using photometry and activity indicators, revealing a stellar rotation period ($5.40\pm0.09$ d) near HAT-P-67 b's orbital period. We mitigate the stellar activity using a constrained quasi-periodic Gaussian process through a joint fit of archival ground-based photometry, TESS photometry, and our NEID observations, obtaining a planetary mass of $M_p = 0.45 \pm 0.15~M_{\rm J}$. Combined with a radius measurement of $R_p=2.140 \pm 0.025~R_{\rm J}$, this yields a density of $\rho_p = 0.061^{+0.020}_{-0.021} \rm{~g~cm^{-3}}$, making HAT-P-67 b the second lowest-density hot giant known to date. We find the recent evolution of the host star caused mass loss for HAT-P-67 b to only recently occur. The planet will be tidally disrupted/engulfed in $\sim 150-500$ Myr, shortly after losing its atmosphere. With rapid atmospheric mass loss, a large, helium leading tail, and upcoming observations with the Hubble Space Telescope, HAT-P-67 b is an exceptional target for future studies, for which an updated mass measurement provides important context.</description>

      <title>Estimates of Rotation Periods for Jupiter Trojans with the Zwicky Transient Facility Photometric Lightcurves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15530v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present new rotational period estimates for 216 Jupiter Trojans using photometric data from the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF), including 80 Trojans with previously unknown periods. Our analysis reveals rotation periods ranging from 4.6 hours to 447.8 hours. These results support the existence of a spin barrier for Trojans larger than 10 km, with periods clustering between 4 and 4.8 hours. This spin barrier is roughly twice as long as that observed for main-belt asteroids, suggesting that Jupiter Trojans have significantly lower bulk densities, likely due to a higher fraction of ices and volatile materials in their composition. We identify three new Trojans with reliable rotation periods near the spin barrier, doubling the number of known Trojans in this critical period range. Using these results, we estimate a mean density of approximately 0.52 g/cm^3 for rubble-pile Trojans. Our findings support the growing evidence that many Trojans are rubble-pile bodies with distinct physical properties compared to main-belt asteroids. Looking forward, we anticipate that data from the Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) will provide rotational period estimates for several hundred thousand Trojans, down to objects as small as 1 km, enabling a more detailed investigation of their rotational properties and internal structure.</description>

      <title>Intermediate-mass stars and the origin of the gas-giant planet-metallicity correlation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19074v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The number of known planets around intermediate-mass stars (1.5 M$_{\odot}$ &lt; M$_{\star}$ &lt; 3.5 M$_{\odot}$) is rather low. We aim to test whether the correlation between the metallicity of the star and the presence of gas-giant planets found for MS low-mass stars still holds for intermediate-mass stars. In particular, we aim to understand whether or not the planet-metallicity relation changes as stars evolve from the pre-MS to the red giant branch. Our results confirm that pre-MS stars with transitional discs with gaps show lower metallicities than pre-MS with flat discs. We show a tendency of intermediate-mass stars in the MS to follow the gas-giant planet-metallicity correlation, although the differences in metal content between planet and non-planet hosts are rather modest and the strength of the correlation is significantly lower than for the less massive FGK MS stars. For stars in the red giant branch, we find a strong planet-metallicity correlation, compatible with that found for FGK MS stars. We discuss how the evolution of the mass in the convective zone of the star's interior might affect the measured metallicity of the star. The lack of a well-established planet-metallicity correlation in pre-MS and MS intermediate-mass stars can be explained by a scenario in which planet formation leads to an accretion of metal-poor material on the surface of the star. As intermediate-mass stars are mainly radiative the metallicity of the star does not reflect its bulk composition but the composition of the accreted material. When the star leaves the MS and develops a sizeable convective envelope, a strong-planet metallicity correlation is recovered. Thus, our results are in line with core-accretion models of planet formation and the idea that the planet-metallicity correlation reflects a bulk property of the star.</description>

      <title>Probing the origins. I. Generalised Additive Model inference of birth radii for Milky Way stars in the solar vicinity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20441v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We employ a Generalised Additive Model (GAM) to address the limitations inherent in radial metallicity gradients predicted by chemical evolution models, thereby facilitating the estimation of birth radii for the thin disc stars in our sample based on their ages and chemical composition. We then juxtapose the birth radius predictions derived from the GAM with the calculated guiding radii, among other dynamic parameters. Metal-rich stars, formed in the inner regions of the Milky Way, seem to be predominantly churned outward. Their metal-poor counterparts, formed in the outer thin disc, exhibit the opposite behaviour. The proportion of blurred/undisturbed stars generally increases with decreasing metallicity when compared to their churned counterparts. Approximately $3/4$ of the sample has been affected by (inward or outward) churning, while the remaining $\sim 1/4$ has either been influenced by blurring or remained undisturbed. These percentages vary considerably across different metallicity-stratified groups. Also, a large age gap is identified between churned and blurred/undisturbed sub-samples within each HC-based group, being the outward-churned stars systematically the oldest, inward-churned stars the youngest, and blurred/undisturbed stars in intermediate ages. We also detect significant differences in angular momenta in the $z$ component, for stars that have either churned inward or outward, when compared to their blurred/undisturbed counterparts. Additionally, we observe the potential effects of the pericentric passage of the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy in our most metal-poor subset of stars, formed in the outer disc. Finally, we estimate that the Sun's most probable birth radius is $7.08 \pm 0.24$ kpc, with a 3$\sigma$ range spanning from 6.46 to 7.81 kpc, in agreement with previous studies.</description>
