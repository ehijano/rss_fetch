      <title>easylayout: an R package for interactive force-directed layouts within RStudio</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18280v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivation
  Network visualization is critical for effective communication in various fields of knowledge. Currently, a gap separates network manipulation from network visualization in programming environments. Users often export network data to be laid out in external interactive software, like Cytoscape and Gephi. We argue the current R package ecosystem lacks an interactive layout engine well integrated with common data analysis workflows.
  Results
  We present easylayout, an R package that bridges network manipulation and visualization by leveraging interactive force simulations within the IDE itself (e.g., RStudio, VSCode). It is not yet another visualization library, but instead aims to interconnect existing libraries and streamline their usage into the R ecosystem. easylayout takes an igraph object and serializes it into a web application integrated with the IDE's interface through a Shiny server. The app lays out the network by simulating attraction and repulsion forces. Simulation parameters can be adjusted in real-time. An editing mode allows moving and rotating nodes. The implementation aims for performance, so that even lower-end devices are able to work with relatively large networks. Once the user finishes tweaking the layout, it is sent back to the R session to be plotted through popular libraries like ggraph, igraph or even the base package itself. The current implementation focuses on the R ecosystem, but using web technologies makes it easily portable to similar environments, like Python/Jupyter Notebooks. We expect this tool to reduce the time spent searching for suitable network layouts, ultimately allowing researchers to generate more compelling figures.
  Availability and implementation

      <title>Relaxation to statistical equilibrium in stochastic Michaelis-Menten kinetics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.10362</link>

Abstract: The equilibration of enzyme and complex concentrations in deterministic Michaelis-Menten reaction networks underlies the hyperbolic dependence between the input (substrates) and output (products). This relationship was first obtained by Michaelis and Menten and then Briggs and Haldane in two asymptotic limits: `fast equilibrium' and `steady state'. In stochastic Michaelis-Menten networks, relevant to catalysis at single-molecule and mesoscopic concentrations, the classical analysis cannot be directly applied due to molecular discreteness and fluctuations. Instead, as we show here, such networks require a more subtle asymptotic analysis based on the decomposition of the network into reversible and irreversible sub-networks and the exact solution of the chemical master equation (CME). The reversible and irreversible sub-networks reach detailed balance and stationarity, respectively, through a relaxation phase that we characterise in detail through several new statistical measures. Since stochastic enzyme kinetics encompasses the single-molecule, mesoscopic and thermodynamic limits, our work provides a broader molecular viewpoint of the classical results, in much the same manner that statistical mechanics provides a broader understanding of thermodynamics.</description>
