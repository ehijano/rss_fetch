      <title>Exploring the accuracy of the equation-of-motion coupled-cluster band gap of solids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18667v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While the periodic equation-of-motion coupled-cluster (EOM-CC) method promises systematic improvement of electronic band gap calculations in solids, its practical application at the singles and doubles level (EOM-CCSD) is hindered by severe finite-size errors in feasible simulation cells. We present a hybrid approach combining EOM-CCSD with the computationally efficient $GW$ approximation to estimate thermodynamic limit band gaps for several insulators and semiconductors. Our method substantially reduces required cell sizes while maintaining accuracy. Comparisons with experimental gaps and self-consistent $GW$ calculations reveal that deviations in EOM-CCSD predictions correlate with reduced single excitation character of the excited many-electron states. Our work not only provides a computationally tractable approach to EOM-CC calculations in solids but also reveals fundamental insights into the role of single excitations in electronic-structure theory.</description>

      <title>Mitigation of Delamination of Epitaxial Large-Area Boron Nitride for Semiconductor Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18735v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) is a promising material for next-generation semiconductor and optoelectronic devices due to its wide bandgap and remarkable optical properties. To apply this material in the semiconductor industry, it is necessary to grow large-area layers on the wafer-scale. For this purpose, chemical vapor deposition methods are highly preferable. However, in the case of epitaxial BN, its fragility and susceptibility to delamination and fold formation during wet processing, such as lithography, present significant challenges to its integration into device fabrication. In this work, we introduce a controlled delamination and redeposition method that effectively prevents the layer from degradation, allowing for multi-step lithographic processes. This approach is applicable to BN layers across a broad thickness range, from tens to hundreds of nanometers, and ensures compatibility with standard photolithographic techniques without compromising the material's intrinsic properties. By addressing key processing challenges, this method paves the way for integrating epitaxial BN into advanced semiconductor and optoelectronic technologies.</description>

      <title>Quantum effects in surface diffusion: application to diffusion of nitrogen adatoms over GaN(0001) surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19079v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is shown that quantum effects play determining role in nitrogen adatom diffusion due to several different factors. This could be related to the change of the energy of the quantum states and also due to the redistribution of electrons between the quantum states, both full and resonant, via quantum statistics partially governed by the Fermi energy level. These effects were studied in the case of nitrogen diffusion over clean and gallium covered Ga-terminated GaN(0001) surface. For the fractional coverage the density functional theory (DFT) calculations show that at the saddle point configuration the redistribution of electrons between different quantum states may affect the surface diffusion barrier significantly. The other quantum influence occurs via the change of the minimal energy configuration. Under fractional Ga coverage of GaN(0001) surface the nitrogen diffusion energy barrier proceeds from the resonant states governed energy minimal H3 site across the saddle point in the bridge configuration. At this path the barrier is affected the electron redistribution between surface quantum states both in the initial and the saddle point. In the case of the full GaN coverage the diffusion path is from on-top N adatom configuration via H3 site that corresponds to maximal energy. Therefore the diffusion barrier is Ebar= 1.18 eV for clean and Ebar= 0.92 eV for (1/6) ML to finally Ebar= 1.23 eV for full Ga coverage. Thus the overall barrier is reduced to Ebar= 0.92 eV due to quantum statistics effects. The identified stable N on-top configuration for the full coverage is essential for atomic mechanism of GaN growth in Ga-rich regime.</description>

      <title>Learning the Hamiltonian Matrix of Large Atomic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have shown promise in learning the ground-state electronic properties of materials, subverting ab initio density functional theory (DFT) calculations when the underlying lattices can be represented as small and/or repeatable unit cells (i.e., molecules and periodic crystals). Realistic systems are, however, non-ideal and generally characterized by higher structural complexity. As such, they require large (10+ Angstroms) unit cells and thousands of atoms to be accurately described. At these scales, DFT becomes computationally prohibitive, making GNNs especially attractive. In this work, we present a strictly local equivariant GNN capable of learning the electronic Hamiltonian (H) of realistically extended materials. It incorporates an augmented partitioning approach that enables training on arbitrarily large structures while preserving local atomic environments beyond boundaries. We demonstrate its capabilities by predicting the electronic Hamiltonian of various systems with up to 3,000 nodes (atoms), 500,000+ edges, ~28 million orbital interactions (nonzero entries of H), and $\leq$0.55% error in the eigenvalue spectra. Our work expands the applicability of current electronic property prediction methods to some of the most challenging cases encountered in computational materials science, namely systems with disorder, interfaces, and defects.</description>

      <title>In-operando test of tunable Heusler alloys for thermomagnetic harvesting of low-grade waste heat</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermomagnetic generation stands out as a promising technology for harvesting and converting low-grade waste heat below 100 {\deg}C. Despite the exponential growth in research on thermomagnetic materials and prototypes over the last decade, there remains, to unlock the full potential of this technology, a critical gap between fundamental research on materials and the design of advanced devices. In this study, we present the in-operando assessment of thermomagnetic performance of three representative Ni,Mn-based Heusler alloys optimized for harvesting low-grade waste heat below 373 K. These materials were tested under operational conditions using a specially designed laboratory-scale prototype of a thermomagnetic motor. The mechanical power output of the motor, operated with NiMnIn, NiMnSn and NiMnCuGa alloys, was correlated with the magnetic properties of the materials, highlighting the critical role of the magnetic transition temperature and saturation magnetization in determining the efficiency of thermomagnetic energy conversion. Austenitic Heusler alloys were confirmed to be promising thermomagnetic materials due to their highly tunable Curie temperature and significant magnetization changes in the 300-360 K temperature range. Among the tested materials, the Ni48Mn36In16 alloy demonstrated the highest thermomagnetic performance, surpassing the benchmark material Gd in the 320-340 K range. From an experimental perspective, the developed prototype of thermomagnetic motor serves as a flexible test-bench for evaluating and comparing the thermomagnetic performance of small amounts (less than 0.3 g) of new materials under variable conditions. Additionally, its modular design facilitates testing and optimization of its various components, thereby contributing to the advancement of thermomagnetic motor technology.</description>

      <title>Strong geometry dependence of the X-ray Thomson Scattering Spectrum in single crystal silicon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19276v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on results from an experiment at the European XFEL where we measured the x-ray Thomson scattering (XRTS) spectrum of single crystal silicon with ultrahigh resolution. Compared to similar previous experiments, we consider a more complex scattering setup, in which the scattering vector changes orientation through the crystal lattice. In doing so, we are able to observe strong geometric dependencies in the inelastic scattering spectrum of silicon at low scattering angles. Furthermore, the high quality of the experimental data allows us to benchmark state-of-the-art TDDFT calculations, and demonstrate TDDFT's ability to accurately predict these geometric dependencies. Finally, we note that this experimental data was collected at a much faster rate than another recently reported dataset using the same setup, demonstrating that ultrahigh resolution XRTS data can be collected in more general experimental scenarios.</description>

      <title>A Metal-Insulator Transition of the Buried MnO2 Monolayer in Complex Oxide Heterostructure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19289v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Functionalities in crystalline materials are determined by 3-dimensional collective interactions of atoms. The confinement of dimensionality in condensed matter provides an exotic research direction to understand the interaction of atoms, thus can be used to tailor or create new functionalities in material systems. In this study, a 2-dimensional transition metal oxide monolayer is constructed inside complex oxide heterostructures based on the theoretical predictions. The electrostatic boundary conditions of oxide monolayer in the heterostructure is carefully designed to tune the chemical, electronic, and magnetic states of oxide monolayer. The challenge of characterizing such an oxide monolayer is overcome by a combination of transmission electron microscopy, x-ray absorption spectroscopy, cross-sectional scanning tunneling microscopy, and electrical transport measurements. An intriguing metal-insulator transition associated with a magnetic transition is discovered in the MnO2 monolayer. This study paves a new route to understand the confinement of dimensionality and explore new intriguing phenomena in condensed matters.</description>

      <title>Solid-state Synapse Based on Magnetoelectrically Coupled Memristor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Brain-inspired computing architectures attempt to emulate the computations performed in the neurons and the synapses in human brain. Memristors with continuously tunable resistances are ideal building blocks for artificial synapses. Through investigating the memristor behaviors in a La0.7Sr0.3MnO3/BaTiO3/La0.7Sr0.3MnO3 multiferroic tunnel junction, it was found that the ferroelectric domain dynamics characteristics are influenced by the relative magnetization alignment of the electrodes, and the interfacial spin polarization is manipulated continuously by ferroelectric domain reversal, enriching our understanding of the magnetoelectric coupling fundamentally. This creates a functionality that not only the resistance of the memristor but also the synaptic plasticity form can be further manipulated, as demonstrated by the spike-timing-dependent plasticity investigations. Density functional theory calculations are carried out to describe the obtained magnetoelectric coupling, which is probably related to the Mn-Ti intermixing at the interfaces. The multiple and controllable plasticity characteristic in a single artificial synapse, to resemble the synaptic morphological alteration property in a biological synapse, will be conducive to the development of artificial intelligence.</description>

      <title>Reactive Fluid Ferroelectrics: A Gateway to the Next Generation of Ferroelectric Liquid Crystalline Polymer Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Herein we report the first examples of reactive mesogenic materials (RMs) which exhibit fluid ferroelectric order based on the recently discovered ferroelectric nematic (NF) phase. We term these materials NF RMs and they provide the first steps towards the next generation of ferroelectric liquid crystalline polymer networks. We report the chemical synthesis and characterisation of the liquid crystalline properties of these materials, demonstrating that they have the lowest longitudinal molecular dipole moments of any reported NF material of 7.39 D. We go on to demonstrate a potential use case of this new class of reactive material through the polymer stabilisation of a matrix which exhibits the NF phase, increasing the phase range of the ferroelectric phase from 75 {\deg}C to 120 {\deg}C. The NF RMs reported herein are an exciting step forward in ferroelectric liquid crystal research, demonstrating that reactive NF materials are achievable, allowing for the future development of liquid crystalline ferroelectric networks, elastomers and polymers.</description>

      <title>Machine learning of microstructure--property relationships in materials with robust features from foundational vision transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18637v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning of microstructure--property relationships from data is an emerging approach in computational materials science. Most existing machine learning efforts focus on the development of task-specific models for each microstructure--property relationship. We propose utilizing pre-trained foundational vision transformers for the extraction of task-agnostic microstructure features and subsequent light-weight machine learning of a microstructure-dependent property. We demonstrate our approach with pre-trained state-of-the-art vision transformers (CLIP, DINOV2, SAM) in two case studies on machine-learning: (i) elastic modulus of two-phase microstructures based on simulations data; and (ii) Vicker's hardness of Ni-base and Co-base superalloys based on experimental data published in literature. Our results show the potential of foundational vision transformers for robust microstructure representation and efficient machine learning of microstructure--property relationships without the need for expensive task-specific training or fine-tuning of bespoke deep learning models.</description>

      <title>Hydrated Cable Bacteria Exhibit Protonic Conductivity Over Long Distances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18651v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study presents the direct measurement of proton transport along filamentous Desulfobulbaceae, or cable bacteria. Cable bacteria are filamentous multicellular microorganisms that have garnered much interest due to their ability to serve as electrical conduits, transferring electrons over several millimeters. Our results indicate that cable bacteria can also function as protonic conduits because they contain proton wires that transport protons at distances greater than 100 um. We find that protonic conductivity ({\sigma}P) along cable bacteria varies between samples and is measured as high as 114 +/- 28 uS cm^-1 at 25-degrees C and 70-percent relative humidity (RH). For cable bacteria, the protonic conductance (GP) and {\sigma}P are dependent upon the RH, increasing by as much as 26-fold between 60-percent and 80-percent RH. This observation implies that proton transport occurs via the Grotthuss mechanism along water associated with cable bacteria, forming proton wires. In order to determine {\sigma}P and GP along cable bacteria, we implemented a protocol using a modified transfer-printing technique to deposit either palladium interdigitated protodes (IDP), palladium transfer length method (TLM) protodes, or gold interdigitated electrodes(IDE) on top of cable bacteria. Due to the relatively mild nature of the transfer-printing technique, this method should be applicable to a broad array of biological samples and curved materials. The observation of protonic conductivity in cable bacteria presents possibilities for investigating the importance of long-distance proton transport in microbial ecosystems and to potentially build biotic or biomimetic scaffolds to interface with materials via proton-mediated gateways or channels.</description>

      <title>Unconventional high-temperature excitonic insulators in two-dimensional topological materials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18694v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bound electron-hole pairs in semiconductors known as excitons can form a coherent state at low temperatures akin to a BCS condensate. The resulting phase is known as the excitonic insulator and has superfluid properties. Here we theoretically study the excitonic insulator in a pair of recently proposed two-dimensional candidate materials with nontrivial band topology. Contrary to previous works, we include interaction channels that violate the individual electron and hole number conservations. These are on equal footing with the number-conserving processes due to the substantial overlap of Wannier orbitals of different bands, which cannot be exponentially localized due to the nontrivial Chern numbers of the latter. Their inclusion is crucial to determine the symmetry of the electron-hole pairing, and by performing mean-field calculations at nonzero temperatures we find that the order parameter is a chiral $d$-wave. We discuss the nontrivial topology of this unconventional state and analyze its superfluid properties. In particular, we estimate BKT temperatures between 75 K and 100 K on realistic substrates, over an order of magnitude larger than in the number-conserving approximation where $s$-wave pairing is favored. Our results highlight the interplay between topology at the single-particle level and long-range interactions, motivating further research in systems where both phenomena coexist.</description>

      <title>Pressure induced enhancement of polar distortions in a metal, and implications on the Rashba spin-splitting</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18728v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Polar metals are an intriguing class of materials in which electric polarisation and metallicity can coexist within a single phase. The unique properties of polar metals challenge expectations, making way for the exploration of exotic phenomena such as unconventional magnetism, hyperferroelectric multiferroicity and developing multifunctional devices that can leverage both the materials electric polarization and its asymmetry in the spin conductivity, that arises due to the Rashba effect. Here, via a high pressure single crystal diffraction study, we report the pressure-induced enhancement of polar distortions in such a metal, Ca$_3$Ru$_2$O$_7$. Our DFT calculations highlight that naive assumptions about the linear dependency between polar distortion amplitudes and the magnitude of the Rashba spin splitting may not be generally valid.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18892v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Here, we study the effects of a GaAs buffer layer on the structural, magnetic, and transport properties of Cr$_y$(Bi$_x$Sb$_{1-x}$)$_{2-y}$Te$_3$ magnetic topological insulator thin films and compare them with those of V$_y$(Bi$_x$Sb$_{1-x}$)$_{2-y}$Te$_3$, which we recently reported. Similar to the case of V$_y$(Bi$_x$Sb$_{1-x}$)$_{2-y}$Te$_3$, growth on a GaAs buffer layer leads to some distinctly different properties than direct growth on InP substrates. These include improved interface quality confirmed by transmission electron microscopy, enhanced magnetic coercive fields, and smaller resistivity peaks at the magnetization reversals. Furthermore, the Bi-ratio dependence of the carrier density reveals that the interface property also affects the Fermi level. These results demonstrate the importance of the buffer layer in controlling the electronic properties of the magnetic topological insulator films.</description>

      <title>Magnetizing weak links by time-dependent spin-orbit interactions: momentum conserving and non-conserving processes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18961v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rashba spin-orbit interactions generated by time-dependent electric fields acting on weak links (that couple together non-magnetic macroscopic leads) can magnetize the junction. The Rashba spin-orbit interaction that affects the spins of electrons tunneling through the weak links changes their momentum concomitantly. We establish the connection between the magnetization flux induced by processes that conserve the momentum and the magnetization created by tunneling events that do not. Control of the induced magnetization can be achieved by tuning the polarization of the AC electric field responsible for the spin-orbit Rashba interaction (e.g., from being circular to linear), by changing the applied bias voltage, and by varying the degree of a gate voltage-induced asymmetry of the device.</description>

      <title>Aggregation of dipolar molecules in SiO$_2$ hybrid organic inorganic films: use of silver nanoparticles as inhibitors of molecular aggregation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19006v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The technological implementation of hybrid organic-inorganic materials in second order nonlinear optical photonic devices depends strongly on the ability of the host matrixes to contain high loads of dipolar molecules without aggregation. Some organic molecules are often used to diminish the attracting interactions between dipolar molecules in such kind of materials, but their efficiency as inhibitors of molecular aggregation is limited by their polarizability. In this work, we report the use of silver nanoparticles as inhibitors of molecular aggregation in hybrid organic-inorganic films doped with dipolar molecules. The large polarizability of the silver nanoparticles makes them ideal moieties for the inhibition of the electrostatic interactions between dipolar nonlinear optical molecules. The average size of the silver nanoparticles in this work was 70.5 nm in diameter, they were synthesized using silver nitrate (AgNO$_3$) as precursor and aminoethylaminopropyltrimethoxysilane as reducing agent. These nanoparticles were immersed in SiO$_2$ hybrid organic-inorganic sol-gel films doped with dipolar chromophores to study their effect as inhibitors of dipolar chromophores aggregation. The presence of the silver nanoparticles in the solid films was confirmed by transmission electronic microscopy and UV-Visible spectroscopy. UV-Visible spectroscopy was also used to monitor the dipolar chromophores aggregation in the SiO$_2$ films. We found that, at room temperature, silver nanoparticles are good inhibiting chromophores aggregation in comparison with the performance of organic inhibitors.</description>

      <title>Correlations drive the attosecond response of strongly-correlated insulators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.19238v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Attosecond spectroscopy of materials has provided invaluable insight into light-driven coherent electron dynamics. However, attosecond spectroscopies have so far been focused on weakly-correlated materials. As a result, the behavior of strongly-correlated systems is largely unknown at sub- to few-femtosecond timescales, even though it is typically the realm at which electron-electron interactions operate. Here we conduct attosecond-resolved experiments on the correlated insulator nickel oxide, and compare its response to a common band insulator, revealing fundamentally different behaviors. The results, together with state-of-the art time-dependent $\textit{ab initio}$ calculations, show that the correlated system response is governed by a laser-driven quench of electron correlations. The evolution of the on-site electronic interaction is measured here at its natural timescale, marking the first direct measurement of Hubbard $U$ renormalization in NiO. It is found to take place within a few femtoseconds, after which structural changes slowly start to take place. The resulting picture sheds light on the entire light-induced response of a strongly-correlated system, from attosecond to long-lived effects.</description>

      <title>Polarization-Resolved Core Exciton Dynamics in LiF Using Attosecond Transient Absorption Spectroscopy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18083v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The ability to control absorption by modifying the polarization of light presents an exciting opportunity to experimentally determine the orbital alignment of absorption features. Here, attosecond extreme ultraviolet (XUV) transient absorption spectroscopy is used to investigate the polarization dependence of core exciton dynamics in LiF thin films at the Li+ K edge. XUV pulses excite electrons from the Li 1s core level into the conduction band, allowing for the formation of a p-orbital-like core exciton, aligned along the XUV light polarization axis. A sub-5 fs near-infrared (NIR) probe pulse then arrives at variable time delays, perturbing the XUV-excited states and allowing the coherence decay of the core exciton to be mapped. The coherence lifetimes are found to be ~2.4 +- 0.4 fs, which is attributed to a phonon-mediated dephasing mechanism as in previous core exciton studies. The differential absorption features are also shown to be sensitive to the relative polarization of the XUV and NIR fields. The parallel NIR probe induces couplings between the initial XUV-excited p-like bright exciton and s-like dark excitons. When crossed pump and probe polarizations are used, the coupling between the bright and dark states is no longer dipole-allowed, and the transient absorption signal associated with the coupling is suppressed by approximately 90%. This interpretation is supported by simulations of a few-level model system, as well as analysis of the calculated band structure. The results indicate that laser polarization can serve as a powerful experimental tool for exploring the orbital alignment of core excitonic states in solid-state materials.</description>

      <title>Topological Linking Determines Elasticity in Limited Valence Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.09689v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the relationship between the microscopic structure and topology of a material and its macroscopic properties is a fundamental challenge across a wide range of systems. Here, we investigate the viscoelasticity of DNA nanostar hydrogels - a model system for physical networks with limited valence - by coupling rheology measurements, confocal imaging and molecular dynamics simulations. We discover that these networks display a large degree of interpenetration and that loops within the network are topologically linked, forming a percolating network-within-network structure. Below overlapping concentration, the fraction of branching points and the pore size determine the high-frequency elasticity of these physical gels. At higher concentrations, we discover that this elastic response is dictated by the abundance of topological links between looped motifs in the gel. Our findings highlight the emergence of "topological elasticity" as a previously overlooked mechanism in generic network-forming liquids and gels and inform the design of topologically-controllable material behaviours.</description>

      <title>TraceGrad: a Framework Learning Expressive SO(3)-equivariant Non-linear Representations for Electronic-Structure Hamiltonian Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05722v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a framework to combine strong non-linear expressiveness with strict SO(3)-equivariance in prediction of the electronic-structure Hamiltonian, by exploring the mathematical relationships between SO(3)-invariant and SO(3)-equivariant quantities and their representations. The proposed framework, called TraceGrad, first constructs theoretical SO(3)-invariant trace quantities derived from the Hamiltonian targets, and use these invariant quantities as supervisory labels to guide the learning of high-quality SO(3)-invariant features. Given that SO(3)-invariance is preserved under non-linear operations, the learning of invariant features can extensively utilize non-linear mappings, thereby fully capturing the non-linear patterns inherent in physical systems. Building on this, we propose a gradient-based mechanism to induce SO(3)-equivariant encodings of various degrees from the learned SO(3)-invariant features. This mechanism can incorporate powerful non-linear expressive capabilities into SO(3)-equivariant features with consistency of physical dimensions to the regression targets, while theoretically preserving equivariant properties, establishing a strong foundation for predicting Hamiltonian. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in prediction accuracy across eight challenging benchmark databases on Hamiltonian prediction. Experimental results demonstrate that this approach not only improves the accuracy of Hamiltonian prediction but also significantly enhances the prediction for downstream physical quantities, and also markedly improves the acceleration performance for the traditional Density Functional Theory algorithms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09599v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Flatband systems form a new class of materials that challenge the conventional wisdom of transport. The intrinsically strong electronic correlations combined with the vanishing kinetic energy scale suggest a sensitive dependence of transport properties on the flat band states and make interacting flat bands promising candidates for exotic quantum transport. Utilizing the Drude weight, we investigate the low-frequency spectral properties of the electrical conductivity within a controlled analytic treatment of the many-body response at temperatures above the bandwidth and the interaction strength and below the bandgap. Focusing on this new transport regime, we demonstrate the potential of a quantum geometric approach for interacting systems and intermediate temperatures. The derived spectral weight yields unexplored four-point geometric contributions unrelated to the quantum metric, which questions the previously proposed projection methods. For long-ranged interactions, we show that the low-frequency spectral weight reduces to the variance of the Berry curvature.</description>

      <title>Distinguishing Ion Dynamics from Muon Diffusion in Muon Spin Relaxation II -- Extension to Paramagnetic Muons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23575v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We extend the previously published model that distinguishes between the diffusive motion of diamagnetic muons and the dynamics of ions around the muon in matter, and propose a generalized model for {\sl paramagnetic muons} (Mu$^0$s, bound states of a muon and an unpaired electron) observed in non-metallic host materials. The new model distinguishes among the independent motion of unpaired electron associated with Mu$^0$, the self-diffusive motion of Mu$^0$ as single atomic entity, and that of the ions surrounding Mu$^0$, where the muon spin relaxation is induced by dynamical fluctuations of the hyperfine (HF) field exerted from the unpaired electron (e.g., due to spin/charge exchange reaction) and/or that of the nuclear hyperfine (NHF) interactions between the unpaired electron and the surrounding ions. We have applied this model to the muonated radicals (Mu$^0$s in a polaron state) in conducting polymers, and examined the validity of the interpretations claimed in the earlier literature that the spin relaxation is induced by quasi-one dimensional motion of the unpaired electron. The result suggests that experimental support for such a claim is still inadequate and needs to be reexamined, including the possibility of other origins for the fluctuations. It is expected that our model will prove a useful guide for $\mu$SR studies of various local dynamics involving paramagnetic muon states.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.02057v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Realizing odd-parity, time-reversal-preserving, non-relativistic spin splitting is a central goal for spintronics applications. We propose a group-theory-based microscopic framework to induce odd-parity spin splitting from coplanar antiferromagnetic (AFM) states without spin-orbit coupling (SOC). We develop phenomenological models for 421 conventional period-doubling AFM systems in non-symmorphic space groups and construct minimal microscopic models for 119 of these. We find that these AFM states can attain three possible competing ground states. These ground states all break symmetries in addition to those broken by the usual AFM order. Specifically, they give rise to either odd-parity spin-splitting, nematic order, or scalar odd-parity order related to multiferroicity. Our microscopic theories reveal that the odd-parity spin-splitting energy scale is generically large and further reveal that the scalar odd-parity order gives a non-zero Berry curvature dipole without SOC. We identify 67 materials in the Magndata database for which our theory applies. We provide DFT calculations on FeSe that reveal an $h$-wave spin splitting consistent with our symmetry arguments and apply our microscopic model to determine the non-relativistic Edelstein response for CeNiAsO.</description>

      <title>Towards Fast, Specialized Machine Learning Force Fields: Distilling Foundation Models via Energy Hessians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09009v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The foundation model (FM) paradigm is transforming Machine Learning Force Fields (MLFFs), leveraging general-purpose representations and scalable training to perform a variety of computational chemistry tasks. Although MLFF FMs have begun to close the accuracy gap relative to first-principles methods, there is still a strong need for faster inference speed. Additionally, while research is increasingly focused on general-purpose models which transfer across chemical space, practitioners typically only study a small subset of systems at a given time. This underscores the need for fast, specialized MLFFs relevant to specific downstream applications, which preserve test-time physical soundness while maintaining train-time scalability. In this work, we introduce a method for transferring general-purpose representations from MLFF foundation models to smaller, faster MLFFs specialized to specific regions of chemical space. We formulate our approach as a knowledge distillation procedure, where the smaller "student" MLFF is trained to match the Hessians of the energy predictions of the "teacher" foundation model. Our specialized MLFFs can be up to 20 $\times$ faster than the original foundation model, while retaining, and in some cases exceeding, its performance and that of undistilled models. We also show that distilling from a teacher model with a direct force parameterization into a student model trained with conservative forces (i.e., computed as derivatives of the potential energy) successfully leverages the representations from the large-scale teacher for improved accuracy, while maintaining energy conservation during test-time molecular dynamics simulations. More broadly, our work suggests a new paradigm for MLFF development, in which foundation models are released along with smaller, specialized simulation "engines" for common chemical subsets.</description>

Abstract: The discovery of superconductivity in pressurized bilayer and trilayer nickelates has generated significant interest. However, their superconducting properties are often dependent on sample quality and pressure conditions, complicating the interpretation of the underlying physics. Finding new systems with optimized bulk superconducting properties is therefore important for advancing our understanding of these materials. Unlike cupates, where trilayer compounds typically exhibit the highest transition temperature (Tc), the bilayer nickelate La3Ni2O7 has thus far outperformed the trilayer La4Ni3O10 in reported Tc. Whether the trilayer nickelates have achieved the optimal Tc remains unclear, with various scenarios suggesting different possibilities. Here, we report the discovery of bulk superconductivity in pressurized Pr4Ni3O10 single crystals, achieving a maximum onset Tc of 40.5 K at 80.1 GPa, significantly exceeding the 30 K observed in La4Ni3O10. The bulk nature of superconductivity is confirmed by zero resistance and a strong diamagnetic response below Tc with a superconducting volume fraction exceeding 80%. These findings establish trilayer nickelates as genuine bulk high-temperature superconductors, provide new insights into the mechanisms driving superconductivity, and point to a promising route toward further enhancing superconducting properties in nickelates.</description>
