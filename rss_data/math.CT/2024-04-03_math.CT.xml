      <title>Presenting Profunctors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01406v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by problems in categorical database theory, we introduce and compare two notions of presentation for profunctors, uncurried and curried, which arise intuitively from thinking of profunctors either as functors $\mathcal{C}^\text{op} \times \mathcal{D} \to \textbf{Set}$ or $\mathcal{C}^\text{op} \to \textbf{Set}^{\mathcal{D}}$. Although the Cartesian closure of $\textbf{Cat}$ means these two perspectives can be used interchangeably at the semantic level, a surprising amount of subtlety is revealed when looking through the lens of syntax. Indeed, we prove that finite uncurried presentations are strictly more expressive than finite curried presentations, hence the two notions do not induce the same class of finitely presentable profunctors. Moreover, an explicit construction for the composite of two curried presentations shows that the class of finitely curried presentable profunctors is closed under composition, in contrast with the larger class of finitely uncurried presentable profunctors, which is not. This shows that curried profunctor presentations are more appropriate for computational tasks that use profunctor composition. We package our results on curried profunctor presentations into a double equivalence from a syntactic double category into the double category of profunctors. Finally, we study the relationship between curried and uncurried presentations, leading to the introduction of curryable presentations. These constitute a subcategory of uncurried presentations which is equivalent to the category of curried presentations, therefore acting as a bridge between the two syntactic choices.</description>

      <title>Combs, Causality and Contractions in Atomic Markov Categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a counterexample showing that Markov categories with conditionals (such as BorelStoch) need not validate a natural scheme of axioms which we call contraction identities. These identities hold in every traced monoidal category, so in particular this shows that BorelStoch cannot be embedded in any traced monoidal category. We remedy this under the additional assumption of atomicity: Atomic Markov categories validate all contraction identities, and furthermore admit a notion of trace defined for non-signalling morphisms. We conclude that atomic Markov categories admit an intrinsic calculus of combs without having to assume an embedding into compact-closed categories.</description>

      <title>Effective Categorical Enumerative Invariants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01499v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce enumerative invariants $F_{g,n}$ $(g\geq0$, $n \geq 1)$ associated to a cyclic $A_\infty$ algebra and a splitting of its non-commutative Hodge filtration. These invariants are defined by explicitly computable Feynman sums, and encode the same information as Costello's partition function of the corresponding field theory.
  Our invariants are stable under Morita equivalence, and therefore can be associated to a Calabi-Yau category with splitting data. This justifies the name categorical enumerative invariants (CEI) that we use for them.
  CEI conjecturally generalize all known enumerative invariants in symplectic geometry, complex geometry, and singularity theory. They also provide a framework for stating enumerative mirror symmetry predictions in arbitrary genus, whenever homological mirror symmetry holds.</description>

      <title>Escrows are optics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.10028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2105.10028v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide a categorical interpretation for escrows, i.e. trading protocols in trustless environment, where the exchange between two agents is mediated by a third party where the buyer locks the money until they receive the goods they want from the seller.
  A simplified escrow system can be modeled as a certain kind of morphism in the category of optics on a monoidal category. When objects in the base category have monoid and comonoid structures, more involved kinds of escrows `with intermediaries' can be modelled as morphisms with action-like properties.</description>
