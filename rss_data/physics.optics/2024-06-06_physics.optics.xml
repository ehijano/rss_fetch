      <title>Chiral transport in Compact topological waveguide arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02843v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Waveguide arrays have a wide range of applications, including optical communication, topological systems, and quantum computing. Chiral transport has broad prospects in optical computing, optical switching, optical isolation, and polarization control. However, the lengths of chiral transmission devices in waveguide arrays are typically very long due to adiabatic limit. We introduce topological protection in encircling exceptional points systems, enabling the larger gap size between the bulk states and topological edge states (TESs). Thus, the restriction from adiabatic limit on the rapid evolution of TESs is eased, thereby significantly reducing the device size. We experimentally demonstrate that the chiral transport has been achieved in a topological waveguide array that is only 75 {\mu}m long. Our research fuses the topology with non-Hermitian physics to develop highly-integrated photonic chips for further advance of nano-photonics.</description>

      <title>Merging bound states in the continuum at third-order $\Gamma$ point enabled by controlling Fourier harmonic components in lattice parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02850v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent studies have demonstrated that ultrahigh-$Q$ resonances, which are robust to fabrication imperfections, can be realized by merging multiple bound states in the continuum (BICs) in momentum space. The merging of multiple BICs holds significant promise for practical applications, providing a robust means to attain ultrahigh-$Q$ resonances that greatly enhance light-matter interactions. In this study, we introduce a novel approach to achieve the merging of BICs at the edges of the fourth stop band, which opens at the third-order $\Gamma$ point, in one-dimensional leaky-mode photonic lattices. Photonic band gaps and BICs arise from periodic modulations in lattice parameters. However, near the third-order $\Gamma$ point, out-of-plane radiation arises by the first and second Fourier harmonic components in the lattice parameters. Accidental BICs can emerge at specific $k$ points where an optimal balance exists between these two Fourier harmonic components. We demonstrate that these accidental BICs are topologically stable, and their positions in momentum space can be precisely controlled by adjusting a specific lattice parameter that influences the strength of the first and second Fourier harmonic components. Furthermore, we show that accidental BICs can be merged at the third-order $\Gamma$ point, with or without a symmetry-protected BIC, by finely adjusting this specific lattice parameter while keeping other parameters constant.</description>

      <title>Dual-color Q-switched mode-locking in an Erbium-doped fiber laser</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Q-switched mode-locking (QML) has been widely observed in various lasers, but its generation mechanism in passive mode-locking remains unclear. In this paper, we build up a dual-color QML Erbium-doped fiber laser and find a bound-state-like envelope on the optical spectrum for the first time. Theoretically, the formation mechanism of QML is numerically investigated using the coupled Ginzburg-Landau equations. In addition, we demonstrated the existence of two QML pulse evolution patterns with gain or polarization state variations in simulation. Our results deepen the understanding of QML pulses in mode-locked fiber lasers and provide a foundation for studying mode-locking nonlinear evolutionary paths.</description>

      <title>Highly sensitive AuNCs@GSH/Ch-PtNPs metal nanoprobes for fluorescent and colorimetric dual-mode detection of ascorbic acid in drink</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03192v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fluorescence detection is a commonly used analytical method with the advantages of fast response, good selectivity and low destructiveness. However, fluorescence detection, a single-mode detection method, has some limitations, such as background interference that affects the accuracy of the fluorescence signal, lack of visualization of the detection results, and low sensitivity for detecting low-concentration samples. In order to overcome the shortcomings of fluorescence single-mode detection, we used the dual-mode method of fluorescence and colorimetry to detect ascorbic acid.
  The dual-mode detection of AA by fluorescence and colorimetry in the probe system enhances the specificity and accuracy of the detection. This bimodal detection method solved the problem of low detection sensitivity in the low concentration range of the analytes to be tested, and was linear in the lower (0-50 {\mu}M) and higher (50-350 {\mu}M) concentration ranges, respectively, and had a lower detection limit (0.034 {\mu}M). This glutathione-based gold cluster assay is characterized by simplicity, rapidity and accuracy, and provides a new way for the quantitative analysis of ascorbic acid. In addition, the method was validated during the determination of AA in beverages, which has the advantages of high sensitivity and fast response time.</description>

      <title>Sum-Frequency Generation Spectro-Microscopy in the Reststrahlen Band of Wurtzite-type Aluminum Nitride</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03214v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonlinear-optical microscopy and spectroscopy provide detailed spatial and spectroscopic contrast, specifically sensitive to structural symmetry and order. Ferroics, in particular, have been widely studied using second harmonic generation imaging, which provides detailed information on domain structures but typically lacks spectroscopic detail. In contrast, infrared-visible sum-frequency generation (SFG) spectroscopy reveals details of the atomic structure and bonding via vibrational resonances, but conventionally lacks spatial information. In this work, we combine the benefits of nonlinear optical imaging and SFG spectroscopy by employing SFG spectro-microscopy using an infrared free-electron laser. Specifically, we demonstrate the feasibility of SFG spectro-microscopy for spectroscopy using in-plane anisotropic wurtzite-type aluminum nitride as a model system. We find the experimental spectra to agree well with our theoretical calculations and we show the potential of our microscope to provide spatially resolved spectroscopic information in inhomogeneous systems such as ferroics and their domains in the near future.</description>

      <title>Electron Confinement-Induced Plasmonic Breakdown in Metals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Plasmon resonance in metals represents the collective oscillation of the free electron gas density and enables enhanced light-matter interactions in nanoscale dimensions. Traditionally, the classical Drude model describes the plasmonic excitation, wherein the plasma frequency exhibits no spatial dispersion. Here, we show conclusive experimental evidence of the breakdown of the plasmon resonance and a consequent photonic metal-insulator transition in an ultrathin archetypal refractory plasmonic material, hafnium nitride (HfN). Epitaxial HfN thick films exhibit a low-loss and high-quality Drude-like plasmon resonance in the visible spectral range. However, as the film thickness is reduced to nanoscale dimensions, the Coulomb interaction among electrons increases due to the electron confinement, leading to the spatial dispersion of the plasma frequency. Importantly, with the further decrease in thickness, electrons lose their ability to shield the incident electric field, turning the medium into a dielectric. The breakdown of the plasmon resonance in epitaxial ultrathin metals could be useful for fundamental physics studies in transdimensional regimes and novel photonic device applications.</description>

      <title>Single-cycle, 643-mW average power THz source based on tilted pulse front in lithium niobate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03318v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present, to the best of our knowledge, the highest average power from a laser-driven single-cycle THz source demonstrated so far, using optical rectification in the titled pulse-front geometry in cryogenically cooled lithium niobate, pumped by a commercially available 500 W ultrafast thin-disk Yb-amplifier. We study repetition rate dependent effects in our setup at 100 kHz and 40 kHz at this high average power, revealing different optimal fluence conditions for efficient conversion. The demonstrated sources with multi-100 mW average power at these high repetition rates combine high THz pulse energies and high repetition rate and is thus ideally suited for nonlinear THz spectroscopy experiments with significantly reduced measurement times. The presented result is a first benchmark for high average power THz time domain spectroscopy systems for nonlinear spectroscopy, driven by very high average power ultrafast Yb lasers.</description>

      <title>Novel functions in silicon photonic chips incorporated with graphene oxide thin films</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.03349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: On-chip integration of two-dimensional (2D) materials with unique structures and distinctive properties endow integrated devices with new functionalities and improved performance. With a high flexibility in modifying its properties and a strong compatibility with various integrated platforms, graphene oxide (GO) becomes an attractive 2D material for implementing functional hybrid integrated devices. Here, we demonstrate novel functionalities that go beyond the capabilities of conventional photonic integrated circuits, by harnessing the photo-thermal effects in 2D GO films integrated onto them. These include all-optical control and switching, optical power limiting, and non-reciprocal light transmission. The 2D layered GO films are on-chip integrated with precise control of their thicknesses and sizes. Benefitting from the broadband response of 2D GO films, all the three functionalities feature a very wide operational bandwidth. By fitting the experimental results with theory, we also extract the changes in material properties induced by the photo-thermal effects, which reveal interesting insights about 2D GO films. These results highlight the versatility of 2D GO films in implementing functional integrated photonic devices for a range of applications.</description>

      <title>Hot spot as hallmark of transition from dielectric disk to ring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02620v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topological transformations of dielectric structures radically change the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of photonic resonances. Moreover, optical effects may arise that characterize the moment of transition from one structure to another, but are not inherent in either the initial or final structure. We demonstrate that such a hallmark of the disk-ring transition is a hot spot of a special nature that arises at the moment a central hole appears in the disk. The hot spot in the air hole is caused by the Mie resonance of the disk with azimuthal number $m$ = 1, while other Mie resonances do not contribute to the effect due to symmetry. As the hole increases, the hot spot fades out, and we theoretically and experimentally observe the formation of photonic resonances of the ring from resonances of the disk. Using near-field and far-field measurements, we discovered clustering of disk photonic modes into distinct galleries of ring eigenmodes that are formed by the inner and outer walls of the cavity. Thus, we demonstrate both the beginning and the end of the rearrangement of photonic eigenmodes during the transition from a dielectric disk to a narrow ring.</description>

      <title>Ghost imaging-based Non-contact Heart Rate Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02640v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Remote heart rate measurement is an increasingly concerned research field, usually using remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) to collect heart rate information through video data collection. However, in certain specific scenarios (such as low light conditions, intense lighting, and non-line-of-sight situations), traditional imaging methods fail to capture image information effectively, that may lead to difficulty or inability in measuring heart rate. To address these limitations, this study proposes using ghost imaging as a substitute for traditional imaging in the aforementioned scenarios. The mean absolute error between experimental measurements and reference true values is 4.24 bpm.Additionally, the bucket signals obtained by the ghost imaging system can be directly processed using digital signal processing techniques, thereby enhancing personal privacy protection.</description>

      <title>The persistence of spin coherence in a crystalline environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02703v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze quantum interference in the triplet-exciton pair generated by singlet exciton fission in a molecular crystal, and introduce transport-induced dephasing (TID) as a key effect that can suppress the expected fluorescence quantum beats when the triplet-exciton wavefunction can localize on inequivalent sites. TID depends on the triplet-exciton hopping rate between inequivalent sites and on the energy-shifts among the stationary states of the entangled triplet pair in different spatial configurations. The theoretical model is confirmed by experiments in rubrene single crystals, where triplet pairs remain entangled for more than 50 ns but quantum beats are suppressed by TID within a few nanoseconds when the magnetic field is misaligned by just a few degrees from specific symmetric directions. Our experiments deliver the zero-field parameters for the rubrene molecule in its orthorhombic lattice and information on triplet-exciton transport, in particular the triplet-exciton hopping rate between inequivalent sites, which we evaluate to be of the order of 150 ps in rubrene.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02704v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A quantum interface between microwave and optical photons is essential for entangling remote superconducting quantum processors. To preserve fragile quantum states, a transducer must operate efficiently while generating less than one photon of noise referred to its input. Here, we present a platform that meets these criteria, utilizing a combination of electrostatic and optomechanical interactions in devices made entirely from crystalline silicon. This platform's small mechanical dissipation and low optical absorption enable ground-state radiative cooling, resulting in quantum-enabled operation with a continuous laser drive. Under the optimal settings for high efficiency (low noise), we measure an external efficiency of $2.2\%$ ($0.47\%$) and an input-referred added noise of $0.94$ ($0.58$) in microwave-to-optics conversion. We quantify the transducer throughput using the efficiency-bandwidth product, finding it exceeds previous demonstrations with similar noise performance by approximately two orders of magnitude, thereby paving a practical path to interconnecting remote superconducting qubits.</description>

      <title>Electric-field-induced magnetic toroidal moment in a time-reversal-odd antiferromagnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03029v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, antiferromagnets with broken time-reversal (T) symmetry have been found to exhibit ferromagnet-like behaviors (e.g., anomalous Hall effect) despite the absence of net magnetization. However, antiferromagnets characterized by T-odd scalar quantities are expected to exhibit unique properties different from the ferromagnet-like behavior. One such example is the diagonal electrotoroidic (ET) effect, in which the application of an electric field E induces a magnetic toroidal moment, an ordered arrangement of magnetic vortices, in the direction parallel to E. Herein, we report the observation of the diagonal ET effect probed by E-induced nonreciprocal directional dichroism in Co2SiO4 holding a T-odd scalar quantity, magnetic toroidal monopole. Using the ET effect, a pair of domain states related to one another by the T operation is spatially resolved. Furthermore, we reveal the inversion of the domain pattern by a magnetic field, which is explained by trilinear coupling ascribed to the piezomagnetic effect. Our observation of the diagonal ET effect paves the way for the exploration of unique functionalities of T-odd antiferromagnets.</description>

It is shown by numerical simulations of Gross-Pitaevskii equation that ratchet phenomena occurs in the polariton graphene due to its structural inhomogeneity. Thus, we suggest a way to induce preferential motion of polaritons by the confinement potential engineering.</description>

      <title>Comparative Analysis of Nanomechanical Resonators: Sensitivity, Response Time, and Practical Considerations in Photothermal Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03295v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nanomechanical photothermal sensing has significantly advanced single-molecule/particle microscopy and spectroscopy, and infrared detection through the use of nanomechanical resonators that detect shifts in resonant frequency due to photothermal heating. However, the relationship between resonator design, photothermal sensitivity, and response time remains unclear. This paper compares three resonator types - strings, drumheads, and trampolines - to explore this relationship. Through theoretical modeling, experimental validation, and finite element method simulations, we find that strings offer the highest sensitivity (with a noise equivalent power of 280 fW/Hz$^{1/2}$ for strings made of silicon nitride), while drumheads exhibit the fastest thermal response. The study reveals that photothermal sensitivity correlates with the average temperature rise and not the peak temperature. Finally, the impact of photothermal back-action is discussed, which can be a major source of frequency instability. This work clarifies the performance differences and limits among resonator designs and guides the development of advanced nanomechanical photothermal sensors, benefiting a wide range of applications.</description>

      <title>Calibrated absolute optical contrast for high-throughput characterization of horizontally aligned carbon nanotube arrays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.03326v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Horizontally aligned carbon nanotube (HACNT) arrays hold significant potential for various applications in nanoelectronics and material science. However, their high-throughput characterization remains challenging due to the lack of methods with both high efficiency and high accuracy. Here, we present a novel technique, Calibrated Absolute Optical Contrast (CAOC), achieved through the implementation of differential principles to filter out stray signals and high-resolution calibration to endow optical contrast with physical significance. CAOC offers major advantages over previous characterization techniques, providing consistent and reliable measurements of HACNT array density with high throughput and non-destructive assessment. To validate its utility, we demonstrate wafer-scale uniformity assessment by rapid density mapping. This technique not only facilitates the practical evaluation of HACNT arrays but also provides insights into balancing high throughput and high resolution in nanomaterial characterization.</description>

      <title>Topological disclination states and charge fractionalization in a non-Hermitian lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03455v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that a non-Hermitian lattice with a disclination can host topological disclination states that are induced by on-site gain and loss. The disclination states are inherently non-Hermitian as they do not exist in the limit of zero gain/loss. They arise from charge fractionalization in the non-Hermitian lattice, which we establish using non-Hermitian Wilson loops calculated with biorthogonal products. The model can be realized using an array of optical resonators, with the emergence of the topological disclination states manifesting as an abrupt shift in emission intensity and frequency upon tuning the gain/loss level.</description>

      <title>A Low Duty Cycle Pulsed UV Technique for Spectroscopy of Aluminum Monochloride</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03483v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel technique to minimize UV-induced damage in experiments that employ second-harmonic generation cavities. The principle of our approach is to reduce the duty cycle of the UV light as much as possible to prolong the lifetime of the used optics. The low duty cycle is achieved by ramping the cavity into resonance for a short time during the experimental cycle when the light is used and tuning it to an off-resonant state otherwise. The necessary fast ramp and length-stabilization control of the cavity is implemented with the FPGA-based STEMlab platform. We demonstrate the utility of this method by measuring the isotope shift of the electronic transition ($X^1\Sigma \leftarrow A^1\Pi$) in AlCl at 261.5 nm in a pulsed molecular beam experiment.</description>

      <title>Asymmetric Faraday effect caused by a break of spatial symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.14355</link>

Abstract: It is widely known that the magneto-optical Faraday effect is linear in magnetization, and therefore the Faraday angles for the states with opposite magnetizations are of opposite sign but equal in modulus. Here we demonstrate that under certain spatial symmetry-breaking conditions, an asymmetric Faraday effect (AFE) arises, meaning that the Faraday angles for opposite magnetic states differ not only in sign but in absolute value as well. Experimental investigations of AFE are performed in a one-dimensional all-garnet magnetophotonic crystal, where AFE appears in the vicinity of the cavity resonance for an oblique incidence of light with an inclined light polarization plane. The magnitude of the observed asymmetry between Faraday rotations for the two opposite magnetizations is very large and reaches 30$\%$ of the absolute value of the Faraday effect. We confirm the generality of the suggested effect by the numerical analysis of several different configurations in which AFE arises. The discovered AFE is of prime importance for nanoscale magnonics and optomagnetism.</description>

      <title>Dirac Cones and Room Temperature Polariton Lasing Evidenced in an Organic Honeycomb Lattice</title>

Abstract: Artificial one- and two-dimensional lattices have emerged as a powerful platform for the emulation of lattice Hamiltonians, the fundamental study of collective many-body effects, and phenomena arising from non-trivial topology. Exciton-polaritons, bosonic part-light and part-matter quasiparticles, combine pronounced nonlinearities with the possibility of on-chip implementation. In this context, organic semiconductors embedded in microcavities have proven to be versatile candidates to study nonlinear many-body physics and bosonic condensation, and in contrast to most inorganic systems, they allow the use at ambient conditions since they host ultra-stable Frenkel excitons. We implement a well-controlled, high-quality optical lattice that accommodates light-matter quasiparticles. The realized polariton graphene presents with excellent cavity quality factors, showing distinct signatures of Dirac cone and flatband dispersions as well as polariton lasing at room temperature. This is realized by filling coupled dielectric microcavities with the fluorescent protein mCherry. We demonstrate the emergence of a coherent polariton condensate at ambient conditions, taking advantage of coupling conditions as precise and controllable as in state-of-the-art inorganic semiconductor-based systems, without the limitations of e.g. lattice matching in epitaxial growth. This progress allows straightforward extension to more complex systems, such as the study of topological phenomena in two-dimensional lattices including topological lasers and non-Hermitian optics.</description>

      <title>Observation of sub-Poissonian correlation in spin-orbit coupled polariton vortex pairs at room temperature</title>

Abstract: Coupling of orbital and spin degrees of freedom gives rise to intriguing physical phenomena in bosonic condensates, such as formation of stripe phases and domains with vortex arrays. However, the robust locking of spin and orbital degrees of freedom of the nonlinear topological objects such as vortex pairs with sub-Poissonian fluctuation in bosonic condensates remains challenging. In the present work, we realize a non-equilibrium room-temperature condensate in a liquid crystal (LC) planar photonic microcavity with the perovskite CsPbBr3 as optically active material. We use the interplay of TE-TM mode splitting and Rashba-Dresselhaus spin-orbit coupling (RDSOC) to realize electrically tunable polariton vortex pairs with locked spin and orbital angular momentum. Remarkably, the counts difference between opposite wavevector states shows sub-Poissonian fluctuation, indicating the existence of the correlation between the two vortices. Our results are robust against sample imperfections and pave the way to investigate coupling and locking of correlated vortex orbital and spin degrees of freedom in a quantum fluid of light at room temperature, offering potential for generation of complex squeezed states of light for quantum optical information processing with optoelectronic chips</description>

      <title>Single-shot volumetric fluorescence imaging with neural fields</title>

Abstract: Single-shot volumetric fluorescence (SVF) imaging offers a significant advantage over traditional imaging methods that require scanning across multiple axial planes as it can capture biological processes with high temporal resolution across a large field of view. The key challenges in SVF imaging include requiring sparsity constraints to meet the multiplexing requirements of compressed sensing, eliminating depth ambiguity in the reconstruction, and maintaining high resolution across a large field of view. In this paper, we introduce the QuadraPol point spread function (PSF) combined with neural fields, a novel approach for SVF imaging. This method utilizes a custom polarizer at the back focal plane and a polarization camera to detect fluorescence, effectively encoding the 3D scene within a compact PSF without depth ambiguity. Additionally, we propose a reconstruction algorithm based on the neural fields technique that provides improved reconstruction quality and addresses the inaccuracies of phase retrieval methods used to correct imaging system aberrations. This algorithm combines the accuracy of experimental PSFs with the long depth of field of computationally generated retrieved PSFs. QuadraPol PSF, combined with neural fields, significantly reduces the acquisition time of a conventional fluorescence microscope by approximately 20 times and captures a 100 mm$^3$ cubic volume in one shot. We validate the effectiveness of both our hardware and algorithm through all-in-focus imaging of bacterial colonies on sand surfaces and visualization of plant root morphology. Our approach offers a powerful tool for advancing biological research and ecological studies.</description>

      <title>Perfect pulsed inline twin-beam squeezers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.10197v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Perfect inline squeezers are both spectrally pure and have identical input and output temporal modes, allowing one to squeeze an arbitrary input quantum state in the sole input mode on which the device acts, while the quantum states of any other modes are unaffected. We study theoretically how to obtain a perfect pulsed inline squeezer in twin-beam systems by considering three commonly used configurations: unpoled single pass, poled single pass, and poled double pass. By obtaining analytical relations between the input and output temporal modes from the Bloch-Messiah decomposition of the discretized Heisenberg-picture propagator, we find that a double pass structure produces a perfect pulsed inline squeezer when operated in a frequency degenerate, symmetric group-velocity matched type-II configuration.</description>
