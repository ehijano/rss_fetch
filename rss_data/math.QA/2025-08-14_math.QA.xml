      <title>Hall algebras and shifted quantum affine algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09405v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In \cite{FT19}, Finkelberg and Tsymbaliuk introduced the notion of shifted quantum affine algebras and described their role in the study of quantized Coulomb branches associated to certain 3D $N = 4$ quiver gauge theories. We describe a new geometric construction of a deformation of one of these shifted quantum affine algebras as the Hall algebra of the category of representations of a certain quiver $Q_{\textrm{Rud}}$ (modulo relations). This quiver first arose in the work of Rudakov in the study of the tame blocks of the category of restricted representations of the Lie algebra $\mathfrak{sl}_2(\mathbb{F}_q)$.</description>

      <title>Quivers and BPS states in 3d and 4d</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09729v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a symmetrization relation between BPS quivers encoding 4d $\mathcal{N}=2$ theories and symmetric quivers associated to 3d $\mathcal{N}=2$ theories. We analyse in detail the symmetrization of BPS quivers for a series of $A_m$ Argyres-Douglas theories by engineering 3d-4d systems in geometric backgrounds involving appropriate 3-manifolds and Riemann surfaces. We discuss properties of these geometric backgrounds and derive the corresponding quiver partition functions from the perspective of skein modules, which forms the foundation of the symmetrization map for the minimal chamber. We also prove that the structure of wall-crossing in 4d $A_m$ Argyres-Douglas theories is isomorphic to the structure of unlinking of symmetric quivers encoding their partner 3d theories, which allows for a proper definition of the symmetrization map outside the minimal chamber. Finally, we show that the Schur indices of 4d theories are captured by symmetric quivers that include symmetrization of 4d BPS quivers.</description>

      <title>Quasi-triangular, triangular, factorizable anti-Leibniz bialgebras and anti-Leibniz Yang-Baxter equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20028v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of an anti-Leibniz bialgebra which is equivalent to a Manin triple of anti-Leibniz algebras, is equivalent to a matched pair of anti-Leibniz algebras. The study of some special anti-Leibniz bialgebras leads to the introduction of the anti-Leibniz Yang-Baxter equation in an anti-Leibniz algebra. A symmetric (or an invariant) solution of the anti-Leibniz Yang-Baxter equation gives an anti-Leibniz bialgebra. The notion of a relative Rota-Baxter operator of an anti-Leibniz algebra is introduced to construct symmetric solutions of the anti-Leibniz Yang-Baxter equation. Moreover, we introduce the notions of factorizable anti-Leibniz bialgebras and skew-symmetric Rota-Baxter anti-Leibniz algebras, and show that a factorizable anti-Leibniz bialgebra leads to a factorization of the underlying anti-Leibniz algebra. There is a one-to-one correspondence between factorizable anti-Leibniz bialgebras and skew-quadratic Rota-Baxter anti-Leibniz algebras. Finally, we constrict anti-Leibniz bialgebras form Leibniz bialgebras by the tensor product and constrict infinite-dimensional anti-Leibniz bialgebras form finite-dimensional anti-Leibniz bialgebras by the completed tensor product.</description>

      <title>Functoriality of Coulomb branches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09962v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that the affine closure of the cotangent bundle of the parabolic base affine space for $\mathrm{GL}_n$ or $\mathrm{SL}_n$ is a Coulomb branch, which confirms a conjecture of Bourget-Dancer-Grimminger-Hanany-Zhong. In particular, we show that the algebra of functions on the cotangent bundle of the parabolic base affine space of $\mathrm{GL}_n$ or $\mathrm{SL}_n$ is finitely generated.
  We prove this by showing that, if we are given a map $H \to G$ of complex reductive groups and a representation of $G$ satisfying an assumption we call gluable, then the Coulomb branch for the induced representation of $H$ is obtained from the corresponding Coulomb branch for $G$ by a certain Hamiltonian reduction procedure. In particular, we show that the Coulomb branch associated to any quiver with no loops can be obtained from Coulomb branches associated to quivers with exactly two vertices using this procedure.</description>

      <title>Analogs of the lower and upper central series in skew braces: a survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01366v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A skew brace is a ring-like and group-like algebraic structure that was introduced in the study of set-theoretic solutions to the Yang-Baxter equation. In this survey paper, we shall consider the left series, right series, socle series, and annihilator series of skew braces. They may be regarded as analogs of the lower and upper central series of groups. Other than some well-known facts regarding these series, we shall prove several new results about the relationship among their terms. We shall also consider the lower central series of skew braces that was defined by Bonatto and Jedli\v{c}ka. As we shall explain, it seems to be the ``correct" analog of the lower central series for skew braces. Concerning this, we shall also discuss the notion of the lower central series of ideals that is due to Ballester-Bolinches et al.</description>

      <title>Shuffle Products, Degenerate Affine Hecke Algebras, and Quantum Toda Lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09520v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit an identification of the quantum Toda lattice for $\mathrm{GL}_N$ and the truncated shifted Yangian of $\mathfrak{sl}_2$, as well as related constructions, from a purely algebraic point of view, bypassing the topological medium of the homology of the affine Grassmannian. For instance, we interpret the Gerasimov-Kharchev-Lebedev-Oblezin homomorphism into the algebra of difference operators via a finite analog of the Miura transform. This algebraic identification is deduced by relating degenerate affine Hecke algebras to the simplest example of a rational Feigin-Odesskii shuffle product. As a bonus, we obtain a presentation of the latter via a mirabolic version of the Kostant-Whittaker reduction.</description>

      <title>Homomorphism, substructure and ideal: Elementary but rigorous aspects of renormalization group or hierarchical structure of topological orders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23155v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a general quantum Hamiltonian formalism of a renormalization group (RG) flow with an emphasis on generalized symmetry by interpreting the elementary relationship between homomorphism, quotient ring, and projection. In our formalism, the noninvertible nature of the ideal of a fusion ring realizing the generalized symmetry of an ultraviolet (UV) theory plays a fundamental role in determining condensation rules between anyons, resulting in the infrared (IR) theories. Our algebraic method applies to the domain wall problem in $2+1$ dimensional topologically ordered systems and the corresponding classification of $1+1$ dimensional gapped phase, for example. An ideal decomposition of a fusion ring provides a straightforward but strong constraint on the gapped phase with noninvertible symmetry and its symmetry-breaking (or emergent symmetry) patterns. Moreover, even in several specific homomorphisms connected under massless RG flows, less familiar homomorphisms appear, and we conjecture that they correspond to partially solvable models in recent literature. Our work demonstrates the fundamental significance of the abstract algebraic structure, ideal, for the RG in physics.</description>

      <title>Noncommutative marked surfaces II: tagged triangulations, clusters, and their symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20393v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The aim of the paper is to define noncommutative cluster structure on several algebras ${\mathcal A}$ related to marked surfaces possibly with orbifold points of various orders, which includes noncommutative clusters, i.e., embeddings of a given group $G$ into the multiplicative monoid ${\mathcal A}^\times$ and an action of a certain braid-like group $Br_{\mathcal A}$ by automorphisms of each cluster group in a compatible way. For punctured surfaces we construct new symmetries, noncommutative tagged clusters and establish a noncommutative Laurent Phenomenon.</description>
