      <title>On the coupled hydraulic and dielectric material properties of soils: combined numerical and experimental investigations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Precise knowledge of the frequency dependent electromagnetic properties of porous media is urgently necessary for successful utilization of high frequency electromagnetic measurement techniques for near and subsurface sensing. Thus, there is a need of systematic investigations by means of dielectric spectroscopy of unsaturated and saturated soils under controlled hydraulic conditions. In this context, two-port rod based transmission lines (R-TMLs) were characterized in the frequency range from 1 MHz to 10 GHz by combined theoretical, numerical, and experimental investigations. To analyze coupled hydraulic and dielectric soil properties a slightly plastic clay soil was investigated. There is evidence that the bound water contribution of the soil is substantially lower than expected.</description>

      <title>Decoding planetary surfaces by counting cracks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07376v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Planets are often covered with thin cracked shells. From mud films to lithospheres of rock or ice, fracture networks form two-dimensional (2D) tessellations of convex polygons whose geometry encodes their genesis. Here we chart the geometry of 2D fracture mosaics across the solar system, and decode their formative conditions using a new dynamical crack model. We show that mosaics can be projected onto a Symbolic Ternary Diagram, where the relative proportions of ``T'', ``X'' and ``Y'' junctions are uniquely related to contributions from distinct modes of fracture. Most planetary mosaics cluster in a region associated with hierarchical fracture networks, where sequential cracking favors formation of T junctions. Exceptions to this rule may betray the presence of water. Europa's fracture networks stand apart due to the predominance of X junctions; this is a special feature of ice, where healing of cracks by refreezing of water allows new fractures to overprint older ones. Several fracture networks on Mars appear as outliers due the high proportion of Y junctions. These patterns -- previously interpreted as ancient mudcracks and frozen polar terrain, based on geological evidence -- are consistent with the twisting of crack junctions by cyclic volume change. Our findings suggest that counting cracks could aid in the identification of other water-influenced planetary environments.</description>

      <title>Comparing Deep Learning Models for Rice Mapping in Bhutan Using High Resolution Satellite Imagery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07482v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Bhutanese government is increasing its utilization of technological approaches such as including Remote Sensing-based knowledge in their decision-making process. This study focuses on crop type and crop extent in Paro, one of the top rice-yielding districts in Bhutan, and employs publicly available NICFI high-resolution satellite imagery from Planet. Two Deep Learning (DL) approaches, point-based (DNN) and patch-based (U-Net), models were used in conjunction with cloud-computing platforms. Three different models per DL approaches (DNN and U-Net) were trained: 1) RGBN channels from Planet; 2) RGBN and elevation data (RGBNE); 3) RGBN and Sentinel-1 (S1) data (RGBNS), and RGBN with E and S1 data (RGBNES). From this comprehensive analysis, the U-Net displayed higher performance metrics across both model training and model validation efforts. Among the U-Net model sets, the RGBN, RGBNE, RGBNS, and RGBNES models had an F1-score of 0.8546, 0.8563, 0.8467, and 0.8500 respectively. An independent model evaluation was performed and found a high level of performance variation across all the metrics. For this independent model evaluation, the U-Net RGBN, RGBNE, RGBNES, and RGBN models displayed the F1-scores of 0.5935, 0.6154, 0.5882, and 0.6582, suggesting U-Net RGBNES as the best model. The study shows that the DL approaches can predict rice. Also, DL methods can be used with the survey-based approaches currently utilized by the Bhutan Department of Agriculture. Further, this study demonstrated the usage of regional land cover products such as SERVIR's RLCMS as a weak label approach to capture different strata addressing the class imbalance problem and improving the sampling design for DL application. Finally, through preliminary model testing and comparisons outlined it was shown that using additional features such as NDVI, EVI, and NDWI did not drastically improve model performance.</description>
