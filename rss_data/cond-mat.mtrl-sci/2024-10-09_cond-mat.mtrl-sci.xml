      <title>Topology-Informed Machine Learning for Efficient Prediction of Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Electrode Polarization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05307v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning has emerged as a potent computational tool for expediting research and development in solid oxide fuel cell electrodes. The effective application of machine learning for performance prediction requires transforming electrode microstructure into a format compatible with artificial neural networks. Input data may range from a comprehensive digital material representation of the electrode to a selected set of microstructural parameters. The chosen representation significantly influences the performance and results of the network. Here, we show a novel approach utilizing persistence representation derived from computational topology. Using 500 microstructures and current-voltage characteristics obtained with 3D first-principles simulations, we have prepared an artificial neural network model that can replicate current-voltage characteristics of unseen microstructures based on their persistent image representation. The artificial neural network can accurately predict the polarization curve of solid oxide fuel cell electrodes. The presented method incorporates complex microstructural information from the digital material representation while requiring substantially less computational resources (preprocessing and prediction time approximately 1 min) compared to our high-fidelity simulations (simulation time approximately 1 hour) to obtain a single current-potential characteristic for one microstructure.</description>

      <title>Homogenized Models of Mechanical Metamaterials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05313v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Direct numerical simulations of mechanical metamaterials are prohibitively expensive due to the separation of scales between the lattice and the macrostructural size. Hence, multiscale continuum analysis plays a pivotal role in the computational modeling of metastructures at macroscopic scales. In the present work, we assess the continuum limit of mechanical metamaterials via homogenized models derived rigorously from variational methods. It is shown through multiple examples that micropolar-type effective energies, derived naturally from analysis, properly capture the kinematics of discrete lattices in two and three dimensions. Moreover, the convergence of the discrete energy to the continuum limit is shown numerically. We provide open-source computational implementations for all examples, including both discrete and homogenized models.</description>

      <title>Accelerating the discovery of low-energy structure configurations: a computational approach that integrates first-principles calculations, Monte Carlo sampling, and Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05604v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Finding Minimum Energy Configurations (MECs) is essential in fields such as physics, chemistry, and materials science, as they represent the most stable states of the systems. In particular, identifying such MECs in multi-component alloys considered candidate PFMs is key because it determines the most stable arrangement of atoms within the alloy, directly influencing its phase stability, structural integrity, and thermo-mechanical properties. However, since the search space grows exponentially with the number of atoms considered, obtaining such MECs using computationally expensive first-principles DFT calculations often results in a cumbersome task. To escape the above compromise between physical fidelity and computational efficiency, we have developed a novel physics-based data-driven approach that combines Monte Carlo sampling, first-principles DFT calculations, and Machine Learning to accelerate the discovery of MECs in multi-component alloys. More specifically, we have leveraged well-established Cluster Expansion (CE) techniques with Local Outlier Factor models to establish strategies that enhance the reliability of the CE method. In this work, we demonstrated the capabilities of the proposed approach for the particular case of a tungsten-based quaternary high-entropy alloy. However, the method is applicable to other types of alloys and enables a wide range of applications.</description>

      <title>Identifying Highly Deformable van der Waals Layered Chalcogenides with Superior Thermoelectric Performance Using Deformability Factors and Interpretable Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Van der Waals layered chalcogenide-based flexible thermoelectric devices show great potential for applications in wearable electronics. However, materials that are both highly deformable and exhibit superior thermoelectric performance are extremely limited. There is an urgent need for methods that can efficiently predict both deformability and thermoelectric performance to enable high-throughput screening of these materials. In this study, over 1000 van der Waals layered chalcogenides were high-throughput screened from material databases, the deformability of which were predicted with our previously developed deformability factor. An accurate and efficient model based on machine learning methods were developed to predict the thermoelectric properties. Several candidate materials with both deformability and thermoelectric potential were successfully discovered. Among them, NbSe2Br2 was verified by first principles calculations, achieving ZTmax value of 1.35 at 1000K, which is currently the highest value among flexible inorganic thermoelectric materials. And the power factor value of 8.1 {\mu}Wcm-1K-2 at 300K also surpassed most organic and inorganic flexible thermoelectric materials. Its high deformability mainly attributed to the small slipping energy that allows interlayer slip and the small in-plane modulus that allows deformation before failure. The high ZTmax is mainly contributed by the extremely low thermal conductivity and the high Seebeck coefficient along the out-of-plane direction at high temperature. The high power factor at room temperature is mainly comes from the high conductivity in the in-plane direction. This study is expected to accelerate the development and application of flexible thermoelectric devices based on inorganic semiconductor materials.</description>

      <title>Material elasticity determines scaling behaviour of cracking dynamics in porous materials: A precursor to crack percolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05758v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While cracking is a complex dynamics that involves material intrinsic properties like grain shape and size distribution, elastic properties of grain and cementing materials, and extrinsic properties of loading, in this work, the focus has been to check the dependence on the elastic properties of the bonding material. A 3-dimensional disordered system was constructed from spherical balls of varying radii that were chosen randomly from a log-normal distribution. The growth of micro-cracks with increasing compressive strain was monitored till the limit of the percolation crack. The two parameters varied were the bond stiffness constant and the bond strength of the material. Two distinct regimes of cracking rates were observed across a critical strain $\epsilon_{knee}$ that manifested as a knee in the cumulative crack-strain plot. The critical strain $\epsilon_{knee}$ and the strain at the percolation point $\epsilon_{perc}$ showed a power law dependence on the elastic property of the bond material. Individual micro-cracks were observed to grow sharply to a maximum value $N^{k_{b}}_{max}$, after which the number of new micro-cracks decreased, showing a long tail. The maximum $N^{k_{b}}_{max}$ was found to correspond to the strain $\epsilon_{knee}$, thus indicating that pre-$N^{k_{b}}_{max}$ cracking brittle, followed by ductile cracking behaviour of system. Lastly, we show that there exists a robust relation between $\epsilon_{knee}$ and $\epsilon_{perc}$ that is a power-law where the exponent is a function of the material elastic property. As $\epsilon_{knee}$ can be determined from acoustic signals associated with micro-cracks, our proposed relation can act as a warning towards critical strain resulting in crack percolation.</description>

      <title>Understanding the irreversible lithium loss in silicon anodes using multi-edge X-ray scattering analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05794v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: During the first charge-discharge cycle, silicon-based batteries show an important capacity loss because of the formation of the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) and morphological changes due to expansion-contraction sequence upon alloying. To understand this first-cycle irreversibility, quantitative methods are needed to characterize the chemical environment of silicon and lithium in the bulk of the cycled electrodes. Here we report a methodology based on multi-edge X-ray Raman Scattering performed on model silicon electrodes prepared in fully lithiated and fully delithiated states after the first cycle. The spectra were recorded at the C, O, F and Li K edges, as well as Si L2,3 edge. They were analysed using linear combinations of both experimental and computed reference spectra. We used prototypical SEI compounds as Li2CO3, LiF and LiPF6, as well as electrode constituents as binder and conductive carbon, cristalline Si, native SiO2,LixSi phases (x being the lithiation index) to identify the main species, isolate their relative contributions, and quantitatively evaluate the proportions of organic and inorganic products. We find that 30% of the carbonates formed in the SEI during the lithiation are dissolved on delithiation, and that part of the Li15Si4 alloys remain present after delithiation. By combining electrochemical analysis and XRS results, we identify that 17% of the lithium lost in the first cycle is trapped in disconnected silicon particles, while 30% form a fluorine-rich stable SEI and 53% a carbonate-rich partially-dissolvable SEI. These results pave the way to systematic, reference data-informed, and modelling assisted studies of SEI characteristics in the bulk of electrodes prepared under controlled state-of-charge and state-of-health conditions.</description>

      <title>Evidence of variable range hopping in the Zintl phase EuIn2P2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report a comprehensive characterization of the magnetic, electrical transport, spectral, and thermal properties of single-crystalline Zintl-type material EuIn2P2. The compound crystallizes with a hexagonal unit cell (space group P63/mmc) and orders magnetically at TC=24K with the Eu magnetic moments aligned ferromagnetically within the ab plane but tilted alternately along the c-axis direction. The effective and saturation magnetic moments agree with the theoretical values expected for the Eu2+ ion. For a range of several tens of kelvins above 40K, the electrical transport of EuIn2P2 is dominated by short-range magnetic interactions. The temperature dependence of the electrical resistivity has been modelled in terms of variable-range hopping. Another indication of the latter scenario seems to be the observation for EuIn2P2 of a quadratic dependence of the negative magnetoresistance on the magnetic field strength and the scaled magnetization. The temperature dependence of Raman band position and FWHM, as well as phonon lifetime, confirms the presence of the distinctive regions observed in transport and magnetic studies.</description>

      <title>Crystal structure and absence of magnetic order in single crystalline RuO$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05850v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: RuO$_2$ was considered for a long time to be a paramagnetic metal with an ideal rutile-type structure down to low temperatures, but recent studies on single-crystals claimed evidence for antiferromagnetic order and some symmetry breaking in the crystal structure. We have grown single-crystals of RuO2 by vapor transport using either O$_2$ or TeCl$_4$ as transport medium. These crystals exhibit metallic behavior following a $T^2$ low-temperature relation and a small paramagnetic susceptibility that can be attributed to Pauli paramagnetism. Neither the conductance nor the susceptibility measurements yield any evidence for a magnetic or a structural transition between 300K and $\sim$4 K. Comprehensive single-crystal diffraction studies with neutron and X-ray radiation reveal the rutile structure to persist until 2K in our crystals, and show nearly perfect stoichiometry. Previous observations of symmetry forbidden reflections can be attributed to multiple diffraction. Polarized single-crystal neutron diffraction experiments at 1.6K exclude the proposed antiferromagnetic structures with ordered moments larger than 0.01 Bohr magnetons.</description>

      <title>Creation, annihilation and transport of nonmagnetic antiskyrmions within Ginzburg-Landau-Devonshire model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05906v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Atomistic model calculations recently revealed that the polarization pattern at the cross-section through nanoscale ferroelectric nanodomains in rhombohedral barium titanate shows a clear antiskyrmion attributes such as the net invariant topological charge of minus two. The present work confirms that these topological defects also exist as local minima in the discretized Ginzburg-Landau-Devonshire model, which is widely used in the phase-field modeling studies. We explore by phase-field simulations how an electric field can be used to create or move antiskyrmions within a monodomain ferroelectric matrix. The process of the field-induced antiskyrmion annihilation reveals the existence of a discrete ladder of intermediate antiskyrmion states with distinct radii but common symmetry, topology and geometrical properties.</description>

      <title>Antiferroelectric Altermagnets: Antiferroelectricity Alters Magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetoelectric coupling is crucial for uncovering fundamental phenomena and advancing technologies in high-density data storage and energy-efficient devices. The emergence of altermagnets, which unify the advantages of ferromagnets and antiferromagnets, offers unprecedented opportunities for magnetoelectric coupling. However, electrically tuning altermagnets remains an outstanding challenge. Here, we demonstrate how this challenge can be overcome by using antiferroelectricity and ferroelectricity to modulate the spin splitting in altermagnets, employing a universal, symmetry-based design principle. We introduce an unexplored class of multiferroics: antiferroelectric altermagnets (AFEAM), where antiferroelectricity and altermagnetism coexist in a single material. From first-principles calculations, we validate the feasibility of AFEAM in well-established van der Waals metal thio(seleno)phosphates and perovskite oxides. We reveal the design of AFEAM ranging from two-dimensional monolayers to three-dimensional bulk structures. Remarkably, even a weak electric field can effectively toggle spin polarization in the AFEAM by switching between antiferroelectric and ferroelectric states. Our findings not only enrich the understanding of magnetoelectric coupling but also pave the way for electrically controlled spintronic and multiferroic devices.</description>

      <title>Epitaxial aluminum layer on antimonide heterostructures for exploring Josephson junction effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06085v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we present results of our recent work of epitaxially-grown aluminum (epi-Al) on antimonide heterostructures, where the epi-Al thin film is grown at either room temperature or below zero $^o$C. A sharp superconducting transition at $T \sim 1.3$ K is observed in these epi-Al films, and the critical magnetic field follows the BCS (Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer) model. We further show that supercurrent states are achieved in Josephson junctions fabricated in the epi-Al/antimonide heterostructures with mobility $\mu \sim 1.0 \times 10^6$ cm$^2$/Vs, making these heterostructures a promising platform for the exploration of Josephson junction effects for quantum microelectronics applications, and the realization of robust topological superconducting states that potentially allow the realization of intrinsically fault-tolerant qubits and quantum gates.</description>

      <title>Phase field crystal modelling of deformation assisted precipitation in binary alloys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06099v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the process of precipitation in binary alloys in the presence of mechanical deformation. It is commonly observed that mechanical deformation prior to or during precipitation leads to microstructure with excess defects, which allows for enhanced precipitate nucleation and growth rates. To investigate this phenomenon, we employ a two-dimensional phase-field crystal alloy model endowed with a temperature dependent mobility, making it capable of recovering isothermal transformation (TTT) diagrams with a characteristic inflection point (nose) about a critical temperature. We examine the variation in the time-scale of precipitation and its connection to the time-scale of the applied deformation, focusing on the roles of atomic defects in the processes involved. Our results indicate that precipitation is initially delayed through application of a deformation until a critical strain is achieved, beyond which precipitation proceeds more rapidly, assisted by plastic deformation such as grain boundary buckling or dislocation nucleation. We show that the evolution of the precipitated fraction, $f(t)$, departs from classical Avrami behaviour. Specifically, $df/dt$ develops two peaks indicative of a ``plateau"-like inflection in $f(t)$, signalling the transition to defect assisted precipitate nucleation. We analyze these plateaus as a function of the deformation rate and demonstrate that the they exhibit a discontinuous bifurcation as the time-scale of applied deformation is increased. These findings are compared to and found to be consistent with experiments.</description>

      <title>Control of Cu morphology on TaN barrier and combined Ru-TaN barrier/liner substrates for nanoscale interconnects from atomistic kinetic Monte Carlo simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The miniaturization of electronic devices brings severe challenges in the deposition of metal interconnects in back end of line processing due to a continually decreasing volume available for metal deposition in the interconnect via. Cu is currently used as the interconnect metal and requires barrier and liner layers to prevent diffusion into silicon and promote deposition of smooth conducting metal films, respectively. However, these take up a significant volume in the interconnect vias, which are already extremely narrow due to the high aspect ratio required. Designing combined barrier/liner materials provides opportunities to promote deposition of smooth films and avoid islanding and frees up precious volume to deposit the required amount of interconnect metal. We present here the first atomistic kinetic Monte Carlo (kMC) investigation of the potential of Ru-modified TaN as a dual-function barrier/line material to promote 2D morphology of deposited Cu enabling optimization of the limited available interconnect volume. The kMC simulations use Density Functional Theory (DFT) activation barriers to predict the role of the combined barrier/liner material on the morphology of deposited Cu and give, for the first time, a tool to predict metal deposition on technologically important substrates. We study Cu deposition at different partial pressures on a series of substrates, including unmodified TaN and TaN with 25% or 50% surface Ru incorporation, at deposition temperatures of 300 K, 500 K and 800 K. The deposition simulations predict Cu film roughness, island size and number, substrate exposure area (as a measure of 2D vs. 3D morphology), layer occupation rate, compactness (as a measure of film quality) and the impact of annealing. As-deposited Cu on unmodified TaN exhibits significantly higher roughness and substrate exposure areas, demonstrating island formation...</description>

      <title>Electrodeposition of amorphous molybdenum sulfo-selenide as a low-cost catalyst</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06136v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Overall, the MoSx system has shown greater catalytic activity over the traditional MoS2 based systems due to the absence of discrete basal plane, and differing structural arrangements. This increases the overall catalytic site density alongside adequate electronic conductivity from short-range atomic arrangements that allow for use in electrochemical processes. Here we translate prior efforts to improve electrocatalysis via Se incorporation within the crystalline system to the polymeric system, as several of the active sites in the a-MoSx have similar motifs and bonding environments as those found in MoS2. We use a single-electrolyte electrodeposition synthesis technique in order to provide a scalable, low-cost material. We demonstrate the influence of the electrolyte conditions on the films physical, chemical, electronic, and catalytic properties as a function of selenium content through a comprehensive study via Raman spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, UV-Vis spectroscopy, and electrochemical methods. Together, these results highlight selenium's role in the Se-MoSx system in promoting the catalytic efficacy of these catalysts.</description>

      <title>Broken intrinsic symmetry induced magnon-magnon coupling in synthetic ferrimagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Synthetic antiferromagnets offer rich magnon energy spectra in which optical and acoustic magnon branches can hybridize. Here, we demonstrate a broken intrinsic symmetry induced coupling of acoustic and optical magnons in a synthetic ferrimagnet consisting of two dissimilar antiferromagnetically interacting ferromagnetic metals. Two distinct magnon modes hybridize at degeneracy points, as indicated by an avoided level-crossing. The avoided level-crossing gap depends on the interlayer exchange interaction between the magnetic layers, which can be controlled by adjusting the non-magnetic interlayer thickness. An exceptionally large avoided level crossing gap of 6 GHz is revealed, exceeding the coupling strength that is typically found in other magnonic hybrid systems based on a coupling of magnons with photons or magnons and phonons.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06181v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Achieving deterministic control over the properties of low-dimensional materials with nanoscale precision is a long-sought goal. Mastering this capability has a transformative impact on the design of multifunctional electrical and optical devices. Here, we present an ion-assisted synthetic technique that enables precise control over the material composition and energy landscape of two-dimensional (2D) atomic crystals. Our method transforms binary transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), like MoSe$_2$, into ternary MoS$_{2\alpha}$Se$_{2(1-{\alpha}})$ alloys with systematically adjustable compositions, ${\alpha}$. By piecewise assembly of the lateral, compositionally modulated MoS$_{2\alpha}$Se$_{2(1-{\alpha})}$ segments within 2D atomic layers, we present a synthetic pathway towards the realization of multi-compositional designer materials. Our technique enables the fabrication of complex structures with arbitrary boundaries, dimensions as small as 30 nm, and fully customizable energy landscapes. Our optical characterizations further showcase the potential for implementing tailored optoelectronics in these engineered 2D crystals.</description>

      <title>Linear and nonlinear optical response based on many-body GW-Bethe-Salpeter and Kadanoff-Baym approaches for two-dimensional layered semiconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06218v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The family of 2D layered semiconductors, including transition metal chalcogenides (TMCs) of the form MX (M=Ga, In; X=S, Se, Te) exhibit exceptional nonlinear optical properties. The energetically most favorable crystal ordering for nonlinear response is the AB layer stacking, which breaks central inversion symmetry for an arbitrary number of layers, resulting in non-zero off-diagonal elements of the $\chi^{(2n')}$ tensor, $n'$ being a positive integer, for arbitrary thickness of the materials. We perform first-principles many-body calculations of bandstructures and linear and nonlinear optical responses of monolayer (ML) and bulk TMC crystals based on $GW$-Bethe-Salpeter and Kadanoff-Baym approaches in and out of equilibrium, respectively, while taking many-body band gap renormalization and excitonic effects into account. We develop a detailed analysis of the linear and nonlinear optical selection rules by means of group and representation theory. We observe the general trend that the lowest-energy excitons are dark in 2D ML TMCs whereas they are bright or mixed bright-dark in 3D bulk TMCs, which we attribute to the difference between spatially dependent screening in 2D and constant screening in 3D. In particular, we derive general formulas for the nonlinear optical response based on exciton states in semiconductor materials. We find anti-bound excitons in ML GaS, which we attribute to dominant exciton exchange interaction. We show that by choosing elements with larger mass and by reducing the detuning energy it is possible to increase the nonlinear response not only for $\chi^{(2)}$ and $\chi^{(3)}$, responsible for SHG and third harmonic generation (THG), but also in general for $\chi^{(n)}$ nonlinear response with $n&gt;3$, giving rise to high harmonic generation (HHG) in 2D semiconductor materials.</description>

      <title>Anomalous size dependence of the coercivity of nanopatterned CrGeTe3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06258v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The coercivity of single-domain magnetic nanoparticles typically decreases with the nanoparticle size and reaches zero when thermal fluctuations overcome the magnetic anisotropy. Here, we used SQUID-on-tip microscopy to investigate the coercivity of square-shaped CrGeTe3 nanoislands with a wide range of sizes and width-to-thickness aspect ratios. The results reveal an anomalous size-dependent coercivity, with smaller islands exhibiting higher coercivity. The nonconventional scaling of the coercivity in CrGeTe3 nanoislands was found to be inversely proportional to the island width and thickness (1 over wd). This scaling implies that the nanoisland magnetic anisotropy is proportional to the perimeter rather than the volume, suggesting a magnetic edge state. In addition, we observe that 1600 nm wide islands display multi-domain structures with zero net remnant field, corresponding to the magnetic properties of pristine CrGeTe3 flakes. Our findings highlight the significant influence of edge states on the magnetic properties of CrGeTe3 and deepen our understanding of low-dimensional magnetic systems.</description>

      <title>Formation of Lattice Vacancies and their Effects on Lithium-ion Transport in LiBO2 Crystals: Comparative Ab Initio Studies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06284v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The monoclinic (m-LBO) and tetragonal (t-LBO) polymorphs of LiBO2 have significant potential for applications such as solid electrolytes and electrode coatings of lithium-ion batteries. While comparative experimental studies of electron and lithium transport in these polymorphs exist, the role of lattice vacancies on lithium transport remains unclear. In this study, we employed density functional theory (DFT) to investigate the impact of boron and oxygen vacancies on the lattice structure, electronic properties, and lithium migration energy barrier (Em) in m-LBO and t-LBO. Our DFT results reveal that boron and oxygen vacancies affect lithium transport in both the polymorphs, but in different ways. While oxygen vacancies lower Em in m-LBO, they increases Em in t-LBO. In contrast, boron vacancies significantly reduce Em in both m-LBO and t-LBO, leading to enhanced diffusivity and ionic conductivity in both polymorphs. This improvement suggests a potential strategy for improving ionic conductivity in LiBO2 through boron vacancy generation.</description>

      <title>Suppression of Generation-Recombination Noise in Topological Insulators Through Indium Substitution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we carry out low-frequency noise spectroscopy (1/f) of highly bulk insulating and disordered thin films of (Bi0.3Sb0.7)2Te3(BST) topological insulator and compare these experimental results of these thin films with the In-doped In0.14(Bi0.3Sb0.7)1.86Te3(IBST) which has enhanced bulk insulating character. The thickness of these thin films is kept around 20nm and temperature-dependent resistance measurements show a highly bulk insulating character where the fermi level is located in the bulk band gap intersecting the Dirac cone only. The analysis of temperature-dependent power spectral density of the two thin films reveals a significant role of Indium (In) substitution in reducing the noise spectra caused by the generation-recombination mechanism in these ternary topological insulator thin films. These results offer potential for exploring topological quantum phase transitions through noise spectroscopy and suggest promising applications in the development of efficient, low-power spintronic devices that can operate near room temperature.</description>

      <title>High Pressure Structural Behavior of Silicon Telluride (Si2Te3) Nanoplates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06323v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The high-pressure behavior of silicon telluride (Si2Te3), a two-dimensional (2D) layered material, was investigated using synchrotron X-ray powder diffraction in a diamond anvil cell to 11.5 GPa coupled with first-principles theory. Si2Te3 undergoes a phase transition at &lt; 1 GPa from a trigonal to a hexagonal crystal structure. At higher pressures (&gt; 8.5 GPa), X-ray diffraction showed the appearance of new peaks possibly coincident with a new phase transition, though we suspect Si2Te3 retains a hexagonal structure. Density functional theory calculations of the band structure reveal metallization above 9.1 GPa consistent with previous measurements of the Raman spectra and disappearance of color and transparency at pressure. The theoretical Raman spectra reproduce the prominent features of the experiment, though a deeper analysis suggests that the orientation of Si dimers dramatically influences the vibrational response. Given the complex structure of Si2Te3, simulation of the resulting high-pressure phase is complicated by disordered vacancies and the initial orientations of Si-Si dimers in the crushed layered phase.</description>

Abstract: The Gaussian approximation potential (GAP) machine-learning-inspired functional form was the first to be used for a general-purpose interatomic potential. The atomic cluster expansion (ACE), previously the subject of a KIM Review, and its multilayer neural-network extension (MACE) have joined GAP among the methods widely used for machine-learning interatomic potentials. Here I review extensions to the original GAP formalism, as well as ACE and MACE-based frameworks that maintain the good features and mitigate the limitations of the original GAP approach.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06414v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report an extensive molecular dynamics study of ab-initio quality of the ferroelectric phase transition in crystalline PbTiO3. We model anharmonicity accurately in terms of potential energy and polarization surfaces trained on density functional theory data with modern machine learning techniques. Our simulations demonstrate that the transition has a strong order-disorder character, in agreement with diffraction experiments, and provide fresh insight into the approach to equilibrium upon crossing the transition temperature. We find that the macroscopic polarization appears/disappears due to dipolar switching at the nanometer scale. We also compute the infrared optical absorption spectra in both the ferroelectric and the paraelectric phases, finding good agreement with the experimental Raman frequencies. For a long time, the almost ideal displacive character of the soft mode detected by Raman scattering in the paraelectric phase has been contrasted with the order-disorder character of the transition suggested by diffraction. We settle this issue by showing that the soft mode coexists with a strong Debye relaxation due to the thermal disordering of the dipoles. The Debye relaxation feature is centered at zero frequency and appears near the transition temperature in both the ferroelectric and the paraelectric phases.</description>

      <title>Generative AI for Discovering Porous Oxide Materials for Next-Generation Energy Storage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The key challenge in advancing multivalent-ion batteries lies in finding suitable intercalation hosts. Open-tunnel oxides, featuring one-dimensional channels or nanopores, show promise for enabling effective ion transport. However, the vast range of compositional possibilities renders traditional experimental and quantum-based methods impractical for large-scale studies. This work presents a generative AI framework that uses the Crystal Diffusion Variational Autoencoder (CDVAE) and a fine-tuned Large Language Model (LLM) to expedite the discovery of stable open-tunneled oxide materials for multivalent-ion batteries.
  By combining machine learning with data mining techniques, five promising transition metal oxide (TMO) structures are generated. These structures, known for forming open-tunnel oxide frameworks, are structurally validated through Density Functional Theory (DFT). The results show that the generated structures have lower formation energies compared to similar compositions in the Materials Project (MP) database, indicating improved thermodynamic stability.
  Additionally, the graph-based M3GNet model is employed to relax further generated structures, providing a more computationally efficient alternative to DFT. Machine learning-based predictions of formation energy, band gap, and energy above the hull refine the selection process, leading to the identification of materials with significant potential for real-world battery applications. This research demonstrates the power of generative AI in rapidly exploring the vast chemical space of TMOs, offering a new approach to discovering stable open-tunnel oxides for multivalent-ion batteries. The results highlight the potential of this approach to contribute to more sustainable energy storage technologies, addressing the growing concerns surrounding the scarcity of lithium.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic Thermal Conductivity of 3D Printed Graphene Enhanced Thermoplastic Polyurethanes Structure toward Photothermal Conversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solar photothermal conversion is one of the most straightforward methods to utilize solar energy. In this manuscript, a novel double-layer structure constructed of graphene enhanced thermoplastic polyurethanes (G-TPU) and neat thermoplastic polyurethanes (N-TPU) was developed via fused deposition modelling (FDM) 3D printing process. The developed G-TPU-N-TPU double-layer structure exhibited anisotropic thermal conductivity that simultaneously satisfied high in-plane (IP) thermal conductivity and low through-plane (TP) thermal conductivity. The top G-TPU layer essentially offered a high IP thermal conductivity of 4.54 W(mK) that lead to overall structure anisotropic thermal conductivity ratio (TCIP-TCTP) of 8. And the low thermal conductivity in the TP direction led to the heat retention effects for thermal storage. Nonetheless, the exceptional photothermal conversion effect of graphene flakes guaranteed the superior photothermal performance that was promising in the photothermal de-icing and infrared labels applications. Finally, the graphene flake enhancement in the mechanical properties of the G-TPU-N-TPU double layer structure was also evaluated that contributed to excellent impact resistance with a puncture energy reaching 12.86 J, and extraordinary wear resistance with a small friction coefficient of 0.1 over 1000 cycles, which ensured the structure suitable for applications at harsh environment.</description>

      <title>High proton conductivity through angstrom-porous titania</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two dimensional (2D) crystals have attracted strong interest as a new class of proton conducting materials that can block atoms, molecules and ions while allowing proton transport through the atomically thin basal planes. Although 2D materials exhibit this perfect selectivity, the reported proton conductivities have been relatively low. Here we show that vacancy-rich titania monolayers are highly permeable to protons while remaining impermeable to helium with proton conductivity exceeding 100 S cm-2 at 200 C and surpassing targets set by industry roadmaps. The fast and selective proton transport is attributed to an extremely high density of titanium-atom vacancies (one per square nm), which effectively turns titania monolayers into angstrom-scale sieves. Our findings highlight the potential of 2D oxides as membrane materials for hydrogen-based technologies.</description>

Abstract: ThMn12-type (Sm,Zr)1(Fe,Co,Ti)12 compounds show great potential for permanent magnets. Magnetically hard anisotropic powders prepared via reduction-diffusion exhibit a significant increase in coercivity from 0.45 T to 1.26 T as the processing temperature is raised from 990{\deg}C to 1220{\deg}C. Structural and microchemical analyses at high-resolution reveal that high-temperature processing annihilates grain boundaries (GBs) and reduces the density of twin boundaries (TBs), which are defects acting as weak links limiting the coercivity in the 1:12 system. Ostwald ripening is proposed as the mechanism behind the reduction of GB and TB densities at higher temperature, driven by the reduction in interfacial energy and enhancing atomic structural uniformity.</description>

      <title>Iron phosphate glass structure at different length scale with emphasis on the medium range: a classical molecular dynamic study</title>

Abstract: Glasses are known to have medium range order (MRO) but its link to any experimentally measurable quantity is still ambiguous. The first sharp diffraction peak (FSDP) in structure-factor S(q) obtained from diffraction experiments on glasses has been associated with this MRO but understanding the fundamental origin of this universal peak is still an open problem. We have addressed this issue for a complex glass i.e. iron phosphate glass (IPG) through atomistic models generated from a hybrid approach (our in-house developed MC code with MD simulation). We have performed a comparative study by generating glass models from different initial configurations and randomization techniques. The developed IPG models were first validated with existing data on short range order (SRO) and MRO, through study of pair correlation functions, bond angle distributions and coordination number (CN) for SRO and rings distribution, FSDP in structure factor and void size distribution for MRO. The study of coordination environment of oxygen is specifically shown to aide in understanding glass formation through topological constraint theory. Thereafter to understand the fundamental origin of FSDP in S(q), structure factors were calculated corresponding to individual ring sizes present in the model. The relative contribution of these individual S(q)s in the total experimental S(q) is estimated using an inverse fitting approach. The contributions thus obtained directly correlated with rings size percentages in the models for the considered q-range. Through this exercise we can connect the rings distribution of an atomistic glass model with an experimentally measurable quantity like FSDP in S(q) for a complex glass like IPG.</description>

      <title>Order in disorder: oxygen vacancy driven electronic phase separation of LaNiO3-x epitaxial thin film surface investigated by scanning probe microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06598v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Oxygen vacancies in nickelates are known to introduce a variety of emergent phenomena and are considered to significantly affect conductivity. Few studies have examined real-space evidence for oxygen vacancies on the surface, particularly using scanning probe microscopy. Understanding the surface composition, both structurally and chemically, is crucial for the application of nickelates, such as in electrochemical water splitting reactions as catalysts. In this study, we investigate a 20 nm epitaxial LaNiO3-x(LNO) film grown on SrTiO3 (STO) via pulsed laser deposition. We examine the surface of this film using scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and reveal a complex surface morphology composed of densely packed crystalline nanometer-sized circular features with radius ranging from 10 to 20 nm. Scanning tunneling spectroscopy revealed an electronic inhomogeneity, or phase separation, in nanoscale islands of semi-conductive nature embedded within a metallic matrix. This change in the electronic density of the states was associated with increased concentration of oxygen vacancies. Further evidence for significant oxygen vacancies at the surface was inferred by examining scanning tunneling tip-induced surface degradation. The strong electric field between the tip and sample likely facilitates oxygen removal in a vacuum environment, increasing the formation of vacancies, which can lead to the breakdown of the crystal structure. This provides insight into the possible origin of the chemical surface transformation during the electrochemical water splitting reaction of this nickelate.</description>

      <title>Functional Groups Accessibility and the Origin of Photoluminescence in N/O-containing Bottom-up Carbon Nanodots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06677v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chemical functionalization of carbon nanodots (CNDs) offers a valuable opportunity to tailor multifunctionality in these nanocarbons, by engineering the composition of their molecular surface. Therefore, it is important to elucidate the type and amount of CNDs functionalization to be able to design their properties accurately. CNDs are often functionalized through amide coupling without validating the degree of functionalization. As a measure of functionalization, the amounts of primary amines via Kaiser test (KT) or imine reactions of the bare CNDs is often considered. However, this may lead to overestimating the degree of functionalization obtained by the pure amide coupling due to different reaction mechanisms and involved intermediates. Herein, four different CNDs prepared by microwave-assisted synthesis from arginine or citric acid with varying amounts of ethylenediamine are presented. We resorted to a combination of physicochemical methods to provide elemental, structural, and optical information. By that, we developed a method to quantify the degree of functionalization by amide coupling and show that the functionalization is lower than one would expect. Comparing experimental optical features of the CNDs with different computed model systems further allows us to provide a more advanced vision of structure-property relationships in these still elusive nanocarbons.</description>

      <title>Terahertz-driven parametric excitation of Raman-active phonons in LaAlO$_{3}$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06748v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Achieving parametric excitation in an oscillating physical system involves periodically adjusting one of its parameters to modulate the oscillator's natural frequency. This phenomenon has been observed in numerous systems within physics and engineering, profoundly transforming modern science and technology. Despite rapid progress, the parametric control of collective excitations, such as phonons, remains a challenge while promising to generate novel and intriguing effects in a largely unexplored field. Here, we investigate the terahertz (THz) field-induced dynamics of Raman-active phonons in LaAlO$_3$ (LAO), an archetypal quantum material for its electronic and structural properties. Utilizing intense THz pulses, we demonstrate a novel mechanism of parametric phonon excitation marked by substantial subharmonic components. Theoretical analysis can successfully capture the hallmarks of the observed phenomena in a physical scenario with the THz field inducing a parametric coupling between the Raman mode and pairs of acoustic phonon excitations.</description>

      <title>Oxide Membranes from Bulk Micro-Machining of SrTiO3 substrates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06758v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Suspended micro-structures based on complex oxides relies on surface micro-machining processes such as those based on sacrificial layers. These processes prevent to physically access the microstructures from both sides, as substantial part of the substrate is not removed. In this work, we develop a bulk micromachining protocol of a commonly used substrate employed in oxide thin film deposition. We realize suspended oxide thin film devices by fabricating pass-through holes across SrTiO3(100) or SrTiO3(110) substrates. Careful calibration of anisotropic etching rates allows controlling the final geometry of the aperture in the substrate in a predictable way. As demonstrators of possible device geometries, we present clamped membranes and trampolines of (La,Sr)MnO3, a conductive magnetic oxide, and a suspended trampoline resonator carved from the SrTiO3 substrate itself. Reported protocols can be readily extended to a broad variety of other complex oxides so to extend the application of membranes technology beyond those of commercially-available silicon compounds.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we review the models and their parameters to describe the relative permittivity, bandgap, impact ionization, mobility, charge carrier recombination/effective masses and incomplete dopand ionization of 4H silicon carbide in computer simulations. We aim to lower the entrance barrier for newcomers and provide a critical evaluation of the status quo to identify shortcomings and guide future research. The review reveals a rich set of often diverging values in literature based on a variety of calculation and measurement methods. Although research for all the selected parameters is still active, we show that sometimes old values or those determined for other kinds of silicon carbide are commonly used.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By coupling unstable components, we demonstrate a novel approach that reduces static modulus to zero, eliminating causality-imposed absorption limitations in acoustics. Our heuristic model simulations achieve ultra-broadband absorption over 99% for wavelengths greater than 132 times the absorber thickness. Theoretical analysis further proves this strategy can approach ideal blackbody behavior with infinitesimal thickness. These findings suggest fundamental physical laws no longer prevent true blackbody absorption realization; the only remaining obstacle is the material limitations.</description>

      <title>Activating the Basal Plane of 2D Transition Metal Dichalcogenides via High-Entropy Alloying</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06876v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) materials, such as transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) in the 2H or 1T crystal phases, are promising (electro)catalyst candidates due to their high surface to volume ratio and composition of low-cost, abundant elements. While the edges of elemental TMDC nanoparticles, such as MoS$_2$, can show significant catalytic activity, the basal plane of the pristine materials are notoriously inert, which limits their normalized activity. Here we show that high densities of catalytically active sites can be formed on the TMDC basal plane by alloying elements that prefer the 2H (1T) phase into a 1T (2H) structure. The global stability of the alloy, in particular whether it crystallizes in the 2H or 1T phase, can be controlled by ensuring a majority of elements preferring the target phase. We further show that the mixing entropy plays a decisive role for stabilizing the alloy implying that high-entropy alloying becomes essential. Our calculations point to a number of interesting non-precious hydrogen evolution catalysts, including (CrHfTaVZr)S$_2$ and (CrNbTiVZr)S$_2$ in the T-phase and (MoNbTaVTi)S$_2$ in the H-phase. Our work opens new directions for designing catalytic sites via high-entropy alloy stabilization of locally unstable structures.</description>

      <title>Electric Field Driven Domain Wall Dynamics in BaTiO3 Nanoparticles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06980v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report a detailed investigation into the response of single BaTiO3 (BTO) nanocrystals under applied electric fields (E-field) using Bragg Coherent Diffraction Imaging (BCDI). Our study reveals pronounced domain wall migration and expansion of a sample measure in situ under applied electric field. The changes are most prominent at the surface of the nanocrystal, where the lack of external strain allows greater domain wall mobility. The observed domain shifts are correlated to the strength and orientation of the applied E-field, following a side-by-side domain model from Suzana et al. Notably, we identified a critical voltage threshold at +10 V, which leads to irreversible structural changes, suggesting plastic deformation. The findings highlight how surface effects and intrinsic defects contribute to the enhanced dielectric properties of BTO at the nanoscale, in contrast to bulk materials, where strain limits domain mobility. These findings deepen our understanding of nanoscale dielectric behaviour and inform the design of advanced nanoelectronic devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07042v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional heterostructures have been crucial in advancing optoelectronic devices utilizing van der Waals materials. Semiconducting transition metal dichalcogenide monolayers, known for their unique optical properties, offer extensive possibilities for light-emitting devices. Recently, a memory-driven optical device, termed a Mem-emitter, was proposed using these monolayers atop dielectric substrates. The successful realization of such devices heavily depends on selecting the optimal substrate. Here, we report a pronounced memory effect in a MoSe$_2$/clinochlore device, evidenced by electric hysteresis in the intensity and energy of MoSe$_2$ monolayer emissions. This demonstrates both population-driven and transition-rate-driven Mem-emitter abilities. Our theoretical approach correlates these memory effects with internal state variables of the substrate, emphasizing that clinochlore layered structure is crucial for a robust and rich memory response. This work introduces a novel two-dimensional device with promising applications in memory functionalities, highlighting the importance of alternative insulators in fabricating van der Waals heterostructures.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the Face-Dependent Ice Growth Kinetics: Insights from Molecular Dynamics on the Basal and Prism Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07050v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ice nucleation and growth are critical in many fields, including atmospheric science, cryobiology, and aviation. However, understanding the detailed mechanisms of ice crystal growth remains challenging. In this work, crystallization at the ice/quasi-liquid layer (QLL) interface of the basal and primary prism (prism1) surfaces of hexagonal ice (Ih) was investigated using molecular dynamics simulations across a wide range of temperatures for the TIP4P/Ice model, with comparisons to the mW coarse-grained model. Together with elucidating the temperature-dependent mechanisms of crystallization, face-specific growth rates were systematically estimated. While the prism surface generally exhibits faster growth rates than the basal surface, a temperature-dependent crossover in growth rates between the basal and prism surfaces is observed in TIP4P/Ice simulations, which correlates with a crossover in QLL thickness and with the well-known column to platelets transition in ice-crystal habits at low vapour pressure. This observation helps decode the complex dependence between crystal morphology and temperature in ice crystals.</description>

      <title>Measuring Minority Carrier Diffusion Length Using High-Injection Scanning Photocurrent Microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scanning photocurrent microscopy (SPCM) has been widely used for characterizing charge transport properties, in particular, the minority carrier diffusion length of semiconductors. However, studying lightly doped or intrinsic semiconductors using SPCM remained challenging. Methods used in previous work required low levels of optical injection, which could not be fulfilled easily in semiconductors with lower carrier concentration. In this work, using finite-element simulation, we show that the minority diffusion length can also be quantified under high optical excitation. Not only being applicable both doped and intrinsic semiconductors, the method also lifted the restriction of implementing a Schottky contact in testing devices -- a condition assumed to be necessary in previous studies. The results significantly expanded the versatility of SPCM in studying a broad spectrum of semiconducting materials with unprecedented flexibility in experimental conditions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.05281v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Heterogeneous materials, crucial in various engineering applications, exhibit complex multiscale behavior, which challenges the effectiveness of traditional computational methods. In this work, we introduce the Micromechanics Transformer ({\em Micrometer}), an artificial intelligence (AI) framework for predicting the mechanical response of heterogeneous materials, bridging the gap between advanced data-driven methods and complex solid mechanics problems. Trained on a large-scale high-resolution dataset of 2D fiber-reinforced composites, Micrometer can achieve state-of-the-art performance in predicting microscale strain fields across a wide range of microstructures, material properties under any loading conditions and We demonstrate the accuracy and computational efficiency of Micrometer through applications in computational homogenization and multiscale modeling, where Micrometer achieves 1\% error in predicting macroscale stress fields while reducing computational time by up to two orders of magnitude compared to conventional numerical solvers. We further showcase the adaptability of the proposed model through transfer learning experiments on new materials with limited data, highlighting its potential to tackle diverse scenarios in mechanical analysis of solid materials. Our work represents a significant step towards AI-driven innovation in computational solid mechanics, addressing the limitations of traditional numerical methods and paving the way for more efficient simulations of heterogeneous materials across various industrial applications.</description>

      <title>Early-Cycle Internal Impedance Enables ML-Based Battery Cycle Life Predictions Across Manufacturers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05326v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Predicting the end-of-life (EOL) of lithium-ion batteries across different manufacturers presents significant challenges due to variations in electrode materials, manufacturing processes, cell formats, and a lack of generally available data. Methods that construct features solely on voltage-capacity profile data typically fail to generalize across cell chemistries. This study introduces a methodology that combines traditional voltage-capacity features with Direct Current Internal Resistance (DCIR) measurements, enabling more accurate and generalizable EOL predictions. The use of early-cycle DCIR data captures critical degradation mechanisms related to internal resistance growth, enhancing model robustness. Models are shown to successfully predict the number of cycles to EOL for unseen manufacturers of varied electrode composition with a mean absolute error (MAE) of 150 cycles. This cross-manufacturer generalizability reduces the need for extensive new data collection and retraining, enabling manufacturers to optimize new battery designs using existing datasets. Additionally, a novel DCIR-compatible dataset is released as part of ongoing efforts to enrich the growing ecosystem of cycling data and accelerate battery materials development.</description>

      <title>Chiral superconductivity from parent Chern band and its non-Abelian generalization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.05384v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a minimal model starting from a parent Chern band with quartic dispersion that can describe the spin-valley polarized electrons in rhombohedral tetra-layer graphene. The interplay between repulsive and attractive interactions on top of that parent Chern band is studied. We conduct standard self-consistent mean-field calculations, and find a rich phase diagram that consists of metal, quantum anomalous Hall crystal, chiral topological superconductor, as well as trivial gapped Bose-Einstein condensate. In particular, there exists a topological phase transition from the chiral superconductor to the Bose-Einstein condensate at zero temperature. Motivated by the recent experimental and theoretical studies of composite Fermi liquid in rhombohedral stacked multi-layer graphene, we further generalize the physical electron model to its composite fermion counterpart based on a field theory analysis. We argue that a chiral spin liquid phase can emerge in the vicinity of the chiral superconductor phase of the composite fermion, i.e., the non-Abelian Moore-Read quantum Hall phase. Our work suggests rhombohedral multi-layer graphene as a potential platform for rich correlated topological phases.</description>

      <title>Slow Equilibrium Relaxation in a Chiral Magnet Mediated by Topological Defects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05485v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We performed a pump-probe experiment on the chiral magnet Cu$_2$OSeO$_3$ to study the relaxation dynamics of its non-collinear magnetic orders, employing a millisecond magnetic field pulse as the pump and resonant elastic x-ray scattering as the probe. Our findings reveal that the system requires $\sim$0.2 s to stabilize after the perturbation applied to both the conical and skyrmion lattice phase; significantly slower than the typical nanosecond timescale observed in micromagnetics. This prolonged relaxation is attributed to the formation and slow dissipation of local topological defects, such as emergent monopoles. By unveiling the experimental lifetime of these emergent singularities in a non-collinear magnetic system, our study highlights a universal relaxation mechanism in solitonic textures within the slow dynamics regime, offering new insights into topological physics and advanced information storage solutions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.05518v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In-medium effective carriers with position-dependent mass in a multishell heterostructure are analytically studied. We obtain the exact spectrum of three-dimensional bound eigenstates and the scattering wave-functions for several von Roos ordering classes. Ascribing a continuously varying mass to the carriers in a multilayer type spherical system we use our solutions to compute optical properties such as the absorption coefficients and refraction indices of a nanometric heterostructure. We analyze in detail the case of a GaAs/Al-GaAs alloy and show how these results depend on the ordering class of the kinetic Hamiltonian.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning Inversion from Scattering for Mechanically Driven Polymers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05574v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a Machine Learning Inversion method for analyzing scattering functions of mechanically driven polymers and extracting the corresponding feature parameters, which include energy parameters and conformation variables. The polymer is modeled as a chain of fixed-length bonds constrained by bending energy, and it is subject to external forces such as stretching and shear. We generate a data set consisting of random combinations of energy parameters, including bending modulus, stretching, and shear force, along with Monte Carlo-calculated scattering functions and conformation variables such as end-to-end distance, radius of gyration, and the off-diagonal component of the gyration tensor. The effects of the energy parameters on the polymer are captured by the scattering function, and principal component analysis ensures the feasibility of the Machine Learning inversion. Finally, we train a Gaussian Process Regressor using part of the data set as a training set and validate the trained regressor for inversion using the rest of the data. The regressor successfully extracts the feature parameters.</description>

      <title>Tunable high Chern-number quantum anomalous Hall effect through interlayer ferromagnetic coupling in two-dimensional ferromagnet NiSbO3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05718v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The high Chern-number quantum anomalous Hall effect (QAHE) is significant and fascinating due to the presence of multiple dissipationless chiral edge states. Here, we predict that monolayer NiSbO3 possesses the Chern number C = 3, confirmed by the anomalous Hall conductance and the chiral edge states. The magnetic anisotropic energy (MAE) responsible for ferromagnetic order is 0.641 meV originating from Ni-d and Sb-p orbitals, where the contributed MAE from same spin-up channels predominates. In forward electric fields, the negative MAE makes the easy magnetization direction perpendicular to the surface, which is conducive to the realizing of high Chern-number QAHE. The simulated Curie temperature is 291 K. Intriguingly, in a bilayer, the obtained C = 6 is twice that of the monolayer, thanking to the interlayer ferromagnetic coupling. Our work offers a promising candidate for potential applications in topological quantum devices and spintronics.</description>

      <title>Room- and low-temperature magnetic parameters of Y$_3$AlFe$_4$O$_{12}$ garnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05879v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic properties of Y$_3$AlFe$_4$O$_{12}$ garnet ceramics have been studied over a wide range of temperature ($3-370$ K) and magnetic fields (up to $2$ kOe). Effects of varying the temperature on some of the application-specific magnetic characteristics have been analyzed in detail. With the decrease in temperature, the effective anisotropy constant, $K_{Eff}$, is found to sharply rise below $\sim150$ K, while the saturation magnetization, $M_s$, changes only slightly ($&lt;20\%$ within $3-250$ K). The exchange stiffness, $A_{ex}$, and spin wave stiffness, $D$, parameters mirror the relatively smooth behavior of the magnetization at low temperatures but display a rapid drop when $T$ approaches $T_C\approx436$ K. The temperature dependence of the domain wall thickness and the critical single-domain size correlate with the corresponding values for pure Y$_3$Fe$_5$O$_{12}$ (YIG) and are in agreement with the theoretical estimates. We conclude by discussing the ways of how to use the obtained results for tailoring the magnetic properties of YIG-based materials for technological applications.</description>

      <title>Transport properties and Kohler's rule in $R$$_x$Lu$_{1-x}$B$_{12}$ solid solutions with $x$ $\leq$ 0.03: do charge stripes really exist in metallic dodecaborides?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06110v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nonmagnetic metal LuB$_{12}$ is known to exhibit considerable transport anisotropy, which was explained in literature by different mechanisms including possible formation of dynamic charge stripes below the point $\sim$ 150K. Here we study transport properties of solid solutions based on LuB$_{12}$ host compound with general formula $R$$_x$Lu$_{1-x}$B$_{12}$ ($R$$-$Dy, Er, Tm, Yb, Lu) and with $x$ $\leq$ 0.03. The experiment has been performed on single crystals of high quality in the temperature range 1.8 $-$ 300K in magnetic fields up to 82kOe. The application of several models to the analysis of zero-field resistivity is discussed. A phenomenological description of large positive quadratic component of transverse magnetoresistance $\Delta$$\rho$/$\rho$($H$) = $\mu_D^2$$H^2$, which dominates for all compounds under investigation, allows to estimate drift mobility exponential changes $\mu_D$ $\sim$ $T^{-\alpha}$ with the index $\alpha$ $\approx$ 0.95 $-$ 1.46. In order to check the existence of additional channel of scattering, caused by probable presence of dynamic charge stripes, we performed the study of the anisotropy of magnetoresistance in Dy$_{0.01}$Lu$_{0.99}$B$_{12}$ and Tm$_{0.03}$Lu$_{0.97}$B$_{12}$ compositions including the measurements of the field scans with different current and field geometries. The data obtained allow us to confirm the fulfillment of semi-empirical Kohler's rule in a wide interval of temperatures 30 $-$ 240K regardless of the orientation of current and magnetic field. This result was attributed as a proof of the absence of additional channel of scattering caused by stripes. We argue, that charge-transport anisotropy is originated in $R$$_x$Lu$_{1-x}$B$_{12}$ due to the anisotropy of electron-phonon scattering on the one hand and the effects of Fermi surface (FS) topology (at low temperatures) on the other.</description>

      <title>Praseodymium doping effect on the superconducting properties of FeSe0.5Te0.5 bulks under ambient and high-pressure growth conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06159v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A series of Pr-doped FeSe0.5Te0.5 (Fe1-xPrxSe0.5Te0.5; x = 0 to 0.3) bulks are prepared by conventional synthesis process at ambient pressure (CSP), and high gas pressure and high temperature synthesis (HP-HTS) methods. These bulks are well characterized by structural and microstructural analysis, Raman spectroscopy, transport, and magnetic measurements. The HP-HTS process of the parent bulks has enhanced the onset transition temperature (Tconset) by 1.5 K and the critical current density (Jc) by two orders of magnitude compared to the CSP method. Pr-doped FeSe0.5Te0.5 up to 10% doping content prepared, either CSP or HP-HTS, slightly increases the unit cell volume, and high-pressure growth produces an almost pure superconducting phase, which confirms the successful Pr-doping at Fe sites. Raman spectroscopy measurements and DFT calculations suggest the substitution of Pr-atoms in the interlayer spacing of Fe(Se,Te) lattice. High-pressure growth of Fe1-xPrxSe0.5Te0.5 also makes the sample less dense compared to the parent sample grown by HP-HTS. Transport and magnetic measurements depict that Tconset is almost unaffected by Pr doping, whereas Jc of Pr-doped FeSe0.5Te0.5 is enhanced by one order of magnitude relative to the parent sample developed by CSP but lower than that of the parent sample grown by HP-HTS. Hence, Pr doping at Fe sites preserves Tconset and improves Jc of FeSe0.5Te0.5 regardless of the doping contents and growth conditions. These results are promising for the practical application of iron-based superconductors to improve Jc properties without affecting Tconset through CSP process and congruent with discoveries from other superconductors, like cuprates and MgB2.</description>

      <title>Predicting Battery Capacity Fade Using Probabilistic Machine Learning Models With and Without Pre-Trained Priors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06422v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lithium-ion batteries are a key energy storage technology driving revolutions in mobile electronics, electric vehicles and renewable energy storage. Capacity retention is a vital performance measure that is frequently utilized to assess whether these batteries have approached their end-of-life. Machine learning (ML) offers a powerful tool for predicting capacity degradation based on past data, and, potentially, prior physical knowledge, but the degree to which an ML prediction can be trusted is of significant practical importance in situations where consequential decisions must be made based on battery state of health. This study explores the efficacy of fully Bayesian machine learning in forecasting battery health with the quantification of uncertainty in its predictions. Specifically, we implemented three probabilistic ML approaches and evaluated the accuracy of their predictions and uncertainty estimates: a standard Gaussian process (GP), a structured Gaussian process (sGP), and a fully Bayesian neural network (BNN). In typical applications of GP and sGP, their hyperparameters are learned from a single sample while, in contrast, BNNs are typically pre-trained on an existing dataset to learn the weight distributions before being used for inference. This difference in methodology gives the BNN an advantage in learning global trends in a dataset and makes BNNs a good choice when training data is available. However, we show that pre-training can also be leveraged for GP and sGP approaches to learn the prior distributions of the hyperparameters and that in the case of the pre-trained sGP, similar accuracy and improved uncertainty estimation compared to the BNN can be achieved. This approach offers a framework for a broad range of probabilistic machine learning scenarios where past data is available and can be used to learn priors for (hyper)parameters of probabilistic ML models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06548v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We performed transverse-field muon spin relaxation/rotation (TF-{\mu}SR) on a high-entropy-type (HE-type) superconductor AgInSnPbBiTe5. The emergence of bulk superconducting states was confirmed from magnetic susceptibility, specific heat, and {\mu}SR. The superconducting gap 2{\Delta}(0) estimated from {\mu}SR was clearly larger than that expected from conventional weak-coupling phonon-mediated model, suggesting the strong-coupling nature of superconductivity. In addition, a long penetration depth of 3.21(7) {\mu}m was obtained. The strong-coupling nature of superconductivity and the long penetration depth are similar to the trends observed in the other HE-type superconductors (HE alloys and transition-metal zirconides), which may be universal feature of HE-type superconductors.</description>

Abstract: Bose metals are metals made of Cooper pairs, which form at very low temperatures in superconducting films and Josephson junction arrays as an intermediate phase between superconductivity and superinsulation. We predicted the existence of this 2D metallic phase of bosons in the mid 90s, showing that they arise due to topological quantum effects. The observation of Bose metals in perfectly regular Josephson junction arrays fully confirms our original prediction and rules out alternative models based on disorder. Here, we review the basic mechanism leading to Bose metals. The key points are that the relevant vortices in granular superconductors are core-less, mobile XY vortices which can tunnel through the system due to quantum phase slips, that there is no charge-phase commutation relation preventing such vortices to be simultaneously out of condensate with charges, and that out-of-condensate charges and vortices are subject to topological mutual statistics interactions, a quantum effect that dominates at low temperatures. These repulsive mutual statistics interactions are sufficient to increase the energy of the Cooper pairs and lift them out of condensate. The result is a topological ground state in which charge conduction along edges and vortex movement across them organize themselves so as to generate the observed metallic saturation at low temperatures. This state is known today as a bosonic topological insulator.</description>

Abstract: Topological crystalline insulators (TCIs) host topological phases of matter protected by crystal symmetries. Topological surface states in three-dimensional TCIs have been predicted and observed in IV-VI SnTe-class semiconductors. Despite the prediction of a two-dimensional (2D) TCI characterized by two pairs of edge states inside the bulk gap, materials challenges have thus far prevented its experimental realization. Here we report the growth and characterization of bilayer SnTe on the 2$H$-NbSe$_2$ substrate by molecular beam epitaxy and scanning tunneling microscopy. We experimentally observe two anticorrelated, periodically modulated pairs of conducting edge states along the perimeters of the sample with a large band gap exceeding $0.2$ eV. We identify these states with a 2D TCI through first principles calculations. Finally, we probe the coupling of adjacent topological edge states and demonstrate the resulting energy shift driven by a combination of electrostatic interactions and tunneling coupling. Our work opens the door to investigations of tunable topological states in 2D TCIs, of potential impact for spintronics and nanoelectronics applications at room temperature.</description>

      <title>Effect of dynamical electron correlations on the tunnelling magnetoresistance of Fe/MgO/Fe(001) junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06679v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We employ dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) combined with density functional theory (DFT) and the non-equilibrium Green's function technique to investigate the steady-state transport properties of an Fe/MgO/Fe magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ), focusing on the impact of dynamical electron correlations on the Fe $3d$ orbitals. By applying the rigid shift approximation, we extend the calculations from zero- to finite-bias in a simple and computationally efficient manner, obtaining the bias-dependent electronic structure and current-versus-voltage characteristic curve in both the parallel and antiparallel configurations. In particular, we find that dynamical electron correlation manifests as a reduction in the spin splitting of the Fe $3d_{z^2}$ state compared to DFT predictions and introduces a finite relaxation time. The impact of these effects on the transport properties, however, varies significantly between magnetic configurations. In the parallel configuration, the characteristic curves obtained with DFT and DMFT are similar, as the transport is mostly due to the coherent transmission of spin-up electrons through the MgO barrier. Conversely, in the antiparallel configuration, correlation effects become more significant, with DMFT predicting a sharp current increase due to bias-driven inelastic electron-electron scattering. As a consequence, DMFT gives a lower bias threshold for the suppression of the tunneling magnetoresistance ratio compared to DFT, matching experimental data more closely.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast momentum-resolved visualization of the interplay between phonon-mediated scattering and plasmons in graphite</title>

Abstract: Scattering between individual charges and collective modes in materials governs fundamental phenomena such as electrical resistance, energy dissipation, switching between different phases, and ordering. The study of such scattering requires a simultaneous access to the ultrafast momentum-resolved dynamics of single-particle and collective excitations, which remains as an experimental challenge. Here, we demonstrate time- and momentum-resolved electron energy-loss spectroscopy, and apply it to graphite showing that large ($\Delta q\simeq$1.2~{\AA}$^{-1}$) photoexcited electron-hole (e-h) pockets in the band structure induce a renormalization of the collective in-plane and bulk plasmons that can be described quantitatively by invoking intra- and inter-valley scattering processes mediated by $E_{2g}$ and $A_{1}'$ phonon modes, which we directly observe by ultrafast electron diffraction and identify via ab initio calculations. Conversely, the photoexcitation of smaller e-h pockets ($\Delta q\simeq$0.7~{\AA}$^{-1}$) close to the K point of graphite results in the renormalization of in-plane plasmons, which can only be partially explained by phonon-mediated scattering and thermal expansion. Our results show the importance of combining momentum- and time-resolved information to elucidate microscopic details associated with electronic scattering processes.</description>

      <title>Large-scale self-assembled nanophotonic scintillators for X-ray imaging</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07141v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scintillators are essential for converting X-ray energy into visible light in imaging technologies. Their widespread application in imaging technologies has been enabled by scalable, high-quality, and affordable manufacturing methods. Nanophotonic scintillators, which feature nanostructures at the scale of their emission wavelength, provide a promising approach to enhance emission properties like light yield, decay time, and directionality. However, scalable fabrication of such nanostructured scintillators has been a significant challenge, impeding their widespread adoption. Here, we present a scalable fabrication method for large-area nanophotonic scintillators based on the self-assembly of chalcogenide glass photonic crystals. This technique enables the production of nanophotonic scintillators over wafer-scale areas, achieving a six-fold enhancement in light yield compared to unpatterned scintillators. We demonstrate this approach using a conventional X-ray scintillator material, cerium-doped yttrium aluminum garnet (YAG:Ce). By analyzing the influence of surface nanofabrication disorder, we establish its effect on imaging performance and provide a route towards large-scale scintillation enhancements without decrease in spatial resolution. Finally, we demonstrate the practical applicability of our nanophotonic scintillators through X-ray imaging of biological and inorganic specimens. Our results indicate that this scalable fabrication technique could enable the industrial implementation of a new generation of nanophotonic-enhanced scintillators, with significant implications for advancements in medical imaging, security screening, and nondestructive testing.</description>

      <title>Electrical magnetochiral anisotropy in trigonal tellurium from first principles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.10164v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Structural chirality gives rise to characteristic responses that change sign with the handedness of the crystal structure. One example is electrical magnetochiral anisotropy (eMChA), a change in resistivity that depends linearly on the applied current and on the magnetic field. Motivated by recent measurements of a strong eMChA in $p$-doped trigonal tellurium, we carry out an \textit{ab initio} study of the eMChA response in this material as a function of temperature and doping concentration. We use the semiclassical Boltzmann transport formalism within the constant relaxation-time approximation to express the bulk eMChA response tensor in terms of the energy dispersion, intrinsic magnetic moment, and Berry curvature of the conduction Bloch states. We find that the orbital Zeeman coupling dominates the calculated response, with smaller contributions coming from the spin Zeeman coupling and from the Berry curvature, and that the effect is maximal when both the current and magnetic field are along the trigonal axis. The calculated data shows a reasonable agreement with the experiments. We provide the open-source code to facilitate further \textit{ab initio} studies of eMChA in other materials.</description>

      <title>The Bulk Photovoltaic Effect: Origin of Shift Currents in the Many-Body Picture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.02002v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the shift current in bulk photovoltaics originates from a light-induced shift of charge centers to the many-body excited states. This many-body shift vector is expressed, using a sum-rule, in terms of pairs of nearly-degenerate optically-active excitons overlapping in $k$-space. The shift current can thus be enhanced by nearly-degenerate optically-active and tightly-bound excitons, spread out in $k$-space. $Ab$ $initio$ results for the many-body shift current and shift vector are presented for CdS and MoS$_2$, and exciton-phonon coupling is included through the exciton-phonon self-energies.</description>

      <title>Signatures of canted antiferromagnetism in infinite-layer nickelates studied by x-ray magnetic dichroism</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16969v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report an experimental study of the magnetic properties of infinite-layer Nd1-xSrxNiO2 thin films by x-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD) at Ni L3,2 and Nd M5,4 edges. We show that at low temperatures the out-of-plane component of the Ni1+ spin-moment is characterized by a rapid increase for magnetic fields below 1T , followed by a slower linear increase reaching a spin-moment value of 0.25uB/Ni at 9T in the case of superconducting Nd0.8Sr0.2NiO2. On the other hand, the Nd M5,4 XMCD shows a clear paramagnetic behaviour, which make both Ni- and Nd-spin-sublattices fully uncorrelated.The magnetic field and temperature dependencies of the Ni L3,2 XMCD data can be explained by assuming an out-of-plane canting of the strongly in-plane anti-ferromagnetic ordered Ni1+ spins. A symmetry lowering of the NiO2 planes observed via four-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy, triggering a DMI, can be responsible of the proposed Ni1+ spin-canting at zero-field. The resulting out-of-plane weak-ferromagnetic coupling under magnetic field explains the relatively large spin-moment and its magnetic field and temperature dependence.</description>

      <title>Excited-State Dynamics and Optically Detected Magnetic Resonance of Solid-State Spin Defects from First Principles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05917v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) is an efficient and reliable method that enables initialization and readout of spin states through spin-photon interface. In general, high quantum efficiency and large spin-dependent photoluminescence contrast are desirable for reliable quantum information readout. However, reliable prediction of the ODMR contrast from first-principles requires accurate description of complex spin polarization mechanisms of spin defects. These mechanisms often include multiple radiative and nonradiative processes in particular intersystem crossing (ISC)among multiple excited electronic states. In this work we present our implementation of the first-principles ODMR contrast, by solving kinetic master equation with calculated rates from \textit{ab initio} electronic structure methods then benchmark the implementation on the case of the negatively-charged nitrogen vacancy center in diamond. We show the importance of correct description of multi-reference electronic states and pseudo Jahn-Teller effect for quantitatively, even qualitatively correct prediction of spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and the rate of ISC. We present the complete calculation of SOC for different ISC processes that align with both group theory and experimental observations. Moreover, we provide a comprehensive picture of excitation and relaxation dynamics, including previously unexplored internal conversion processes. We show good agreement between our first-principles calculations and the experimental ODMR contrast under magnetic field. We then demonstrate reliable predictions of magnetic field direction, pump power, and microwave frequency dependency, as important parameters for ODMR experiments. Our work provides a predictive computational platform for spin polarization and optical readout of solid-state quantum defects from first principles.</description>

      <title>Atomically thin obstructed atomic insulators with robust edge modes and quantized spin Hall effect</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03771v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Symmetry-protected edge states serve as direct evidence of nontrivial electronic topology in atomically thin materials. Finding these states in experimentally realizable single-phase materials presents a substantial challenge for their use in fundamental studies and developing functional nanoscale devices. Here, we show the presence of robust edge states in phosphorene and group-Va monolayers with puckered lattice structures. By carefully analyzing the symmetry of the atomic sites and edge mode properties, we demonstrate that these atomically thin monolayers realize recently introduced obstructed atomic insulator states with partially occupied edge modes. The obstructed edge modes attain a Rashba-type spin splitting with Rashba parameter ($\alpha$) of 1.52 eV \r{A} for arsenene. Under strain or doping effects, these obstructed insulators transition to a phase with substantial spin-Berry curvature, yielding a double quantum spin Hall state with a spin Hall conductivity $\approx 4 \frac{e^2}{h}$. The experimental availability of phosphorene and other group-Va monolayers could enable verification of obstructed atomic states and enhanced spin-Berry curvature effects discussed in this study, offering the potential for applications in topological electronic and spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Hybridizing anomalous Nernst effect in artificially tilted multilayer based on magnetic topological material</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05393v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Transverse thermoelectric conversion holds significant potential in addressing complex challenges faced by classical Seebeck/Peltier modules. A promising transverse thermoelectric phenomenon is the anomalous Nernst effect (ANE) originating from nontrivial band structures in magnetic topological materials. However, the currently reported performance for ANE in topological materials, e.g., Co$_2$MnGa, remains insufficient for practical thermoelectric applications. Here, we unveil a new availability for ANE by integrating magnetic topological materials into artificially tilted multilayers (ATMLs), known to exhibit the structure-induced transverse thermoelectric conversion due to the off-diagonal Seebeck effect. Our experiments reveal that the transverse thermoelectric performance in Co$_2$MnGa-based ATMLs is improved through the hybrid action of ANE and the off-diagonal Seebeck effect, with the modulation of performance dependent on magnetization being significantly greater than the performance achievable with ANE alone. This unconventional synergy underscores the importance of hybrid transverse thermoelectric conversion and paves a way for advancing thermoelectric applications using magnetic materials.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Magnetoelectric Effect under Magnetic Octupole Order: Its Application to a $d$-Wave Altermagnet and a Pyrochlore Lattice with All-In/All-Out Magnetic Order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15836v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Extensive investigation has recently been conducted into a new class of antiferromagnetic order known as magnetic octupole order. However, the high rank of octupoles makes it difficult to detect and manipulate them by using conventional methods such as the anomalous Hall effect. In this paper, we propose the nonlinear magnetoelectric effect (NMEE), a second-order response to an electric field that induces a spontaneous magnetization, as a finite response under magnetic octupole order. First, we classify the magnetic point groups to identify antiferromagnets with such order, and derive the NMEE tensor using quantum kinetic theory. Then, we confirm the effectiveness of the NMEE through model calculations for two specific examples: a $d$-wave altermagnet and a pyrochlore lattice with all-in/all-out magnetic order. In particular, the intrinsic NMEE exhibits a large response in a magnetic Weyl semimetal phase of the pyrochlore lattice. This enhanced response is explained by the fact that the response tensor involves the quantum metric, which is enhanced near Weyl points. Furthermore, our results show that the NMEE has a sizeable value that can be detected by the magneto-optical Kerr effect.</description>

      <title>Giant strain-induced spin splitting effect in MnTe, a $g$-wave altermagnetic semiconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20440v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hexagonal MnTe is an altermagnetic semiconductor with $g$-wave symmetry of spin polarization in momentum space. In the nonrelativistic limit, this symmetry mandates that electric current flowing in any crystallographic direction is unpolarized. However, it is shown that elastic strain is effective in inducing the spin splitting effect in MnTe. For this analysis, a spin-orbit-coupled $\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{p}$ Hamiltonian for the valence band maximum at the A point is derived and fitted to eigenvalues calculated from first principles. The spin splitting angle is calculated using the Boltzmann approach in the relaxation-time approximation. The spin splitting gauge factor exceeds 20 near the valence band maximum. Thus, with suitable substrate engineering, MnTe can be used as an efficient source and detector of spin current in spintronic devices. Proper inclusion of the Rashba-Dresselhaus spin-orbit coupling is crucial for the correct description of the transport properties of MnTe.</description>

      <title>Careful finite element simulations of cold rolling with accurate through-thickness resolution and prediction of residual stress</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03242v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Metal rolling is a widespread and well-studied process, and many finite-element (FE) rolling simulations can be found in the scientific literature. However, these FE simulations are typically limited in their resolution of through-thickness variations. In this paper, we carefully assess the accuracy of a number of FE approaches, and find that at least 60 elements through-thickness are needed to properly resolve through-thickness variation; this is significantly more than is used elsewhere in the metal rolling literature. In doing so, we reveal an oscillatory stress pattern, which is not usually observed in simulations but which we can validate by comparison with recent analytical work, and which is completely deterministic, not arising from numerical noise or error. We show that these oscillations contribute to the formation of residual stress and may help predict curvature in asymmetric rolled sheets, a phenomenon which is currently not well understood. Accurate through-thickness variation of stress and strain would also have implications for modelling microstructure evolution, damage, and surface finish.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15062v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The recently proposed machine learning-based physically-constrained nonlocal (MPN) kinetic energy density functional (KEDF) can be used for simple metals and their alloys [Phys. Rev. B 109, 115135 (2024)]. However, the MPN KEDF does not perform well for semiconductors. Here we propose a multi-channel MPN (CPN) KEDF, which extends the MPN KEDF to semiconductors by integrating information collected from multiple channels, with each channel featuring a specific length scale in real space. The CPN KEDF is systematically tested on silicon and binary semiconductors. We find that the multi-channel design for KEDF is beneficial for machine-learning-based models in capturing the characteristics of semiconductors, particularly in handling covalent bonds. In particular, the CPN5 KEDF, which utilizes five channels, demonstrates excellent accuracy across all tested systems. These results offer a new path for generating KEDFs for semiconductors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.09399v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the fast developments of high-performance computing, first-principles methods based on quantum mechanics play a significant role in materials research, serving as fundamental tools for predicting and analyzing various properties of materials. However, the inherent complexity and substantial computational demands of first-principles algorithms, such as density functional theory, limit their use in larger systems. The rapid development of heterogeneous computing, particularly General-Purpose Graphics Processing Units (GPGPUs), has heralded new prospects for enhancing the performance and cost-effectiveness of first-principles algorithms. We utilize GPGPUs to accelerate the electronic structure algorithms in Atomic-orbital Based Ab-initio Computation at USTC (ABACUS), a first-principles computational package based on the linear combination of atomic orbitals (LCAO) basis set. We design algorithms on GPGPU to efficiently construct and diagonalize the Hamiltonian of a given system, including the related force and stress calculations.The effectiveness of this computational acceleration has been demonstrated through calculations on twisted bilayer graphene with the system size up to 10,444 atoms.</description>

      <title>Effect of Biaxial Strain on Cation Octahedral Rotations and the Electronic Band Structure of the Antiperovskite Mn$_{3}$GaN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04163v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Density functional theory is used to study the effect of compressive and tensile biaxial strain on Mn$_{3}$GaN. Mn$_{3}$GaN is a non-collinear antiferromagnetic antiperovskite with a similar structure to that of an ideal cubic oxide perovskite, but with cations at the octahedral sites while the anion, nitrogen, is found at the B site. The present study explores the response of Mn$_{3}$GaN to (001) strain, considering biaxial strain levels ranging from -5% to 5%. It is found that the electron structure is insensitive to tensile strain. The study supports previous results in that a spin-canted antiferromagnetic order emerges due to tensile strain, inducing net magnetization. Compressive strain collapses the non-collinear antiferromagnetic spin structure and induces a ferrimagnetic order at -2% strain. Notably, in contrast with oxide perovskites, Mn$_{3}$GaN does not respond to strain by octahedral tilt, but rather by intraband redistributions of charge between Mn $d$ states. Despite the similar structure to oxide perovskites, the bonds between the B site anion and octahedral site cations in Mn$_{3}$GaN bonds are less rigid, such that strain is instead accommodated by a change in bond length rather than a change in bond angles.</description>

Abstract: While thermoelectric material performances can be estimated using the ZT, predicting the performance of thermoelectric generator modules (TGMs) is complex due to the non-linearity and non-locality of the thermoelectric differential equations. Here, we present a simplified thermoelectric algebra framework for predicting TGM performance within the Constant Seebeck-coefficient Approximation (CSA). First, we revisit the Constant Seebeck-coefficient Model (CSM) to transform the differential equations into exact algebraic equations for thermoelectric heat flux and conversion efficiency in terms of the load resistance ratio and relative Fourier heat flux. Next, we introduce the CSA, where the Thomson term is neglected, and the device parameters are assumed to be fixed. We define average thermoelectric properties and device parameters at the zero-current condition using a simple temperature integral. Finally, we derive approximate thermoelectric algebraic equations for voltage, resistance, heat flux, and conversion efficiency as functions of current. We numerically validate that the CSA formalism is superior to other single-parameter theories, such as peak-ZT, integral-ZT, and the generic engineering-ZT, in predicting efficiency. The relative standard error in optimal efficiency is less than 11% for average ZT values not exceeding 2. By combining CSM and CSA, TGM performance can be easily estimated without the need for calculus or solving differential equations.</description>

      <title>Observation of converse flexoelectric effect in topological semimetals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04831v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A strong coupling between electric polarization and elastic deformation in solids is an important factor in creating useful electromechanical nanodevices. Such coupling is typically allowed in insulating materials with inversion symmetry breaking as exemplified by the piezoelectric effect in ferroelectric materials. Therefore, materials with metallicity and centrosymmetry have tended to be out of scope in this perspective. Here, we report the observation of giant elastic deformation by the application of an alternating electric current in topological semimetals (V,Mo)Te2, regardless of the centrosymmetry. Considering the crystal and band structures and the asymmetric measurement configurations in addition to the absence of the electromechanical effect in a trivial semimetal TiTe2, the observed effect is discussed in terms of a Berry-phase-derived converse flexoelectric effect in metals. The observation of the flexoelectric effect in topological semimetals paves a way for a new type of nanoscale electromechanical sensors and energy harvesting.</description>

      <title>Scaling Law for Time-Reversal-Odd Nonlinear Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.01219v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Time-reversal-odd ($\mathcal{T}$-odd) nonlinear current response has been theoretically proposed and experimentally confirmed recently. However, the role of disorder scattering in the response, especially whether it contributes to the $\sigma_{xx}$-independent term, has not been clarified. In this work, we derive a general scaling law for this effect, which accounts for multiple scattering sources. We show that the nonlinear conductivity is generally a quartic function in $\sigma_{xx}$. Besides intrinsic contribution, extrinsic contributions from scattering also enter the zeroth order term, and their values can be comparable to or even larger than the intrinsic one. Terms beyond zeroth order are all extrinsic. Cubic and quartic terms must involve skew scattering and they signal competition between at least two scattering sources. The behavior of zeroth order extrinsic terms is explicitly demonstrated in a Dirac model. Our finding reveals the significant role of disorder scattering in $\mathcal{T}$-odd nonlinear transport, and establishes a foundation for analyzing experimental result.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.03016v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In spite of the interest in the two-dimensional electron gases (2DEGs) experimentally found at surfaces and interfaces, important uncertainties remain about the observed insulator--metal transitions (IMTs). Here we show how an explicit improper coupling of carrier sources with a relevant soft mode significantly affects the transition. The analysis presented here for 2DEGs at polar interfaces is based on group theory, Landau-Ginzburg theory, and illustrated with first-principles calculations for the prototypical case of the LaAlO$_3$/SrTiO$_3$ interface, for which such a structural transition has recently been observed. This direct coupling implies that the appearance of the soft mode is always accompanied by carriers. For sufficiently strong coupling an avalanche-like first-order IMT is predicted.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic nonlinear Hall effect in two-dimensional honeycomb topological antiferromagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.02685v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional systems with honeycomb lattice are known to be a paradigmatic platform to explore the various types of Hall effects, owing to that the interplay of lattice geometry, spin-orbit coupling and magnetism can give rise to very rich features in the quantum geometry of wave functions. In this work, we consider honeycomb topological antiferromagets that are effectively described by a $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric antiferromagnetic Kane-Mele model, and explore the evolution of its nonlinear Hall response with respect to the change of lattice anisotropy, chemical potential, and the direction of the N\'{e}el vector. Due to the $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry, the leading-order Hall effect of quantum geometric origin is the intrinsic nonlinear Hall effect, which is a second-order effect of electric fields and is independent of the scattering time. We investigate the behavior of the intrinsic nonlinear Hall conductivity tensor across topological phase transitions driven by antiferromagnetic exchange field and lattice anisotropy and find that its components do not change sign, which is different from the extrinsic nonlinear Hall effect. In the weakly doped regime, we find that the intrinsic nonlinear Hall effect is valley-polarized. By varying the chemical potential, we find that the nonlinear Hall conductivity tensors exhibit kinks when the Fermi surface undergoes Lifshitz transitions. Furthermore, we find that the existence of spin-orbit coupling to lift the spin-rotation symmetry is decisive for the use of intrinsic nonlinear Hall effect to detect the direction of the N\'{e}el vector. Our work shows that the two-dimensional honeycomb topological antiferromagnets are an ideal class of material systems with rich properties for the study of intrinsic nonlinear Hall effect.</description>

      <title>Minimal Models for Altermagnetism</title>

Abstract: Altermagnets feature vanishing net magnetization, like antiferromagnets, but exhibit time-reversal symmetry breaking and momentum-dependent spin-split band structures. Motivated by the prevalence of altermagnetic materials with non-symmorphic symmetry-dictated band degeneracies, we provide realistic minimal models for altermagnetism by constructing tight-binding models for nonsymmorphic space groups with a sublattice defined by two magnetic atoms. These models can be applied to monoclinic, orthorhombic, tetragonal, rhombohedral, hexagonal, and cubic materials and can describe d-wave, g-wave, and i-wave altermagnetism. By examining the altermagnetic susceptibility and mean field instabilities within a Hubbard model we reveal that these models have altermagnetic ground states and yield a Berry curvature that is linear in the spin-orbit coupling. We apply our models to RuO$_2$, MnF$_2$, FeSb$_2$, $\kappa$-Cl, CrSb, and MnTe.</description>

      <title>Bridging electronic and classical density-functional theory using universal machine-learned functional approximations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20270v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The accuracy of density-functional theory (DFT) is determined by the quality of the approximate functionals, such as exchange-correlation in electronic DFT and the excess functional in the classical DFT formalism of fluids. The exact functional is highly nonlocal for both electrons and fluids, yet most approximate functionals are semi-local or nonlocal in a limited weighted-density form. Machine-learned (ML) nonlocal density-functional approximations are promising in both electronic and classical DFT, but have so far employed disparate approaches with limited generality. Here, we formulate a universal approximation framework and training protocol for nonlocal ML functionals, combining features of equivariant convolutional neural networks and the weighted-density approximation. We prototype this approach for several 1D and quasi-1D problems and demonstrate that a functional with exactly the same hyperparameters achieves excellent accuracy for the hard-rod fluid, the inhomogeneous Ising model, the exact exchange functional for electrons, the electron kinetic energy functional for orbital-free DFT, as well as for liquid water with 1D inhomogeneities. These results lay the foundation for a universal ML approach to exact 3D functionals spanning electronic and classical DFT.</description>

      <title>Angle-dependent planar thermal Hall effect by quasi-ballistic phonons in black phosphorus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18816v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The origin of the phonon thermal Hall effect in insulators is a matter of ongoing debate. The large amplitude of the signal in an elemental non-magnetic solid, such as black phosphorus (BP) calls for a minimal mechanism with no role for spin degree of freedom. Here, we show that a longitudinal heat flow generates a transverse temperature gradient in BP even when the magnetic field, the heat current and the thermal gradient lie in the same plane. The long phonon mean-free-path leaves little room for scattering by point-like symmetry breaking defects. We argue that the angular dependence of the signal can be accounted for as a sum of two sinusoidal components each peaking when the magnetic field is parallel to a high symmetry axis. Anharmonicity and finite thermal expansion emerge as indispensable ingredients for a planar Hall signal. We identify the torque exerted by magnetic field on traveling electric dipolar waves as a possible microscopic driver.</description>

      <title>Inverse Spin Hall Effect in Nonequilibrium Dirac Systems Induced by Anomalous Flow Imbalance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09025v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study Dirac fermions in the presence of a space-dependent chiral gauge field and thermodynamic gradients, establishing a connection to the inverse spin Hall effect. The chiral gauge field induces a chiral magnetic field, resulting in a surface Fermi arc state and a chiral Landau level state which, although is delocalized in the bulk, we show to be more robust against impurities. By applying chemical potential and temperature gradients, we achieve nonzero charge currents, with each gradient leading to distinct Fermi level dependencies, both of which have been observed in a recent experiment. Unlike the conventional mixed axial-gravitational anomaly, our currents require a noncollinear chiral magnetic field and thermodynamic gradient. We further derive low-energy transport formulas and demonstrate the importance of carefully treating the ultraviolet cutoff for understanding our lattice calculations.</description>

Abstract: Machine learning has been pervasively touching many fields of science. Chemistry and materials science are no exception. While machine learning has been making a great impact, it is still not reaching its full potential or maturity. In this perspective, we first outline current applications across a diversity of problems in chemistry. Then, we discuss how machine learning researchers view and approach problems in the field.

      <title>Multifold Majorana corner modes arising from multiple pairs of helical edge states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11791v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum spin Hall insulators with a pair of helical edge states and proximity-induced superconductivity have been shown to support second-order topological superconductors with Majorana corner modes. As the Majorana corner modes are originated from the helical edge states of the quantum spin Hall insulators, whether quantum spin Hall insulators with multiple pairs of helical edge states and proximity-induced superconductivity can give rise to second-order topological superconductors with multifold Majorana corner modes is an interesting question to address. In this work, we consider a quantum spin Hall insulator with two pairs of helical edge states. We find robust twofold Majorana corner modes can be achieved when the helical edge states are gapped by a combined action of a magnetic exchange field and an $s$-wave pairing, or an $s+p$ mixed-parity pairing. The stability of two Majorana zero modes per corner under the action of magnetic exchange fields is attributed to the protection from the chiral symmetry. Our study reveals that heterostructures composed of superconductors and quantum spin Hall insulators with multiple pairs of helical edge states could serve as a platform to pursue multifold Majorana corner modes.</description>
