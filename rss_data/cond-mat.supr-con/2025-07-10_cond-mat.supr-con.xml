      <title>Superconducting Photocurrent and Light Enriched Supercurrent Phase Relation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Noncentrosymmetric superconductors are expected to exhibit DC photocurrents even for irradiation frequencies below the superconducting gap. Such superconducting photocurrent are non-dissipative and track the quantum geometry of the superconducting state. Here we argue that superconducting photocurrent drives changes to the constitutive superconducting current phase relation (CPR) manifesting in a light controlled inductive response as well as altering the critical current. For chiral incident light, we find that superconducting photocurrent can transform reciprocal CPR into a non-reciprocal CPR producing a non-reciprocal inductance and light-controlled superconducting diode effect. These provide a protocol for measuring superconducting photocurrent and new tools for mapping the quantum geometry and order parameter of superconductors.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Andreev Reflection in Flat-Band Systems: Wave Packet Dynamics, DC Transport and the Josephson Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06327v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate Andreev reflection (AR) in a proximity-induced normal-superconductor (NS) junction within the extended $\alpha-\mathcal{T}_3$ lattice, emphasizing the impact of flat bands on AR. Our findings reveal that flat bands significantly enhance AR. Through wave packet dynamics, we track the real-time evolution of quasi-particle wave packets across the junction, providing deeper insight into electron-hole conversion. Notably, the combination of band flatness and anisotropic dispersion in the $k_x-k_y$ plane induces an electronic analog of Goos-H\"anchen (GH) shifts at the NS interface, exhibiting directional asymmetry along the junction. This asymmetry leads to a Hall-like response in Josephson junction in SNS geometry, where transport across the junction region is dominated by the quasi-flat bands.</description>

      <title>Gap reopening as signature of coupling between Majorana zero modes in Sn-(Bi,Sb)2(Te,S)3-based Josephson trijunctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06474v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the past two decades, enormous efforts have been made to search for possible platforms and schemes to implement topological quantum computation (TQC). In exploring the Fu-Kane scheme of TQC based on Josephson trijunctions constructed on topological insulators, the expected Majorana phase diagram of a single trijunction has been experimentally verified. If Majorana zero modes indeed exist in this kind of trijunctions, coupling between them in multiple trijunction devices would be further expected. In this study, we fabricated Josephson devices containing two adjacent Josephson trijunctions on the surface of Sn-(Bi,Sb)2(Te,S)3, and observed that the minigap reopens for both trijunctions in their phase spaces where a closure would otherwise be expected if the trijunctions existed independently. Our findings would provide new experimental support for the validity of the Fu-Kane theory and instill further confidence in advancing along the TQC scheme proposed by Fu and Kane.</description>

      <title>Enhanced superconductivity via layer differentiation in trilayer Hubbard model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the highest superconducting transition temperature ($T_c$) in multilayer cuprates,we investigated the trilayer Hubbard model by adopting the large-scale dynamical cluster quantum Monte Carlo simulations. Focusing on the systems with higher hole dopings within the two outer layers (OL) than the inner layer (IL), which is believed to be relevant to the realistic multilayer cuprates, our exploration discovered that the IL and OL manifest strong differentiation in a wide range of hole doping combinations. Specifically, the OLs remain metallic while the IL shows a distinct transition from the pseudogap to superconducting state. More importantly, the highest $T_c$ of the composite trilayer system can be largely enhanced compared to the single layer model and the imbalanced hole dopings between IL and OL is beneficial to the global SC. We further provide strong numerical evidence on the picture that the IL itself can drive the $d$-wave superconductivity while the OLs only serve as the charge reservoir. Our investigation provides new insight into the origin of highest $T_c$ in multilayer cuprates.</description>

      <title>Real-space understanding of electron-phonon coupling in superconducting hydrides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06749v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electron-phonon coupling is at the origin of conventional superconductivity, enabling the pairing of electrons into Cooper pairs. The electron-phonon matrix elements depend on the electronic eigenstates and, in the standard linear approximation, on the first derivative of the potential felt by the electrons with respect to ionic perturbations. Here, we focus on the derivatives of the potential with a twofold aim: to assess their contribution to the overall coupling and to analyze the limitations of neglecting higher-order derivatives. Several real-space functions are proposed to do the analysis, and are computed for some well-known superconductors. Our results show that, in hydrides, the derivatives of the potential tend to be larger in regions of high electron localization, explaining the success of electronic descriptors previously described to correlate with the critical temperature. The new functions introduced here are able to tell apart structures with similar types of bonding but very different critical temperatures, such as H3S and H3Se Im-3m phases, where electronic descriptors alone fail. Interestingly, our descriptors are capable of easily estimating the impact of higher-order terms in the electron-phonon coupling. In fact, we capture the limitations of the linear approximation expected for PdH, and predict an even more important non-linear behavior in LaH10.</description>

      <title>Discovery of High-Temperature Charge Order and Time-Reversal Symmetry-Breaking in the Kagome Superconductor YRu3Si2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06885v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The identification of high-temperature unconventional charge order and superconductivity in kagome quantum materials is pivotal for deepening our understanding of geometrically frustrated and correlated electron systems, and for harnessing their exotic properties in future quantum technologies. Here, we report the discovery of a remarkably rich phase diagram in the kagome superconductor YRu$_{3}$Si$_{2}$, uncovered through a unique combination of muon spin rotation (${\mu}$SR), magnetotransport, X-ray diffraction (XRD), and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Our study reveals the emergence of a charge-ordered state with a propagation vector of (1/2, 0, 0), setting a record onset temperature of 800 K for such an order in a kagome system and for quantum materials more broadly. In addition, we observe time-reversal symmetry (TRS) breaking below $T_{2}^{*}$ ${\simeq}$ 25 K and field-induced magnetism below $T_{1}^{*}$ ${\simeq}$ 90 K, indicating the presence of a hidden magnetic state. These transitions are mirrored in the magnetoresistance data, which show a clear onset at ${\sim}$ $T_{1}^{*}$ and a pronounced increase below ${\sim}$ $T_{2}^{*}$, ultimately reaching a maximum magnetoresistance of 45${\%}$. Band structure calculations identify two van Hove singularities (VHSs) near the Fermi level, one of which resides within a flat band, suggesting a strong interplay between electronic correlations and emergent orders. At low temperatures, we find bulk superconductivity below $T_{\rm c}$ = 3.4 K, characterized by a pairing symmetry with either two isotropic full gaps or an anisotropic nodeless gap. Together, our findings point to a coexistence of high-temperature charge order, tunable magnetism, and multigap superconductivity in YRu$_{3}$Si$_{2}$, positioning it as a compelling platform for exploring correlated kagome physics.</description>

      <title>Excess quasiparticles and their dynamics in the presence of subgap states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06902v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Material inhomogeneities in a superconductor generically lead to broadening of the density of states and to subgap states. The latter are associated with spatial fluctuations of the gap in which quasiparticles can be trapped. Recombination between such localized quasiparticles is hindered by their spatial separation and hence their density could be higher than expectations based on the recombination between mobile quasiparticles. We show here that the recombination between localized and mobile excitations can be efficient at limiting the quasiparticle density. We comment on the significance of our findings for devices such as superconducting resonators and qubits. We find that for typical aluminum devices, the subgap states do not significantly influence the quasiparticle density.</description>

      <title>A time-reversal invariant vortex in topological superconductors and gravitational $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06586v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a topological superconductor in the presence of a time-reversal invariant vortex. The eigenmodes of the Bogoliubov-de-Genne (BdG) Hamiltonian show a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topology: the time-reversal invariant vortex with odd winding number supports a pair of helical Majorana zero-modes at the vortex and the edge, while there is no such zero-modes when the winding number is even. We find that this $\mathbb{Z}_2$ structure can be interpreted as an emergent gravitational effect. Identifying the gap function as spatial components of the vielbein in 2 +1-dimensional gravity theory, we can explicitly convert the BdG equation into the Dirac equation coupled to a nontrivial gravitational background. We find that the gravitational curvature is induced at the vortex core, with its total flux quantized in integer multiples of $\pi$, reflecting the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological structure. Although the curvature vanishes everywhere except at the vortex core, the fermionic spectrum remains sensitive to the total curvature flux, owing to the gravitational Aharonov-Bohm effect.</description>

      <title>On the T-linear resistivity of cuprates: theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06725v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By partitioning the electronic system of the optimally doped cuprates in two electronic components: (1) mobile electrons on oxygen sub-lattice; and (2) localized spins on copper sub-lattice, and considering the scattering of mobile electrons (on oxygen sub-lattice) via generation of paramagnons in the localized sub-system (copper spins), we ask what should be the electron-paramagnon coupling matrix element $M_q$ so that T-linear resistivity results. This 'reverse engineering approach' leads to $|M_q|^2 \sim \frac{1}{q^2+\xi(T)^{-2}}$. We comment how can such exotic coupling emerge in 2D systems where short range magnetic fluctuations resides. In other words, the role of quantum criticality is found to be crucial. And the T-linear behaviour of resistivity demands that the magnetic correlation length scales as $\xi(T)\propto\frac{1}{T}$, which seems to be a reasonable assumption in the quantum critical regime of cuprates (that is, near optimal doping where T-linear resistivity is observed).</description>

Abstract: The discovery of superconductivity in Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) bilayer nickelate films under ambient pressure provides an unprecedented opportunity to directly investigate electronic energy scales of the superconducting state and the pairing mechanism. Here, we report angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy measurements of superconducting (La,Pr,Sm)$_{3}$Ni$_2$O$_7$ thin films epitaxially grown on SrLaAlO$_4$ substrates by developing an ultra-high vacuum low-temperature quenching and transfer technique. A finite superconducting gap of ~18 meV with pronounced coherence peak is observed along the Brillouin zone diagonal direction. Remarkably, the finite superconducting gap persists across the entire Brillouin zone of the underlying Fermi surfaces, revealing the absence of gap nodes. An abrupt band renormalization, manifested as a kink in the energy-momentum dispersion at ~70 meV below the Fermi level, indicates an electron-boson coupling in the system. The simultaneous observation of a nodeless superconducting gap and electron-boson coupling provides crucial insights into the pairing symmetry and gluing mechanism in high-T$_c$ RP bilayer nickelates.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.20727v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The recent discovery of superconductivity with a transition temperature $T_c$ over 40 K in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ and (La,Pr)$_{3}$Ni$_2$O$_7$ thin films at ambient pressure marks an important step in the field of nickelate superconductors. Here, we perform a renormalized mean-field theory study of the superconductivity in $\mathrm{La_3Ni_2O_7}$ thin films, using a bilayer two-orbital $t-J$ model. Our result reveals an $s_\pm$-wave pairing symmetry driven by the strong interlayer superexchange coupling of $d_{z^2}$ orbital, resembling the pressurized bulk case. Also, we roughly reproduce the experimentally observed nodeless shape of the superconducting gap at the $\beta$ pocket and the superconducting $T_c$. In addition, by analysing the orbital-resolved pairing configurations and their projections onto Fermi surface, we find that the nodeless feature of $\beta$ pocket is related to the interlayer pairing within both $d_{z^2}$ and $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals. Moreover, we identify a formation of the inplane inter-orbital $d$-wave pairing between $d_{z^2}$ and $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals, which can even enhance the dominated interlayer $s_\pm$-wave.</description>

      <title>On-chip magnon polaritons in the ultrastrong coupling regime</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.06065v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Light-matter interactions underpin the quantum technologies from quantum information processing to quantum sensing. When the coupling strength of light-matter interactions approaches the resonance frequencies of light and matter - the ultrastrong coupling regime - antiresonant (counter-rotating) processes, in which a photon and a matter excitation are simultaneously created or annihilated, induce non-negligible ground-state quantum entanglement between light and matter. Ultrastrong coupling thus provides a robust platform for noise-tolerant quantum entanglement, essential for reliable quantum technologies. However, the diamagnetic term typically counteracts antiresonant interactions, inhibiting intriguing phenomena such as thermal equibilium superradiant phase transitions. Here, we present an on-chip platform consisting of a superconducting resonator and thin ferromagnetic films achieving ultrastrong magnon-photon coupling system (magnon polaritons) via collective magnetic-dipole interactions, significantly circumventing the diamagnetic term. We experimentally demonstrate a pronounced Bloch-Siegert shift of about 60 MHz - direct evidence of antiresonant interactions - and observe cooperative enhancement of the effective coupling strength through increasing the number of remote magnon elements coupling with one photon mode. This scalable platform facilitates exploration of exotic quantum phenomena driven by antiresonant interactions, bridging spintronics and quantum optics, and enabling noise-tolerant quantum technological applications.</description>
