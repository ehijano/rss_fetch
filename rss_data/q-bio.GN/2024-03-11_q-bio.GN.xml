      <title>Cell reprogramming design by transfer learning of functional transcriptional networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04837v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent developments in synthetic biology, next-generation sequencing, and machine learning provide an unprecedented opportunity to rationally design new disease treatments based on measured responses to gene perturbations and drugs to reprogram cells. The main challenges to seizing this opportunity are the incomplete knowledge of the cellular network and the combinatorial explosion of possible interventions, both of which are insurmountable by experiments. To address these challenges, we develop a transfer learning approach to control cell behavior that is pre-trained on transcriptomic data associated with human cell fates, thereby generating a model of the network dynamics that can be transferred to specific reprogramming goals. The approach combines transcriptional responses to gene perturbations to minimize the difference between a given pair of initial and target transcriptional states. We demonstrate our approach's versatility by applying it to a microarray dataset comprising &gt;9,000 microarrays across 54 cell types and 227 unique perturbations, and an RNASeq dataset consisting of &gt;10,000 sequencing runs across 36 cell types and 138 perturbations. Our approach reproduces known reprogramming protocols with an AUROC of 0.91 while innovating over existing methods by pre-training an adaptable model that can be tailored to specific reprogramming transitions. We show that the number of gene perturbations required to steer from one fate to another increases with decreasing developmental relatedness and that fewer genes are needed to progress along developmental paths than to regress. These findings establish a proof-of-concept for our approach to computationally design control strategies and provide insights into how gene regulatory networks govern phenotype.</description>

      <title>A step toward a reinforcement learning de novo genome assembler</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.02649</link>

Abstract: De novo genome assembly is a relevant but computationally complex task in genomics. Although de novo assemblers have been used successfully in several genomics projects, there is still no 'best assembler', and the choice and setup of assemblers still rely on bioinformatics experts. Thus, as with other computationally complex problems, machine learning may emerge as an alternative (or complementary) way for developing more accurate and automated assemblers. Reinforcement learning has proven promising for solving complex activities without supervision - such games - and there is a pressing need to understand the limits of this approach to 'real' problems, such as the DFA problem. This study aimed to shed light on the application of machine learning, using reinforcement learning (RL), in genome assembly. We expanded upon the sole previous approach found in the literature to solve this problem by carefully exploring the learning aspects of the proposed intelligent agent, which uses the Q-learning algorithm, and we provided insights for the next steps of automated genome assembly development. We improved the reward system and optimized the exploration of the state space based on pruning and in collaboration with evolutionary computing. We tested the new approaches on 23 new larger environments, which are all available on the internet. Our results suggest consistent performance progress; however, we also found limitations, especially concerning the high dimensionality of state and action spaces. Finally, we discuss paths for achieving efficient and automated genome assembly in real scenarios considering successful RL applications - including deep reinforcement learning.</description>

      <title>Mixed Models with Multiple Instance Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.02455v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Predicting patient features from single-cell data can help identify cellular states implicated in health and disease. Linear models and average cell type expressions are typically favored for this task for their efficiency and robustness, but they overlook the rich cell heterogeneity inherent in single-cell data. To address this gap, we introduce MixMIL, a framework integrating Generalized Linear Mixed Models (GLMM) and Multiple Instance Learning (MIL), upholding the advantages of linear models while modeling cell state heterogeneity. By leveraging predefined cell embeddings, MixMIL enhances computational efficiency and aligns with recent advancements in single-cell representation learning. Our empirical results reveal that MixMIL outperforms existing MIL models in single-cell datasets, uncovering new associations and elucidating biological mechanisms across different domains.</description>
