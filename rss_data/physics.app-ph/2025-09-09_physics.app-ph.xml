      <title>A 10-bit SAR ADC with 1.5x Input Range</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05636v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a differential 10-bit 2 MS/s successive approximation register (SAR) analog-to-digital converter (ADC) with a precision-improvement technique. The proposed method breaks the direct tradeoff between the capacitive digital-to-analog converter (CDAC) units and the resolution of SAR ADCs by extending the effective input range, thereby enhancing the effective number of bits (ENOB). Specifically, the technique is implemented by switching the potential of the MSB capacitors during the sampling phase. Theoretically, it enables a precision improvement of more than 0.5-bit. In this design, 512 capacitor units and a reference voltage VREF are employed, achieving an extended input range of +-1.5VREF and an equivalent resolution of 10.5-bit. Fabricated in a 180-nm CMOS process, the prototype chip demonstrates 10.36-bit ENOB in post-simulation, while consuming 48{\mu}W at a sampling rate of 2 MS/s under a 1.8-V supply, with an area of 0.79mm2.</description>

      <title>Observation of temporal Wood's anomaly in folded time gratings: surface-wave-enhanced transmission and the emergence of gain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wood's anomaly is a fundamental wave phenomenon that stems from the interplay between farfields and surface-wave (SW) resonances through structured interfaces. Recent theories have suggested temporal analogs of such SW coupling processes by employing frequency transitions via time-periodic interfaces, rather than classical wavevector (momentum) transitions via space-periodic gratings. In this paper, we observe this phenomenon experimentally by devising a folded time grating of a single, waveguide-enclosed, time-modulated element; this substantially reduces complexity and power consumption and facilitates transmissive operation. We support our findings by deriving a comprehensive Floquet-Bloch analysis that exhibits excellent agreement with measurements. Importantly, we utilize our framework and experiment to reveal a unique regime of temporal Wood's anomaly, in which coupling to negative SW frequencies manifests tunable parametric amplification unattainable via traditional spatial modulation. Beyond the fundamental contribution, our results provide an economical path for universally synthesizing intricate temporal apertures to enhance dynamic filtering and leaky-wave antennas.</description>

      <title>Screening currents increase thermal quench propagation speed in ultra-high-field REBCO magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06621v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superconducting REBCO ($RE$Ba$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-x}$, where $RE$ is a rare earth, typically Y, Gd or Eu) electromagnets are useful for many applications like medical magnetic resonace imaging (MRI), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, and magnets for particle accelerators and detectors. REBCO magnets are also the core of many nuclear fusion energy start-ups. In order to avoid permanent damage during operation, magnet design needs to take electro-thermal quench into account, which is due to unavoidable REBCO tape or magnet imperfections. However, most high-field magnet designs do not take superconducting screening currents into account. In this work, we show that it is essential to consider screening currents in magnet design, since they highly speed-up electrothermal quench propagation. Our study is based on detailed numerical modeling, based on the Minimum Electromagnetic Entropy Production (MEMEP) and Finite Differences (MEMEP-FD). Benchmarking with well-established Partial Element Equivalent Circuit (PEEC) model supports the correctness of MEMEP-FD. This work focusses on a 32 T all-superconducting magnet design and we analyze in detail the time evolution of electrothermal quench. Our findings will have an impact in the design of ultra-high-field magnets for NMR or user facilities, and possibly for other kinds of magnets, like those for fusion energy.</description>

      <title>A microwave-activated high-fidelity three-qubit gate scheme for fixed-frequency superconducting qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21346v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scalable superconducting quantum processors require balancing critical constraints in coherence, control complexity, and spectral crowding. Fixed-frequency architectures suppress flux noise and simplify control via all-microwave operations but remain limited by residual ZZ crosstalk. Here we propose a microwave-activated three-qubit gate protocol for fixed-frequency transmon qubits in the large-detuning regime ($|\Delta| \gg g$), leveraging the third-order nonlinear interaction to coherently exchange $|001\rangle \leftrightarrow |110\rangle$ states. By incorporating a phase-compensated optimization protocol, numerical simulations demonstrate a high average gate fidelity exceeding $99.9\%$. Systematic error analysis identifies static long-range ZZ coupling as the dominant error source in multi-qubit systems, which can be suppressed via operations in the large-detuning regime ($\sim 1$ GHz). This approach simultaneously enhances gate fidelity while preserving spectral isolation, ensuring compatibility with existing all-microwave controlled-Z gate frameworks. The protocol exhibits intrinsic robustness to fabrication-induced qubit parameter variations. This hardware-efficient strategy advances scalable quantum computing systems by improving coherence properties, reducing spectral congestion, and expanding the experimental toolkit for error-resilient quantum operations in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum era.</description>

      <title>Room Temperature Single Photon Detection at 1550 nm using van der Waals Heterojunction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05455v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Single-photon detectors (SPDs) are crucial in applications ranging from space, biological imaging to quantum communication and information processing. The SPDs that operate at room temperature are of particular interest to broader application space as the energy overhead introduced by the cryogenic cooling can be avoided. Although silicon-based single photon avalanche diodes (SPADs) are well matured and operate at room temperature, the bandgap limitation restricts their operation at telecommunication wavelength (1550 nm) and beyond. InGaAs-based SPADs, on the other hand, are sensitive to 1550 nm photons, but suffer from relatively lower efficiency, high dark count rate, afterpulsing probability, and pose hazards to the environment from the fabrication process. In this work, we demonstrate how we can leverage the properties of nanomaterials to address these challenges and realise a room temperature single-photon detector capable of operating at 1550 nm. We achieve this by coupling a low bandgap ($\sim 350~meV$) absorber (black phosphorus) to a sensitive van der Waals probe that is capable of detecting discrete electron fluctuation. We optimize the device for operation at $1550~nm$ and demonstrate an overall quantum efficiency of $21.4\%$ (estimated as $42.8\%$ for polarized light), and a minimum dark count of $\sim 720~Hz$ at room temperature.</description>

      <title>Topological robustness of classical and quantum optical skyrmions in atmospheric turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05727v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The degradation of classical and quantum structured light induced by complex media constitutes a critical barrier to its practical implementation in a range of applications, from communication and energy transport to imaging and sensing. Atmospheric turbulence is an exemplary case due to its complex phase structure and dynamic variations, driving the need to find invariances in light. Here we construct classical and quantum optical skyrmions and pass them through experimentally simulated atmospheric turbulence, revealing the embedded topological resilience of their structure. In the quantum realm, we show that while skyrmions undergo diminished entanglement, their topological characteristics maintain stable. This is paralleled classically, where the vectorial structure is scrambled by the medium yet the skyrmion remains stable by virtue of its intrinsic topological protection mechanism. Our experimental results are supported by rigorous analytical and numerical modelling, validating that the quantum-classical equivalence of the topological behaviour is due to the non-separability of the states and one-sided nature of the channel. Our work blurs the classical-quantum divide in the context of topology and opens a new path to information resilience in noisy channels, such as terrestrial and satellite-to-ground communication networks.</description>

      <title>Meta-training of diffractive meta-neural networks for super-resolution direction of arrival estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05926v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffractive neural networks leverage the high-dimensional characteristics of electromagnetic (EM) fields for high-throughput computing. However, the existing architectures face challenges in integrating large-scale multidimensional metasurfaces with precise network training and haven't utilized multidimensional EM field coding scheme for super-resolution sensing. Here, we propose diffractive meta-neural networks (DMNNs) for accurate EM field modulation through metasurfaces, which enable multidimensional multiplexing and coding for multi-task learning and high-throughput super-resolution direction of arrival estimation. DMNN integrates pre-trained mini-metanets to characterize the amplitude and phase responses of meta-atoms across different polarizations and frequencies, with structure parameters inversely designed using the gradient-based meta-training. For wide-field super-resolution angle estimation, the system simultaneously resolves azimuthal and elevational angles through x and y-polarization channels, while the interleaving of frequency-multiplexed angular intervals generates spectral-encoded optical super-oscillations to achieve full-angle high-resolution estimation. Post-processing lightweight electronic neural networks further enhance the performance. Experimental results validate that a three-layer DMNN operating at 27 GHz, 29 GHz, and 31 GHz achieves $\sim7\times$ Rayleigh diffraction-limited angular resolution (0.5$^\circ$), a mean absolute error of 0.048$^\circ$ for two incoherent targets within a $\pm 11.5^\circ$ field of view, and an angular estimation throughput an order of magnitude higher (1917) than that of existing methods. The proposed architecture advances high-dimensional photonic computing systems by utilizing inherent high-parallelism and all-optical coding methods for ultra-high-resolution, high-throughput applications.</description>

      <title>The origin of long-range links of air pollution in China</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05974v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Weather conditions significantly influence the formation and dispersion of pollution variations. Here we study networks of pollution as well as climate networks and find that pollutants may not only have an impact close to their source but also show a significant correlation with pollutant concentrations thousands of kilometers away. We develop a pollution network model based on cross-correlation between PM2.5 concentration time series in different sites in China to detect stable long-range links during the last ten years. A multi-network analysis of the 500 hPa geopotential height and PM2.5 concentration suggests that long-range correlations in PM2.5 levels are also influenced by synoptic activity.</description>

      <title>Distillation of CNN Ensemble Results for Enhanced Long-Term Prediction of the ENSO Phenomenon</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.06227v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The accurate long-term forecasting of the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is still one of the biggest challenges in climate science. While it is true that short-to medium-range performance has been improved significantly using the advances in deep learning, statistical dynamical hybrids, most operational systems still use the simple mean of all ensemble members, implicitly assuming equal skill across members. In this study, we demonstrate, through a strictly a-posteriori evaluation , for any large enough ensemble of ENSO forecasts, there is a subset of members whose skill is substantially higher than that of the ensemble mean. Using a state-of-the-art ENSO forecast system cross-validated against the 1986-2017 observed Nino3.4 index, we identify two Top-5 subsets one ranked on lowest Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and another on highest Pearson correlation. Generally across all leads, these outstanding members show higher correlation and lower RMSE, with the advantage rising enormously with lead time. Whereas at short leads (1 month) raises the mean correlation by about +0.02 (+1.7%) and lowers the RMSE by around 0.14 {\deg}C or by 23.3% compared to the All-40 mean, at extreme leads (23 months) the correlation is raised by +0.43 (+172%) and RMSE by 0.18 {\deg}C or by 22.5% decrease. The enhancements are largest during crucial ENSO transition periods such as SON and DJF, when accurate amplitude and phase forecasting is of greatest socio-economic benefit, and furthermore season-dependent e.g., mid-year months such as JJA and MJJ have incredibly large RMSE reductions. This study provides a solid foundation for further investigations to identify reliable clues for detecting high-quality ensemble members, thereby enhancing forecasting skill.</description>

      <title>Lessons from Chalcopyrites for Scaling Thin Film Perovskite Photovoltaic Technology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.11638v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The growing demand for photovoltaic (PV) technologies that are lightweight, flexible, and seamlessly integrated into diverse applications has propelled interest in thin-film solar cells. Among these, Cu(In,Ga)(S,Se)2 (CIGS) and metal halide perovskites have garnered significant attention in the past and present, respectively. While CIGS reached commercial readiness after decades of refinement, their large-scale deployment was hindered by manufacturing complexity, scale-up challenges, and a lack of coordination between materials, device design, and production systems. Perovskite solar cells, despite setting record efficiencies at an unprecedented pace, now face similar challenges on their path to commercialization: ensuring long-term stability, translating laboratory performance to scalable architectures, and aligning with industrial realities. In this perspective, we revisit the CIGS experience not as a benchmark, but as a blueprint, highlighting how its successes and failures can inform a more deliberate and durable trajectory for perovskite PV. Bridging this historical perspective with the current frontier, we propose that the future of perovskites depends not only on continued innovation, but on learning from past thin-film PV experience to avoid its repetition.</description>

Abstract: Coulomb crystals -- ordered structures of cold ions confined in ion traps -- find applications in a variety of research fields. The number and temperature of the ions forming the Coulomb crystals are two key attributes of interest in many trapped-ion experiments. Here, we present a fast and accurate approach to determining these attributes from fluorescence images of the ions based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs). In this approach, we first generate a large number of images of Coulomb crystals with different ion numbers and temperatures using molecular-dynamics simulations and then train CNN models on these images to classify the desired attributes. The classification performance of several common pretrained CNN models was compared in example tasks. We find that for crystals with ion numbers in the range 100--299 and secular temperatures of 5--15 mK, the best-performing model can discern number variations on the level of one ion with an accuracy of 93% and temperature variations by 1 mK with an accuracy of 92%. Since the trained model can be directly integrated into experiments, in-situ determination of these attributes can be realized in a non-invasive fashion, which has the potential to greatly facilitate the analysis and control of trapped ions in real time.</description>

Abstract: Soft X-ray experiments at synchrotron light sources are essential for a wide range of research fields. However, commercially available detectors for this energy range often cannot deliver the necessary combination of quantum efficiency, signal-to-noise ratio, dynamic range, speed, and radiation hardness within a single system. While hybrid detectors have addressed these challenges effectively in the hard X-ray regime, specifically with single photon counting pixel detectors extensively used in high-performance synchrotron applications, similar solutions are desired for energies below 2 keV.
  In this work, we introduce the first single-photon-counting hybrid pixel detector capable of detecting X-ray energies as low as 550 eV, utilizing the internal amplification of Low-Gain Avalanche Diode (LGAD) sensors. This detector is thoroughly characterized in terms of Signal-to-Noise Ratio and Detective Quantum Efficiency. We demonstrate its capabilities through ptychographic imaging at MAX IV 4th generation synchrotron light source at the Fe L$_3$-edge (707 eV), showcasing the enhanced detection performance of the system. This development sets a new benchmark for soft X-ray applications at synchrotrons, paving the way for significant advancements in imaging and analysis at lower photon energies.</description>

      <title>Two-media laser threshold magnetometry: A magnetic-field-dependent laser threshold</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.08466v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond are a promising platform for high-precision magnetometry. In contrast to the use of spontaneous emission in a number of NV-magnetometers, laser threshold magnetometry (LTM) exploits stimulated emission of NV centers by placing an NV-doped diamond inside an optical cavity. The NV laser system is predicted to reach a high magnetic-field-dependent contrast and coherent signal strength, leading to an improved magnetic field sensitivity combined with a high linearity. Here, we consider a two-media setup where the cavity additionally includes a vertical external cavity surface emitting laser. This optically active material compensates cavity losses at \SI{750}{nm} while still allowing for magnetic-field-dependent effects from the NV-diamond. We demonstrate a magnetic-field-dependent laser threshold and investigate the effects of pump laser induced absorption of the diamond. The experimental data is supported by an analytical simulation based on a rate model. Furthermore, we derive a generalized formula to compute the shot-noise-limited magnetic field sensitivity in the regime of high contrast yielding 49.07(33) pT/$\sqrt{\text{Hz}}$ for the present setup. Simulations with an optimized NV-diamond suggest that values down to 4.9 ft/$\sqrt{\text{Hz}}$ are possible.</description>

Abstract: Reconfigurable integrated chips of photonic components and networks are envisaged to play a key role in realizing highly efficient integrated photonic information processing. Electrothermally modulated optical effect (ETMOE) is a powerful thermo-optic tuning mechanism for silicon photonic devices, enabling precise optical control via localized Joule heating. We present a rigorous and three-dimensional electronic-photonic co-integrated approach with the nonlinear numerical coupling of temperature and wavelength-dependent material properties to comprehensively model ETMOE in silicon waveguides and resonators. A platinum-based symmetric heater is optimized using advanced true 3D numerical simulations, achieving efficient ETMOE-based tuning while mitigating asymmetric heat distribution. In addition to a complete design and analysis of the fully integrated three-dimensional switch, we also evaluate single-mode waveguide cutoff, heater-to-waveguide separation, heater dimensions, and thermal dissipation, providing a framework for ETMOE-based optimization. The findings contribute to energy-efficient, programmable photonic systems for neuromorphic computing, optical interconnects, and reconfigurable photonic networks.</description>

      <title>Deformation Driven Suction Cups: A Mechanics-Based Approach to Wearable Electronics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11838v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Wearable electronics are emerging as essential tools for health monitoring, haptic feedback, and human-computer interactions. While stable contact at the device-body interface is critical for these applications, it remains challenging due to the skin's softness, roughness, and mechanical variability. Existing methods, such as grounding structures or adhesive tapes, often suffer from contact loss, limited repeatability, and restrictions on the types of electronics they can support. Suction-based adhesives offer a promising alternative by generating negative pressure without requiring tight bands or chemical adhesives. However, most existing cup designs rely on rigid-surface assumptions and overlook mechanical interactions between suction cups and skin. Inspired by traditional cupping therapies, we present a suction-based adhesive system that attaches through elastic deformation and recovery. Using analytical modeling, numerical simulations, and experiments, we present a mechanics-based framework showing how suction performance depends on cup geometry, substrate compliance, and interfacial adhesion. We show that cup geometry should be tailored to substrate stiffness. Wide, flat suction cups perform well on rigid surfaces but fail on soft ones like skin due to substrate intrusion into the chamber. Narrow and tall domes better preserve recoverable volume and generate stronger suction. To improve sealing on rough, dry skin, we introduce a soft, tacky interfacial layer informed by a contact mechanics model. Using our design principles for skin suction adhesives, we demonstrate secure attachment of rigid and flexible components including motion sensors, haptic actuators, and electrophysiological electrodes across diverse anatomical regions. These findings provide a fundamental basis for designing the next generation of skin-friendly adhesives for wearable electronics.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Centrifuge Effects in Ultrafast Laser Ablation Plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20299v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A self-consistent model is developed to explain the anomalously large enrichment of nickel isotopes observed in ablation plumes from ultrafast laser irradiation of solid surfaces. The model is based on the spontaneous creation of a magnetic centrifuge in the ablation plume and the associated cyclotron rotation of plasma ions with rotation rates on the order of 10^9 radians per second. Mass separation occurs around the radial coordinate of cylindrical symmetry with longitudinal axis normal to the ablating surface. A Gaussian shaped radial magnetic field distribution is extracted for Ni isotopes with peak field of 53 Megagauss and average field of 20 Megagauss. In addition to cyclotron rotation of ions, a rigid rotor model is also presented that is associated with the hydrodynamic rotation of the entire plasma and is shown to be of little consequence for the isotope enrichment. Cyclotron rotations dominate the process. A profound resonance of enrichment is observed for specific cyclotron charge states and is shown to be associated with Ion Bernstein Wave (IBW) coupling that provides electrostatic acceleration to these resonant orbits.</description>
