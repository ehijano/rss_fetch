      <title>Jet radius dependence of dijet momentum balance and suppression in Pb+Pb collisions at 5.02 TeV with the ATLAS detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper describes a measurement of the jet radius dependence of the dijet momentum balance between leading back-to-back jets in 1.72 $nb^{-1}$ of Pb+Pb collisions collected in 2018 and 255 pb$^{-1}$ of $pp$ collisions collected in 2017 by the ATLAS detector at the LHC. Both data sets were collected at $ \sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}=$ 5.02 TeV. Jets are reconstructed using the anti-$k_t$ algorithm with jet radius parameters $R=$ 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5 and 0.6. The dijet momentum balance distributions are constructed for leading jets with transverse momentum $p_{\rm T}$ from 100 to 562 GeV for $R=$ 0.2, 0.3 and 0.4 jets, and from 158 to 562 GeV for $R=$ 0.5 and 0.6 jets. The absolutely normalized dijet momentum balance distributions are constructed to compare measurements of the dijet yields in Pb+Pb collisions directly to the dijet cross sections in $pp$ collisions. For all jet radii considered here, there is a suppression of more balanced dijets in Pb+Pb collisions compared to $pp$ collisions, while for more imbalanced dijets there is an enhancement. There is a jet radius dependence to the dijet yields, being stronger for more imbalanced dijets than for more balanced dijets. Additionally, jet pair nuclear modification factors are measured. The subleading jet yields are found to be more suppressed than leading jet yields in dijets. A jet radius dependence of the pair nuclear modification factors is observed, with the suppression decreasing with increasing jet radius. These measurements provide new constraints on jet quenching scenarios in the quark-gluon plasma.</description>

      <title>MoEDAL search in the CMS beam pipe for magnetic monopoles produced via the Schwinger effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.15682v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report on a search for magnetic monopoles (MMs) produced in ultraperipheral Pb--Pb collisions during Run-1 of the LHC. The beam pipe surrounding the interaction region of the CMS experiment was exposed to 184.07 \textmu b$^{-1}$ of Pb--Pb collisions at 2.76 TeV center-of-mass energy per collision in December 2011, before being removed in 2013. It was scanned by the MoEDAL experiment using a SQUID magnetometer to search for trapped MMs. No MM signal was observed. The two distinctive features of this search are the use of a trapping volume very close to the collision point and ultra-high magnetic fields generated during the heavy-ion run that could produce MMs via the Schwinger effect. These two advantages allowed setting the first reliable, world-leading mass limits on MMs with high magnetic charge. In particular, the established limits are the strongest available in the range between 2 and 45 Dirac units, excluding MMs with masses of up to 80 GeV at 95\% confidence level.</description>

      <title>Measurement of Spin-Density Matrix Elements in $\Delta^{++}(1232)$ photoproduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12829v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We measure the spin-density matrix elements (SDMEs) of the $\Delta^{++}(1232)$ in the photoproduction reaction $\gamma p \to \pi^-\Delta^{++}(1232)$ with the GlueX experiment in Hall D at Jefferson Lab. The measurement uses a linearly--polarized photon beam with energies from $8.2$ to $8.8$~GeV and the statistical precision of the SDMEs exceeds the previous measurement by three orders of magnitude for the momentum transfer squared region below $1.4$ GeV$^2$. The data are sensitive to the previously undetermined relative sign between couplings in existing Regge-exchange models. Linear combinations of the extracted SDMEs allow for a decomposition into natural and unnatural--exchange amplitudes. We find that the unnatural exchange plays an important role in the low momentum transfer region.</description>
