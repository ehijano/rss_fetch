      <title>SW-ViT: A Spatio-Temporal Vision Transformer Network with Post Denoiser for Sequential Multi-Push Ultrasound Shear Wave Elastography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18865v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Objective: Ultrasound Shear Wave Elastography (SWE) demonstrates great potential in assessing soft-tissue pathology by mapping tissue stiffness, which is linked to malignancy. Traditional SWE methods have shown promise in estimating tissue elasticity, yet their susceptibility to noise interference, reliance on limited training data, and inability to generate segmentation masks concurrently present notable challenges to accuracy and reliability. Approach: In this paper, we propose SW-ViT, a novel two-stage deep learning framework for SWE that integrates a CNN-Spatio-Temporal Vision Transformer-based reconstruction network with an efficient Transformer-based post-denoising network. The first stage uses a 3D ResNet encoder with multi-resolution spatio-temporal Transformer blocks that capture spatial and temporal features, followed by a squeeze-and-excitation attention decoder that reconstructs 2D stiffness maps. To address data limitations, a patch-based training strategy is adopted for localized learning and reconstruction. In the second stage, a denoising network with a shared encoder and dual decoders processes inclusion and background regions to produce a refined stiffness map and segmentation mask. A hybrid loss combining regional, smoothness, fusion, and Intersection over Union (IoU) components ensures improvements in both reconstruction and segmentation. Results: On simulated data, our method achieves PSNR of 32.68 dB, CNR of 46.78 dB, and SSIM of 0.995. On phantom data, results include PSNR of 21.11 dB, CNR of 42.14 dB, and SSIM of 0.936. Segmentation IoU values reach 0.949 (simulation) and 0.738 (phantom) with ASSD values being 0.184 and 1.011, respectively. Significance: SW-ViT delivers robust, high-quality elasticity map estimates from noisy SWE data and holds clear promise for clinical application.</description>

      <title>Hyperdisordered cell packing on a growing surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15712v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While the physics of disordered packing in non-growing systems is well understood, unexplored phenomena can emerge when packing takes place in growing domains. We study the arrangements of pigment cells (chromatophores) on squid skin as a biological example of a packed system on an expanding surface. We find that relative density fluctuations in cell numbers grow with spatial scale. We term this behavior ``hyperdisordered'', in contrast with hyperuniform behavior in which relative fluctuations tend to zero at large scale. We find that hyperdisordered scaling, akin to that of a critical system, is quantitatively reproduced by a model in which hard disks are randomly inserted in a homogeneously growing surface. In addition, we find that chromatophores increase in size during animal development, but maintain a stationary size distribution. The physical mechanisms described in our work may apply to a broad class of growing dense systems.</description>
