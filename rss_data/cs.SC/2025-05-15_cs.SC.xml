      <title>An Algorithm for the Leading Monomials of a Minimal Groebner Basis of Generic Sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an efficient algorithm for computing the leading monomials of a minimal Groebner basis of a generic sequence of homogeneous polynomials. Our approach bypasses costly polynomial reductions by exploiting structural properties conjectured to hold for generic sequences-specifically, that their leading monomial ideals are weakly reverse lexicographic and that their Hilbert series follow a known closed-form expression. The algorithm incrementally constructs the set of leading monomials degree by degree by comparing Hilbert functions of monomial ideals with the expected Hilbert series of the input ideal. To enhance computational efficiency, we introduce several optimization techniques that progressively narrow the search space and reduce the number of divisibility checks required at each step. We also refine the loop termination condition using degree bounds, thereby avoiding unnecessary recomputation of Hilbert series. Experimental results confirm that the proposed method substantially reduces both computation time and memory usage compared to conventional Groebner basis computations, particularly for large-scale systems. These results indicate that our algorithm can serve as an effective pre-processing tool for accelerating Groebner basis computations in generic polynomial sequence solving.</description>

      <title>$XX^{t}$ Can Be Faster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09814v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a new algorithm RXTX that computes product of matrix by its transpose $XX^{t}$. RXTX uses $5\%$ less multiplications and additions than State-of-the-Art and achieves accelerations even for small sizes of matrix $X$. The algorithm was discovered by combining Machine Learning-based search methods with Combinatorial Optimization.</description>

      <title>Majorization and Inequalities among Complete Homogeneous Symmetric Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08149v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inequalities among symmetric functions are fundamental in various branches of mathematics, thus motivating a systematic study of their structure. Majorization has been shown to characterize inequalities among commonly used symmetric functions, except for complete homogeneous symmetric functions (shortened as CHs). In 2011, Cuttler, Greene, and Skandera posed a natural question: Can majorization also characterize inequalities among CHs? Their work demonstrated that majorization characterizes inequalities among CHs up to degree 7 and suggested exploring its validity for higher degrees. In this paper, we show that, for every degree greater than 7, majorization does not characterize inequalities among CHs.</description>
