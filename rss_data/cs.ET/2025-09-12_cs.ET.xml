      <title>The Sound of Entanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08892v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The advent of quantum physics has revolutionized our understanding of the universe, replacing the deterministic framework of classical physics with a paradigm dominated by intrinsic randomness and quantum correlations. This shift has not only enabled groundbreaking technologies, such as quantum sensors, networks and computers, but has also unlocked entirely new possibilities for artistic expressions. In this paper, we explore the intersection of quantum mechanics and art, focusing on the use of quantum entanglement and inherent randomness as creative tools. Specifically, we present The Sound of Entanglement, a live musical performance driven by real-time measurements of entangled photons in a Bell test. By integrating the measured quantum correlations as a central compositional element and synchronizing live visuals with experimental data, the performance offers a unique and unrepeatable audiovisual experience that relies on quantum correlations which cannot be produced by any classical device. Through this fusion of science and art, we aim to provide a deeper appreciation of quantum phenomena while expanding the boundaries of creative expression.</description>

      <title>Toward a Multi-Echelon Cyber Warfare Theory: A Meta-Game-Theoretic Paradigm for Defense and Dominance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08976v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cyber warfare has become a central element of modern conflict, especially within multi-domain operations. As both a distinct and critical domain, cyber warfare requires integrating defensive and offensive technologies into coherent strategies. While prior research has emphasized isolated tactics or fragmented technologies, a holistic understanding is essential for effective resource deployment and risk mitigation. Game theory offers a unifying framework for this purpose. It not only models attacker-defender interactions but also provides quantitative tools for equilibrium analysis, risk assessment, and strategic reasoning. Integrated with modern AI techniques, game-theoretic models enable the design and optimization of strategies across multiple levels of cyber warfare, from policy and strategy to operations, tactics, and technical implementations. These models capture the paradoxical logic of conflict, where more resources do not always translate into greater advantage, and where nonlinear dynamics govern outcomes. To illustrate the approach, this chapter examines RedCyber, a synthetic cyber conflict, demonstrating how game-theoretic methods capture the interdependencies of cyber operations. The chapter concludes with directions for future research on resilience, cros-echelon planning, and the evolving role of AI in cyber warfare.</description>

      <title>6G Resilience -- White Paper</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09005v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: 6G must be designed to withstand, adapt to, and evolve amid prolonged, complex disruptions. Mobile networks' shift from efficiency-first to sustainability-aware has motivated this white paper to assert that resilience is a primary design goal, alongside sustainability and efficiency, encompassing technology, architecture, and economics. We promote resilience by analysing dependencies between mobile networks and other critical systems, such as energy, transport, and emergency services, and illustrate how cascading failures spread through infrastructures. We formalise resilience using the 3R framework: reliability, robustness, resilience. Subsequently, we translate this into measurable capabilities: graceful degradation, situational awareness, rapid reconfiguration, and learning-driven improvement and recovery.
  Architecturally, we promote edge-native and locality-aware designs, open interfaces, and programmability to enable islanded operations, fallback modes, and multi-layer diversity (radio, compute, energy, timing). Key enablers include AI-native control loops with verifiable behaviour, zero-trust security rooted in hardware and supply-chain integrity, and networking techniques that prioritise critical traffic, time-sensitive flows, and inter-domain coordination.
  Resilience also has a techno-economic aspect: open platforms and high-quality complementors generate ecosystem externalities that enhance resilience while opening new markets. We identify nine business-model groups and several patterns aligned with the 3R objectives, and we outline governance and standardisation. This white paper serves as an initial step and catalyst for 6G resilience. It aims to inspire researchers, professionals, government officials, and the public, providing them with the essential components to understand and shape the development of 6G resilience.</description>

      <title>Classification of Driver Behaviour Using External Observation Techniques for Autonomous Vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09349v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Road traffic accidents remain a significant global concern, with human error, particularly distracted and impaired driving, among the leading causes. This study introduces a novel driver behavior classification system that uses external observation techniques to detect indicators of distraction and impairment. The proposed framework employs advanced computer vision methodologies, including real-time object tracking, lateral displacement analysis, and lane position monitoring. The system identifies unsafe driving behaviors such as excessive lateral movement and erratic trajectory patterns by implementing the YOLO object detection model and custom lane estimation algorithms. Unlike systems reliant on inter-vehicular communication, this vision-based approach enables behavioral analysis of non-connected vehicles. Experimental evaluations on diverse video datasets demonstrate the framework's reliability and adaptability across varying road and environmental conditions.</description>

      <title>Explaining the Reputational Risks of AI-Mediated Communication: Messages Labeled as AI-Assisted Are Viewed as Less Diagnostic of the Sender's Moral Character</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09645v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When someone sends us a thoughtful message, we naturally form judgments about their character. But what happens when that message carries a label indicating it was written with the help of AI? This paper investigates how the appearance of AI assistance affects our perceptions of message senders. Adding nuance to previous research, through two studies (N=399) featuring vignette scenarios, we find that AI-assistance labels don't necessarily make people view senders negatively. Rather, they dampen the strength of character signals in communication. We show that when someone sends a warmth-signalling message (like thanking or apologizing) without AI help, people more strongly categorize the sender as warm. At the same time, when someone sends a coldness-signalling message (like bragging or blaming) without assistance, people more confidently categorize them as cold. Interestingly, AI labels weaken both these associations: An AI-assisted apology makes the sender appear less warm than if they had written it themselves, and an AI-assisted blame makes the sender appear less cold than if they had composed it independently. This supports our signal diagnosticity explanation: messages labeled as AI-assisted are viewed as less diagnostic than messages which seem unassisted. We discuss how our findings shed light on the causal origins of previously reported observations in AI-Mediated Communication.</description>

      <title>Bridging Simplicity and Sophistication using GLinear: A Novel Architecture for Enhanced Time Series Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01087v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Time Series Forecasting (TSF) is an important application across many fields. There is a debate about whether Transformers, despite being good at understanding long sequences, struggle with preserving temporal relationships in time series data. Recent research suggests that simpler linear models might outperform or at least provide competitive performance compared to complex Transformer-based models for TSF tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel data-efficient architecture, \textit{Gaussian-activated Linear model (GLinear)}, for multivariate TSF that exploits periodic patterns to provide better accuracy. It achieves higher prediction accuracy while requiring less historical data than other state-of-the-art linear predictors. Four different datasets (ETTh1, Electricity, Traffic, and Weather) are used to evaluate the performance of the proposed predictor. A performance comparison with state-of-the-art linear architectures (such as NLinear, DLinear, and RLinear) and transformer-based time series predictors (Autoformer) shows that the GLinear, despite being data efficient, outperforms the existing architectures in most cases of multivariate TSF while being competitive in others. We hope that the proposed GLinear model opens new fronts of research and development of simpler and more sophisticated architectures for data and computationally efficient time-series analysis.

      <title>Quantum-Assisted Machine Learning Models for Enhanced Weather Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23408v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum Machine Learning (QML) presents as a revolutionary approach to weather forecasting by using quantum computing to improve predictive modeling capabilities. In this study, we apply QML models, including Quantum Gated Recurrent Units (QGRUs), Quantum Neural Networks (QNNs), Quantum Long Short-Term Memory(QLSTM), Variational Quantum Circuits(VQCs), and Quantum Support Vector Machines(QSVMs), to analyze meteorological time-series data from the ERA5 dataset. Our methodology includes preprocessing meteorological features, implementing QML architectures for both classification and regression tasks. The results demonstrate that QML models can achieve reasonable accuracy in both prediction and classification tasks, particularly in binary classification. However, challenges such as quantum hardware limitations and noise affect scalability and generalization. This research provides insights into the feasibility of QML for weather prediction, paving the way for further exploration of hybrid quantum-classical frameworks to enhance meteorological forecasting.</description>

      <title>Efficient Optimization Accelerator Framework for Multistate Ising Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20250v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ising Machines are emerging hardware architectures that efficiently solve NP-Hard combinatorial optimization problems. Generally, combinatorial problems are transformed into quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) form, but this transformation often complicates the solution landscape, degrading performance, especially for multi-state problems. To address this challenge, we model spin interactions as generalized boolean logic function to significantly reduce the exploration space. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on graph coloring problem using probabilistic Ising solvers, achieving similar accuracy compared to state-of-the-art heuristics and machine learning algorithms. It also shows significant improvement over state-of-the-art QUBO-based Ising solvers, including probabilistic Ising and simulated bifurcation machines. We also design 1024-neuron all-to-all connected probabilistic Ising accelerator on FPGA with the proposed approach that shows ~10000x performance acceleration compared to GPU-based Tabucol heuristics and reducing physical neurons by 1.5-4x over baseline Ising frameworks. Thus, this work establishes superior efficiency, scalability and solution quality for multi-state optimization problems.</description>

      <title>Can Large Language Models Understand As Well As Apply Patent Regulations to Pass a Hands-On Patent Attorney Test?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10576v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The legal field already uses various large language models (LLMs) in actual applications, but their quantitative performance and reasons for it are underexplored. We evaluated several open-source and proprietary LLMs -- including GPT-series, Anthropic, Deepseek and Llama-3, variants -- on parts of the European Qualifying Examination (EQE) for future European Patent Attorneys. OpenAI o1 led with 0.82 accuracy and 0.81 F1 score, whereas (Amazon Web Services) AWS Llama 3.1 8B lagged at 0.50 accuracy, and a Python-deployed Llama 3.1 8B scored 0.55. The latter two are within the range of mere guessing for the two-answer forced-choice design. None of the evaluated models could have passed the examination fully, as accuracy never exceeded the average threshold of 0.90 required for professional-level standards -- also not models that are regularly promoted for their assumed beyond-PhD- and bar-admitted-lawyer-level performance. GPT-4o excelled at integrating text and graphics, while Claude 3 Opus often lost formatting coherence. Human patent experts evaluated the textual justifications and uncovered various critical shortcomings of each model. They valued clarity and legal rationale over the raw correctness of the answers, which revealed misalignment between automatic metrics and expert judgment. Model outputs were sensitive to modest temperature changes and prompt wording, which underscores the remaining necessity of expert oversight. Future work should target logical consistency, robust multimodality, and adaptive prompting to approach human-level patent proficiency. In summary, despite the outstanding performance of recent large models, the general public might overestimate their performance. The field has a long way to go to develop a virtual patent attorney. This paper wants to point out several specific limitations that need solutions.</description>
