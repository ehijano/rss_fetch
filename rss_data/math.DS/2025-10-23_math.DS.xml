      <title>Li-Yorke chaos on fuzzy dynamical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20240v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a dynamical system $(X,f)$ we investigate how several variants of Li-Yorke chaos behave with respect to the extended systems $(\mathcal{K}(X),\overline{f})$ and $(\mathcal{F}(X),\hat{f})$, where $\overline{f}$ is the hyperextension of $f$ acting on the space $\mathcal{K}(X)$ of non-empty compact subsets of $X$, and where $\hat{f}$ denotes the Zadeh extension of $f$ acting on the space $\mathcal{F}(X)$ of normal fuzzy subsets of $X$. We first prove that the main variants of Li-Yorke chaos transfer from $(X,f)$ to $(\mathcal{K}(X),\overline{f})$ and from $(\mathcal{K}(X),\overline{f})$ to $(\mathcal{F}(X),\hat{f})$, but that the converse implications do not hold in general. However, combining the notions of proximality and sensitivity we introduce Cantor-dense Li-Yorke chaos, and we prove that this strengthened variant of chaos does transfer from $(\mathcal{F}(X),\hat{f})$ to $(\mathcal{K}(X),\overline{f})$ under natural assumptions.</description>

      <title>The Long-Term Impact of Direct Capture Approaches to Carbon Dioxide Removal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the similarities and differences of the long term impact of different carbon dioxide removal (CDR) techniques is essential in determining the most effective and sustainable strategies to mitigate climate change. In particular, direct ocean capture (DOC) has emerged as a promising approach. In contrast to direct air capture (DAC) which separates carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, DOC performs the separation directly from seawater before storing it in geological reservoirs. In this study, we construct and analyze a kinetic system for CDR via DOC using chemical reaction network theory. Our analysis reveals the necessary conditions for the existence of positive steady states and highlights the potential for multistationarity, where the carbon cycle may admit multiple positive steady states, emphasizing the critical importance of addressing tipping points, thresholds beyond which the system could undergo irreversible changes. Furthermore, we examine conditions under which certain carbon pools exhibit absolute concentration robustness, remaining resistant to change regardless of initial conditions. We also determine the conditions for the carbon reduction capability of the model with the DOC intervention. Importantly, a comparative analysis is then presented, where we compare the DOC model with the well-established DAC model by Fortun et al., and explore an integrated DOC-DAC approach for CDR. This comparison is important given that DAC is already being implemented in large-scale projects, while DOC remains in its early stages with limited trials and is geographically constrained to oceanic vicinity. Our comparative modeling framework provides valuable insights into the long-term impacts and complementary roles of DOC, DAC, and their integration into broader CDR strategies for climate mitigation.</description>

      <title>Bounded cohomological induction for transverse measured groupoids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20656v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish an induction isomorphism in the context of measurable bounded cohomology of discrete measured groupoid, which generalizes the Eckmann-Shapiro isomorphism in bounded cohomology of lattices due to Burger and Monod. In our wider setting, the role of lattices is taken by the class of transverse measured groupoids $(\mathcal{G}, \nu)$ associated with a cross-section $Y$ in a pmp dynamical system $(X, \mu)$ of a lcsc group $G$ such that the associated hitting time process of $Y$ is locally integrable. Typical examples are given by pattern groupoids of strong approximate lattices.
  Under the assumptions that $G$ is unimodular we show that the measurable bounded cohomology of $(\mathcal{G}, \nu)$ is isomorphic to the continuous bounded cohomology of $G$ with coefficients in $\text{L}^{\infty}(X, \mu)$. As a consequence, if $G$ is amenable, then $(\mathcal{G}, \nu)$ is boundedly acyclic, and in general the restriction map $\text{H}_{\text{cb}}^\bullet (G; \mathbb{R}) \to \text{H}_{\text{mb}}^\bullet ((\mathcal{G}, \nu);\underline{\mathbb{R}})$ is injective. Moreover, it follows from known results in continuous bounded cohomology that if $G$ is a semisimple higher rank Lie group of Hermitian (respectively complex classical) type, then the second (respectively third) measurable bounded cohomology of $(\mathcal{G}, \nu)$ is generated by the restriction of the bounded K\"ahler class (respectively bounded Borel class). These are the first explicit computations of non-trivial bounded cohomology groups of measured groupoids which are not isomorphic to an action groupoid.</description>

      <title>Understanding Mechanistic Role of Structural and Functional Connectivity in Tau Propagation Through Multi-Layer Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20148v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Emerging neuroimaging evidence shows that pathological tau proteins build up along specific brain networks, suggesting that large-scale network architecture plays a key role in the progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, how structural connectivity (SC) and functional connectivity (FC) interact to influence tau propagation remains unclear. Leveraging an unprecedented volume of longitudinal neuroimaging data, we examine SC-FC interactions through a multi-layer graph diffusion model. Beyond showing that connectome architecture constrains tau spread, our model reveals a regionally asymmetric contribution of SC and FC. Specifically, FC predominantly drives tau spread in subcortical areas, the insula, frontal and temporal cortices, whereas SC plays a larger role in occipital, parietal, and limbic regions. The relative dominance of SC versus FC shifts over the course of disease, with FC generally prevailing in early AD and SC becoming primary in later stages. Spatial patterns of SC- and FC-dominant regions strongly align with the regional expression of AD-associated genes involved in inflammation, apoptosis, and lysosomal function, including CHUK (IKK-alpha), TMEM106B, MCL1, NOTCH1, and TH. In parallel, other non-modifiable risk factors (e.g., APOE genotype, sex) and biological mechanisms (e.g., amyloid deposition) selectively reshape tau propagation by shifting dominant routes between anatomical and functional pathways in a region-specific manner. Findings are validated in an independent AD cohort.</description>

      <title>Energy Decay in Measure Time: HUM Observability, Product-Exponential Envelopes, and GCC Calibration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20371v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that for impulsive exposure patterns there is no uniform exponential energy law in wall-clock time t, which explains why past t-based unifications of continuous damping with impulses fail. We therefore replace t by a measure-valued clock, sigma, that aggregates absolutely continuous exposure and atomic doses within a single Lyapunov ledger. On this ledger we prove an observability-dissipation principle in the sense of the Hilbert Uniqueness Method (HUM): there exists a structural constant c_sigma &gt; 0 such that the energy decays at least at a product-exponential rate with respect to sigma. When sigma = t, the statement reduces to classical exponential stabilization with the same constant. For the damped wave under the Geometric Control Condition (GCC), the constant is calibrated by the usual observability and geometric factors. The framework yields a monotonicity principle ("more sigma-mass implies faster decay") and unifies intermittent regimes where quiescent intervals are punctuated by impulses. As robustness, secondary to the main contribution, the same decay law persists under structure-compatible discretizations and along compact variational limits; a stochastic extension supplies expectation and pathwise envelopes via the compensator. The contribution is a qualitative dynamics backbone: observability implies sigma-exponential decay with sharp constants.</description>

      <title>Stochastic evolution equations with nonlinear diffusivity, recent progress and critical cases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20471v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This short survey article stems from recent progress on critical cases of stochastic evolution equations in variational formulation with additive, multiplicative or gradient noises. Typical examples appear as the limit cases of the stochastic porous medium equation, stochastic fast- and super fast-diffusion equations, self-organized criticality, stochastic singular $p$-Laplace equations, and the stochastic total variation flow, among others. We present several different notions of solutions, results on convergence of solutions depending on a parameter, and homogenization. Furthermore, we provide some references hinting at the recent progress in regularity results, long-time behavior, ergodicity, and numerical analysis.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous Stiffness and Trajectory Optimization for Energy Minimization of Pick-and-Place Tasks of SEA-Actuated Parallel Kinematic Manipulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20490v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A major field of industrial robot applications deals with repetitive tasks that alternate between operating points. For these so-called pick-and-place operations, parallel kinematic manipulators (PKM) are frequently employed. These tasks tend to automatically run for a long period of time and therefore minimizing energy consumption is always of interest. Recent research addresses this topic by the use of elastic elements and particularly series elastic actuators (SEA). This paper explores the possibilities of minimizing energy consumption of SEA actuated PKM performing pick-and-place tasks. The basic idea is to excite eigenmotions that result from the actuator springs and exploit their oscillating characteristics. To this end, a prescribed cyclic pick-and-place operation is analyzed and a dynamic model of SEA driven PKM is derived. Subsequently, an energy minimizing optimal control problem is formulated where operating trajectories as well as SEA stiffnesses are optimized simultaneously. Here, optimizing the actuator stiffness does not account for variable stiffness actuators. It serves as a tool for the design and dimensioning process. The hypothesis on energy reduction is tested on two (parallel) robot applications where redundant actuation is also addressed. The results confirm the validity of this approach.</description>

      <title>A Parameter-Linear Formulation of the Optimal Path Following Problem for Robotic Manipulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20496v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper the computational challenges of time-optimal path following are addressed. The standard approach is to minimize the travel time, which inevitably leads to singularities at zero path speed, when reformulating the optimization problem in terms of a path parameter. Thus, smooth trajectory generation while maintaining a low computational effort is quite challenging, since the singularities have to be taken into account. To this end, a different approach is presented in this paper. This approach is based on maximizing the path speed along a prescribed path. Furthermore, the approach is capable of planning smooth trajectories numerically efficient. Moreover, the discrete reformulation of the underlying problem is linear in optimization variables.</description>

Abstract: This is a complete study of the dynamics of polynomial planar vector fields whose linear part is a multiple of the identity and whose nonlinear part is a homogeneous polynomial. It extends previous work by other authors that was mainly concerned with the existence and number of limit cycles. The general results are also applied to two classes of examples where the nonlinearities have degrees 2 and 3, for which we provide a complete set of phase portraits.</description>

      <title>A Selective Review of Modern Stochastic Modeling: SDE/SPDE Numerics, Data-Driven Identification, and Generative Methods with Applications in Biomathematics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11004v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This review maps developments in stochastic modeling, highlighting non-standard approaches and their applications to biology and epidemiology. It brings together four strands: (1) core models for systems that evolve with randomness; (2) learning key parts of those models directly from data; (3) methods that can generate realistic synthetic data in continuous time; and (4) numerical techniques that keep simulations stable, accurate, and faithful over long runs. The objective is practical: help researchers quickly see what is new, how the pieces fit together, and where important gaps remain. We summarize tools for estimating changing infection or reaction rates under noisy and incomplete observations, modeling spatial spread, accounting for sudden jumps and heavy tails, and reporting uncertainty in a way that is useful for decisions. We also highlight open problems that deserve near-term attention: separating true dynamics from noise when data are irregular; learning spatial dynamics under random influences with guarantees of stability; aligning training with the numerical method used in applications; preserving positivity and conservation in all simulations; reducing cost while controlling error for large studies; estimating rare but important events; and adopting clear, comparable reporting standards. By organizing the field around these aims, the review offers a concise guide to current methods, their practical use, and the most promising directions for future work in biology and epidemiology.s.</description>

Abstract: This paper explores the relationship between Cartan symmetries, dynamical similarities, and dynamical symmetries in contact Hamiltonian mechanics. By introducing an alternative decomposition of vector fields, we characterize these symmetries and present a novel description in terms of tensor densities. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this framework allows, under specific conditions, for the recovery of integrals of motion. We also establish new criteria to assess their independence.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we establish upper bounds on the dimension of sets of singular-on-average and \(\omega\)-singular affine forms in singly metric settings, where either the matrix or the shift is fixed. These results partially address open questions posed by Das, Fishman, Simmons, and Urba\'nski, as well as Kleinbock and Wadleigh. Furthermore, we extend our results to the generalized weighted setup and derive bounds for the intersection of these sets with a wide class of fractals.</description>

      <title>Linear dynamics of random products of operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00186v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the linear dynamics of the random sequence $(T_n(.))_{n \geq 1}$ of the operators $T_n(\omega) = T(\tau^{n-1}\omega) \dotsm T(\tau \omega) T(\omega), n \geq 1$. These products depend on an ergodic measure-preserving transformation $\tau : \mathbb{T} \to \mathbb{T}$ on the probability space $(\mathbb{T}, m)$ and on a strongly measurable map $T : \mathbb{T} \to \mathcal{B}(X)$, where $X$ is a separable Fr\'echet space. We will be focusing on the case where $T(\omega)$ is equal to an operator $T_1$ on $X$ for every $\omega \in A_1$ and equal to an operator $T_2$ on $X$ for every $\omega \in A_2$, where $A_1, A_2$ are two disjoint Borel subsets of $[0,1)$ such that $A_1 \cup A_2 = [0,1)$ and $m(A_k) &gt; 0$ for $k = 1,2$. More precisely, we will be focusing on the case where the operators $T_1$ and $T_2$ are adjoints of multiplication operators on the Hardy space $H^2(\mathbb{D})$, as well as the case where $T_1$ and $T_2$ are entire functions of exponential type of the derivation operator on the space of entire functions. Finally, we will study the linear dynamics of a case of a random product $T_n(\omega)$ for which the operators $T(\tau^i \omega), i \geq 0$, do not commute. We will give particular importance to the case where the ergodic transformation is an irrational rotation or the doubling map on $\mathbb{T}$.</description>

      <title>Equitability and explosive synchronisation in multiplex and higher-order networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.09319v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cluster synchronisation is a key phenomenon observed in networks of coupled dynamical units. Its presence has been linked to symmetry and, more generally, to equability of the underlying network pattern of interactions between identical dynamical units. In this article, we show that equitability is a necessary, and sufficient, condition for the existence of linearly independent cluster synchronised solutions on a very general dynamical system which allows multiplex or higher-order, arbitrarily weighted interactions. As an important consequence, our results explain the ubiquity of explosive synchronisation, as opposed to cluster synchronisation, in multiplex and higher-order networks: equitability imposes additional constraints that must be simultaneously satisfied on the same set of nodes. We study cluster synchronisation for both non-invasive (e.g. diffusive) and generic coupling functions, and relate them to external respectively general equitability of the underlying partition. Our results have important implications for the design of complex dynamical systems of coupled dynamical units with arbitrary cluster synchronisation patterns and coupling functions.</description>

Abstract: Interacting random matrix systems are fundamental to modern theoretical physics and data science, yet a unified framework for their analysis has been lacking. This work introduces such a universal framework, built upon two novel concepts: the Dyson Trace Flow characterizing macroscopic fluctuations, and the Multivariate Dynamic Coupled Semicircle Law describing the collective spectral behavior of multiple interacting matrix processes. We establish the stochastic evolution of eigenvalues under asymmetric coupling and prove the mathematical well-posedness of the theory. A large deviation principle is derived, enabling the calculation of rare event probabilities. The framework is extended to nonlinear and non-reciprocal interactions, revealing universal phenomena including exceptional points, bistability, and novel scaling laws. A striking connection to quantum chaos is unveiled through a holographic correspondence with wormhole geometries. By generalizing classical random matrix theory, this work provides powerful tools for understanding neural networks and complex quantum dynamics.</description>

      <title>Singularity of Cannon-Thurston maps</title>

Abstract: In a closed fibered hyperbolic 3-manifold M, the inclusion of a fiber S, with S and M lifted to the universal covers gives an exponentially distorted embedding of the hyperbolic plane into hyperbolic 3-space. Nevertheless, Cannon and Thurston showed that there is a map from the circle at infinity of the hyperbolic plane to the 2-sphere at infinity of hyperbolic 3-space. The Cannon-Thurston map is surjective, finite-to-one, and gives a space-filling curve. Here we prove that many natural measures on the circle when pushed forward by the Cannon-Thurston map become singular with respect to many natural measures on the 2-sphere. The circle measures we consider are the Lebesgue measure and stationary measures that arise from fully supported random walks on the surface group. Whereas the measures on the sphere we consider are the Lebesgue measure and stationary measures that arise from geometric random walks on the 3-manifold group. The singularity of measures is ultimately derived from the following geometric result. We prove that a hyperbolic geodesic sampled with respect to a pushforward measure asymptotically spends a definite proportion of its time close to a fiber. On the other hand, we show that a hyperbolic geodesic sampled with respect to a natural measure on the sphere spends an asymptotically negligible proportion of its time close to a fiber. For a more restricted class of measures, namely the Lebesgue measure and stationary measures from geometric random walks on the surface group, we also prove an effective result for the proportion of time spent close to a fiber. To this end, we give precise descriptions of quasi-geodesics in the Cannon-Thurston metric, which may be of independent interest.</description>
