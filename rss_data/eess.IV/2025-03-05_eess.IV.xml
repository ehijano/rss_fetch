      <title>A Lightweight Deep Exclusion Unfolding Network for Single Image Reflection Removal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Single Image Reflection Removal (SIRR) is a canonical blind source separation problem and refers to the issue of separating a reflection-contaminated image into a transmission and a reflection image. The core challenge lies in minimizing the commonalities among different sources. Existing deep learning approaches either neglect the significance of feature interactions or rely on heuristically designed architectures. In this paper, we propose a novel Deep Exclusion unfolding Network (DExNet), a lightweight, interpretable, and effective network architecture for SIRR. DExNet is principally constructed by unfolding and parameterizing a simple iterative Sparse and Auxiliary Feature Update (i-SAFU) algorithm, which is specifically designed to solve a new model-based SIRR optimization formulation incorporating a general exclusion prior. This general exclusion prior enables the unfolded SAFU module to inherently identify and penalize commonalities between the transmission and reflection features, ensuring more accurate separation. The principled design of DExNet not only enhances its interpretability but also significantly improves its performance. Comprehensive experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that DExNet achieves state-of-the-art visual and quantitative results while utilizing only approximately 8\% of the parameters required by leading methods.</description>

      <title>CrossFusion: A Multi-Scale Cross-Attention Convolutional Fusion Model for Cancer Survival Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cancer survival prediction from whole slide images (WSIs) is a challenging task in computational pathology due to the large size, irregular shape, and high granularity of the WSIs. These characteristics make it difficult to capture the full spectrum of patterns, from subtle cellular abnormalities to complex tissue interactions, which are crucial for accurate prognosis. To address this, we propose CrossFusion, a novel multi-scale feature integration framework that extracts and fuses information from patches across different magnification levels. By effectively modeling both scale-specific patterns and their interactions, CrossFusion generates a rich feature set that enhances survival prediction accuracy. We validate our approach across six cancer types from public datasets, demonstrating significant improvements over existing state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, when coupled with domain-specific feature extraction backbones, our method shows further gains in prognostic performance compared to general-purpose backbones.

      <title>Volume Tells: Dual Cycle-Consistent Diffusion for 3D Fluorescence Microscopy De-noising and Super-Resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02261v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 3D fluorescence microscopy is essential for understanding fundamental life processes through long-term live-cell imaging. However, due to inherent issues in imaging principles, it faces significant challenges including spatially varying noise and anisotropic resolution, where the axial resolution lags behind the lateral resolution up to 4.5 times. Meanwhile, laser power is kept low to maintain cell viability, leading to inaccessible low-noise and high-resolution paired ground truth (GT). To tackle these limitations, a dual Cycle-consistent Diffusion is proposed to effectively mine intra-volume imaging priors within 3D cell volumes in an unsupervised manner, i.e., Volume Tells (VTCD), achieving de-noising and super-resolution (SR) simultaneously. Specifically, a spatially iso-distributed denoiser is designed to exploit the noise distribution consistency between adjacent low-noise and high-noise regions within the 3D cell volume, suppressing the spatially varying noise. Then, in light of the structural consistency of the cell volume, a cross-plane global-propagation SR module propagates high-resolution details from the XY plane into adjacent regions in the XZ and YZ planes, progressively enhancing resolution across the entire 3D cell volume. Experimental results on 10 in vivo cellular dataset demonstrate high improvements in both denoising and super-resolution, with axial resolution enhanced from ~ 430 nm to ~ 90 nm.</description>

      <title>Semantic Prior Distillation with Vision Foundation Model for Enhanced Rapid Bone Scintigraphy Image Restoration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rapid bone scintigraphy is an essential tool for diagnosing skeletal diseases and tumor metastasis in pediatric patients, as it reduces scan time and minimizes patient discomfort. However, rapid scans often result in poor image quality, potentially affecting diagnosis due to reduced resolution and detail, which make it challenging to identify and evaluate finer anatomical structures. To address this issue, we propose the first application of SAM-based semantic priors for medical image restoration, leveraging the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to enhance rapid bone scintigraphy images in pediatric populations. Our method comprises two cascaded networks, $f^{IR1}$ and $f^{IR2}$, augmented by three key modules: a Semantic Prior Integration (SPI) module, a Semantic Knowledge Distillation (SKD) module, and a Semantic Consistency Module (SCM). The SPI and SKD modules incorporate domain-specific semantic information from a fine-tuned SAM, while the SCM maintains consistent semantic feature representation throughout the cascaded networks. In addition, we will release a novel Rapid Bone Scintigraphy dataset called RBS, the first dataset dedicated to rapid bone scintigraphy image restoration in pediatric patients. RBS consists of 137 pediatric patients aged between 0.5 and 16 years who underwent both standard and rapid bone scans. The dataset includes scans performed at 20 cm/min (standard) and 40 cm/min (rapid), representing a $2\times$ acceleration. We conducted extensive experiments on both the publicly available endoscopic dataset and RBS. The results demonstrate that our method outperforms all existing methods across various metrics, including PSNR, SSIM, FID, and LPIPS.</description>

      <title>Generative Model-Assisted Demosaicing for Cross-multispectral Cameras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02322v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As a crucial part of the spectral filter array (SFA)-based multispectral imaging process, spectral demosaicing has exploded with the proliferation of deep learning techniques. However, (1) bothering by the difficulty of capturing corresponding labels for real data or simulating the practical spectral imaging process, end-to-end networks trained in a supervised manner using simulated data often perform poorly on real data. (2) cross-camera spectral discrepancies make it difficult to apply pre-trained models to new cameras. (3) existing demosaicing networks are prone to introducing visual artifacts on hard cases due to the interpolation of unknown values. To address these issues, we propose a hybrid supervised training method with the assistance of the self-supervised generative model, which performs well on real data across different spectral cameras. Specifically, our approach consists of three steps: (1) Pre-Training step: training the end-to-end neural network on a large amount of simulated data; (2) Pseudo-Pairing step: generating pseudo-labels of real target data using the self-supervised generative model; (3) Fine-Tuning step: fine-tuning the pre-trained model on the pseudo data pairs obtained in (2). To alleviate artifacts, we propose a frequency-domain hard patch selection method that identifies artifact-prone regions by analyzing spectral discrepancies using Fourier transform and filtering techniques, allowing targeted fine-tuning to enhance demosaicing performance. Finally, we propose UniSpecTest, a real-world multispectral mosaic image dataset for testing. Ablation experiments have demonstrated the effectiveness of each training step, and extensive experiments on both synthetic and real datasets show that our method achieves significant performance gains compared to state-of-the-art techniques.</description>

      <title>COMMA: Coordinate-aware Modulated Mamba Network for 3D Dispersed Vessel Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate segmentation of 3D vascular structures is essential for various medical imaging applications. The dispersed nature of vascular structures leads to inherent spatial uncertainty and necessitates location awareness, yet most current 3D medical segmentation models rely on the patch-wise training strategy that usually loses this spatial context. In this study, we introduce the Coordinate-aware Modulated Mamba Network (COMMA) and contribute a manually labeled dataset of 570 cases, the largest publicly available 3D vessel dataset to date. COMMA leverages both entire and cropped patch data through global and local branches, ensuring robust and efficient spatial location awareness. Specifically, COMMA employs a channel-compressed Mamba (ccMamba) block to encode entire image data, capturing long-range dependencies while optimizing computational costs. Additionally, we propose a coordinate-aware modulated (CaM) block to enhance interactions between the global and local branches, allowing the local branch to better perceive spatial information. We evaluate COMMA on six datasets, covering two imaging modalities and five types of vascular tissues. The results demonstrate COMMA's superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods with computational efficiency, especially in segmenting small vessels. Ablation studies further highlight the importance of our proposed modules and spatial information. The code and data will be open source at https://github.com/shigen-StoneRoot/COMMA.</description>

      <title>Building 3D In-Context Learning Universal Model in Neuroimaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In-context learning (ICL), a type of universal model, demonstrates exceptional generalization across a wide range of tasks without retraining by leveraging task-specific guidance from context, making it particularly effective for the complex demands of neuroimaging. However, existing ICL models, which take 2D images as input, struggle to fully leverage the 3D anatomical structures in neuroimages, leading to a lack of global awareness and suboptimal performance. In this regard, we introduce Neuroverse3D, an ICL model capable of performing multiple neuroimaging tasks (e.g., segmentation, denoising, inpainting) in 3D. Neuroverse3D overcomes the large memory consumption due to 3D inputs through adaptive parallel-sequential context processing and a U-shape fusion strategy, allowing it to handle an unlimited number of context images. Additionally, we propose an optimized loss to balance multi-task training and enhance the focus on anatomical structures. Our study incorporates 43,674 3D scans from 19 neuroimaging datasets and evaluates Neuroverse3D on 14 diverse tasks using held-out test sets. The results demonstrate that Neuroverse3D significantly outperforms existing ICL models and closely matches the performance of task-specific models. The code and model weights are publicly released at: https://github.com/jiesihu/Neu3D.</description>

      <title>Scene-based nonuniformity correction with homography transformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02487v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to their affordable, low mass, and small dimensions, uncooled microbolometer-based thermal focal plane arrays (UC-FPAs) are useful for long-wave infrared (LWIR)imaging applications. However, in outdoor conditions typical in agricultural remote sensing, cameras based on UC-FPAs may suffer from drift in offset and gain. To tackle the persistent drift, the system requires continuous calibration. Our goal in this study was to eliminate this requirement via a computational schema. In a former study, we estimated unknown gain and offset values and thermographic images of an object from a sequence of pairs of successive images taken at two different blur levels.In the current work, we took on a similar problem using a sequence of shifted images, with relative shifts caused by realistic drone hovering modeled by homography transformation. This places our work in the realm of scene-based nonuniformity correction problems. We show that an object's thermographic values, as well as gain and offset, can be jointly estimated by relying on a few sets of shifted images. We use a minimum likelihood estimator, which is found using alternating minimization. Registration is done using a generalized Lucas-Kanade method. Simulations show promising accuracy with mean Pearson correlation of more than 0.9999998 between ground truth and restoration. Under ideal assumptions, this is equivalent to a mean restoration error of less than 0.01 Celsius degree.</description>

      <title>Undertrained Image Reconstruction for Realistic Degradation in Blind Image Super-Resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02767v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most super-resolution (SR) models struggle with real-world low-resolution (LR) images. This issue arises because the degradation characteristics in the synthetic datasets differ from those in real-world LR images. Since SR models are trained on pairs of high-resolution (HR) and LR images generated by downsampling, they are optimized for simple degradation. However, real-world LR images contain complex degradation caused by factors such as the imaging process and JPEG compression. Due to these differences in degradation characteristics, most SR models perform poorly on real-world LR images. This study proposes a dataset generation method using undertrained image reconstruction models. These models have the property of reconstructing low-quality images with diverse degradation from input images. By leveraging this property, this study generates LR images with diverse degradation from HR images to construct the datasets. Fine-tuning pre-trained SR models on our generated datasets improves noise removal and blur reduction, enhancing performance on real-world LR images. Furthermore, an analysis of the datasets reveals that degradation diversity contributes to performance improvements, whereas color differences between HR and LR images may degrade performance. 11 pages, (11 figures and 2 tables)</description>

      <title>SPIDER: A Comprehensive Multi-Organ Supervised Pathology Dataset and Baseline Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02876v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advancing AI in computational pathology requires large, high-quality, and diverse datasets, yet existing public datasets are often limited in organ diversity, class coverage, or annotation quality. To bridge this gap, we introduce SPIDER (Supervised Pathology Image-DEscription Repository), the largest publicly available patch-level dataset covering multiple organ types, including Skin, Colorectal, and Thorax, with comprehensive class coverage for each organ. SPIDER provides high-quality annotations verified by expert pathologists and includes surrounding context patches, which enhance classification performance by providing spatial context.
  Alongside the dataset, we present baseline models trained on SPIDER using the Hibou-L foundation model as a feature extractor combined with an attention-based classification head. The models achieve state-of-the-art performance across multiple tissue categories and serve as strong benchmarks for future digital pathology research. Beyond patch classification, the model enables rapid identification of significant areas, quantitative tissue metrics, and establishes a foundation for multimodal approaches.
  Both the dataset and trained models are publicly available to advance research, reproducibility, and AI-driven pathology development. Access them at: https://github.com/HistAI/SPIDER</description>

      <title>S-R2D2: a spherical extension of the R2D2 deep neural network series paradigm for wide-field radio-interferometric imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01462v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, the R2D2 paradigm, standing for ''Residual-to-Residual DNN series for high-Dynamic-range imaging'', was introduced for image formation in Radio Interferometry (RI) as a learned version of the traditional algorithm CLEAN. The first incarnations of R2D2 are limited to planar imaging on small fields of view, failing to meet the spherical-imaging requirement of modern telescopes observing wide fields. To address this limitation, we propose the spherical-imaging extension S-R2D2. Firstly, as R2D2, S-R2D2 encapsulates its minor cycles in existing 2D-Euclidean deep neural network (DNN) architectures, but adapts its iterative scheme to incorporate the wide-field measurement model mapping a spherical image to visibility data. We implemented this model as the composition of an efficient Fourier-based interpolator mapping the spherical image onto the equatorial plane, with the standard RI operator mapping the equatorial-plane image to visibility data. Importantly, the interpolation step must inevitably be performed at a lower-than-optimal resolution on the plane, to meet the high-resolution requirement on the sphere of wide-field imaging while preserving scalability. Therefore, secondly, we design S-R2D2's DNN training loss to jointly learn to correct the interpolation approximations and identify residual image structures on the sphere, ensuring consistency with the spherical ground truth using the adjoint plane-to-sphere interpolator. Finally, we demonstrate through simulations S-R2D2's capability to perform fast and accurate reconstructions of spherical monochromatic intensity images, across high-resolution, high-dynamic-range settings.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01863v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the advent of Vision-Language Models (VLMs), medical artificial intelligence (AI) has experienced significant technological progress and paradigm shifts. This survey provides an extensive review of recent advancements in Medical Vision-Language Models (Med-VLMs), which integrate visual and textual data to enhance healthcare outcomes. We discuss the foundational technology behind Med-VLMs, illustrating how general models are adapted for complex medical tasks, and examine their applications in healthcare. The transformative impact of Med-VLMs on clinical practice, education, and patient care is highlighted, alongside challenges such as data scarcity, narrow task generalization, interpretability issues, and ethical concerns like fairness, accountability, and privacy. These limitations are exacerbated by uneven dataset distribution, computational demands, and regulatory hurdles. Rigorous evaluation methods and robust regulatory frameworks are essential for safe integration into healthcare workflows. Future directions include leveraging large-scale, diverse datasets, improving cross-modal generalization, and enhancing interpretability. Innovations like federated learning, lightweight architectures, and Electronic Health Record (EHR) integration are explored as pathways to democratize access and improve clinical relevance. This review aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of Med-VLMs' strengths and limitations, fostering their ethical and balanced adoption in healthcare.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.01907v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This report introduces ReID-SAM, a novel model developed for the SkiTB Challenge that addresses the complexities of tracking skier appearance. Our approach integrates the SAMURAI tracker with a person re-identification (Re-ID) module and advanced post-processing techniques to enhance accuracy in challenging skiing scenarios. We employ an OSNet-based Re-ID model to minimize identity switches and utilize YOLOv11 with Kalman filtering or STARK-based object detection for precise equipment tracking. When evaluated on the SkiTB dataset, ReID-SAM achieved a state-of-the-art F1-score of 0.870, surpassing existing methods across alpine, ski jumping, and freestyle skiing disciplines. These results demonstrate significant advancements in skier tracking accuracy and provide valuable insights for computer vision applications in winter sports.</description>

      <title>QDCNN: Quantum Deep Learning for Enhancing Safety and Reliability in Autonomous Transportation Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01916v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In transportation cyber-physical systems (CPS), ensuring safety and reliability in real-time decision-making is essential for successfully deploying autonomous vehicles and intelligent transportation networks. However, these systems face significant challenges, such as computational complexity and the ability to handle ambiguous inputs like shadows in complex environments. This paper introduces a Quantum Deep Convolutional Neural Network (QDCNN) designed to enhance the safety and reliability of CPS in transportation by leveraging quantum algorithms. At the core of QDCNN is the UU{\dag} method, which is utilized to improve shadow detection through a propagation algorithm that trains the centroid value with preprocessing and postprocessing operations to classify shadow regions in images accurately. The proposed QDCNN is evaluated on three datasets on normal conditions and one road affected by rain to test its robustness. It outperforms existing methods in terms of computational efficiency, achieving a shadow detection time of just 0.0049352 seconds, faster than classical algorithms like intensity-based thresholding (0.03 seconds), chromaticity-based shadow detection (1.47 seconds), and local binary pattern techniques (2.05 seconds). This remarkable speed, superior accuracy, and noise resilience demonstrate the key factors for safe navigation in autonomous transportation in real-time. This research demonstrates the potential of quantum-enhanced models in addressing critical limitations of classical methods, contributing to more dependable and robust autonomous transportation systems within the CPS framework.</description>

      <title>DarkDeblur: Learning single-shot image deblurring in low-light condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02194v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Single-shot image deblurring in a low-light condition is known to be a profoundly challenging image translation task. This study tackles the limitations of the low-light image deblurring with a learning-based approach and proposes a novel deep network named as DarkDeblurNet. The proposed DarkDeblur- Net comprises a dense-attention block and a contextual gating mechanism in a feature pyramid structure to leverage content awareness. The model additionally incorporates a multi-term objective function to perceive a plausible perceptual image quality while performing image deblurring in the low-light settings. The practicability of the proposed model has been verified by fusing it in numerous computer vision applications. Apart from that, this study introduces a benchmark dataset collected with actual hardware to assess the low-light image deblurring methods in a real-world setup. The experimental results illustrate that the proposed method can outperform the state-of-the-art methods in both synthesized and real-world data for single-shot image deblurring, even in challenging lighting environment.</description>

      <title>Time-Varying Coronary Artery Deformation: A Dynamic Skinning Framework for Surgical Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02218v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Purpose: This study proposes a novel anatomically-driven dynamic modeling framework for coronary arteries using skeletal skinning weights computation, aiming to achieve precise control over vessel deformation while maintaining real-time performance for surgical simulation applications. Methods: We developed a computational framework based on biharmonic energy minimization for skinning weight calculation, incorporating volumetric discretization through tetrahedral mesh generation. The method implements temporal sampling and interpolation for continuous vessel deformation throughout the cardiac cycle, with mechanical constraints and volume conservation enforcement. The framework was validated using clinical datasets from 5 patients, comparing interpolated deformation results against ground truth data obtained from frame-by-frame segmentation across cardiac phases. Results: The proposed framework effectively handled interactive vessel manipulation. Geometric accuracy evaluation showed mean Hausdorff distance of 4.96 +- 1.78 mm and mean surface distance of 1.78 +- 0.75 mm between interpolated meshes and ground truth models. The Branch Completeness Ratio achieved 1.82 +- 0.46, while Branch Continuity Score maintained 0.84 +- 0.06 (scale 0-1) across all datasets. The system demonstrated capability in supporting real-time guidewire-vessel collision detection and contrast medium flow simulation throughout the complete coronary tree structure. Conclusion: Our skinning weight-based methodology enhances model interactivity and applicability while maintaining geometric accuracy. The framework provides a more flexible technical foundation for virtual surgical training systems, demonstrating promising potential for both clinical practice and medical education applications.

      <title>Anomaly detection in non-stationary videos using time-recursive differencing network based prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02234v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Most videos, including those captured through aerial remote sensing, are usually non-stationary in nature having time-varying feature statistics. Although, sophisticated reconstruction and prediction models exist for video anomaly detection, effective handling of non-stationarity has seldom been considered explicitly. In this paper, we propose to perform prediction using a time-recursive differencing network followed by autoregressive moving average estimation for video anomaly detection. The differencing network is employed to effectively handle non-stationarity in video data during the anomaly detection. Focusing on the prediction process, the effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated considering a simple optical flow based video feature, and by generating qualitative and quantitative results on three aerial video datasets and two standard anomaly detection video datasets. EER, AUC and ROC curve based comparison with several existing methods including the state-of-the-art reveal the superiority of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>$\mathbf{\Phi}$-GAN: Physics-Inspired GAN for Generating SAR Images Under Limited Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02242v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Approaches for improving generative adversarial networks (GANs) training under a few samples have been explored for natural images. However, these methods have limited effectiveness for synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images, as they do not account for the unique electromagnetic scattering properties of SAR. To remedy this, we propose a physics-inspired regularization method dubbed $\Phi$-GAN, which incorporates the ideal point scattering center (PSC) model of SAR with two physical consistency losses. The PSC model approximates SAR targets using physical parameters, ensuring that $\Phi$-GAN generates SAR images consistent with real physical properties while preventing discriminator overfitting by focusing on PSC-based decision cues. To embed the PSC model into GANs for end-to-end training, we introduce a physics-inspired neural module capable of estimating the physical parameters of SAR targets efficiently. This module retains the interpretability of the physical model and can be trained with limited data. We propose two physical loss functions: one for the generator, guiding it to produce SAR images with physical parameters consistent with real ones, and one for the discriminator, enhancing its robustness by basing decisions on PSC attributes. We evaluate $\Phi$-GAN across several conditional GAN (cGAN) models, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance in data-scarce scenarios on three SAR image datasets.</description>

      <title>Q&amp;C: When Quantization Meets Cache in Efficient Image Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02508v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantization and cache mechanisms are typically applied individually for efficient Diffusion Transformers (DiTs), each demonstrating notable potential for acceleration. However, the promoting effect of combining the two mechanisms on efficient generation remains under-explored. Through empirical investigation, we find that the combination of quantization and cache mechanisms for DiT is not straightforward, and two key challenges lead to severe catastrophic performance degradation: (i) the sample efficacy of calibration datasets in post-training quantization (PTQ) is significantly eliminated by cache operation; (ii) the combination of the above mechanisms introduces more severe exposure bias within sampling distribution, resulting in amplified error accumulation in the image generation process. In this work, we take advantage of these two acceleration mechanisms and propose a hybrid acceleration method by tackling the above challenges, aiming to further improve the efficiency of DiTs while maintaining excellent generation capability. Concretely, a temporal-aware parallel clustering (TAP) is designed to dynamically improve the sample selection efficacy for the calibration within PTQ for different diffusion steps. A variance compensation (VC) strategy is derived to correct the sampling distribution. It mitigates exposure bias through an adaptive correction factor generation. Extensive experiments have shown that our method has accelerated DiTs by 12.7x while preserving competitive generation capability.

      <title>TS-CGNet: Temporal-Spatial Fusion Meets Centerline-Guided Diffusion for BEV Mapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02578v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bird's Eye View (BEV) perception technology is crucial for autonomous driving, as it generates top-down 2D maps for environment perception, navigation, and decision-making. Nevertheless, the majority of current BEV map generation studies focusing on visual map generation lack depth-aware reasoning capabilities. They exhibit limited efficacy in managing occlusions and handling complex environments, with a notable decline in perceptual performance under adverse weather conditions or low-light scenarios. Therefore, this paper proposes TS-CGNet, which leverages Temporal-Spatial fusion with Centerline-Guided diffusion. This visual framework, grounded in prior knowledge, is designed for integration into any existing network for building BEV maps. Specifically, this framework is decoupled into three parts: Local mapping system involves the initial generation of semantic maps using purely visual information; The Temporal-Spatial Aligner Module (TSAM) integrates historical information into mapping generation by applying transformation matrices; The Centerline-Guided Diffusion Model (CGDM) is a prediction module based on the diffusion model. CGDM incorporates centerline information through spatial-attention mechanisms to enhance semantic segmentation reconstruction. We construct BEV semantic segmentation maps by our methods on the public nuScenes and the robustness benchmarks under various corruptions. Our method improves 1.90%, 1.73%, and 2.87% for perceived ranges of 60x30m, 120x60m, and 240x60m in the task of BEV HD mapping. TS-CGNet attains an improvement of 1.92% for perceived ranges of 100x100m in the task of BEV semantic mapping. Moreover, TS-CGNet achieves an average improvement of 2.92% in detection accuracy under varying weather conditions and sensor interferences in the perception range of 240x60m.

      <title>Unveiling the Potential of Segment Anything Model 2 for RGB-Thermal Semantic Segmentation with Language Guidance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02581v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The perception capability of robotic systems relies on the richness of the dataset. Although Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2), trained on large datasets, demonstrates strong perception potential in perception tasks, its inherent training paradigm prevents it from being suitable for RGB-T tasks. To address these challenges, we propose SHIFNet, a novel SAM2-driven Hybrid Interaction Paradigm that unlocks the potential of SAM2 with linguistic guidance for efficient RGB-Thermal perception. Our framework consists of two key components: (1) Semantic-Aware Cross-modal Fusion (SACF) module that dynamically balances modality contributions through text-guided affinity learning, overcoming SAM2's inherent RGB bias; (2) Heterogeneous Prompting Decoder (HPD) that enhances global semantic information through a semantic enhancement module and then combined with category embeddings to amplify cross-modal semantic consistency. With 32.27M trainable parameters, SHIFNet achieves state-of-the-art segmentation performance on public benchmarks, reaching 89.8% on PST900 and 67.8% on FMB, respectively. The framework facilitates the adaptation of pre-trained large models to RGB-T segmentation tasks, effectively mitigating the high costs associated with data collection while endowing robotic systems with comprehensive perception capabilities.

      <title>Resource-Efficient Affordance Grounding with Complementary Depth and Semantic Prompts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02600v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Affordance refers to the functional properties that an agent perceives and utilizes from its environment, and is key perceptual information required for robots to perform actions. This information is rich and multimodal in nature. Existing multimodal affordance methods face limitations in extracting useful information, mainly due to simple structural designs, basic fusion methods, and large model parameters, making it difficult to meet the performance requirements for practical deployment. To address these issues, this paper proposes the BiT-Align image-depth-text affordance mapping framework. The framework includes a Bypass Prompt Module (BPM) and a Text Feature Guidance (TFG) attention selection mechanism. BPM integrates the auxiliary modality depth image directly as a prompt to the primary modality RGB image, embedding it into the primary modality encoder without introducing additional encoders. This reduces the model's parameter count and effectively improves functional region localization accuracy. The TFG mechanism guides the selection and enhancement of attention heads in the image encoder using textual features, improving the understanding of affordance characteristics. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves significant performance improvements on public AGD20K and HICO-IIF datasets. On the AGD20K dataset, compared with the current state-of-the-art method, we achieve a 6.0% improvement in the KLD metric, while reducing model parameters by 88.8%, demonstrating practical application values.

      <description>arXiv:2503.02725v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The advent of neuralmorphic spike cameras has garnered significant attention for their ability to capture continuous motion with unparalleled temporal resolution.However, this imaging attribute necessitates considerable resources for binary spike data storage and transmission.In light of compression and spike-driven intelligent applications, we present the notion of Spike Coding for Intelligence (SCI), wherein spike sequences are compressed and optimized for both bit-rate and task performance.Drawing inspiration from the mammalian vision system, we propose a dual-pathway architecture for separate processing of spatial semantics and motion information, which is then merged to produce features for compression.A refinement scheme is also introduced to ensure consistency between decoded features and motion vectors.We further propose a temporal regression approach that integrates various motion dynamics, capitalizing on the advancements in warping and deformation simultaneously.Comprehensive experiments demonstrate our scheme achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance for spike compression and analysis.We achieve an average 17.25% BD-rate reduction compared to SOTA codecs and a 4.3% accuracy improvement over SpiReco for spike-based classification, with 88.26% complexity reduction and 42.41% inference time saving on the encoding side.</description>

Abstract: Recent years have seen a tremendous growth in both the capability and popularity of automatic machine analysis of images and video. As a result, a growing need for efficient compression methods optimized for machine vision, rather than human vision, has emerged. To meet this growing demand, several methods have been developed for image and video coding for machines. Unfortunately, while there is a substantial body of knowledge regarding rate-distortion theory for human vision, the same cannot be said of machine analysis. In this paper, we extend the current rate-distortion theory for machines, providing insight into important design considerations of machine-vision codecs. We then utilize this newfound understanding to improve several methods for learnable image coding for machines. Our proposed methods achieve state-of-the-art rate-distortion performance on several computer vision tasks such as classification, instance segmentation, and object detection.</description>

      <title>Explainable AI for Autism Diagnosis: Identifying Critical Brain Regions Using fMRI Data</title>

Abstract: Early diagnosis and intervention for Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) has been shown to significantly improve the quality of life of autistic individuals. However, diagnostics methods for ASD rely on assessments based on clinical presentation that are prone to bias and can be challenging to arrive at an early diagnosis. There is a need for objective biomarkers of ASD which can help improve diagnostic accuracy. Deep learning (DL) has achieved outstanding performance in diagnosing diseases and conditions from medical imaging data. Extensive research has been conducted on creating models that classify ASD using resting-state functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) data. However, existing models lack interpretability. This research aims to improve the accuracy and interpretability of ASD diagnosis by creating a DL model that can not only accurately classify ASD but also provide explainable insights into its working. The dataset used is a preprocessed version of the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE) with 884 samples. Our findings show a model that can accurately classify ASD and highlight critical brain regions differing between ASD and typical controls, with potential implications for early diagnosis and understanding of the neural basis of ASD. These findings are validated by studies in the literature that use different datasets and modalities, confirming that the model actually learned characteristics of ASD and not just the dataset. This study advances the field of explainable AI in medical imaging by providing a robust and interpretable model, thereby contributing to a future with objective and reliable ASD diagnostics.</description>

      <title>Generalized Gaussian Model for Learned Image Compression</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19320v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In learned image compression, probabilistic models play an essential role in characterizing the distribution of latent variables. The Gaussian model with mean and scale parameters has been widely used for its simplicity and effectiveness. Probabilistic models with more parameters, such as the Gaussian mixture models, can fit the distribution of latent variables more precisely, but the corresponding complexity is higher. To balance the compression performance and complexity, we extend the Gaussian model to the generalized Gaussian family for more flexible latent distribution modeling, introducing only one additional shape parameter beta than the Gaussian model. To enhance the performance of the generalized Gaussian model by alleviating the train-test mismatch, we propose improved training methods, including beta-dependent lower bounds for scale parameters and gradient rectification. Our proposed generalized Gaussian model, coupled with the improved training methods, is demonstrated to outperform the Gaussian and Gaussian mixture models on a variety of learned image compression networks.</description>

      <title>MedFuncta: Modality-Agnostic Representations Based on Efficient Neural Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14401v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent research in medical image analysis with deep learning almost exclusively focuses on grid- or voxel-based data representations. We challenge this common choice by introducing MedFuncta, a modality-agnostic continuous data representation based on neural fields. We demonstrate how to scale neural fields from single instances to large datasets by exploiting redundancy in medical signals and by applying an efficient meta-learning approach with a context reduction scheme. We further address the spectral bias in commonly used SIREN activations, by introducing an $\omega_0$-schedule, improving reconstruction quality and convergence speed. We validate our proposed approach on a large variety of medical signals of different dimensions and modalities (1D: ECG; 2D: Chest X-ray, Retinal OCT, Fundus Camera, Dermatoscope, Colon Histopathology, Cell Microscopy; 3D: Brain MRI, Lung CT) and successfully demonstrate that we can solve relevant downstream tasks on these representations. We additionally release a large-scale dataset of &gt; 550k annotated neural fields to promote research in this direction.</description>

      <title>Metric-Guided Conformal Bounds for Probabilistic Image Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15274v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modern deep learning reconstruction algorithms generate impressively realistic scans from sparse inputs, but can often produce significant inaccuracies. This makes it difficult to provide statistically guaranteed claims about the true state of a subject from scans reconstructed by these algorithms. In this study, we propose a framework for computing provably valid prediction bounds on claims derived from probabilistic black-box image reconstruction algorithms. The key insights behind our framework are to represent reconstructed scans with a derived clinical metric of interest, and to calibrate bounds on the ground truth metric with conformal prediction (CP) using a prior calibration dataset. These bounds convey interpretable feedback about the subject's state, and can also be used to retrieve nearest-neighbor reconstructed scans for visual inspection. We demonstrate the utility of this framework on sparse-view computed tomography (CT) for fat mass quantification and radiotherapy planning tasks. Results show that our framework produces bounds with better semantical interpretation than conventional pixel-based bounding approaches. Furthermore, we can flag dangerous outlier reconstructions that look plausible but have statistically unlikely metric values.</description>

      <title>Game-Theoretic Defenses for Robust Conformal Prediction Against Adversarial Attacks in Medical Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04376v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Adversarial attacks pose significant threats to the reliability and safety of deep learning models, especially in critical domains such as medical imaging. This paper introduces a novel framework that integrates conformal prediction with game-theoretic defensive strategies to enhance model robustness against both known and unknown adversarial perturbations. We address three primary research questions: constructing valid and efficient conformal prediction sets under known attacks (RQ1), ensuring coverage under unknown attacks through conservative thresholding (RQ2), and determining optimal defensive strategies within a zero-sum game framework (RQ3). Our methodology involves training specialized defensive models against specific attack types and employing maximum and minimum classifiers to aggregate defenses effectively. Extensive experiments conducted on the MedMNIST datasets, including PathMNIST, OrganAMNIST, and TissueMNIST, demonstrate that our approach maintains high coverage guarantees while minimizing prediction set sizes. The game-theoretic analysis reveals that the optimal defensive strategy often converges to a singular robust model, outperforming uniform and simple strategies across all evaluated datasets. This work advances the state-of-the-art in uncertainty quantification and adversarial robustness, providing a reliable mechanism for deploying deep learning models in adversarial environments.</description>

      <title>SAR-W-MixMAE: SAR Foundation Model Training Using Backscatter Power Weighting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01181v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Foundation model approaches such as masked auto-encoders (MAE) or its variations are now being successfully applied to satellite imagery. Most of the ongoing technical validation of foundation models have been applied to optical images like RGB or multi-spectral images. Due to difficulty in semantic labeling to create datasets and higher noise content with respect to optical images, Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data has not been explored a lot in the field for foundation models. Therefore, in this work as a pre-training approach, we explored masked auto-encoder, specifically MixMAE on Sentinel-1 SAR images and its impact on SAR image classification tasks. Moreover, we proposed to use the physical characteristic of SAR data for applying weighting parameter on the auto-encoder training loss (MSE) to reduce the effect of speckle noise and very high values on the SAR images. Proposed SAR intensity-based weighting of the reconstruction loss demonstrates promising results both on SAR pre-training and downstream tasks specifically on flood detection compared with the baseline model.</description>

      <title>A Multi-Sensor Fusion Approach for Rapid Orthoimage Generation in Large-Scale UAV Mapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01202v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Rapid generation of large-scale orthoimages from Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) has been a long-standing focus of research in the field of aerial mapping. A multi-sensor UAV system, integrating the Global Positioning System (GPS), Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), 4D millimeter-wave radar and camera, can provide an effective solution to this problem. In this paper, we utilize multi-sensor data to overcome the limitations of conventional orthoimage generation methods in terms of temporal performance, system robustness, and geographic reference accuracy. A prior-pose-optimized feature matching method is introduced to enhance matching speed and accuracy, reducing the number of required features and providing precise references for the Structure from Motion (SfM) process. The proposed method exhibits robustness in low-texture scenes like farmlands, where feature matching is difficult. Experiments show that our approach achieves accurate feature matching orthoimage generation in a short time. The proposed drone system effectively aids in farmland detection and management.</description>
