      <title>A Catalog of Stellar and Dust Properties for 500,000 Stars in the Southwest Bar of the Small Magellanic Cloud</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a catalog of individual stellar and dust extinction properties along close to 500,000 sight lines in the southwest bar of the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC). The catalog is based on multiband Hubble Space Telescope photometric data spanning near-ultraviolet to near-infrared wavelengths from the Small Magellanic Cloud Investigation of Dust and Gas Evolution survey (SMIDGE) covering a 100 x 200 pc area. We use the probabilistic technique of the Bayesian Extinction And Stellar Tool (BEAST) to model the spectral energy distributions of individual stars in SMIDGE and include the effects of observational uncertainties in the data. We compare BEAST-derived dust extinction properties with tracers of the interstellar medium, such as the emission from the 12CO (2-1) transition (I(CO)), the dust mass surface density ({\Sigma}dust) from far-IR emission, the H I column density (N(HI)) from the 21cm transition, and the mass fraction of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs; qPAH, derived from IR emission). We find that the dust extinction (A(V )) in the SMIDGE field is strongly correlated with {\Sigma}dust and I(CO), and less so with N(HI) and qPAH, and suggest potential explanations. Our extinction measurements are also sensitive to the presence of the 2175 {\AA} bump in the extinction curve toward UV bright stars. While most do not show evidence for the bump, we identify ~200 lines of sight that are 2175 {\AA} bump candidates. Furthermore, we find distinct structures in the dust extinction-distance distributions that provide insights into the 3D geometry of the SMC.</description>

      <title>VIRAC2: NIR Astrometry and Time Series Photometry for 500M+ Stars from the VVV and VVVX Surveys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06295v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present VIRAC2, a catalogue of positions, proper motions, parallaxes and $Z$, $Y$, $J$, $H$, and $K_s$ near-infrared photometric time series of 545 346 537 unique stars. The catalogue is based on a point spread function fitting reduction of nearly a decade of VISTA VVV and VVVX images, which cover $560~{\rm deg}^2$ of the Southern Galactic plane and bulge. The catalogue is complete at the $&gt;90$ per cent level for $11&lt;K_s~{\rm mag}&lt;16$ sources, but extends to $K_s\approx{}17.5$ mag in most fields. Astrometric performance for $11&lt;K_s~{\rm mag}&lt;14$ sources is typically $\approx{}0.37~{\rm mas~yr}^{-1}$ per dimension for proper motion, and $1~{\rm mas}$ for parallax. At $K_s=16$ the equivalent values are around $1.5~{\rm mas~yr}^{-1}$ and $5~{\rm mas}$. These uncertainties are validated against Gaia DR3 and Hubble Space Telescope astrometry. The complete catalogues are available via the ESO archive. We perform an initial search of the catalogue for nearby ultracool dwarf candidates. In total we find 26 new sources whose parallaxes place them within 50 parsecs of the Sun. Among them we find two high-confidence T dwarfs and a number of other sources that appear to lie close to the L/T transition.</description>

      <title>Improved SED-Fitting Assumptions Result in Inside-Out Quenching at $z\sim0.5$ and Quenching at All Radii Simultaneously at $z\sim1$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06297v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many studies conclude that galaxies quench from the inside-out by examining profiles of specific star-formation rate (sSFR). These are usually measured by fitting spectral energy distributions (SEDs) assuming a fixed dust law and uniform priors on all parameters. Here, we examine the effects of more physically motivated priors: a flexible dust law, an exponential prior on the dust attenuation $A_V$, and Gaussian priors that favor extended star-formation histories. This results in model colors that better trace observations. We then perform radial SED fits to multi-band flux profiles measured from Hubble images for 1,440 galaxies at $0.4&lt;z&lt;1.5$ of stellar masses $10^{10}-10^{11.5}\ M_{\odot}$ using both the traditional and the more physically motivated assumptions. This results in SFR and $A_V$ profiles that agree with measurements from spectroscopy and $A_V$ profiles that behave correctly as a function of inclination. Since green valley galaxies at $z\sim1.3$ are expected to evolve into quiescent galaxies at $z\sim0.9$, we compare their sSFR profiles using the more physically motivated assumptions. Their slopes are similar at all masses ($0.06 - 0.08~\textrm{dex}~\textrm{kpc}^{-1}$), and the normalizations for the quiescent galaxies are lower. Therefore, the sSFR profiles decline with time as quenching occurs at all radii simultaneously. We compare profiles of green valley galaxies at $z\sim0.9$ and quiescent galaxies at $z\sim0.5$. The former are shallower at all masses by $\sim0.1~\textrm{dex}~\textrm{kpc}^{-1}$. The sSFR profiles steepen with time as galaxies quench from the inside-out. In summary, galaxies at $z\sim1$ quench at all radii simultaneously while galaxies at $z\sim0.7$ quench from the inside-out.</description>

      <title>WISDOM Project -- XXII. A 5% precision CO-dynamical supermassive black hole mass measurement in the galaxy NGC 383</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06303v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a measurement of the supermassive black hole (SMBH) mass of the nearby lenticular galaxy NGC 383, based on Atacama Large Millimeter/sub-millimeter Array (ALMA) observations of the $^{12}$CO(2-1) emission line with an angular resolution of $0.''050\times0.''024$ ($\approx16\times8$ pc$^2$). These observations spatially resolve the nuclear molecular gas disc down to $\approx41,300$ Schwarzschild radii and the SMBH sphere of influence by a factor of $\approx24$ radially, better than any other SMBH mass measurement using molecular gas to date. The high resolution enables us to probe material with a maximum circular velocity of $\approx1040$ km/s, even higher than those of the highest-resolution SMBH mass measurements using megamasers. We detect a clear Keplerian increase (from the outside in) of the line-of-sight rotation velocities, a slight offset between the gas disc kinematic (i.e. the position of the SMBH) and morphological (i.e. the centre of the molecular gas emission) centres, an asymmetry of the innermost rotation velocity peaks and evidence for a mild position angle warp and/or non-circular motions within the central $\approx0.''3$. By forward modelling the mass distribution and ALMA data cube, we infer a SMBH mass of $(3.58\pm0.19)\times10^9$ M$_\odot$ ($1\sigma$ confidence interval), more precise ($5\%$) but consistent within $\approx1.4\sigma$ with the previous measurement using lower-resolution molecular gas data. Our measurement emphasises the importance of high spatial resolution observations for precise SMBH mass determinations.</description>

      <title>Morphological Classification of Galaxies Through Structural and Star Formation Parameters Using Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06340v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We employ the XGBoost machine learning (ML) method for the morphological classification of galaxies into two (early-type, late-type) and five (E, S0--S0a, Sa--Sb, Sbc--Scd, Sd--Irr) classes, using a combination of non-parametric ($C,\,A,\,S,\,A_S,\,\mathrm{Gini},\,M_{20},\,c_{5090}$), parametric (S\'ersic index, $n$), geometric (axial ratio, $BA$), global colour ($g-i,\,u-r,\,u-i$), colour gradient ($\Delta (g - i)$), and asymmetry gradient ($\Delta A_{9050}$) information, all estimated for a local galaxy sample ($z&lt;0.15$) compiled from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) imaging data. We train the XGBoost model and evaluate its performance through multiple standard metrics. Our findings reveal better performance when utilizing all fourteen parameters, achieving accuracies of 88\% and 65\% for the two-class and five-class classification tasks, respectively. In addition, we investigate a hierarchical classification approach for the five-class scenario, combining three XGBoost classifiers. We observe comparable performance to the ``direct'' five-class classification, with discrepancies of only up to 3\%. Using SHAP (an advanced interpretation tool), we analyse how galaxy parameters impact the model's classifications, providing valuable insights into the influence of these features on classification outcomes. Finally, we compare our results with previous studies and find them consistently aligned.</description>

      <title>The Missing Link of Sulfur Chemistry in TMC-1: The Detection of c-C3H2S from the GOTHAM Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06343v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the spectroscopic characterization of cyclopropenethione (c-C3H2S) in the laboratory and detect it in space using the Green Bank Telescope (GBT) Observations of TMC-1: Hunting Aromatic Molecules (GOTHAM) survey. The detection of this molecule - the missing link in understanding the C3H2S isomeric family in TMC-1 - completes the detection of all 3 low-energy isomers of C3H2S as both CH2CCS and HCCCHS have been previously detected in this source. The total column density of this molecule (N_T of 5.72+2.65/-1.61x10^10 cm^-2 at an excitation temperature of 4.7+1.3/-1.1 K) is smaller than both CH2CCS and HCCCHS and follows nicely the relative dipole principle (RDP), a kinetic rule-of-thumb for predicting isomer abundances which suggests that, all other chemistry among a family of isomers being the same, the member with the smallest dipole should be the most abundant. The RDP now holds for the astronomical abundance ratios of both the S-bearing and O-bearing counterparts observed in TMC-1; however, CH2CCO continues to elude detection in any astronomical source.</description>

      <title>Probing Signals of Self-Interacting Dark Matter Core Collapse in \textsc{Hi}-Rich Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06413v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze rotation curves of five \textsc{Hi}-rich galaxies recently discovered with MeerKAT. These galaxies exhibit sharply rising rotation curves, while their baryonic components are not dynamically dominant, suggesting that their dark matter halos have high inner densities. When fitting the standard Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) halo model, four galaxies require extremely high halo concentrations, exceeding the cosmological median by $5\sigma$. In contrast, self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) halos in the core-collapse phase naturally account for the high densities in these galaxies. For halos with masses around $10^{11}~{\rm M_\odot}$, those in cosmic filaments exhibit concentrations consistent with the cosmological average, while halos in cosmic nodes show relatively higher concentrations that align with the SIDM fits but remain insufficient for the NFW fits. Our analysis indicates that these \textsc{Hi}-rich galaxies may have formed in cosmic nodes of dark matter with significant self-interactions.</description>

      <title>New look at old friends: EVN imaging of prominent radio-loud active galactic nuclei with extremely large radio-optical positional offsets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06513v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When comparing modern fundamental reference frames in the radio (International Celestial Reference Frame) and optical (Gaia), a couple of bright radio reference sources appear to have very large radio-optical offsets, from tens up to hundreds of milliarcseconds (mas). The amount of these positional misalignments exceeds the uncertainty of each individual technique by at least an order of magnitude. In most cases, complex and extended radio structure and its time variability, and thus the difficulty in pinpointing the true location of the central engine, is responsible for the large apparent offsets. Sometimes distant parts of the radio structure are not properly detected due to a lack of shorter interferometer baselines. For our 5-GHz very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) experiment using antennas of the European VLBI Network and the enhanced Multi Element Radio Linked Interferometer Network, we selected 10 bright radio-loud active galactic nuclei with extremely large radio-optical offsets. Sensitive imaging involving a wide range of projected baseline lengths, as well as phase-referencing to nearby sources shed light on the possible causes of positional inconsistencies. Here we show results for 3 selected sources from this project.</description>

      <title>FOGGIE X: Characterizing the Small-Scale Structure of the CGM and its Imprint on Observables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the main unknowns in galaxy evolution is how gas flows into and out of galaxies in the circumgalactic medium (CGM). Studies observing the CGM in absorption using multiple or extended background objects suggest a high degree of variation on relatively small ($\lesssim 1$ kpc) spatial scales. Similarly, high-resolution simulations generally exhibit small-scale substructure in the gas around galaxies. We examine the small-scale structure of the $z = 1$ CGM using simulations from the FOGGIE (Figuring Out Gas &amp; Galaxies in Enzo) project. We select gaseous substructures ("clumps") by their local overdensity and investigate their physical properties, including temperature, metallicity, and kinematics with respect to the galaxy and the nearby surroundings. FOGGIE resolves clumps down to sphericalized radii $R \sim 0.25$ kpc at $z = 1$. The distribution of clumps peaks at $\sim 10^5$ $\rm M_{\odot}$ and $10^{4}$ K, consistent with relatively condensed, cool gas with a slight preference for inflow-like velocities. Many clumps show internal temperature and density variations, and thus internally varying ionization levels for key diagnostic ions such as HI, MgII, and OVI. The average metallicity in clumps is about a factor 1.5--2$\times$ lower in metallicity than nearby gas, suggesting that the metals are not well-mixed between structured and diffuse CGM, which may have implications for observational metallicity estimations of dense CGM clouds. We estimate the survivability of CGM clumps and find that structures larger than 0.5 kpc are generally long-lived. Finally, we qualitatively compare the simulated cloud properties to Milky Way high-velocity clouds.</description>

      <title>Tracking Outflow using Line-Locking (TOLL). II. Large Line-Locking Web identified in Quasar J151352+085555</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06734v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quasar outflows often consist of two clouds with velocity separations matching the doublet spacings of common UV resonance transitions, a phenomenon known as line-locking, which is commonly observed in quasar spectra. Multiple clouds can be locked together through multi-ion doublets, forming 'line-locking web'. In the second paper of the TOLL project, we present discovery of one of the largest 'line-locking web' known to date from the VLT/UVES spectra of QSO J151352+085555. We identify 12 associated narrow absorption line systems through the C IV, N V, Si IV, O VI, and multiple Lyman lines (Ly${\alpha}$ to Ly${\epsilon}$), and find 10 out of the 12 absorbers are line-locked together by comparing velocity separations between different absorption systems. By conducting photoionization modeling with CLOUDY, we measure the total hydrogen column densities, metallicities, and ionization parameters of these absorbers, which suggests the absorbers likely have sub-solar metallicities. A preliminary statistical analysis demonstrates the shadowed clouds tend to have similar ionization states comparing to the shadowing ones. Identification of one of the largest line-locking webs implies that radiative acceleration plays an important role in sorting out cloud velocities in quasar outflows, and highlights the need for more sophisticated theoretical models to explain its formation and evolution.</description>

      <title>A comparative study of galaxy evolution with four different active galactic nucleus torus models and two different host geometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06870v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Estimating physical quantities such as the star formation rate, stellar mass and active galactic nucleus (AGN) fraction of galaxies is a key step in understanding galaxy formation and evolution. In order to estimate the uncertainties in the predicted values for these quantities, in this paper we explore the impact of adopting four different AGN torus models in fitting the multi-wavelength spectral energy distributions (SED) of galaxies. We also explore the impact of adopting two different geometries for the host, a spheroidal geometry, more appropriate for late-stage mergers, and a disc geometry, more appropriate for galaxies forming stars with secular processes. We use optical to submillimeter photometry from the Herschel Extragalactic Legacy Project (HELP) and utilize a Markov chain Monte Carlo SED-fitting code. We use exclusively radiative transfer models for the AGN torus as well as for the starburst and host galaxy. We concentrate on a sample of 200 galaxies at z~2, selected in the ELAIS-N1 field. All galaxies have a detection at 250um which ensures the presence of a starburst. We find that the stellar mass and star formation rate of the galaxies can be robustly estimated by the SED fitting but the AGN fraction depends very much on the adopted torus model. We also find that the vast majority of the galaxies in our sample are better fitted by a spheroidal geometry and lie above the main sequence. Our method predicts systematically higher SFR and lower stellar mass than the popular energy balance method CIGALE.</description>

      <title>A Deep Search for a Strong Diffuse Interstellar Band in the Circumgalactic Medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the absorption signals of a strong diffuse interstellar band, DIB$\lambda4430$, in the circumgalactic medium (CGM) traced by MgII absorption lines. To this end, we make use of approximately 60,000 MgII absorption line spectra within $0.4&lt;z&lt;1.0$ compiled from the Sloan Digital Sky Surveys and obtain composite spectra with uncertainties for absorption line measurements being a few m$\r{A}$. By using MgII absorption strength and dust reddening relation from the literature, we measure the DIB$\lambda4430$ absorption strength as a function of $\rm E(B-V)$ in the CGM, and compare the Milky Way DIB$\lambda4430$ - $\rm E(B-V)$ relation extrapolated down to the CGM $\rm E(B-V)$ region. Our results show no detectable signals of DIB$\lambda4430$ across the entire $\rm E(B-V)$ range in the CGM traced by MgII absorption lines. This lack of detection of DIB$\lambda4430$ in the CGM is inconsistent with the Milky Way signals by $\sim 5 \, \sigma$, indicating that the factors associated with different environments affect the abundance of the DIB$\lambda4430$ carrier.</description>

      <title>On the origin of compressive turbulence in protoclumps in high redshift disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The giant, star forming clumps in gas-rich, high redshift disks are commonly assumed to form due to gravitational instabilities, in which protoclumps have a Toomre-$Q$ parameter less than unity. However, some cosmological simulations show that clumps can form in regions where $Q\gg1$. In these simulations, there is an excess of compressive modes of turbulence that lead to gravitational collapse of regions that were not supposed to gravitationally collapse, according to linear theory. In contrast, sites of clump formation in isolated simulations do not show this excess, hinting that the origin may be external. We explore two external mechanisms that can induce compressive modes of disk turbulence in protoclumps, namely, compressive tides exerted by the cosmological environment and the direct driving by inflowing streams. We correlate the local strength of compressive tides and the amount of fresh stream material with protoclump regions in zoom-in cosmological simulations. The local strength of compressive tides is derived from the tidal tensor. The local strength of incoming streams is derived from the fractional presence of the stream compared to the average. We find that the tidal field in protoclumps tends to be over-compressive while random patches in the disk show diverging tides. In particular, in $25\%$ of the protoclumps, the tidal field is fully compressive, while no random patch resides in regions of fully compressive tides. In addition, protoclumps tend to reside in regions where the fraction of incoming stream mass is 2-10 times larger than the average at the same galactocentric radius. Both compressive tides and inflowing streams are correlated with the protoclumps and can thus serve as the drivers of excessive compressive turbulence that can initiate clump formation. This constitutes a new, non-linear mode of violent disk instabilities in high-$z$ galaxies.</description>

      <title>The diverse physical origins of stars in the dynamically hot bulge: CALIFA vs. IllustrisTNG</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compare the internal stellar structures of central galaxies in the TNG50 and TNG100 simulations and field galaxies in the CALIFA survey. The luminosity fractions of the dynamically cold, warm, and hot components in both TNG50 and TNG100 galaxies exhibit general consistency with those observed in CALIFA galaxies. For example, they all exhibit a minimum luminosity fraction of the dynamically hot component in galaxies with intermediate stellar masses, and the morphology of each orbital component in the TNG50 and TNG100 galaxies closely resembles that found in the CALIFA galaxies. We therefore use the simulations to quantify the physical origins of the different components, focusing on the dynamically hot component in TNG50. We identify three primary regimes and thus physical processes: (1) in low mass galaxies that have not experienced major mergers, stars are born with a wide range of circularity distributions and have remained relatively unchanged until the present day. Consequently, hot stars in such galaxies at redshift 0 are predominantly born hot. (2) In higher mass galaxies lacking major mergers, most stars are initially born cold but are subsequently heated through secular evolution. (3) In galaxies across the entire mass range, mergers, if they occurred, significantly increased the hot orbital fraction. As a result, the dynamically hot bulge within $R_e$ of present-day galaxies does not indicate their past merger histories; instead, the hot stars in the outer regions are mostly heated or accreted by mergers, thus indicating galaxy merger history. The massive galaxies are initially born with cold, rotationally supported structures, consistent with recent observations from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) regarding high-redshift galaxies.</description>

      <title>Comparison of Global HI and H$\alpha$ Line Profiles in MaNGA Galaxy Pairs with FAST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present case studies comparing the global HI and H$\alpha$ emission line profiles of six galaxy pairs. The six pairs are selected to have different nuclear activities, with two hosting an active galactic nucleus, and in different merging stages (two of each from pre-merging, merging, and post-merger stages). We observe their global HI spectra with the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST), achieving a noise level of about 0.5 mJy. Five out of the six pair systems have secure detections of HI emissions (signal-to-noise ratio &gt; 10). The HI fraction and star formation efficiency of the six pairs do not deviate from isolated galaxies. For the HI line profiles, common unique asymmetry is observed, indicating disturbances on the atomic gas from the galaxy interaction. The global H$\alpha$ spectra of the merger systems are constructed from the optical integral field spectroscopic observations, by integrating the flux in corresponding line-of-sight velocity bins. The H$\alpha$ spectra tend to show multiple components in the pre-merger phase, and single component line profiles in the post-merger systems, while all HI spectra show single component line profiles regardless of merger stages. The HI and H$\alpha$ spectra show offsets in the central velocities, which appear to decrease from &gt;100 km/s in the pre-merger pair to &lt;10 km/s in post-merger pairs. This trend is consistent with the scenario that, despite the significantly different distribution and kinematics of the atomic and ionized gases, the merging process may contribute to the mixing and eventually align various gas contents.</description>

      <title>Optical and NIR spectral analysis of a post-starburst galaxy at $z \sim 2$ : probing the stellar population properties, gas content, and contribution of TP-AGB stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the spectral analysis of J-138717, a post-starburst galaxy observed at $z=1.8845$ with JWST, for which we estimate a stellar mass M$_* = 3.5\pm0.2\times10^{10}$M$_\odot$ and velocity dispersion $\sigma_* = 198\pm10$ km/s. From the fits of the NIRspec low-resolution prism and medium resolution grating spectra, we estimate an age of $\sim0.9$ Gyr, a metallicity of $\sim -0.3$ dex, and a dust attenuation A$_{\rm V} \sim 0.7$ mag. From the H$\alpha$ and [OII] emission lines we derive a star-formation rate (SFR)$\sim 0.1$ M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$, corresponding to a specific SFR$\sim 4 \times 10^{-12}$ yr$^{-1}$. By reconstructing its SFH, we find that this galaxy formed most of its stellar mass quickly ($0.4-0.8$ Gyr) and then rapidly quenched about 0.4 Gyr lookback time. The analysis of the emission lines ([OII], [NeIII], [OIII], H$\alpha$, and [NII]) indicates a low-level residual star formation or a weak AGN as the ionization source. Further, the lack of evidence for ongoing outflows in both the absorption and emission lines tracing the neutral and ionized gas argues against the presence of strong AGN feedback. Thanks to the high quality of the data, we carried out a comprehensive analysis of the NIR spectral indices. This is the first time NIR spectral indices have been investigated at such a high redshift. We find that the observed CO and CN indices are generally weak and in better agreement with models with a lower contribution from thermally pulsating (TP-)AGB stars, indicating that either TP-AGB stars do not contribute significantly to the spectrum of J-138717 or the prescriptions in the models for these evolved phases should be substantially improved. In general, we find that all models struggle to reproduce the NIR indices consistently, pointing to the importance of improving state-of-the-art stellar population models in the NIR, especially at young ages.</description>

      <title>Galaxy mass-size segregation in the cosmic web from the CAVITY parent sample</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07345v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The mass-size relation is a fundamental galaxy scaling law closely tied to galaxy formation and evolution. Using added-value products of the Calar Alto Void Integral-field Treasury surveY (CAVITY) and SDSS DR16 images, we examine the effect of large-scale environments on the stellar mass-size relation. We analyse the Petrosian R50 and R90 radii of approximately 140000 galaxies in voids, filaments, and clusters, with a mass range of $10^{8.5} - 10^{11} M_{\odot}$. We explore the relation in terms of galaxy morphology and star formation history, parametrised by T50, T70, and T90. We find that early-type void galaxies are, on average, 10-20% smaller than their counterparts in denser environments, regardless of their mass assembly history. Moreover, the mass-size relation for massive early-type void galaxies has a shallower slope compared to those in denser regions. In contrast, early-type galaxies in filaments, and clusters show a more uniform mass-size relation. Late-type cluster galaxies with stellar masses $log(M_{\star} / M_{\odot}) = 9 - 10.5$ are smaller and more concentrated than their counterparts in lower-density environments, such as filaments, and voids. We conclude that large-scale environments influence the mass-size relation. Early-type galaxies appear to grow most of their mass during the initial formation phase. Subsequent size growth in voids is less significant, likely due to slower evolution, reduced minor merger activity, fewer accretion events, or a combination. The flatter slope for massive void galaxies indicates a lower rate of minor accretion, a trend also observed in late-type void galaxies with $\approx 10^{10.5} M_{\odot}$, where minor mergers contribute to size growth. Conversely, late-type quenched cluster galaxies are smaller due to environmental interactions, with early infallers being most affected.</description>

      <title>MeerKAT HI imaging of the jellyfish galaxy ESO 137-001</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07418v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present MeerKAT HI observations of ESO 137-001, a quintessential jellyfish galaxy with long multi-phase tails formed due to the interaction with the intra-cluster medium of its host galaxy cluster, ACO 3627. Our observations reveal the presence of HI in both the disc and outer regions of the galaxy for the first time, with a total HI mass of ($3.5 \pm\ 0.4) \times 10^{8}$ M$_{\odot}$. ESO 137-001 is at an advanced stage of gas stripping; it is extremely HI deficient and seems to have lost 90% of its initial HI mass; about 2/3 of the surviving HI is found at a larger radius than expected for a normal HI disc and forms a $\sim40$ kpc tail coincident with the tail detected at other wavelengths. Only $\sim10$% of the surviving HI is still found within the stellar disc, consistent with the expectation of an outside-in truncation due to ram pressure. Similarly to other jellyfish galaxies, ESO137-001 has a high star formation rate for the low amount of HI detected. We measure an HI depletion time of 0.29 Gyr. However, when taking into account the total gas (HI + H$_2$) content, the depletion time is consistent with typical values measured in nearby spiral galaxies. This suggests that ESO 137-001 is at its current stage of ram pressure interaction characterised by an efficient HI stripping, rather than an enhanced conversion of HI to H$_2$, which was recently observed in some other jellyfish galaxies.</description>

      <title>A flux-limited sample of dusty star-forming galaxies from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope: physical properties and the case for multiplicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the modeling of the millimeter and far-infrared spectral energy distributions of 71 dusty star-forming galaxies (DSFGs) selected by the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) with a lower flux-density limit of 8 mJy at 220 GHz (1.4 mm). All sources were cross-identified with Herschel surveys at 500, 350, and 250 {\mu}m, and nineteen of our sources were observed at with the Submillimeter Array. A probabilistic cataloging algorithm, PCAT, favors multiple unresolved flux components in the Herschel data for the majority of ACT-selected DSFGs. We compare the derived physical properties of the DSFGs obtained from modeling the flux densities with those from similar studies of both lensed and unlensed DSFG populations. We find the median, 16th and 84th percentiles for the following model parameters: redshift zphot=3.3(+0.7)(-0.6), apparent size {\mu}d=5.2(+0.9)(-2.4) kpc, apparent dust mass log10({\mu}Md/Msun)=9.14(+0.12)(-0.04) and cutoff temperature Tc=35.6(+4.8)(-1.6) K, and the corresponding apparent far-infrared luminosity log10({\mu}LIR/Lsun)=13.6(+0.2)(-0.3), where {\mu} is lensing magnification. While many of the properties broadly agree with those of samples of primarily lensed DSFGs, we exercise caution in interpreting them. ACT's lower flux limit, the PCAT decomposition, and the higher-resolution SMA observations all suggest that some fraction of these DSFGs are likely to be unlensed and possibly multiples. The SMA data indicate that at least fourteen out of nineteen sources are such, either via "missing" flux in comparison to the ensemble model or detection of additional sources in the fields. Additional high-resolution follow-up and targeted redshift observations are needed to better understand this flux-limited sample of DSFGs.</description>

      <title>Do tides play a role in the determination of the pre-stellar core mass function?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent studies have examined the role of tides in the star formation process. They suggest, notably, that the tides determine the characteristic mass of the stellar initial mass function (IMF) by preventing the collapse of density fluctuations that would become gravitationally unstable in the absence of the tidal field generated by a neighboring central mass. However, most of these studies consider the tidal collapse condition as a 1D process or use a scalar virial condition and thus neglect the anisotropy of the tidal field and its compressive effects. In the present paper, we consider a turbulence-induced density perturbation formed in the envelope of a central core. This perturbation is subject to a tidal field generated by the central core. We study its evolution taking dynamical effects and the anisotropy of the tides into account. Based on the general tensorial virial equations, we determine a new collapse condition that takes these mechanisms into account. We identify two regimes: (i) a weak tidal regime in which the dynamics of the perturbation is only slightly modified by the action of the tides and (ii) a strong tidal regime in which the density threshold for collapse can potentially be increased due to the combined effects of the tides and the rotational support generated by the tidal synchronization of the perturbation with the orbital motion. In the case of a turbulence-induced density perturbation formed in the vicinity of a first Larson core, we show that the density threshold above which the perturbation collapses is increased only for low-mass perturbations (less than 2.7 solar mass) and only by at most a factor of 1.5. We conclude that tides likely do not play a major role in the process of star formation or in the determination of the characteristic mass of the IMF. We propose an alternative explanation for the observed value of the characteristic mass of the IMF.</description>

      <title>Metal-THINGS: The Milky Way twin candidate NGC 3521</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07443v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The 3D spectrophotometry measurements of the galaxy NGC~3521, a structural Milky Way analogue (sMWA), were carried out within the Metal-THINGS project. We found that the oxygen abundance in the inner part of NGC~3521 is at a nearly constant level and the O/H gradient is negative at larger radii. The change in the N/H with radius is similar to that for O/H. The radial distributions of the O/H, the gas mass fraction, and the effective oxygen yield in NGC~3521 are compared to that of the Milky Way (MW), with the aim of examining the similarity in their chemical evolutions. The O/H of two HII regions closest to the centre of the MW (at a radii of 4-5 kpc) are close to the binned O/H in NGC~3521 at the same galactocentric distances. The O/H in the outer part of the MW are lower than those in the outer part of NGC~3521. The gas mass fraction in the outer part of the MW is higher than in NGC~3521. The obtained values of the effective oxygen yield, Yeff, in NGC~3521 are close to the empirical estimation of the oxygen yield, Yo. This suggests that mass exchange with the surroundings plays little to no role in the chemical evolution of NGC3521. The values of the Yeff in the MW were determined using two variants of the distribution of the gas mass surface density. The values of the Yeff in the MW obtained with the first distribution are also close to Yo. The Yeff in the MW obtained with the second distribution are below Yo at radii between 6 and 10.4 kpc. This suggests that the mass exchange with the surroundings can play a significant role in the chemical evolution of this part of the MW. To draw a solid conclusion about the role of mass exchange with the surroundings in the chemical evolution of the MW it is essential to determine which of these distributions provides a more adequate description of the gas distribution in the MW.</description>

      <title>Deriving the abundance distribution of HII galaxies using sulphur as tracer: Exploring the high-metallicity end</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07510v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The main objective of this work is to derive the distribution of the the metal content of HII galaxies using sulphur as an abundance tracer. This increases the metallicity range that can safely be reached. We selected a sample of emission-line galaxies that we extracted from the SDSS-DR16. These objects have a redshift of z less than 0.04 so that the [SIII] 9069 A emission line and H beta equivalent widths that are higher than 10 A in emission were included, and they are compact in appearance. We used the so-called direct method for objects with the electron-temperature-sensitive [SIII] 6312 A emission line, and an empirical method based on the S23 parameter. The last provided an abundance calibration that monotonically increased up to at least the solar value, and can be applied based on the spectral range from 6000 to 9500 A alone. We show that the bias that is introduced when the [OIII] 4363 A line is required restricts the sample to objects with an [OIII] electron temperature higher than 10,000K, and their temperature distribution is then rather narrow. For objects with determinations of te [SIII], the distribution is flatter and wider, which fits a more realistic scenario better. For the objects in the sample that required the detection of the [OIII] 4363 A line and [SIII] 6312 A, the distribution abundances as traced directly by oxygen and sulphur appear to be very similar to each other. However, when the restriction for weak temperature-sensitive lines is relaxed, the abundance distribution is wider . In summary, the abundance distributions traced by sulphur can reach reliable abundances up to the solar value at least and provide a more complete picture of the metallicity distribution of HII galaxies.</description>

      <title>Compact Size, High $\Sigma$SFR: Defining Morphological Features of Ly$\alpha$-Emitters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The mechanisms of Ly$\alpha$ photon escape are key to understanding galaxy evolution and cosmic reionization, yet remain poorly understood. We investigate the UV-continuum sizes of 23 Ly$\alpha$ emitters (LAEs) at Cosmic Noon ($1.7 &lt; z &lt; 3.3$), extending previous size analyses to include fainter galaxies ($M_{\rm UV} \simeq -14$) using gravitational lensing. Our results show that these LAEs are unusually small for their luminosity, with a mean effective radius ($r_{\rm eff}$) of $170 \pm 140$ pc. They follow a distinct size-luminosity relation, with an intercept at $M_{\rm UV} = -21$ approximately three times smaller than typical star-forming galaxies (SFGs) at similar redshifts. This relation, however, is consistent with that of low-redshift Green Pea galaxies, suggesting that LAEs maintain compact sizes across redshifts. We also find that Ly$\alpha$ equivalent width (EW(Ly$\alpha$)) increases with decreasing $r_{\rm eff}$, confirming previous findings. The small sizes of LAEs lead to high star formation surface densities ($\Sigma$SFR $= 1-600 M_{\sun} \ \rm{yr}^{-1} \ \rm{kpc^{-2}}$), clearly separating them from typical SFGs in the $\Sigma$SFR vs. $r_{\rm eff}$ space. Given that high $\Sigma$SFR is linked to strong galactic outflows, our findings imply that compact morphology plays a key role in Ly$\alpha$ escape, likely facilitated by outflows that clear under-dense channels in the ISM. Thus, these results demonstrate that compact size and high $\Sigma$SFR can help identify Ly$\alpha$-emitters.</description>

      <title>LensNet: Enhancing Real-time Microlensing Event Discovery with Recurrent Neural Networks in the Korea Microlensing Telescope Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06293v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traditional microlensing event vetting methods require highly trained human experts, and the process is both complex and time-consuming. This reliance on manual inspection often leads to inefficiencies and constrains the ability to scale for widespread exoplanet detection, ultimately hindering discovery rates. To address the limits of traditional microlensing event vetting, we have developed LensNet, a machine learning pipeline specifically designed to distinguish legitimate microlensing events from false positives caused by instrumental artifacts, such as pixel bleed trails and diffraction spikes. Our system operates in conjunction with a preliminary algorithm that detects increasing trends in flux. These flagged instances are then passed to LensNet for further classification, allowing for timely alerts and follow-up observations. Tailored for the multi-observatory setup of the Korea Microlensing Telescope Network (KMTNet) and trained on a rich dataset of manually classified events, LensNet is optimized for early detection and warning of microlensing occurrences, enabling astronomers to organize follow-up observations promptly. The internal model of the pipeline employs a multi-branch Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) architecture that evaluates time-series flux data with contextual information, including sky background, the full width at half maximum of the target star, flux errors, PSF quality flags, and air mass for each observation. We demonstrate a classification accuracy above 87.5%, and anticipate further improvements as we expand our training set and continue to refine the algorithm.</description>

      <title>Continuum Reverberation in Active Galactic Nuclei Disks Only With Sufficient X-ray Luminosity and Low Albedo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06304v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Disk continuum reverberation mapping is one of the primary ways we learn about active galactic nuclei (AGN) accretion disks. Reverberation mapping assumes that time-varying X-rays incident on the accretion disk drive variability in UV-optical light curves emitted by AGN disks, and uses lags between X-ray and UV-optical variability on the light-crossing timescale to measure the radial temperature profile and extent of AGN disks. However, recent reverberation mapping campaigns have revealed oddities in some sources such as weakly correlated X-ray and UV light curves, longer than anticipated lags, and evidence of intrinsic variability from disk fluctuations. To understand how X-ray reverberation works with realistic accretion disk structures, we perform 3D multi-frequency radiation magnetohydrodynamic simulations of X-ray reprocessing by the UV-emitting region of an AGN disk using sophisticated opacity models that include line opacities for both the X-ray and UV radiation. We find there are two important factors that determine whether X-ray irradiation and UV emission will be well-correlated, the ratio of X-ray to UV luminosity and significant absorption. When these factors are met, the reprocessing of X-rays into UV is nearly instantaneous, as is often assumed, although linear reprocessing models are insufficient to fully capture X-ray reprocessing in our simulations. Nevertheless, we can still easily recover mock lags in our light curves using software that assumes linear reprocessing. Finally, the X-rays in our simulation heat the disk, increasing temperatures by a factor of 2--5 in the optically thin region, which could help explain the discrepancy between measured and anticipated lags.</description>

      <title>Oscillations of Solitonic Galactic Cores in Ultralight Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06891v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A remarkable feature of dark matter consisting of ultralight bosonic particles is the emergence of superfluid Bose-Einstein condensate structures on galactic scales. We investigate the oscillations of the solitonic dark matter structure in the central galactic region by numerically solving the Bogoliubov-de Gennes problem, accounting for perturbations in the gravitational potential and local self-interactions. Our findings reveal that the central solitonic core, formed by the balance of gravitational attraction, quantum pressure, and repulsive interactions, exhibits significant oscillatory behaviour. These oscillations, characterized by distinct eigenmodes, provide insights into the dynamical properties of solitonic dark matter structures and their observational implications and contributions to galactic structure formation and evolution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.06973v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As gravitational wave detections increase the number of observed compact binaries (consisting of neutron stars or blacks), we begin to probe the different conditions producing these binaries. Most studies of compact remnant formation focus either on stellar collapse from the evolution of field binary stars in gas-free environments or the formation of stars in clusters where dynamical interactions capture the compact objects, forming binaries. But a third scenario exists. In this paper, we study the fate of massive stars formed, accrete gas, and evolve in the dense disks surrounding supermassive black holes. We calculate the explosions produced and compact objects formed by the collapse of these massive stars. Nucleosynthetic yields may provide an ideal, directly observable, diagnostic of the formation and fate of these stars in active galactic nuclei. We present a first study of the explosive yields from these stars, comparing these yields with the observed nucleosynthetic signatures in the disks around supermassive stars with quasars. We show that, even though these stars tend to form black holes, their rapid rotation leads to disks that can eject a considerable amount of iron during the collapse of the star. The nucleosynthetic yields from these stars can produce constraints on the number of systems formed in this manner, but further work is needed to exploit variations from the initial models presented in this paper.</description>

      <title>Can Dark Stars account for the star formation efficiency excess at very high redshifts?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07119v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has recently conducted observations of massive galaxies at high redshifts, revealing a notable anomaly in their star formation efficiency (SFE). Motivated by the recent identification of three $\sim 10^{6}M_\odot$ dark star candidates, we investigate whether dark stars can be the origin of the SFE excess. It turns out that the excess can be reproduced by a group of dark stars with $M \gtrsim 10^{3}\, \rm M_{\odot}$, because of their domination in generating primary UV radiation in high-redshift galaxies. The genesis of these dark stars is attributed to the capture of Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs) within a mass range of tens of GeV to a few TeV. However, if the top-heavy initial mass function of dark stars holds up to $\sim 10^{5}M_\odot$, the relic black holes stemming from their collapse would be too abundant to be consistent with the current observations of Massive Compact Halo Objects (MACHOs). We thus suggest that just a small fraction of SFE excess may be contributed by the very massive dark stars and the majority likely originated from other reasons such as the Population III stars in view of their rather similar UV radiation efficiencies.</description>

      <title>A differentiable binary microlensing model using adaptive contour integration method</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07268v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present microlux, which is a Jax-based code that can compute the binary microlensing light curve and its derivatives both efficiently and accurately. The key feature of microlux is the implementation of a modified version of the adaptive sampling algorithm that was originally proposed by V. Bozza to account for the finite-source effect most efficiently. The efficiency and accuracy of microlux have been verified across the relevant parameter space for binary microlensing. As a differentiable code, microlux makes it possible to apply gradient-based algorithms to the search and posterior estimation of the microlensing modeling. As an example, we use microlux to model a real microlensing event and infer the model posterior via both Fisher information matrix and Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, neither of which would have been possible without the access to accurate model gradients.</description>

      <title>First mid-infrared detection and modeling of a flare from Sgr A*</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07415v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The time-variable emission from the accretion flow of Sgr A*, the supermassive black hole at the Galactic Center, has long been examined in the radio-to-mm, near-infrared (NIR), and X-ray regimes of the electromagnetic spectrum. However, until now, sensitivity and angular resolution have been insufficient in the crucial mid-infrared (MIR) regime. The MIRI instrument on JWST has changed that, and we report the first MIR detection of Sgr A*. The detection was during a flare that lasted about 40 minutes, a duration similar to NIR and X-ray flares, and the source's spectral index steepened as the flare ended. The steepening suggests synchrotron cooling is an important process for Sgr A*'s variability and implies magnetic field strengths $\sim$40--70 Gauss in the emission zone. Observations at $1.3~\mathrm{mm}$ with the Submillimeter Array revealed a counterpart flare lagging the MIR flare by $\approx$10 minutes. The observations can be self-consistently explained as synchrotron radiation from a single population of gradually cooling high-energy electrons accelerated through (a combination of) magnetic reconnection and/or magnetized turbulence.</description>

      <title>The GRACE project: Hard X-ray giant radio galaxies and their duty cycle</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07416v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The advent of new generation radio telescopes is opening new possibilities on the classification and study of extragalactic high-energy sources, specially the underrepresented ones like radio galaxies. Among these, Giant Radio Galaxies (GRG, larger than 0.7 Mpc) are among the most extreme manifestations of the accretion/ejection processes on supermassive black holes. Our recent studies have shown that GRG can be up to four times more abundant in hard X-ray selected (i.e. from INTEGRAL/IBIS and Swift/BAT at $&gt;$20 keV) samples and, most interestingly, the majority of them present signs of restarted radio activity. This makes them the ideal test-bed to study the so far unknown duty cycle of jets in active galactic nuclei. Open questions in the field include: How and when jets are restarted? How jets evolve and what's their dynamic? What is the jet's duty cycle and what triggers them? Our group has recently collected a wealth of radio data on these high-energy selected GRGs, allowing us to study their jet formation and evolution from the pc to kpc scales, across different activity epochs. In particular, thanks to our EVN large programme, we were able to probe the new radio phase in the core of these giants. Furthermore, we are devoting an effort to the exploitation of new radio surveys data for the discovery of new classes of counterparts of Fermi/LAT catalogues. In particular, we are unveiling the hidden population of radio galaxies associated with gamma-ray sources.</description>

      <title>Deep Needlet: A CNN based full sky component separation method in Needlet space</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07469v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the most important steps of Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) data analysis is component separation to recover CMB map by combining the observations contaminated by foregrounds. Needlet Internal Linear Combination (NILC) is one of the successful methods that applies the minimum variance estimation technique to a set of needlet-filtered frequency maps to recover CMB. This work develops a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) model to recover CMB map from needlet-filtered frequency maps over the full sky. The model allows to perform component separation with a multi-resolution representation of spherical data localized on both pixel space and harmonic space with rotational invariant features of CMB. The network model is trained on realistic simulations at Planck frequencies. We demonstrate the network performance for simulations that exhibit different foreground complexities. The model achieves precise recovery of the CMB temperature map and the TT power spectrum exhibits excellent agreement with true value up to $\ell\sim$1100. The residual leakage to the recovered CMB is reduced significantly compared to the CMB map recovered using NILC pipeline. Once validated on the simulations, the network is applied to Planck PR3 data to recover CMB. The recovered CMB map shows excellent agreement with CMB maps of Planck legacy products using NILC and SMICA pipelines. This work demonstrates a powerful component separation method to clean spherical signal data from multi-resolution wavelet-filtered maps.</description>

      <title>A reference framework for extremely metal-poor OB star studies: calibrations for stellar parameters and intrinsic colours</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07569v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide the first reference framework for extremely metal-poor (XMP) OB-type stars. We parsed a grid of 0.10 $Z_{\odot}$ FASTWIND models, covering the parameter space of O stars and early-B supergiants, through contemporary spectral classification criteria to deliver a calibration of key stellar properties as a function of spectral type, and tabulated colours for the most common photometric systems. By using an extensive grid of models, we account for the different combinations of stellar parameters that result in the same spectral morphology and provide a range of parameters and colours compatible with each spectral subtype and luminosity class. We supply updated photometric criteria to optimize candidate selection of OB stars in XMP environments. We find 0.10 $Z_{\odot}$ OB stars are 1-6 kK hotter and produce higher ionizing fluxes than their Galactic analogues. In addition, we find a bimodal distribution of the HeII-ionizing flux with spectral type; because of its known dependence on effective temperature and the wind, $\log~q_{HeII}$ for individual XMP late-O type stars could be underestimated by up to 4 orders of magnitude by other calibrations, some of them used by population synthesis codes. Finally, we used our calibrated colours to map the extinction of the 0.10 $Z_{\odot}$ galaxy Sextans A finding that reddening is non-negligible and uneven.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02399v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent studies based on JWST data reveals that the observed number density of massive galaxies in the early Universe appears to be higher than model predictions, which may pose a serious problem to the \lcdm ~cosmology. A major limitation in many previous studies is the large uncertainty in estimating $\mstar$ due to the lack of constraints in the rest-frame near-infrared part of the spectral energy distribution, which is critical to determining $\mstar$ accurately. Here we use multiwavelength data from a large {\it JWST}/MIRI survey in the PRIMER program to perform a systematic analysis of massive galaxies at $z \sim 3-8$, leveraging photometric constraints at rest-frame $\gtrsim 1 \mu$m. We find a significant reduction in the number and mass densities of massive galaxies at $z &gt; 5$ compared to earlier results that did not use the MIRI photometry. Within the standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmology, our results require a moderate increase in the baryon-to-star conversion efficiency ($\epsilon$) towards higher redshifts and higher $\mstar$. For the most massive galaxies at $z\sim 8$, the required $\epsilon$ is $\sim 0.3$, in comparison to $\epsilon \sim 0.14$ for typical low-redshift galaxies. Our findings are consistent with models assuming suppressed stellar feedback due to the high gas density and the associated short free-fall time expected for massive halos at high redshifts.</description>

      <title>Superbubbles as the source of dynamical friction: gas migration, stellar and dark matter contributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18086v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: [Abridged] The gas distribution in galaxies is smooth on large scales, but is usually time-dependent and inhomogeneous on smaller scales. The time-dependence originates from processes such as cloud formation, their collisions, and supernovae (SNe) explosions, which also create inhomogeneities. The inhomogeneities in the matter distribution give rise to variations in the local galactic gravitational potential, which can contribute to dynamically coupling the gas disc to the stellar and the dark matter (DM) components of the galaxy. Specifically, multiple SNe occurring in young stellar clusters give rise to superbubbles (SBs), which modify the local acceleration field and alter the energy and momentum of stars or DM particles traversing them, in broad analogy to the dynamical friction caused by a massive object. Our aim is to quantify how the acceleration field from SBs causes dynamical friction and contributes to the secular evolution of galaxies. In order to assess this, we constructed the time-dependent density modifications to the gas distribution that mimics a SB. By evaluating the acceleration field from these density modifications, we were able to see how the momentum or angular momentum of the gas hosting the SBs changes when stars pass through the SB. Combining the effects of all the stars and SBs, we constructed an empirical approximation formula for the momentum loss in homogeneous and isotropic cases. We find that the rate at which the gas disc loses its specific angular momentum via the above process is up to 4% per Gyr, which translates to under one-half of its original value over the lifetime of the disc. For comparison, the mass transfer rate from SBs is about one order of magnitude less than from gas turbulence, and hence the SB contribution should be included to account for the gas migration rate more accurately than 10%.</description>

Abstract: This study involves the use of friend-of-friend method on the volume limited samples constructed from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 12 (SDSS DR12) to classify the galaxies into isolated and non-isolated environments hence to investigate the influence of the galaxy environment on the main sequence of star formation, and colour bimodality. We classified the galaxies into the luminous volume-limited sample with $ -22.5\leq M_r \leq -20.5$ (mag), and the faint volume-limited sample with $-20.5 \leq M_r \leq -18.5$ (mag). Using the WHAN diagnostic diagram we assignedthe samples into star-forming, strong AGN, weak AGN, and retired galaxies based on their environment (isolated and non-isolated). The friend-of-friend method was successful in producing consistent results regarding the stellar mass-SFR and stellar mass-colour known relations. Apart from that the decrease in the slope of the main sequence for star-forming galaxies by $0.04$ dex and intercept by $0.39$ dex for the luminous sample was observed while the faint sample a decrease of $0.08$ dex in slope and $0.74$ dex in intercept was observed between isolated and non-isolated galaxies. A significant difference on the number of galaxies between isolated and non-isolated galaxies within, above and below the main sequence by $7.47\%$, $28.51\%$, $14.59\%$ for the luminous sample while for the faint sample by $16.15\%$, $32.60\%$, $35.23\%$ on average, respectively are observed. A significant difference in the number of galaxies in the blue cloud, green valley, and red sequence by $10.30\%$, $20.61\%$, $5.74\%$ for luminous sample while for faint sample by $28.46\%$, $41.36\%$, $8.95\%$ on average, respectively was observed. The study concludes that the galaxy environment influences the shaping and positioning of galaxies along the star formation main sequence and colour bimodality.</description>

      <title>Systematics in ETG Mass Profile Modelling: Strong Lensing &amp; Stellar Dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02297v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Strong gravitational lensing and stellar dynamics are independent and powerful methods to probe the total gravitational potential of galaxies, and thus, their total mass profile. However, inherent degeneracies in the individual models makes it difficult to obtain a full understanding of the distribution of baryons and dark matter (DM), although such degeneracies might be broken by the combination of these two tracers, leading to more reliable measurements of the mass distribution of the lens galaxy. We use mock data from IllustrisTNG50 to compare how dynamical-only, lens-only, and joint modelling can constrain the mass distribution of early-type galaxies (ETGs). The joint model consistently outperforms the other models, achivieng a $2\%$ accuracy in recovering the total mass within $2.5R_\text{eff}$. The Einstein radius is robustly recovered for both lens-only and joint models, with the first showing a median fractional error of $-5\%$ and the latter a fractional error consistent with zero. The stellar mass-to-light ratio and total mass density slope are well recovered by all models. In particular, the dynamical-only model achieves an accuracy of $1\%$ for the stellar mass-to-light ratio, while the accuracy of the mass density slope is typically of the order of $5\%$ for all models. However, all models struggle to constrain integrated quantities involving DM and the halo parameters. Nevertheless, imposing more restrictive assumptions on the DM halo, such as fixing the scale radius, could alleviate some of the issues. Finally, we verify that the number of kinematical constraints ($15, 35, 55$ bins) on the kinematical map does not impact the models outcomes.</description>

      <title>Improved particle spray algorithm for modeling globular cluster streams</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01496v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stellar streams that emerge from globular clusters (GCs) are thin stellar structures spread along the orbits of progenitor clusters. Numerical modeling of these streams is essential for understanding their interaction with the host galaxy's mass distribution. Traditional methods are either computationally expensive or oversimplified, motivating us to develop a fast and accurate approach using a particle spray algorithm. By conducting a series of N-body simulations of GCs orbiting a host galaxy, we find that the position and velocity distributions of newly-escaped stream particles are consistent across various GC masses and orbital parameters. Based on these distributions, we develop a new algorithm that avoids computing the detailed internal cluster dynamics by directly drawing tracer particles from these distributions. This algorithm correctly reproduces the action space distribution of stream particles and achieves a 10% accuracy in stream morphology and velocities compared to N-body simulations. To facilitate broader use, we have implemented this algorithm in galactic dynamics codes agama, gala, galax, and galpy.</description>

      <title>The ones that got away: chemical tagging of globular cluster-origin stars with Gaia BP/RP spectra</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.00197v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Globular clusters (GCs) are sites of extremely efficient star formation, and recent studies suggest they significantly contributed to the early Milky Way's stellar mass build-up. Although their role has since diminished, GCs' impact on the Galaxy's initial evolution can be traced today by identifying their most chemically unique stars--those with anomalous nitrogen and aluminum overabundances and oxygen depletion. While they are a perfect tracer of clusters, be it intact or fully dissolved, these high-[N/O], high-[Al/Fe] GC-origin stars are extremely rare within the current Galaxy. To address the scarcity of these unusual, precious former GC members, we train a neural network (NN) to identify high-[N/O], high-[Al/Fe] stars using low-resolution Gaia BP/RP spectra. Our NN achieves a classification accuracy of approximately $\approx99\%$ and a false positive rate of around $\approx7\%$, identifying 878 new candidates in the Galactic field. We validate our results with several physically-motivated sanity checks, showing, for example, that the incidence of selected stars in Galactic GCs is significantly higher than in the field. Moreover, we find that most of our GC-origin candidates reside in the inner Galaxy, having likely formed in the proto-Milky Way, consistent with previous research. The fraction of GC candidates in the field drops at a metallicity of [Fe/H]$\approx-1$, approximately coinciding with the completion of spin-up, i.e. the formation of the Galactic stellar disk.</description>

      <title>The Host Galaxy (If Any) of the Little Red Dots</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04446v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the host galaxy properties of eight little red dots (LRDs) selected from the JWST UNCOVER survey, applying a new technique ({\tt\string GalfitS}) to simultaneously fit the morphology and spectral energy distribution using multi-band NIRCam images covering $\sim 1-4\,\mu {\rm m}$. We detect the host galaxy in only one LRD, MSAID38108 at $z = 4.96$, which has a stellar mass of $\log (M_*/M_{\odot}) = 8.66^{+0.24}_{-0.23}$, an effective radius $R_e=0.66^{+0.08}_{-0.05}$ kpc, and a S\'ersic index $n=0.71^{+0.07}_{-0.08}$. No host emission centered on the central point source is found in the other seven LRDs. We derive stringent upper limits for the stellar mass of a hypothetical host galaxy by conducting realistic mock simulations that place high-redshift galaxy images under the LRDs. Based on the black hole masses estimated from the broad H$\alpha$ emission line, the derived stellar mass limits are at least a factor of 10 lower than expected from the $z \approx 0$ scaling relation between black hole mass and host galaxy stellar mass. Intriguingly, four of the LRDs (50\% of the sample) show extended, off-centered emission, which is particularly prominent in the bluer bands. The asymmetric emission of two sources can be modeled as stellar emission, but the nature of the other two is unclear.</description>

      <title>First Detection of Radio Emission from the Intermediate Mass Black Hole in POX 52: Deep Multi-Band Observations with ATCA and VLA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03316v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the first multi-band centimeter detection of POX 52, a nearby dwarf galaxy believed to habor a robust intermediate mass black hole (IMBH). We conducted the deep observations using the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA), spanning frequencies from 4.5 to 10 GHz, as well as the sensitive observations from the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) operating in its most extended A-configuration at S band (2--4 GHz) and C band (4--8 GHz). In the ATCA observations, the source shows a compact morphology, with only one direction marginally resolved. The higher resolution of the VLA allowed us to slightly resolve the source, fitting it well with a two-dimensional Gaussian model. The detected radio emission confirms the presence of Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN) activity, indicating either a low-power jet or AGN-driven winds/outflows. Our dual-epoch observations with ATCA and VLA, together with previous non-detection flux density upper limits, reveal radio emission variability spanning two decades. In addition, we find that POX 52 aligns well with the low-mass extension of the fundamental plane for high-accretion, radio-quiet massive AGNs.</description>

      <title>The ALMA-ATOMS survey: Vibrationally excited HC$_3$N lines in hot cores</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12546v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Interstellar molecules are excellent tools for studying the physical and chemical environments of massive star-forming regions. In particular, vibrationally excited HC$_3$N (HC$_3$N*) lines are the key tracers for probing hot cores environments. We present the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) 3 mm observations of HC$_3$N* lines in 60 hot cores, aiming to investigate how physical conditions affect the excitation of HC$_3$N* transitions. We have used the XCLASS for line identification. Under the assumption of local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE), we derived the rotation temperature and column density of HC$_3$N* transitions in hot cores. Additionally, we calculated the H$_2$ column density and number density, along with the abundance of HC$_3$N* relative to H$_2$, to enable a comparison of the physical properties of hot cores with different numbers of HC$_3$N* states. We have detected HC$_3$N* lines in 52 hot cores, in which 29 cores showing more than one vibrationally excited state. Hot cores with higher gas temperatures have more detections of these vibrationally excited lines. The excitation of HC$_3$N* requires dense environments, with its spatial distribution influenced by the presence of UC Hii regions. The observed column density of HC$_3$N* contributes to the number of HC$_3$N* states in hot core environments. After analyzing the various factors influencing HC$_3$N* excitation in hot cores, we conclude that the excitation of HC$_3$N* is mainly driven by mid-IR pumping, while collisional excitation is ineffective.</description>

      <title>Numerical viscosity and resistivity in MHD turbulence simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.10350v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate magnetohydrodynamical (MHD) turbulence simulations require understanding numerical dissipation. We quantify numerical viscosity and resistivity in subsonic (M=0.1) and supersonic (M=10) turbulence regimes. The hydrodynamic (Re) and magnetic Reynolds numbers (Rm) on the turbulence driving scale l_turb in a cubic domain of side length L with N^3 resolution elements are well-described by Re=[2(N/N_Re)(l_turb/L)]^p_Re and Rm=[2(N/N_Rm)(l_turb/L)]^p_Rm. We provide two sets of fit values of (N_Re,p_Re,N_Rm,p_Rm): one with p_Re &amp; p_Rm fixed at their theoretical values, and the other one allowing all 4 parameters to vary. The sets for M=0.1 are (1.57_{-0.12}^{+0.10},4/3,1.55_{-0.14}^{+0.45},4/3) and (0.83_{-0.08}^{+0.09},1.20_{-0.02}^{+0.02},4.19_{-4.05}^{+2.95},1.60_{-0.33}^{+0.18}), respectively. For M=10, they are (3.55_{-0.56}^{+0.78},3/2,1.03_{-0.11}^{+0.12},3/2) and (10.46_{-0.85}^{+0.96},1.90_{-0.04}^{+0.04},0.44_{-0.23}^{+0.61},1.32_{-0.09}^{+0.17}). The resulting magnetic Prandtl numbers (Pm=Rm/Re) are consistent with constant values of 1.0_{-0.2}^{+0.3} for M=0.1, and 6.2_{-4.8}^{+5.6} for M=10. These apply when the magnetic energy (E_mag) is &lt;10% of the kinetic energy (E_kin). When E_mag/E_kin~0.1-1, Rm is reduced by a factor~3 (increase in N_Rm by a factor~2) for M=0.1, while Rm for M=10 and Re (for any M) remain largely unaffected. We compare our Re-N relation with 14 other simulations from the literature, employing various numerical methods (with &amp; without Riemann solvers, different reconstruction schemes &amp; orders, and smoothed particle hydrodynamics), and find agreement within a factor of 3. Additionally, we compare these results to target Re and Rm values from simulations with explicit dissipation. These comparisons and our relations help users determine the Re and Rm achievable at a given N, ensuring physical dissipation dominates over numerical dissipation.</description>

      <title>Low-mass Runaways from the Orion Nebula Cluster -- Kinematic Age Constraints on Star Cluster Formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.12258v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In their early, formative stages star clusters can undergo rapid dynamical evolution leading to strong gravitational interactions and ejection of "runaway" stars at high velocities. While O/B runaway stars have been well studied, lower-mass runaways are so far very poorly characterised, even though they are expected to be much more common. We carried out spectroscopic observations with MAG2-MIKE to follow-up 27 high priority candidate runaways consistent with having been ejected from the Orion Nebula Cluster (ONC) &gt; 2.5 Myr ago, based on Gaia astrometry. We derive spectroscopic youth indicators (Li &amp; H${\alpha}$) and radial velocities, enabling detection of bona fide runaway stars via signatures of youth and 3D traceback. We successfully confirmed 11 of the candidates as low-mass Young Stellar Objects (YSOs) on the basis of our spectroscopic criteria and derived radial velocities (RVs) with which we performed 3D traceback analysis. Three of these confirmed YSOs have kinematic ejection ages &gt; 4 Myr, with the oldest being 4.7 Myr. Assuming that these stars indeed formed in the ONC and were then ejected, this yields an estimate for the overall formation time of the ONC to be at least ${\sim}$ 5 Myr, i.e., about 10 free-fall times, and with a mean star formation efficiency per free-fall time of ${\bar{\epsilon}_{ff}} {\lesssim}$ 0.05. These results favor a scenario of slow, quasi-equilibrium star cluster formation, regulated by magnetic fields and/or protostellar outflow feedback.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06314v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the effect of a dark matter caustic passing through the Solar System. We find, confirming a previous result, that the Sun tracks the caustic surface for some time. We integrate numerically the equations of motion of the Sun and a comet for a large number of initial conditions and of caustic passage properties. We calculate the probability for the comet to escape the Solar System and the probability for it to fall within 50 A.U. of the Sun, given the initial semimajor axis and eccentricity of its orbit. We find that the average probability for a comet to fall within 50 A.U. of the Sun is of order $3 \times 10^{-4}$ and that comets which are initially at a distance larger than about $10^5$ A.U. have a probability of order one to be ejected from the Solar System.</description>

      <title>A Brisk Estimator for the Angular Multipoles (BEAM) of the redshift space bispectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14513v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The anisotropy of the redshift space bispectrum depends upon the orientation of the triangles formed by three $\vec{k}$ modes with respect to the line of sight. For a triangle of fixed size ($k_1$) and shape ($\mu,t$), this orientation dependence can be quantified in terms of angular multipoles $B_\ell^m(k_1,\mu,t)$ which contain a wealth of cosmological information. We propose a fast and efficient FFT-based estimator that computes the bispectrum multipole moments $B_\ell^m$ of a 3D cosmological field for all possible $\ell$ and $m$ (including $m\neq 0$). The time required by the estimator to compute all multipoles from a gridded data cube of volume $N_g^3$ scales as $\sim \mathcal{O}(N_g^4)$ in contrast to the direct computation technique which requires time $\sim \mathcal{O}(N_g^6)$. Here, we demonstrate the formalism and validate the estimator using a simulated non-Gaussian field for which the analytical expressions for all the bispectrum multipoles are known. The estimated results are found to be in good agreement with the analytical predictions for all $16$ non-zero multipoles (up to $\ell= 6, m=6$). We expect the $m \neq 0$ bispectrum multipoles to significantly enhance the information available from galaxy redshift surveys and future redshifted 21-cm observations.</description>

      <title>Early Grain Growth in the Young Protostellar Disk HH 212 Supported by Dust Self-Scattering Modeling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00305v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Grain growth in disks around young stars plays a crucial role in the formation of planets. Early grain growth has been suggested in the HH 212 protostellar disk by previous polarization observations. To confirm it and to determine the grain size, we analyze high-resolution multi-band observations of the disk obtained with Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) in Bands 9 (0.4 mm), 7 (0.9 mm), 6 (1.3 mm), 3 (3 mm) as well as with Very Large Array (VLA) in Band Ka (9 mm) and present new VLA data in Bands Q (7 mm), K (1.3 cm), and X (3 cm). We adopt a parameterized flared disk model to fit the continuum maps of the disk in these bands and derive the opacities, albedos, and opacity spectral index $\mathrm{\beta}$ of the dust in the disk, taking into account the dust scattering ignored in the previous work modeling the multi-band data of this source. For the VLA bands, we only include the Band Q data in our modeling to avoid free-free emission contamination. The obtained opacities, albedos, and opacity spectral index $\beta$ (with a value of $\sim$ 1.2) suggest that the upper limit of maximum grain size in the disk be $\sim$ 130 $\mu$m, consistent with that implied in the previous polarization observations in Band 7, supporting the grain growth in this disk. The values of the absorption opacities further highlight the need for a new dust composition model for Class 0/I disks.</description>

Abstract: Considering radio-interferometric observations, we present a fast and efficient estimator to compute the binned angular bispectrum (ABS) from gridded visibility data. The estimator makes use of Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) techniques to compute the bispectrum covering all possible triangle shapes and sizes. Here, we present the formalism of the estimator and validate it using simulated visibility data for the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) observations at $\nu=154.25$ MHz. We find that our estimator is able to faithfully recover the ABS of the simulated sky signal with $\approx 10\%-15 \%$ accuracy for a wide variety of triangle shapes and sizes across the range of angular multipoles $46 \le \ell \le 1320$. In future work, we plan to apply this to actual data and also generalize it to estimate the three-dimensional redshifted 21-cm bispectrum.</description>
