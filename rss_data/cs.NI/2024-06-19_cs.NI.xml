      <title>Never Gonna Give You Up: Exploring Deprecated NULL Ciphers in Commercial VoWiFi Deployments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In today's cellular network evolutions, such as 4G and 5G, the IMS (IP Multimedia Subsystem) serves as a crucial component in managing voice calls and handling short messages. Besides accessing the IMS over the traditional radio layer, many operators use Voice over Wi-Fi (VoWiFi) allowing customers to dial into their core network over the public Internet using an (insecure) Wi-Fi connection.
  To protect against malicious actors on the WiFi or Internet domain, the traffic is sent over a series of IPsec tunnels, ensuring confidentiality and integrity. Similar to other encrypted protocols (e.g. TLS), the client and server use a handshake protocol (i.e., IKEv2) to communicate their supported security configurations and to agree upon the used parameters (e.g., keys or an encryption algorithm) for the ongoing session. This however opens the door for security vulnerabilities introduced by misconfiguration.
  We want to analyze security configurations within commercial VoWiFi deployments, both on the client and server side, spotting deprecated configurations that undermine communication security.</description>

      <title>Towards Deep Application-Network Integration: Architectures, Progress and Opportunities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12556v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rise of a new generation of applications (e.g., virtual and augmented reality, artificial intelligence, etc) demanding stringent performance requirements, the need for networking solutions and architectures that can enable a higher Quality of Experience (QoE) is becoming increasingly important.
  While jointly optimizing application and network may increase the applications' QoE and simultaneously improve the utilization of network resources, such a paradigm has had limited success in real production networks. However, with the combination of revolutionary trends in (1) compute processing demands, (2) networking capabilities, and (3) sustainable business models, it is high time the community explores the full potential of deeper integration between application and network.
  In this paper, recent trends observed over the past few years are systematically reviewed. These include the paradigm shift in modern communication services towards computing-driven applications, such as on-site AI training, advances in programmable network technologies like Software Defined Networking (SDN), and new business models incentivizing collaboration and cooperation between parties. Following this, successful scenarios that benefit from various forms of deeper network-application integration are reported, highlighting their considerable potential. A unified framework is then introduced, providing an overview of possible architecture paradigms for network-application integration and bringing awareness to existing abstractions, mechanisms, tools, and their potential combinations. The paper concludes with a discussion of several remaining challenges in building practical network-application integrated systems.</description>

      <title>Flow Optimization at Inter-Datacenter Networks for Application Run-time Acceleration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12567v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present-day, distributed applications are commonly spread across multiple datacenters, reaching out to edge and fog computing locations. The transition away from single datacenter hosting is driven by capacity constraints in datacenters and the adoption of hybrid deployment strategies, combining on-premise and public cloud facilities. However, the performance of such applications is often limited by extended Flow Completion Times (FCT) for short flows due to queuing behind bursts of packets from concurrent long flows. To address this challenge, we propose a solution to prioritize short flows over long flows in the Software-Defined Wide-Area Network (SD-WAN) interconnecting the distributed computing platforms. Our solution utilizes eBPF to segregate short and long flows, transmitting them over separate tunnels with the same properties. By effectively mitigating queuing delays, we consistently achieve a 1.5 times reduction in FCT for short flows, resulting in improved application response times. The proposed solution works with encrypted traffic and is application-agnostic, making it deployable in diverse distributed environments without modifying the applications themselves. Our testbed evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach in accelerating the run-time of distributed applications, providing valuable insights for optimizing multi-datacenter and edge deployments.</description>

      <title>Count-Min sketches for Telemetry: analysis of performance in P4 implementations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12586v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Monitoring streams of packets at 100~Gb/s and beyond requires using compact and efficient hashing-techniques like HyperLogLog (HLL) or Count-Min Sketch (CMS). In this work, we evaluate the uses and applications of Count-Min Sketch for Metro Networks employing P4-based packet-optical nodes. We provide dimensioning rules for CMS at 100~Gb/s and 400~Gb/s and evaluate its performance in a real implementation testbed.</description>

      <title>On optimizing Inband Telemetry systems for accurate latency-based service deployments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The power of Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence algorithms based on collected datasets, along with the programmability and flexibility provided by Software Defined Networking can provide the building blocks for constructing the so-called Zero-Touch Network and Service Management systems. However, the fuel towards this goal relies on the availability of sufficient and good-quality data collected from measurements and telemetry. This article provides a telemetry methodology to collect accurate latency measurements, as a first step toward building intelligent control planes that make correct decisions based on precise information.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement-Learning based routing for packet-optical networks with hybrid telemetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article provides a methodology and open-source implementation of Reinforcement Learning algorithms for finding optimal routes in a packet-optical network scenario. The algorithm uses measurements provided by the physical layer (pre-FEC bit error rate and propagation delay) and the link layer (link load) to configure a set of latency-based rewards and penalties based on such measurements. Then, the algorithm executes Q-learning based on this set of rewards for finding the optimal routing strategies. It is further shown that the algorithm dynamically adapts to changing network conditions by re-calculating optimal policies upon either link load changes or link degradation as measured by pre-FEC BER.</description>

      <title>Exploiting and Securing ML Solutions in Near-RT RIC: A Perspective of an xApp</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12299v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Open Radio Access Networks (O-RAN) are emerging as a disruptive technology, revolutionising traditional mobile network architecture and deployments in the current 5G and the upcoming 6G era. Disaggregation of network architecture, inherent support for AI/ML workflows, cloud-native principles, scalability, and interoperability make O-RAN attractive to network providers for beyond-5G and 6G deployments. Notably, the ability to deploy custom applications, including Machine Learning (ML) solutions as xApps or rApps on the RAN Intelligent Controllers (RICs), has immense potential for network function and resource optimisation. However, the openness, nascent standards, and distributed architecture of O-RAN and RICs introduce numerous vulnerabilities exploitable through multiple attack vectors, which have not yet been fully explored. To address this gap and ensure robust systems before large-scale deployments, this work analyses the security of ML-based applications deployed on the RIC platform. We focus on potential attacks, defence mechanisms, and pave the way for future research towards a more robust RIC platform.</description>

      <title>Security and Privacy of 6G Federated Learning-enabled Dynamic Spectrum Sharing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12330v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spectrum sharing is increasingly vital in 6G wireless communication, facilitating dynamic access to unused spectrum holes. Recently, there has been a significant shift towards employing machine learning (ML) techniques for sensing spectrum holes. In this context, federated learning (FL)-enabled spectrum sensing technology has garnered wide attention, allowing for the construction of an aggregated ML model without disclosing the private spectrum sensing information of wireless user devices. However, the integrity of collaborative training and the privacy of spectrum information from local users have remained largely unexplored. This article first examines the latest developments in FL-enabled spectrum sharing for prospective 6G scenarios. It then identifies practical attack vectors in 6G to illustrate potential AI-powered security and privacy threats in these contexts. Finally, the study outlines future directions, including practical defense challenges and guidelines.</description>

      <title>A Near-Optimal Category Information Sampling in RFID Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10347v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In many RFID-enabled applications, objects are classified into different categories, and the information associated with each object's category (called category information) is written into the attached tag, allowing the reader to access it later. The category information sampling in such RFID systems, which is to randomly choose (sample) a few tags from each category and collect their category information, is fundamental for providing real-time monitoring and analysis in RFID. However, to the best of our knowledge, two technical challenges, i.e., how to guarantee a minimized execution time and reduce collection failure caused by missing tags, remain unsolved for this problem. In this paper, we address these two limitations by considering how to use the shortest possible time to sample a different number of random tags from each category and collect their category information sequentially in small batches. In particular, we first obtain a lower bound on the execution time of any protocol that can solve this problem. Then, we present a near-OPTimal Category information sampling protocol (OPT-C) that solves the problem with an execution time close to the lower bound. Finally, extensive simulation results demonstrate the superiority of OPT-C over existing protocols, while real-world experiments validate the practicality of OPT-C.</description>

      <title>Architecture and protocols for all-photonic quantum repeaters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.03748v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The all-photonic quantum repeater scheme, utilizing a type of graph state called the repeater graph state (RGS), promises resilience to photon losses and operational errors, offering a fast Bell pair generation rate limited only by the RGS creation time (rather than enforced round-trip waits). While existing research has predominantly focused on RGS generation and secret key sharing rate analysis, there is a need to extend investigations to encompass broader applications, such as distributed computation and teleportation, the main tasks envisioned for the Quantum Internet. Here we propose a new emitter-photonic qubit building block and an RGS protocol that addresses several key considerations: end node involvement in connection establishment, decoding of logical qubits within the RGS, and computing the Pauli frame corrections at each participating node to ensure the desired correct end-to-end Bell pair state. Our proposed building block significantly reduces the total number of emissive quantum memories required for end nodes and seamlessly integrates all-photonic and memory-based repeaters under the same communication protocol. We also present an algorithm for decoding logical measurement results, employing graphical reasoning based on graph state manipulation rules.</description>

      <title>Make Your Home Safe: Time-aware Unsupervised User Behavior Anomaly Detection in Smart Homes via Loss-guided Mask</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10928v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Smart homes, powered by the Internet of Things, offer great convenience but also pose security concerns due to abnormal behaviors, such as improper operations of users and potential attacks from malicious attackers. Several behavior modeling methods have been proposed to identify abnormal behaviors and mitigate potential risks. However, their performance often falls short because they do not effectively learn less frequent behaviors, consider temporal context, or account for the impact of noise in human behaviors. In this paper, we propose SmartGuard, an autoencoder-based unsupervised user behavior anomaly detection framework. First, we design a Loss-guided Dynamic Mask Strategy (LDMS) to encourage the model to learn less frequent behaviors, which are often overlooked during learning. Second, we propose a Three-level Time-aware Position Embedding (TTPE) to incorporate temporal information into positional embedding to detect temporal context anomaly. Third, we propose a Noise-aware Weighted Reconstruction Loss (NWRL) that assigns different weights for routine behaviors and noise behaviors to mitigate the interference of noise behaviors during inference. Comprehensive experiments on three datasets with ten types of anomaly behaviors demonstrates that SmartGuard consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and also offers highly interpretable results.</description>
