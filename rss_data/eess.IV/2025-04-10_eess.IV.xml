      <title>Going beyond explainability in multi-modal stroke outcome prediction models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aim: This study aims to enhance interpretability and explainability of multi-modal prediction models integrating imaging and tabular patient data.
  Methods: We adapt the xAI methods Grad-CAM and Occlusion to multi-modal, partly interpretable deep transformation models (dTMs). DTMs combine statistical and deep learning approaches to simultaneously achieve state-of-the-art prediction performance and interpretable parameter estimates, such as odds ratios for tabular features. Based on brain imaging and tabular data from 407 stroke patients, we trained dTMs to predict functional outcome three months after stroke. We evaluated the models using different discriminatory metrics. The adapted xAI methods were used to generated explanation maps for identification of relevant image features and error analysis.
  Results: The dTMs achieve state-of-the-art prediction performance, with area under the curve (AUC) values close to 0.8. The most important tabular predictors of functional outcome are functional independence before stroke and NIHSS on admission, a neurological score indicating stroke severity. Explanation maps calculated from brain imaging dTMs for functional outcome highlighted critical brain regions such as the frontal lobe, which is known to be linked to age which in turn increases the risk for unfavorable outcomes. Similarity plots of the explanation maps revealed distinct patterns which give insight into stroke pathophysiology, support developing novel predictors of stroke outcome and enable to identify false predictions.
  Conclusion: By adapting methods for explanation maps to dTMs, we enhanced the explainability of multi-modal and partly interpretable prediction models. The resulting explanation maps facilitate error analysis and support hypothesis generation regarding the significance of specific image regions in outcome prediction.</description>

      <title>Subjective Visual Quality Assessment for High-Fidelity Learning-Based Image Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06301v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Learning-based image compression methods have recently emerged as promising alternatives to traditional codecs, offering improved rate-distortion performance and perceptual quality. JPEG AI represents the latest standardized framework in this domain, leveraging deep neural networks for high-fidelity image reconstruction. In this study, we present a comprehensive subjective visual quality assessment of JPEG AI-compressed images using the JPEG AIC-3 methodology, which quantifies perceptual differences in terms of Just Noticeable Difference (JND) units. We generated a dataset of 50 compressed images with fine-grained distortion levels from five diverse sources. A large-scale crowdsourced experiment collected 96,200 triplet responses from 459 participants. We reconstructed JND-based quality scales using a unified model based on boosted and plain triplet comparisons. Additionally, we evaluated the alignment of multiple objective image quality metrics with human perception in the high-fidelity range. The CVVDP metric achieved the overall highest performance; however, most metrics including CVVDP were overly optimistic in predicting the quality of JPEG AI-compressed images. These findings emphasize the necessity for rigorous subjective evaluations in the development and benchmarking of modern image codecs, particularly in the high-fidelity range. Another technical contribution is the introduction of the well-known Meng-Rosenthal-Rubin statistical test to the field of Quality of Experience research. This test can reliably assess the significance of difference in performance of quality metrics in terms of correlation between metrics and ground truth. The complete dataset, including all subjective scores, is publicly available at https://github.com/jpeg-aic/dataset-JPEG-AI-SDR25.</description>

      <title>Retuve: Automated Multi-Modality Analysis of Hip Dysplasia with Open Source AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH) poses significant diagnostic challenges, hindering timely intervention. Current screening methodologies lack standardization, and AI-driven studies suffer from reproducibility issues due to limited data and code availability. To address these limitations, we introduce Retuve, an open-source framework for multi-modality DDH analysis, encompassing both ultrasound (US) and X-ray imaging. Retuve provides a complete and reproducible workflow, offering open datasets comprising expert-annotated US and X-ray images, pre-trained models with training code and weights, and a user-friendly Python Application Programming Interface (API). The framework integrates segmentation and landmark detection models, enabling automated measurement of key diagnostic parameters such as the alpha angle and acetabular index. By adhering to open-source principles, Retuve promotes transparency, collaboration, and accessibility in DDH research. This initiative has the potential to democratize DDH screening, facilitate early diagnosis, and ultimately improve patient outcomes by enabling widespread screening and early intervention.

      <title>DIMA: DIffusing Motion Artifacts for unsupervised correction in brain MRI images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06767v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motion artifacts remain a significant challenge in Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), compromising diagnostic quality and potentially leading to misdiagnosis or repeated scans. Existing deep learning approaches for motion artifact correction typically require paired motion-free and motion-affected images for training, which are rarely available in clinical settings. To overcome this requirement, we present DIMA (DIffusing Motion Artifacts), a novel framework that leverages diffusion models to enable unsupervised motion artifact correction in brain MRI. Our two-phase approach first trains a diffusion model on unpaired motion-affected images to learn the distribution of motion artifacts. This model then generates realistic motion artifacts on clean images, creating paired datasets suitable for supervised training of correction networks. Unlike existing methods, DIMA operates without requiring k-space manipulation or detailed knowledge of MRI sequence parameters, making it adaptable across different scanning protocols and hardware. Comprehensive evaluations across multiple datasets and anatomical planes demonstrate that our method achieves comparable performance to state-of-the-art supervised approaches while offering superior generalizability to real clinical data. DIMA represents a significant advancement in making motion artifact correction more accessible for routine clinical use, potentially reducing the need for repeat scans and improving diagnostic accuracy.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Anatomical Priors for Automated Pancreas Segmentation on Abdominal CT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06921v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An accurate segmentation of the pancreas on CT is crucial to identify pancreatic pathologies and extract imaging-based biomarkers. However, prior research on pancreas segmentation has primarily focused on modifying the segmentation model architecture or utilizing pre- and post-processing techniques. In this article, we investigate the utility of anatomical priors to enhance the segmentation performance of the pancreas. Two 3D full-resolution nnU-Net models were trained, one with 8 refined labels from the public PANORAMA dataset, and another that combined them with labels derived from the public TotalSegmentator (TS) tool. The addition of anatomical priors resulted in a 6\% increase in Dice score ($p &lt; .001$) and a 36.5 mm decrease in Hausdorff distance for pancreas segmentation ($p &lt; .001$). Moreover, the pancreas was always detected when anatomy priors were used, whereas there were 8 instances of failed detections without their use. The use of anatomy priors shows promise for pancreas segmentation and subsequent derivation of imaging biomarkers.</description>

      <title>Longitudinal Assessment of Lung Lesion Burden in CT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06924v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the U.S., lung cancer is the second major cause of death. Early detection of suspicious lung nodules is crucial for patient treatment planning, management, and improving outcomes. Many approaches for lung nodule segmentation and volumetric analysis have been proposed, but few have looked at longitudinal changes in total lung tumor burden. In this work, we trained two 3D models (nnUNet) with and without anatomical priors to automatically segment lung lesions and quantified total lesion burden for each patient. The 3D model without priors significantly outperformed ($p &lt; .001$) the model trained with anatomy priors. For detecting clinically significant lesions $&gt;$ 1cm, a precision of 71.3\%, sensitivity of 68.4\%, and F1-score of 69.8\% was achieved. For segmentation, a Dice score of 77.1 $\pm$ 20.3 and Hausdorff distance error of 11.7 $\pm$ 24.1 mm was obtained. The median lesion burden was 6.4 cc (IQR: 2.1, 18.1) and the median volume difference between manual and automated measurements was 0.02 cc (IQR: -2.8, 1.2). Agreements were also evaluated with linear regression and Bland-Altman plots. The proposed approach can produce a personalized evaluation of the total tumor burden for a patient and facilitate interval change tracking over time.</description>

      <title>Assessing the risk of recurrence in early-stage breast cancer through H&amp;E stained whole slide images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06650v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate prediction of the likelihood of recurrence is important in the selection of postoperative treatment for patients with early-stage breast cancer. In this study, we investigated whether deep learning algorithms can predict patients' risk of recurrence by analyzing the pathology images of their cancer histology.We analyzed 125 hematoxylin and eosin-stained whole slide images (WSIs) from 125 patients across two institutions (National Cancer Center and Korea University Medical Center Guro Hospital) to predict breast cancer recurrence risk using deep learning. Sensitivity reached 0.857, 0.746, and 0.529 for low, intermediate, and high-risk categories, respectively, with specificity of 0.816, 0.803, and 0.972, and a Pearson correlation of 0.61 with histological grade. Class activation maps highlighted features like tubule formation and mitotic rate, suggesting a cost-effective approach to risk stratification, pending broader validation. These findings suggest that deep learning models trained exclusively on hematoxylin and eosin stained whole slide images can approximate genomic assay results, offering a cost-effective and scalable tool for breast cancer recurrence risk assessment. However, further validation using larger and more balanced datasets is needed to confirm the clinical applicability of our approach.</description>

      <title>Learning Generalizable Features for Tibial Plateau Fracture Segmentation Using Masked Autoencoder and Limited Annotations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02862v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate automated segmentation of tibial plateau fractures (TPF) from computed tomography (CT) requires large amounts of annotated data to train deep learning models, but obtaining such annotations presents unique challenges. The process demands expert knowledge to identify diverse fracture patterns, assess severity, and account for individual anatomical variations, making the annotation process highly time-consuming and expensive. Although semi-supervised learning methods can utilize unlabeled data, existing approaches often struggle with the complexity and variability of fracture morphologies, as well as limited generalizability across datasets. To tackle these issues, we propose an effective training strategy based on masked autoencoder (MAE) for the accurate TPF segmentation in CT. Our method leverages MAE pretraining to capture global skeletal structures and fine-grained fracture details from unlabeled data, followed by fine-tuning with a small set of labeled data. This strategy reduces the dependence on extensive annotations while enhancing the model's ability to learn generalizable and transferable features. The proposed method is evaluated on an in-house dataset containing 180 CT scans with TPF. Experimental results demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms semi-supervised methods, achieving an average Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) of 95.81%, average symmetric surface distance (ASSD) of 1.91mm, and Hausdorff distance (95HD) of 9.42mm with only 20 annotated cases. Moreover, our method exhibits strong transferability when applying to another public pelvic CT dataset with hip fractures, highlighting its potential for broader applications in fracture segmentation tasks.</description>

      <title>Multispectral Demosaicing via Dual Cameras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22026v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multispectral (MS) images capture detailed scene information across a wide range of spectral bands, making them invaluable for applications requiring rich spectral data. Integrating MS imaging into multi camera devices, such as smartphones, has the potential to enhance both spectral applications and RGB image quality. A critical step in processing MS data is demosaicing, which reconstructs color information from the mosaic MS images captured by the camera. This paper proposes a method for MS image demosaicing specifically designed for dual-camera setups where both RGB and MS cameras capture the same scene. Our approach leverages co-captured RGB images, which typically have higher spatial fidelity, to guide the demosaicing of lower-fidelity MS images. We introduce the Dual-camera RGB-MS Dataset - a large collection of paired RGB and MS mosaiced images with ground-truth demosaiced outputs - that enables training and evaluation of our method. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art accuracy compared to existing techniques.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.01081v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce ShieldGemma 2, a 4B parameter image content moderation model built on Gemma 3. This model provides robust safety risk predictions across the following key harm categories: Sexually Explicit, Violence \&amp; Gore, and Dangerous Content for synthetic images (e.g. output of any image generation model) and natural images (e.g. any image input to a Vision-Language Model). We evaluated on both internal and external benchmarks to demonstrate state-of-the-art performance compared to LlavaGuard \citep{helff2024llavaguard}, GPT-4o mini \citep{hurst2024gpt}, and the base Gemma 3 model \citep{gemma_2025} based on our policies. Additionally, we present a novel adversarial data generation pipeline which enables a controlled, diverse, and robust image generation. ShieldGemma 2 provides an open image moderation tool to advance multimodal safety and responsible AI development.</description>
