      <title>Ephemeral Superconductivity Atop the False Vacuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02992v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A many body system in the vicinity of a first-order phase transition may get trapped in a local minimum of the free energy landscape. These so-called false-vacuum states may survive for exceedingly long times if the barrier for their decay is high enough. The rich phase diagram obtained in graphene multilayer devices presents a unique opportunity to explore transient superconductivity on top of a correlated false vacuum. Specifically, we consider superconductors which are terminated by an apparent first-order phase transition to a correlated phase with different symmetry. We propose that quenching across this transition leads to a non-equilibrium ephemeral superconductor, readily detectable using straightforward transport measurements. Besides enabling a simple detection scheme, the transient superconductor also generically enhances the false vacuum lifetime, potentially by orders of magnitude. In several scenarios, the complimentary effect takes place as well: superconductivity is temporarily emboldened in the false vacuum, albeit ultimately decaying. We demonstrate the applicability of these claims for two different instances of superconductivity terminated by a first order transition in rhombohedral graphene. The obtained decay timescales position this class of materials as a promising playground to unambiguously realize and measure non-equilibrium superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic Spin Stripe Domains in Bilayer La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discovery of superconductivity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ under pressure has motivated the investigation of a parent spin density wave (SDW) state which could provide the underlying pairing interaction. Here, we employ resonant soft x-ray scattering and polarimetry on thin films of bilayer La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ to determine that the magnetic structure of the SDW forms unidirectional diagonal spin stripes with moments lying within the NiO$_2$ plane and perpendicular to $\mathbf{Q}_{SDW}$, but without the strong charge disproportionation typically associated with other nickelates. These stripes form anisotropic domains with shorter correlation lengths perpendicular versus parallel to $\mathbf{Q}_{SDW}$, revealing nanoscale rotational and translational symmetry breaking analogous to the cuprate and Fe-based superconductors, with Bloch-like antiferromagnetic domain walls separating orthogonal domains.</description>

      <title>Magnetic field tunable spectral response of kinetic inductance detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03356v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We tune the onset of optical response in aluminium kinetic inductance detectors from a natural cutoff frequency of 90 GHz to 60 GHz by applying an external magnetic field. The change in spectral response is due to the decrease of the superconducting gap, from 90 GHz at zero magnetic field to 60 GHz at a magnetic field of around 3 mT. We characterize the variation of the superconducting gap, the detector frequency shift and the internal quality factor as a function of the applied field. In principle, the magnetic field tunable response could be used to make spectroscopic measurements. In practice, the internal quality factor behaves hysteretically with the magnetic field due to the presence of vortices in the thin superconducting film. We conclude by discussing possible solutions to achieve spectroscopy measurements using kinetic inductance detectors and magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Emergence of Superconductivity at 20 K in Th$_3$P$_4$-type In$_{3-x}$S$_4$ Synthesized by Diamond Anvil Cell with Boron-doped Diamond Electrodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03409v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The exploration of superconductors in metastable phases by manipulating crystal structures through high-pressure techniques has attracted significant interest in materials science to achieve a high critical temperature ($T_c$). In this study, we report an emergence of novel superconductivity in a metastable phase of Th$_3$P$_4$-type cubic In$_{3-x}$S$_4$ with remarkably high $T_c$ at 20 K under 45 GPa by using an originally designed diamond anvil cell equipped with boron-doped diamond electrodes, which can perform a high-pressure synthesis and an in-situ electrical transport measurement simultaneously. In-situ structural analysis indicates that the In$_{3-x}$S$_4$ appears partially above 40 GPa without heating. The high-pressure annealing treatment induces complete transformation to the Th$_3$P$_4$-type structure, and the defected concentration of x in In$_{3-x}$S$_4$ decreases with increasing annealing temperature. The $T_c$ in In$_{3-x}$S$_4$ is maximized at x = 0 and approaches 20 K. Electronic band calculations show that the high density of states composed of sulfur and indium bands are located at the conduction band bottom near Fermi energy. The record high $T_c$ in In$_{3-x}$S$_4$ among superconducting sulfides accelerates the further exploration of high $T_c$ materials within the Th$_3$P$_4$-type cubic family by using flexibility in crystal structure.</description>

      <title>Stabilization of Ambient Pressure Rocksalt Crystal Structure and High Critical Field Superconductivity in ReC via Mo and W Substitution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03592v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transition-metal-based carbides (TMCs), renowned for their exceptional hardness, mechanical strength, and thermal properties, have recently emerged as promising candidates for topological superconductivity. In this study, we synthesized ReC in the NaCl structure at ambient pressure by substituting Mo or W at the Re-site. We investigated the superconducting properties of Re$_{1-x}$T$_{x}$C (where T = Mo, W) for $x = 0.5$ using magnetization, resistivity and specific heat measurements. These compounds display type-II, fully gapped, weakly coupled superconductivity with high critical fields, establishing them as new members of superconducting ultra-hard materials at ambient pressure and paving the way for superconducting device applications under extreme conditions.</description>

      <title>Shapiro steps in strongly-interacting Fermi gases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03448v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the observation of Shapiro steps in a periodically driven Josephson junction between strongly-interacting Fermi superfluids of ultracold atoms. We observe quantized plateaus in the current-potential characteristics, the height and width of which mirror the external drive frequency and the junction nonlinear response. Direct measurements of the current-phase relationship showcase how Shapiro steps arise from the synchronization between the relative phase of the two reservoirs and the external drive. Such mechanism is further supported by the detection of periodic phase-slippage processes, in the form of vortex-antivortex pairs. Our results are corroborated by a circuital model and numerical simulations, overall providing a clear understanding of Shapiro dynamics in atomic Fermi superfluids. Our work demonstrates phase-coherent and synchronization effects in driven strongly-interacting superfluids, opening prospects for studying emergent non-equilibrium dynamics in quantum many-body systems under external drives.</description>

      <title>Multidimensional Terahertz Probes of Quantum Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03719v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multidimensional spectroscopy has a long history originating from nuclear magnetic resonance, and has now found widespread application at infrared and optical frequencies as well. However, the energy scales of traditional multidimensional probes have been ill-suited for studying quantum materials. Recent technological advancements have now enabled extension of these multidimensional techniques to the terahertz frequency range, in which collective excitations of quantum materials are typically found. This Perspective introduces the technique of two-dimensional terahertz spectroscopy (2DTS) and the unique physics of quantum materials revealed by 2DTS spectra, accompanied by a selection of the rapidly expanding experimental and theoretical literature. While 2DTS has so far been primarily applied to quantum materials at equilibrium, we provide an outlook for its application towards understanding their dynamical non-equilibrium states and beyond.</description>

      <title>High-$T\rm_{c}$ superconductivity of clathrate Y$_{3}$EuH$_{24}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.05906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.05906v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent progress on theoretical predictions of ternary superhydrides and their subsequent experimental confirmations have introduced us with a new generation of superconductors, having the potential to realize the synthesis of the most anticipated room temperature superconductors. Motivated by the recent high pressure experiment on YH$_6$ and EuH$_6$, we have theoretically examined the stability as well as superconductivity by mixing the two compounds. Here we identified four phases capable of maintaining thermodynamic stability in the pressure range of 150-300 GPa, namely $Fm\bar{3}m$-Y$_{3}$EuH$_{24}$, $Cmmm$-YEuH$_{12}$, $Cmmm$-YEu$_{3}$H$_{24}$,$Immm$-YEu$_{3}$H$_{24}$. Among them, only $Fm\bar{3}m$-Y$_{3}$EuH$_{24}$ can maintain dynamically stability in the searched pressure range. The Allen-Dynes modified McMillan formula was used to further check the superconductivity of this phase, and the results reveal that the predicted superconducting transition temperature $T\rm_{c}$ of Y$_{3}$EuH$_{24}$ is approaching 220 K at 200 GPa. $Fm\bar{3}m$-Y$_{3}$EuH$_{24}$ has a nearly identical logarithmic average phonon frequency $\omega_{log}$ to YH$_{6}$, but its electron-phonon coupling (EPC) constant $\lambda$ is somewhat smaller than YH$_{6}$'s 2.56, resulting in a lower ultimate $T_{c}$ value.</description>

      <title>Metastable Photo-Induced Superconductivity far above $T_{\textrm{c}}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.15355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.15355v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inspired by the striking discovery of metastable superconductivity in $\mathrm{K}_3\mathrm{C}_{60}$ at 100K, far above $T_{\textrm{c}}=20K$, we discuss possible mechanisms for long-lived, photo-induced superconductivity. Starting from a model of optically-driven Raman phonons coupled to inter-band electronic transitions, we develop a microscopic mechanism for photo-controlling the pairing interaction. Leveraging this mechanism, we first investigate long-lived superconductivity arising from the thermodynamic metastable trapping of the driven phonon. We then propose an alternative route, where the superconducting gap created by an optical drive leads to a dynamical bottleneck in the equilibration of quasi-particles. We conclude by discussing implications of both scenarios for experiments that can be used to discriminate between them. Our work provides falsifiable explanations for the nanosecond-scale photo-induced superconductivity found in $\mathrm{K}_3\mathrm{C}_{60}$, while simultaneously offering a theoretical basis for exploring metastable superconductivity in other quantum materials.</description>

      <title>Microwave-Tunable Diode Effect in Asymmetric SQUIDs with Topological Josephson Junctions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.16931v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In superconducting systems in which inversion and time-reversal symmetry are simultaneously broken the critical current for positive and negative current bias can be different. For superconducting systems formed by Josephson junctions (JJs) this effect is termed Josephson diode effect. In this work, we study the Josephson diode effect for a superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) formed by a topological JJ with a 4$\pi$-periodic current-phase relationship and a topologically trivial JJ. We show how the fractional Josephson effect manifests in the Josephson diode effect with the application of a magnetic field and how tuning properties of the trivial SQUID arm can lead to diode polarity switching. We then investigate the AC response and show that the polarity of the diode effect can be tuned by varying the AC power and discuss differences between the AC diode effect of asymmetric SQUIDs with no topological JJ and SQUIDs in which one JJ is topological.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00933v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Uranium ditelluride (UTe$_2$) is the strongest contender to date for a $p$-wave superconductor in bulk form. Here we perform a spectroscopic study of the ambient pressure superconducting phase of UTe$_2$, measuring conductance through point-contact junctions formed by metallic contacts on different crystalline facets down to 250 mK and up to 18 T. Fitting a range of qualitatively varying spectra with a Blonder-Tinkham-Klapwijk(BTK) model for $p$-wave pairing, we can extract gap amplitude and interface barrier strength for each junction. We find good agreement with the data for a $p_y$ -wave gap function with amplitude in 0.26 $\pm$ 0.06 meV. Our work provides spectroscopic evidence for a gap structure consistent with the proposed spin-triplet pairing in the superconducting state of UTe$_2$.</description>

Abstract: We report our progress in the high-temperature superconductor (HTS) Josephson junction fabrication process founded on using a focused helium ion beam damaging technique and discuss the expected device performance attainable with the HTS multi-junction device technology. Both the achievable high value of characteristic voltage $V_c=I_cR_N$ of Josephson junctions and the ability to design a large number of arbitrary located Josephson junctions allow narrowing the existing gap in design abilities for LTS and HTS circuits even with using a single YBCO film layer. A one-layer topology of active electrically small antenna is suggested and its voltage response characteristics are considered.</description>

      <title>Superconductivity Discovered in Niobium Polyhydride at High Pressures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.05726v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Niobium polyhydride was synthesized at high pressure and high temperature conditions by using diamond anvil cell combined with in situ high pressure laser heating techniques. High pressure electric transport experiments demonstrate that superconducting transition occurs with critical temperature(Tc) 42 K at 187 GPa. The shift of Tc as function of external applied magnetic field is in consistent to the nature of superconductivity while the upper critical field at zero temperature Hc2(0) is estimated to~16.8 Tesla while the GL coherent length ~57 angstrom is estimated. The structure investigation using synchrotron radiation implies that the observed superconductivity may come from Fm-3m phase of NbH3.</description>

      <title>Emergent pair symmetries in systems with poor man's Majorana modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17508v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Few-site Kitaev chains are promising for realizing Majorana zero modes without topological protection but fully nonlocal, which are known as poor man's Majorana modes. While several signatures have already been reported both theoretically and experimentally, it still remains unknown what is the nature of superconducting correlations in the presence of poor man's Majorana modes. In this work, we study few-site Kitaev chains and demonstrate that they host pair correlations with distinct symmetries, entirely determined by the underlying quantum numbers. In particular, we find that a two-site Kitaev chain hosts local (odd-frequency) and nonlocal (odd- and even-frequency) pair correlations, both spin polarized and highly tunable by the system parameters. Interestingly, the odd-frequency pair correlations exhibit a divergent behaviour around zero frequency when the nonlocal $p$-wave pair potential and electron tunneling are of the same order, an effect that can be controlled by the onsite energies. Since a divergent odd-frequency pairing is directly connected to the intrinsic spatial nonlocality of Majorana zero modes in topological superconductors, the divergent odd-frequency pairing here reflects the intrinsic Majorana nonlocality of poor man's Majorana modes but without any relation to topology. Our findings could help understanding the emergent pair correlations in few-site Kitaev chains.</description>

Abstract: Josephson elements are cornerstones of cryogenic classical and quantum superconducting technology, owing to their nonlinearity. Two important types of Josephson elements are often considered distinct: the tunnel junction (superconductor-insulator-superconductor, SIS) and the Andreev weak link (superconductor-normal-superconductor, SNS) referring to any non-superconducting and non-insulating central region. SNS junctions and SIS junctions have appeared in related technological and fundamental science contexts over the last decade, such as in the design of protected qubit concepts. In this perspective article, we review correspondences between SISIS junctions and SNS junctions in limiting regimes, in which a single energy-phase relationship describes both systems. We show how this insight helps to connect recent bodies of theoretical and experimental work in both systems, and conclude by describing a few important differences.</description>
