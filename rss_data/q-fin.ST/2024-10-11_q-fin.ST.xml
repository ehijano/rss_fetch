      <title>Evaluating Financial Relational Graphs: Interpretation Before Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07216v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate and robust stock trend forecasting has been a crucial and challenging task, as stock price changes are influenced by multiple factors. Graph neural network-based methods have recently achieved remarkable success in this domain by constructing stock relationship graphs that reflect internal factors and relationships between stocks. However, most of these methods rely on predefined factors to construct static stock relationship graphs due to the lack of suitable datasets, failing to capture the dynamic changes in stock relationships. Moreover, the evaluation of relationship graphs in these methods is often tied to the performance of neural network models on downstream tasks, leading to confusion and imprecision. To address these issues, we introduce the SPNews dataset, collected based on S\&amp;P 500 Index stocks, to facilitate the construction of dynamic relationship graphs. Furthermore, we propose a novel set of financial relationship graph evaluation methods that are independent of downstream tasks. By using the relationship graph to explain historical financial phenomena, we assess its validity before constructing a graph neural network, ensuring the graph's effectiveness in capturing relevant financial relationships. Experimental results demonstrate that our evaluation methods can effectively differentiate between various financial relationship graphs, yielding more interpretable results compared to traditional approaches. We make our source code publicly available on GitHub to promote reproducibility and further research in this area.</description>

      <title>Stock Price Prediction and Traditional Models: An Approach to Achieve Short-, Medium- and Long-Term Goals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07220v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A comparative analysis of deep learning models and traditional statistical methods for stock price prediction uses data from the Nigerian stock exchange. Historical data, including daily prices and trading volumes, are employed to implement models such as Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) networks, Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs), Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA), and Autoregressive Moving Average (ARMA). These models are assessed over three-time horizons: short-term (1 year), medium-term (2.5 years), and long-term (5 years), with performance measured by Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE). The stability of the time series is tested using the Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test. Results reveal that deep learning models, particularly LSTM, outperform traditional methods by capturing complex, nonlinear patterns in the data, resulting in more accurate predictions. However, these models require greater computational resources and offer less interpretability than traditional approaches. The findings highlight the potential of deep learning for improving financial forecasting and investment strategies. Future research could incorporate external factors such as social media sentiment and economic indicators, refine model architectures, and explore real-time applications to enhance prediction accuracy and scalability.</description>

      <title>Detecting Structural breakpoints in natural gas and electricity wholesale prices via Bayesian ensemble approach, in the era of energy prices turmoil of 2022 period: the cases of ten European markets</title>

Abstract: We investigate the impact of several critical events associated with the Russo Ukrainian war, started officially on 24 February 2022 with the Russian invasion of Ukraine, on ten European electricity markets, two natural gas markets (the European reference trading hub TTF and N.Y. NGNMX market) and how these markets interact to each other and with USDRUB exchange rate, a financial market. We analyze the reactions of these markets, manifested as breakpoints attributed to these critical events, and their interaction, by using a set of three tools that can shed light on different aspects of this complex situation. We combine the concepts of market efficiency, measured by quantifying the Efficient market hypothesis (EMH) via rolling Hurst exponent, with structural breakpoints occurred in the time series of gas, electricity and financial markets, the detection of which is possible by using a Bayesian ensemble approach, the Bayesian Estimator of Abrupt change, Seasonal change and Trend (BEAST), a powerful tool that can effectively detect structural breakpoints, trends, seasonalities and sudden abrupt changes in time series. The results show that the analyzed markets have exhibited different modes of reactions to the critical events, both in respect of number, nature, and time of occurrence (leading, lagging, concurrent with dates of critical events) of breakpoints as well as of the dynamic behavior of their trend components.</description>

      <title>Distilling Analysis from Generative Models for Investment Decisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07225v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Professionals' decisions are the focus of every field. For example, politicians' decisions will influence the future of the country, and stock analysts' decisions will impact the market. Recognizing the influential role of professionals' perspectives, inclinations, and actions in shaping decision-making processes and future trends across multiple fields, we propose three tasks for modeling these decisions in the financial market. To facilitate this, we introduce a novel dataset, A3, designed to simulate professionals' decision-making processes. While we find current models present challenges in forecasting professionals' behaviors, particularly in making trading decisions, the proposed Chain-of-Decision approach demonstrates promising improvements. It integrates an opinion-generator-in-the-loop to provide subjective analysis based on each news item, further enhancing the proposed tasks' performance.</description>
