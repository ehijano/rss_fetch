      <title>Fast Estimation of the Composite Link Model for Multidimensional Grouped Counts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04956v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a significant advancement in the estimation of the Composite Link Model within a penalized likelihood framework, specifically designed to address indirect observations of grouped count data. While the model is effective in these contexts, its application becomes computationally challenging in large, high-dimensional settings. To overcome this, we propose a reformulated iterative estimation procedure that leverages Generalized Linear Array Models, enabling the disaggregation and smooth estimation of latent distributions in multidimensional data. Through applications to high-dimensional mortality datasets, we demonstrate the model's capability to capture fine-grained patterns while comparing its computational performance to the conventional algorithm. The proposed methodology offers notable improvements in computational speed, storage efficiency, and practical applicability, making it suitable for a wide range of fields where high-dimensional data are provided in grouped formats.</description>

      <title>Optimal control under uncertainty with joint chance state constraints: almost-everywhere bounds, variance reduction, and application to (bi-)linear elliptic PDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05125v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study optimal control of PDEs under uncertainty with the state variable subject to joint chance constraints. The controls are deterministic, but the states are probabilistic due to random variables in the governing equation. Joint chance constraints ensure that the random state variable meets pointwise bounds with high probability. For linear governing PDEs and elliptically distributed random parameters, we prove existence and uniqueness results for almost-everywhere state bounds. Using the spherical-radial decomposition (SRD) of the uncertain variable, we prove that when the probability is very large or small, the resulting Monte Carlo estimator for the chance constraint probability exhibits substantially reduced variance compared to the standard Monte Carlo estimator. We further illustrate how the SRD can be leveraged to efficiently compute derivatives of the probability function, and discuss different expansions of the uncertain variable in the governing equation. Numerical examples for linear and bilinear PDEs compare the performance of Monte Carlo and quasi-Monte Carlo sampling methods, examining probability estimation convergence as the number of samples increases. We also study how the accuracy of the probabilities depends on the truncation of the random variable expansion, and numerically illustrate the variance reduction of the SRD.</description>

      <title>The Polynomial Stein Discrepancy for Assessing Moment Convergence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05135v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel method for measuring the discrepancy between a set of samples and a desired posterior distribution for Bayesian inference. Classical methods for assessing sample quality like the effective sample size are not appropriate for scalable Bayesian sampling algorithms, such as stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics, that are asymptotically biased. Instead, the gold standard is to use the kernel Stein Discrepancy (KSD), which is itself not scalable given its quadratic cost in the number of samples. The KSD and its faster extensions also typically suffer from the curse-of-dimensionality and can require extensive tuning. To address these limitations, we develop the polynomial Stein discrepancy (PSD) and an associated goodness-of-fit test. While the new test is not fully convergence-determining, we prove that it detects differences in the first r moments in the Bernstein-von Mises limit. We empirically show that the test has higher power than its competitors in several examples, and at a lower computational cost. Finally, we demonstrate that the PSD can assist practitioners to select hyper-parameters of Bayesian sampling algorithms more efficiently than competitors.</description>

      <title>Generative Filtering for Recursive Bayesian Inference with Streaming Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.14271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.14271v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the streaming data setting, where data arrive continuously or in frequent batches and there is no pre-determined amount of total data, Bayesian models can employ recursive updates, incorporating each new batch of data into the model parameters' posterior distribution. Filtering methods are currently used to perform these updates efficiently, however, they suffer from eventual degradation as the number of unique values within the filtered samples decreases. We propose Generative Filtering, a method for efficiently performing recursive Bayesian updates in the streaming setting. Generative Filtering retains the speed of a filtering method while using parallel updates to avoid degenerate distributions after repeated applications. We derive rates of convergence for Generative Filtering and conditions for the use of sufficient statistics instead of fully storing all past data. We investigate the alleviation of filtering degradation through simulation and Ecological species count data.</description>

      <title>Linear-Cost Vecchia Approximation of Multivariate Normal Probabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.09426v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multivariate normal (MVN) probabilities arise in myriad applications, but they are analytically intractable and need to be evaluated via Monte-Carlo-based numerical integration. For the state-of-the-art minimax exponential tilting (MET) method, we show that the complexity of each of its components can be greatly reduced through an integrand parameterization that utilizes the sparse inverse Cholesky factor produced by the Vecchia approximation, whose approximation error is often negligible relative to the Monte-Carlo error. Based on this idea, we derive algorithms that can estimate MVN probabilities and sample from truncated MVN distributions in linear time (and that are easily parallelizable) at the same convergence or acceptance rate as MET, whose complexity is cubic in the dimension of the MVN probability. We showcase the advantages of our methods relative to existing approaches using several simulated examples. We also analyze a groundwater-contamination dataset with over twenty thousand censored measurements to demonstrate the scalability of our method for partially censored Gaussian-process models.</description>
