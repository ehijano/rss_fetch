      <title>Measuring the effect of spatial dimension on hydrodynamic turbulence using direct numerical simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00449v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We perform direct numerical simulation of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equation with forcing at different spatial dimensions and measure turbulent and chaotic properties. Lyapunov exponents, $\lambda$, decrease with dimension, and $\lambda &lt; 0$ for all simulations in six-dimensions up to $Re = 40$. These six-dimensional simulations display non-Gaussian statistics and other behavior similar to well developed turbulence despite their lack of chaos. Further, we find that small scale perturbations do not extend to the largest scales and that this terminal scale between correlation and decorrelation shrinks with dimension. We theorize that this change is related to the increased rate of vortex stretching. We find the interplay between turbulent and chaotic properties changes with increasing dimension.</description>

      <title>Spectral form factor and power spectrum for trapped rotating interacting bosons: An exact diagonalization study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00828v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an exact diagonalization study of the spectral form factor and the power spectrum for externally impressed rotating bosons in a quasi-two-dimensional harmonic trap interacting via repulsive Gaussian potential. Our focus is on the spectral correlations arising from the condensate depletion as a result of the formation of quantized vortices and the strong interaction, which leads to chaos in the system. We consider two distinct interaction regimes: moderate, where the interaction energy is small compared to the trap energy, and strong, where it is comparable. For the non-rotating case, the spectral form factor (SFF) in the moderate interaction regime exhibits a dip-plateau structure characteristic of integrable systems, while in the strong interaction regime it develops a weak ramp, signalling a transition to pseudo-integrable behavior. For the rotating single-vortex state, the SFF in the moderate interaction regime shows the onset of a weak ramp consistent with pseudo-integrability, whereas in the strong interaction regime the ramp becomes significantly more pronounced, indicating strongly chaotic behavior. For the multi-vortex states in the strong interacting regime, the SFF exhibits a clear dip-ramp-plateau structure, indicative of chaotic behavior. The corresponding power spectrum results further corroborate these findings: integrable system exhibits the characteristic $1/f^{\alpha}$ (with $\alpha \approx2$) noise, chaotic system shows the ubiquitous $1/f^{\alpha}$ (with $\alpha \approx 1$) noise, and pseudo-integrable system yields intermediate exponents with $1 &lt; \alpha &lt; 2$.</description>

      <title>Stability analysis of action potential generation using Markov models of voltage-gated sodium channel isoforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01058v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate a conductance-based neuron model to explore how voltage-gated ion channel isoforms influence action-potential generation. The model combines a six-state Markov representation of NaV channels with a first-order KV3.1 model, allowing us to vary maximal sodium and potassium conductances and compare nine NaV isoforms. Using bifurcation theory and local stability analysis, we map regions of stable limit cycles and visualize excitability landscapes via heatmap-based diagrams. These analyses show that isoforms NaV1.3, NaV1.4 and NaV1.6 support broad excitable regimes, while isoforms NaV1.7 and NaV1.9 exhibit minimal oscillatory behavior. Our findings provide insights into the role of channel heterogeneity in neuronal dynamics and may help to guide the design of synthetic excitable systems by narrowing the parameter space needed for robust action-potential trains.</description>

      <title>Data assimilation and discrepancy modeling with shallow recurrent decoders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01170v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The requirements of modern sensing are rapidly evolving, driven by increasing demands for data efficiency, real-time processing, and deployment under limited sensing coverage. Complex physical systems are often characterized through the integration of a limited number of point sensors in combination with scientific computations which approximate the dominant, full-state dynamics. Simulation models, however, inevitably neglect small-scale or hidden processes, are sensitive to perturbations, or oversimplify parameter correlations, leading to reconstructions that often diverge from the reality measured by sensors. This creates a critical need for data assimilation, the process of integrating observational data with predictive simulation models to produce coherent and accurate estimates of the full state of complex physical systems. We propose a machine learning framework for Data Assimilation with a SHallow REcurrent Decoder (DA-SHRED) which bridges the simulation-to-real (SIM2REAL) gap between computational modeling and experimental sensor data. For real-world physics systems modeling high-dimensional spatiotemporal fields, where the full state cannot be directly observed and must be inferred from sparse sensor measurements, we leverage the latent space learned from a reduced simulation model via SHRED, and update these latent variables using real sensor data to accurately reconstruct the full system state. Furthermore, our algorithm incorporates a sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics based regression model in the latent space to identify functionals corresponding to missing dynamics in the simulation model. We demonstrate that DA-SHRED successfully closes the SIM2REAL gap and additionally recovers missing dynamics in highly complex systems, demonstrating that the combination of efficient temporal encoding and physics-informed correction enables robust data assimilation.</description>
