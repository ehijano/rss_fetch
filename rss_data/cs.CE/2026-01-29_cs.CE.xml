      <title>High-Resolution Mapping of Port Dynamics from Open-Access AIS Data in Tokyo Bay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20211v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Knowledge about vessel activity in port areas and around major industrial zones provides insights into economic trends, supports decision-making for shipping and port operators, and contributes to maritime safety. Vessel data from terrestrial receivers of the Automatic Identification System (AIS) have become increasingly openly available, and we demonstrate that such data can be used to infer port activities at high resolution and with precision comparable to official statistics. We analyze open-access AIS data from a three-month period in 2024 for Tokyo Bay, located in Japan's most densely populated urban region. Accounting for uneven data coverage, we reconstruct vessel activity in Tokyo Bay at $\sim\,$30~m resolution and identify 161 active berths across seven major port areas in the bay. During the analysis period, we find an average of $35\pm17_{\text{stat}}$ vessels moving within the bay at any given time, and $293\pm22_{\text{stat}}+65_{\text{syst}}-10_{\text{syst}}$ vessels entering or leaving the bay daily, with an average gross tonnage of $11{,}860^{+280}_{-\;\,50}$. These figures indicate an accelerating long-term trend toward fewer but larger vessels in Tokyo Bay's commercial traffic. Furthermore, we find that in dense urban environments, radio shadows in vessel AIS data can reveal the precise locations of inherently passive receiver stations.</description>

      <title>CM-GAI: Continuum Mechanistic Generative Artificial Intelligence Theory for Data Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20462v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence (GAI) plays a fundamental role in high-impact AI-based systems such as SORA and AlphaFold. Currently, GAI shows limited capability in the specialized domains due to data scarcity. In this paper, we develop a continuum mechanics-based theoretical framework to generalize the optimal transport theory from pure mathematics, which can be used to describe the dynamics of data, realizing the generative tasks with a small amount of data. The developed theory is used to solve three typical problem involved in many mechanical designs and engineering applications: at material level, how to generate the stress-strain response outside the range of experimental conditions based on experimentally measured stress-strain data; at structure level, how to generate the temperature-dependent stress fields under the thermal loading; at system level, how to generate the plastic strain fields under transient dynamic loading. Our results show the proposed theory can complete the generation successfully, showing its potential to solve many difficult problems involved in engineering applications, not limited to mechanics problems, such as image generation. The present work shows that mechanics can provide new tools for computer science. The limitation of the proposed theory is also discussed.</description>

      <title>Idea2Story: An Automated Pipeline for Transforming Research Concepts into Complete Scientific Narratives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20833v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autonomous scientific discovery with large language model (LLM)-based agents has recently made substantial progress, demonstrating the ability to automate end-to-end research workflows. However, existing systems largely rely on runtime-centric execution paradigms, repeatedly reading, summarizing, and reasoning over large volumes of scientific literature online. This on-the-spot computation strategy incurs high computational cost, suffers from context window limitations, and often leads to brittle reasoning and hallucination. We propose Idea2Story, a pre-computation-driven framework for autonomous scientific discovery that shifts literature understanding from online reasoning to offline knowledge construction. Idea2Story continuously collects peer-reviewed papers together with their review feedback, extracts core methodological units, composes reusable research patterns, and organizes them into a structured methodological knowledge graph. At runtime, underspecified user research intents are aligned to established research paradigms, enabling efficient retrieval and reuse of high-quality research patterns instead of open-ended generation and trial-and-error. By grounding research planning and execution in a pre-built knowledge graph, Idea2Story alleviates the context window bottleneck of LLMs and substantially reduces repeated runtime reasoning over literature. We conduct qualitative analyses and preliminary empirical studies demonstrating that Idea2Story can generate coherent, methodologically grounded, and novel research patterns, and can produce several high-quality research demonstrations in an end-to-end setting. These results suggest that offline knowledge construction provides a practical and scalable foundation for reliable autonomous scientific discovery.</description>

      <title>Cheap2Rich: A Multi-Fidelity Framework for Data Assimilation and System Identification of Multiscale Physics -- Rotating Detonation Engines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20295v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bridging the sim2real gap between computationally inexpensive models and complex physical systems remains a central challenge in machine learning applications to engineering problems, particularly in multi-scale settings where reduced-order models typically capture only dominant dynamics. In this work, we present Cheap2Rich, a multi-scale data assimilation framework that reconstructs high-fidelity state spaces from sparse sensor histories by combining a fast low-fidelity prior with learned, interpretable discrepancy corrections. We demonstrate the performance on rotating detonation engines (RDEs), a challenging class of systems that couple detonation-front propagation with injector-driven unsteadiness, mixing, and stiff chemistry across disparate scales. Our approach successfully reconstructs high-fidelity RDE states from sparse measurements while isolating physically meaningful discrepancy dynamics associated with injector-driven effects. The results highlight a general multi-fidelity framework for data assimilation and system identification in complex multi-scale systems, enabling rapid design exploration and real-time monitoring and control while providing interpretable discrepancy dynamics. Code for this project is is available at: github.com/kro0l1k/Cheap2Rich.</description>

      <title>An Eulerian Data Assimilation Method for Two-Layer Quasi-Geostrophic Model in Physical Domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14586v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Data assimilation (DA) integrates observational data with numerical models to improve the prediction of complex physical systems. However, traditional DA methods often struggle with nonlinear dynamics and multi-scale variability, particularly when implemented directly in the physical domain. To address these challenges, this work develops an Eulerian Data Assimilation (EuDA) method with the Conditional Gaussian Nonlinear System (CGNS). The proposed approach enables the treatment of systems with non-periodic boundaries and provides a more intuitive representation of localized and time-dependent phenomena. The work considers a simplified physical domain inspired by sea-ice floe trajectories and ocean eddy recovery in the Arctic regions, where the dynamics are modeled by a two-layer quasi-geostrophic (QG) system. The QG equations are numerically solved using forward-Euler time stepping and centered finite-difference schemes. CGNS provides a nonlinear filter as it offers an analytical and continuous formulation for filtering a nonlinear system. Model performance is assessed using normalized root mean square error (RMSE) and pattern correlation (Corr) of the posterior mean. The results show that both metrics improve monotonically with refining timesteps, while RMSE converges to approximately 0.1, which is the noise strength, and Corr increases from 0.64 to 0.92 as the grid resolution becomes finer. Lastly, a coupled scenario with sea-ice particles advected by the two-layer QG flow under a linear drag force is examined, demonstrating the flexibility of the EuDA-CGNS framework in capturing coupled ice-ocean interactions. These findings demonstrate the effectiveness of exploiting the two-layer QG model in the physical domain to capture multiscale flow features.</description>
