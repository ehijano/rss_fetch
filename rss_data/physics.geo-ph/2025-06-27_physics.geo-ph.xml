      <title>Efficacy of Temporal Fusion Transformers for Runoff Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Combining attention with recurrence has shown to be valuable in sequence modeling, including hydrological predictions. Here, we explore the strength of Temporal Fusion Transformers (TFTs) over Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks in rainfall-runoff modeling. We train ten randomly initialized models, TFT and LSTM, for 531 CAMELS catchments in the US. We repeat the experiment with five subsets of the Caravan dataset, each representing catchments in the US, Australia, Brazil, Great Britain, and Chile. Then, the performance of the models, their variability regarding the catchment attributes, and the difference according to the datasets are assessed. Our findings show that TFT slightly outperforms LSTM, especially in simulating the midsection and peak of hydrographs. Furthermore, we show the ability of TFT to handle longer sequences and why it can be a better candidate for higher or larger catchments. Being an explainable AI technique, TFT identifies the key dynamic and static variables, providing valuable scientific insights. However, both TFT and LSTM exhibit a considerable drop in performance with the Caravan dataset, indicating possible data quality issues. Overall, the study highlights the potential of TFT in improving hydrological modeling and understanding.</description>

      <title>A new method for structural diagnostics with muon tomography and deep learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03339v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work investigates the production of high-resolution images of typical support elements in concrete structures by means of muon tomography (muography). By exploiting detailed Monte Carlo radiation-matter simulations, we demonstrate the feasibility of reconstructing 1 cm-thick iron bars inside 30 cm-deep concrete blocks, regarded as an important testbed within the structural diagnostics community. In addition, we present a new method for integrating simulated data with advanced deep learning techniques in order to improve the muon imaging of concrete structures. Through deep learning enhancement techniques, this results in a dramatic improvement in image quality and a significant reduction in data acquisition time, which are two critical limitations within the usual practice of muography for civil engineering diagnostics.</description>

      <title>A generic framework for extending Miles' approach to wind-wave interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09369v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the energy transfer from wind to waves is an important but complex topic, typically based on phenomenology, on pure numerics, or on technically challenging analysis, carried out on a case by case basis. Here we show that the approach by Miles, initially proposed for a still and infinitely deep ocean of inviscid water, is in fact generic: it can easily be adapted, as we demonstrate directly from the mathematical structure of the arguments put forward by Miles. We establish simple transformations, which infer wave growth rates in complex hydrodynamic situations directly from those in Miles' conditions, without any adjustable parameters. The corresponding conversion factors are determined from the hydrodynamic water pressure produced by a propagating surface wave, and can be determined without requiring to further analyse wind and air flow. We reproduce a variety of results for different hydrodynamic situations to show how such generalisations can be achieved with surprisingly simple calculations and without any additional numerical effort, which should make the approach interesting for real-life applications.</description>
