      <title>She's Got Her Mother's Hair: End-to-End Collapsar Simulations Unveil the Origin of Black Holes' Magnetic Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16745v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Relativistic jets from a black hole (BH) following the core-collapse of a massive star (''collapsar'') is a leading model for gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). However, the two key ingredients for a Blandford-Znajek (BZ) powered jet $-$ rapid rotation and a strong magnetic field $-$ seem mutually exclusive. Strong fields in the progenitor star's core transport angular momentum outwards more quickly, slowing down the core before collapse. Using MESA stellar evolution models followed to core-collapse, we explicitly show that the small length-scale of the instabilities, likely responsible for angular momentum transport in the core (e.g., Tayler-Spruit), results in a low net magnetic flux fed to the BH horizon, far too small to power GRB jets. Instead, we propose a novel scenario in which collapsar BHs acquire their magnetic ''hair'' from their progenitor proto-neutron star (PNS), which is likely highly magnetized from an internal dynamo. We evaluate the conditions for the BH accretion disk to pin the PNS magnetosphere to its horizon immediately after the collapse. Our results show that the PNS's pre-collapse energy matches the excess energy in Ic-BL supernovae, while the nascent BH's spin and magnetic flux produce jets consistent with observed GRB characteristics. We map our MESA models to 3D general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations and confirm that accretion disks confine the strong magnetic flux initiated near a rotating BH, enabling the launch of successful GRB jets, whereas a slower spinning BH or one without a disk fails to do so. Our model indicates that standard GRB jets emerge whenever an accretion disk forms.</description>

      <title>Role of magnetic arcades in explaining the puzzle of the gamma-ray emission from the solar disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interpretation of gamma-ray emission originating from the solar disk ($0.5^\circ$ in angular size) as due to the interaction of Galactic Cosmic Rays (GCRs) with the solar atmosphere has remained a central challenge in solar physics. After the seminal work by Seckel, Stanev, and Gaisser (SSG91) based on GCRs magnetic mirroring, discrepancies between models and observations persist, indicating the need for a novel approach. The present work focuses on exploring the impact of a closed magnetic field geometry in the low photosphere on the observed gamma-ray flux. We track numerically with the PLUTO code the trajectories of test-particle protons within a static $\sim 20$ Mm scale height magnetic arcade adjacent to jets. By making use of numerical vertical density profiles we inject particles at distinct chromospheric/photospheric altitudes, mimicking the migration of GCRs from neighboring flux tubes into closed arcades. Remarkably, our model reproduces a flat gamma-ray spectrum below $\sim 33$ GeV, a nearly-isotropic emission at $\sim 10$ GeV, both consistent with Fermi-LAT observations, and a near-limb emission at $\sim 1$ TeV. Our model can also reproduce the flux-drop detected by HAWC ($\sim 1$ TeV). Finally, we argue that the spectral dip observed at $\sim$ 40 GeV may result from the flux suppression at low energy due to the cross-field diffusion, which would produce a cutoff. These findings underscore the pivotal role of closed magnetic field structures in shaping the solar disk gamma-ray emission.</description>

      <title>Associations Between Scattering Screens and Interstellar Medium Filaments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16876v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pulsar scintillation can be used to measure small scale structure in the Galaxy, but little is known about the specific interstellar medium features that cause scintillation. We searched for interstellar medium counterparts to all scintillation screens for which absolute distances and scattering orientations have been measured - a sample of 12 pulsars and 22 screens. For one pulsar, PSR J0737-3039A, we re-analyze its scintillation screen and find evidence for a highly anisotropic screen. Among the screens, we found that eight are located inside of the Local Bubble, and a further six are less than 100 pc farther than its inner edge. Comparisons with tracers of ionized and magnetized media did not find any new associations. Instead, for seven of the pulsars analyzed, aligned HI filaments are seen for at least one of their screens, for a total of 12 out of 22 screens. This result seems unlikely to be due to chance: comparing with random trials, we estimate a likelihood of finding 12 or more screens with aligned emission by chance of only 0.004%. Estimating the significance of the amount of aligned emission (in standard deviations over the mean), the probability of finding as much observed aligned emission by chance is larger, at 1.7%, but still indicative of a real correlation. Since HI filaments are preferentially associated with cold neutral gas, and thus unlikely to cause scintillation, this may indicate both the filaments and the screens are aligned preferentially by the same mechanisms such as magnetic fields or shocks.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Alfven-Wave Dynamics and Pre-Merger Emission from Crustal Oscillations in Neutron Star Mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17026v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neutron stars have solid crusts threaded by strong magnetic fields. Perturbations in the crust can excite non-radial oscillations, which can in turn launch Alfven waves into the magnetosphere. In the case of a compact binary close to merger involving at least one neutron star, this can happen through tidal interactions causing resonant excitations that shatter the neutron star crust. We present the first numerical study that elucidates the dynamics of Alfven waves launched in a compact binary magnetosphere. We seed a magnetic field perturbation on the neutron star crust, which we then evolve in fully general-relativistic force-free electrodynamics using a GPU-based implementation. We show that Alfven waves steepen nonlinearly before reaching the orbital light cylinder, form flares, and dissipate energy in a transient current sheet. Our results predict radio and X-ray precursor emission from this process.</description>

      <title>Effect of irradiation and binary radio pulsars with giant companions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17178v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pulsars are neutron stars that rotate rapidly. Most pulsars in binary systems tend to spin faster than those in isolation. According to binary evolution theory, radio pulsars in binary systems can have various types of companion stars. However, currently, binary radio pulsars with companions of giant stars, helium stars, and black holes are still missing. We aim to investigate the possible parameter space of binary radio pulsars with giant companions. We used the MESA stellar evolution code to consider the effect of irradiation in binary evolution and evolved a series of binary models. In this paper, we present the potential physical properties of binary radio pulsars with giant star companions under the framework of the classical recycling scenario and the irradiation model. We found that the parameter space of binary radio pulsars with giant companions can be greatly expanded by the effect of irradiation. Moreover, if irradiation is strong enough, the sub-millisecond pulsars might be accompanied by giant companion stars. We also demonstrate a correlation between the timescale of the binary system being in the state of low mass X-ray binary and the irradiation efficiency. Birth rate problem between the millisecond pulsars and low-mass X-ray binaries might not resolved by irradiation effect and a more detailed Binary Population Synthesis is necessary. Our findings may also offer guidance for observers to locate binary radio pulsars with giant companions or sub-millisecond pulsars.</description>

      <title>Two black widow pulsars in the optical and X-rays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. Two millisecond pulsars, PSR J1513$-$2550 and PSR J2017$-$1614, with spin periods of about 2.1 and 2.3 ms were recently discovered in the radio and $\gamma$-rays and classified as black widow pulsars in tight binary stellar systems with orbital periods of about 4.3 and 2.3 h. Aims. Our goals are to reveal fundamental parameters of both systems and their binary components using multi-wavelength observations. Methods. We carried out the first time-series multi-band optical photometry of the objects with the 2.1-metre telescope of the Observatorio Astron\'omico Nacional San Pedro M\'artir, the 6.5-metre \magel-1 telescope, and the 10.4-metre Gran Telescopio Canarias. To derive the parameters of both systems, we fitted the obtained light curves with a model assuming heating of the companion by the pulsar. We also analysed archival X-ray data obtained with the XMM-Newton observatory. Results. For the first time, we firmly identified J1513$-$2550 in the optical and both pulsars in X-rays. The optical light curves of both systems have a single peak per orbital period with peak-to-peak amplitude of $\gtrsim2$ magnitudes. The J2017$-$1614 light curves are symmetric, while J1513$-$2550 demonstrates strong asymmetry whose nature remains unclear. Conclusions. We constrained the orbital inclinations, pulsar masses, companion temperatures and masses, as well as the distances to both systems. We also conclude that J2017$-$1614 may contain a massive neutron star of 2.4$\pm$0.6 M$_{\odot}$. The X-ray spectra of both sources can be fitted by power laws with parameters typical for black widow systems.</description>

      <title>A second view on the X-ray polarization of NGC 4151 with IXPE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on the second observing program of the active galactic nucleus NGC 4151 with simultaneous Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE; {\sim}750 ks), NuSTAR ({\sim}60 ks), XMM-Newton ({\sim}75 ks), and NICER ({\sim}65 ks) pointings. NGC 4151 is the first Type 1 radio-quiet Seyfert galaxy with constrained polarization properties for the X-ray corona. Despite the lower flux state in which the source is re-observed and the resulting higher contribution of the constant reflection component in the IXPE energy band, our results are in agreement with the first detection. From the polarimetric analysis, a polarization degree {\Pi} = 4.7 {\pm} 1.3 per cent and angle {\Psi} = 77{\deg} {\pm} 8{\deg} east of north (68 per cent confidence level) are derived in the 2.0 - 8.0 keV energy range. Combining the two observations leads to polarization properties that are more constrained than those of the individual detections, showing {\Pi} = 4.5 {\pm} 0.9 per cent and {\Psi} = 81{\deg} {\pm} 6{\deg} (with detection significance {\sim}4.6{\sigma}). The observed polarization angle aligns very well with the radio emission in this source, supporting, together with the significant polarization degree, a slab or wedge geometry for the X-ray corona. However, a switch in the polarization angle at low energies (37{\deg} {\pm} 7{\deg} in the 2 - 3.5 keV bin) suggests the presence of another component. When it is included in the spectro-polarimetric fit, a high polarization degree disfavors an interpretation in terms of a leakage through the absorbers, rather pointing to scattering from some kind of mirror.</description>

      <title>Fermi acceleration under Lorentz invariance violation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17254v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, the acceleration of particles in astrophysical sources by the Fermi mechanism is revisited under the assumption of Lorentz invariance violation (LIV). We calculate the energy spectrum and the acceleration time of particles leaving the source as a function of the energy beyond which the Lorentz invariance violation becomes relevant. Lorentz invariance violation causes significant changes in the acceleration of particles by the first and second-order Fermi mechanisms. The energy spectrum of particles accelerated by first-order Fermi mechanism under LIV assumption shows a strong suppression for energies above the break. The calculations presented here complete the scenario for LIV searches with astroparticles by showing, for the first time, how the benchmark acceleration mechanisms (Fermi) are modified under LIV assumption.</description>

      <title>Demonstrating sub-electron noise performance in Single electron Sensitive Readout (SiSeRO) devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16754v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Single electron Sensitive Read Out (SiSeRO) is a novel on-chip charge detection technology that can, in principle, provide significantly greater responsivity and improved noise performance than traditional charge coupled device (CCD) readout circuitry. The SiSeRO, developed by MIT Lincoln Laboratory, uses a p-MOSFET transistor with a depleted back-gate region under the transistor channel; as charge is transferred into the back gate region, the transistor current is modulated. With our first generation SiSeRO devices, we previously achieved a responsivity of around 800 pA per electron, an equivalent noise charge (ENC) of 4.5 electrons root mean square (RMS), and a full width at half maximum (FWHM) spectral resolution of 130 eV at 5.9 keV, at a readout speed of 625 Kpixel/s and for a detector temperature of 250 K. Importantly, since the charge signal remains unaffected by the SiSeRO readout process, we have also been able to implement Repetitive Non-Destructive Readout (RNDR), achieving an improved ENC performance. In this paper, we demonstrate sub-electron noise sensitivity with these devices, utilizing an enhanced test setup optimized for RNDR measurements, with excellent temperature control, improved readout circuitry, and advanced digital filtering techniques. We are currently fabricating new SiSeRO detectors with more sensitive and RNDR-optimized amplifier designs, which will help mature the SiSeRO technology in the future and eventually lead to the pathway to develop active pixel sensor (APS) arrays using sensitive SiSeRO amplifiers on each pixel. Active pixel devices with sub-electron sensitivity and fast readout present an exciting option for next generation, large area astronomical X-ray telescopes requiring fast, low-noise megapixel imagers.</description>

Abstract: Future strategic X-ray satellite telescopes, such as the probe-class Advanced X-ray Imaging Satellite (AXIS), will require excellent soft energy response in their imaging detectors to enable maximum discovery potential. In order to characterize Charge-Coupled Device (CCD) and Single Electron Sensitive Read Output (SiSeRO) detectors in the soft X-ray region, the X-ray Astronomy and Observational Cosmology (XOC) group at Stanford has developed, assembled, and commissioned a 2.5-meter-long X-ray beamline test system. The beamline is designed to efficiently produce monoenergetic X-ray fluorescence lines in the 0.3-10 keV energy range and achieve detector temperatures as low as 173 K. We present design and simulation details of the beamline, and discuss the vacuum, cooling, and X-ray fluorescence performance achieved. As a workhorse for future detector characterization at Stanford, the XOC beamline will support detector development for a broad range of X-ray astronomy instruments.</description>

      <title>X-ray speed reading with the MCRC: prototype success and next generation upgrades</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16759v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Advanced X-ray Imaging Satellite (AXIS) is a NASA probe class mission concept designed to deliver arcsecond resolution with an effective area ten times that of Chandra (at launch). The AXIS focal plane features an MIT Lincoln Laboratory (MIT-LL) X-ray charge-coupled device (CCD) detector working in conjunction with an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC), denoted the Multi-Channel Readout Chip (MCRC). While this readout ASIC targets the AXIS mission, it is applicable to a range of potential X-ray missions with comparable readout requirements. Designed by the X-ray astronomy and Observational Cosmology (XOC) group at Stanford University, the MCRC ASIC prototype (MCRC-V1.0) uses a 350 nm technology node and provides 8 channels of high speed, low noise, low power consumption readout electronics. Each channel implements a current source to bias the detector output driver, a preamplifier to provide gain, and an output buffer to interface directly to an analog-to-digital (ADC) converter. The MCRC-V1 ASIC exhibits comparable performance to our best discrete electronics implementations, but with ten times less power consumption and a fraction of the footprint area. In a total ionizing dose (TID) test, the chip demonstrated a radiation hardness equal or greater to 25 krad, confirming the suitability of the process technology and layout techniques used in its design. The next iteration of the ASIC (MCRC-V2) will expand the channel count and extend the interfaces to external circuits, advancing its readiness as a readout-on-a-chip solution for next generation X-ray CCD-like detectors. This paper summarizes our most recent characterization efforts, including the TID radiation campaign and results from the first operation of the MCRC ASIC in combination with a representative MIT-LL CCD.</description>

      <title>Continued developments in X-ray speed reading: fast, low noise readout for next-generation wide-field imagers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16761v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Future strategic X-ray astronomy missions will require unprecedentedly sensitive wide-field imagers providing high frame rates, low readout noise and excellent soft energy response. To meet these needs, our team is employing a multi-pronged approach to advance several key areas of technology. Our first focus is on advanced readout electronics, specifically integrated electronics, where we are collaborating on the VERITAS readout chip for the Athena Wide Field Imager, and have developed the Multi-Channel Readout Chip (MCRC), which enables fast readout and high frame rates for MIT-LL JFET (junction field effect transistor) CCDs. Second, we are contributing to novel detector development, specifically the SiSeRO (Single electron Sensitive Read Out) devices fabricated at MIT Lincoln Laboratory, and their advanced readout, to achieve sub-electron noise performance. Hardware components set the stage for performance, but their efficient utilization relies on software and algorithms for signal and event processing. Our group is developing digital waveform filtering and AI methods to augment detector performance, including enhanced particle background screening and improved event characterization. All of these efforts make use of an efficient, new X-ray beamline facility at Stanford, where components and concepts can be tested and characterized.</description>

      <title>Augmenting astronomical X-ray detectors with AI for enhanced sensitivity and reduced background</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16764v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bringing artificial intelligence (AI) alongside next-generation X-ray imaging detectors, including CCDs and DEPFET sensors, enhances their sensitivity to achieve many of the flagship science cases targeted by future X-ray observatories, based upon low surface brightness and high redshift sources. Machine learning algorithms operating on the raw frame-level data provide enhanced identification of background vs. astrophysical X-ray events, by considering all of the signals in the context within which they appear within each frame. We have developed prototype machine learning algorithms to identify valid X-ray and cosmic-ray induced background events, trained and tested upon a suite of realistic end-to-end simulations that trace the interaction of cosmic ray particles and their secondaries through the spacecraft and detector. These algorithms demonstrate that AI can reduce the unrejected instrumental background by up to 41.5 per cent compared with traditional filtering methods. Alongside AI algorithms to reduce the instrumental background, next-generation event reconstruction methods, based upon fitting physically-motivated Gaussian models of the charge clouds produced by events within the detector, promise increased accuracy and spectral resolution of the lowest energy photon events.</description>

      <title>Where is the Supervirial hot gas? I: A pilot study with sightlines to Galactic X-ray binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16790v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hot, \logT\ $\sim$ 7.5, gas was recently discovered in the Milky Way in extragalactic sightlines. In order to determine its location, here we present sightlines to Galactic X-ray binaries (XRBs) passing through the Interstellar Medium (ISM). In this pilot study we investigate absorption features of \SXVI, \SiXIV, and \NeX\ in the spectra of three XRBs, namely 4U 1735-44, 4U 1820-30, and Cyg X-2, using Chandra High Energy Transmission Grating archival observations. We do not detect any of these lines. {We determine the 2$\sigma$ upper limit for the equivalent widths of the undetected absorption lines and the column densities of the corresponding ions.} We note that the 2$\sigma$ upper limits for \SXVI\ \Ka\ and \SiXIV\ \Ka\ are an order of magnitude smaller than those previously detected in the extragalactic sightlines. Our finding suggests that if any gas at \logT\ $&gt;7$ is present in the Galactic ISM, it is unlikely to be ubiquitous. This is an important result because it implies that \SXVI, \SiXIV\ {and \NeX\ }absorption detected in extragalactic sightlines is not from the ISM, but is likely from a hot gas phase in the extraplanar region beyond the ISM or in the extended CGM.</description>

      <title>Simulation study of performance of the Very Large Area gamma-ray Space Telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16973v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Very Large Area gamma-ray Space Telescope (VLAST) is a mission concept proposed to detect gamma-ray photons through both the Compton scattering and electron-positron pair production mechanisms, enabling the detection of photons with energies ranging from MeV to TeV. This project aims to conduct a comprehensive survey of the gamma-ray sky from a low Earth orbit using an anti-coincidence detector, a tracker detector that also serves as a low energy calorimeter, and a high energy imaging calorimeter. We developed a Monte Carlo simulation application of the detector with the GEANT4 toolkit to evaluate the instrument performance including the effective area, angular resolution and energy resolution, as well as explored specific optimizations of the detector configuration. Our simulation-based analysis indicates that the VLAST's current design is physically feasible, with an acceptance larger than 10~$\rm m^2\ sr$ which is four times larger than Fermi-LAT, an energy resolution better than 2\% at 10~GeV, and an angular resolution better than 0.2 degrees at 10~GeV. The VLAST project is expected to make significant contribution to the field of gamma-ray astronomy and to enhance our understanding of the cosmos.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16989v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using adiabatic point-particle black hole perturbation theory, we simulate plausible gravitational wave~(GW) signatures in two exotic scenarios (i) where a small black hole is emitted by a larger one ('black hole emission') and (ii) where a small black hole is emitted by a larger one and subsequently absorbed back ('black hole absorption'). While such scenarios are forbidden in general relativity!(GR), alternative theories (such as certain quantum gravity scenarios obeying the weak gravity conjecture, white holes, and Hawking radiation) may allow them. By leveraging the phenomenology of black hole emission and absorption signals, we introduce straightforward modifications to existing gravitational waveform models to mimic gravitational radiation associated with these exotic events. We anticipate that these (incomplete but) initial simulations, coupled with the adjusted waveform models, will aid in the development of null tests for GR using GWs.</description>

      <title>Ion-electron instabilities in the precursor of weakly magnetized, transrelativistic shocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17137v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Collisionless shocks are known to induce turbulence via upstream ion reflection within the precursor region. This study elucidates the properties of electrostatic and electromagnetic instabilities, exploring their role over the transrelativistic range. Notably, the growth of oblique Buneman waves and previously overlooked, secondary small-scale ion-electron instabilities is observed to be particularly promoted in the relativistic regime. Furthermore, the growth of large-scale electromagnetic modes encounters severe limitations in any cold, baryon-loaded precursor. It is argued that electron pre-heating in electrostatic modes may alleviate these constraints, facilitating the subsequent growth of large-scale filamentation modes in the precursor of transrelativistic shocks.</description>

Abstract: The Instrument Control Software of SOXS (Son Of X-Shooter), the forthcoming spectrograph for the ESO New Technology Telescope at the La Silla Observatory, has reached a mature state of development and is approaching the crucial Preliminary Acceptance in Europe phase. Now that all the subsystems have been integrated in the laboratories of the Padova Astronomical Observatory, the team operates for testing purposes with the whole instrument at both engineering and scientific level. These activities will make use of a set of software peculiarities that will be discussed in this contribution. In particular, we focus on the synoptic panel, the co-rotator system special device, on the Active Flexure Compensation system which controls two separate piezo tip-tilt devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17335v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the structure and radial oscillations of anisotropic compact stars composed of dark energy, using the vanishing complexity factor formalism within general relativity. This novel approach establishes a direct link between the energy density and anisotropic factor, providing a robust framework for studying these exotic stellar objects. Employing an Extended Chaplygin Gas equation of state, we numerically compute interior solutions for both isotropic and anisotropic stars, revealing distinct differences in their properties. Additionally, we examine the oscillation modes and frequencies of these stars, highlighting the impact of anisotropy on their pulsational behavior. Our results reveal distinct differences in the stellar properties, such as the metric potentials, pressure, speed of sound, and relativistic adiabatic index, between the two cases. Furthermore, we calculate the large frequency separation for the fundamental and first excited modes, offering insights relevant for future asteroseismology studies. Our findings shed light on the complex interplay of gravity, matter, and anisotropy in compact stars, providing a new perspective on dark energy's role in their structure and dynamics.</description>

      <title>Different spectra of cosmic ray H, He and heavier nuclei escaping compact star clusters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.11663v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cosmic ray acceleration at the termination shock of compact star clusters has recently received much attention, mainly because of the detection of gamma ray emission from some of such astrophysical sources. Here we focus on the acceleration of nuclei at the termination shock and we investigate the role played by proton energy losses and spallation reactions of nuclei, especially downstream of the shock. We show that for a reasonable choice of the mean gas density in the cavity excavated by the cluster wind, dominated by the presence of dense clouds, the spectrum of He nuclei escaping the bubble is systematically harder than the spectrum of hydrogen, in a manner that appears to be qualitatively consistent with the observed and yet unexplained phenomenon of discrepant hardening. We also find that, in this scenario, the spallation reactions of heavier nuclei are likely to be so severe that their spectra become very hard and with a low normalization, meaning that it is unlikely that heavy nuclei escaping star clusters can provide a sizeable contribution to the spectrum of cosmic rays at the Earth. Limitations and implications of this scenario are discussed.</description>

Abstract: We present an incremental version (4FGL-DR4, for Data Release 4) of the fourth Fermi-LAT catalog containing 7194 gamma-ray sources. Based on the first 14 years of science data in the energy range from 50 MeV to 1 TeV, it uses the same analysis methods as the 4FGL-DR3 catalog did for 12 years of data, with only a few improvements. The spectral parameters, spectral energy distributions, light curves and associations are updated for all sources.
  We add four new extended sources and modify two existing ones. Among the 6658 4FGL-DR3 sources, we delete 14 and change the localization of 10, while 32 are newly associated, eleven associations are changed and three associations are discarded. We add 546 point sources, among which 8 are considered identified and 229 have a plausible counterpart at other wavelengths. Most are just above the detection threshold, and 14 are transient sources below the detection threshold that can affect the light curves of nearby sources.</description>

      <title>Detecting the early optical flashes of gamma-ray bursts with small telescope arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.04361v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an observational approach for the independent detection of the early optical emission of long gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). For this purpose, we explore the potential of the Large Array Survey Telescope (LAST). This array of small optical telescopes can be used to scan a wide region of the sky, and to focus on a smaller field of view with increased sensitivity, as needed. The modularity of the array facilitates dynamic scanning of multiple fields, by shifting telescope pointing directions with high cadence. This can significantly increase the effective sky coverage of a blind survey on short time scales. For events associated with gamma-ray counterparts, the valuable early time data can supplement high-energy observations. Regardless of gamma-ray association, detections can potentially be used to explore various phenomena associated with GRBs, such as orphan afterglows; dirty fireballs; and choked jets. We simulate a sample of GRBs and their respective optical signals at early times. After accounting for dynamic cadence, the light curves are given as input to a machine learning classifier, used to identify astrophysical transients. We find that by dedicating half of a LAST array to a blind search, one would expect to independently detect 7-11 GRBs per year, corresponding to an approximate intrinsic event rate of 0.12 per square degree per year.</description>

      <title>The transient event in NGC 1566 from 2017 to 2019 -- I. An eccentric accretion disk and a turbulent, disk-dominated broad-line region unveiled by double-peaked Ca II and O I lines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.12054v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: NGC 1566 is known for exhibiting recurrent outbursts, which are accompanied by changes in spectral type. The most recent transient event occurred from 2017 to 2019 and was reported to be accompanied by a change in Seyfert classification from Seyfert 1.8 to Seyfert 1.2. We analyze data from an optical spectroscopic variability campaign of NGC 1566 taken with the 9.2m SALT between July 2018 and October 2019 and supplement our data set with optical to near-infrared spectroscopic archival data taken by VLT/MUSE in September 2015 and October 2017. We observe the emergence and fading of a strong power-law-like blue continuum as well as strong variations in the Balmer, HeI, HeII lines and the coronal lines [FeVII], [FeX] and [FeXI]. Moreover, we detect broad double-peaked emission line profiles of OI 8446 and the CaII 8498,8542,8662 triplet. This is the first time that genuine double-peaked OI 8446 and CaII 8498,8542,8662 emission in AGN is reported in the literature. All broad lines show a clear redward asymmetry with respect to their central wavelength and we find indications for a significant blueward drift of the total line profiles during the transient event. We show that the double-peaked emission line profiles are well approximated by emission from a low-inclination, relativistic eccentric accretion disk, and that single-peaked profiles can be obtained by broadening due to scale-height dependent turbulence. Small-scale features in the OI and CaII lines suggest the presence of inhomogeneities in the broad-line region. We conclude that the broad-line region in NGC 1566 is dominated by the kinematics of a relativistic eccentric accretion disk. The broad-line region can be modeled to be vertically stratified with respect to scale-height turbulence. The observed blueward drift might be attributed to a low-optical-depth wind launched during the transient event.</description>

      <title>The variable radio jet of the accreting neutron star the Rapid Burster</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19827v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Rapid Burster is a unique neutron star low-mass X-ray binary system, showing both thermonuclear Type-I and accretion-driven Type-II X-ray bursts. Recent studies have demonstrated how coordinated observations of X-ray and radio variability can constrain jet properties of accreting neutron stars - particularly when the X-ray variability is dominated by discrete changes. We present a simultaneous VLA, Swift, and INTEGRAL observing campaign of the Rapid Burster to investigate whether its jet responds to Type-II bursts. We observe the radio counterpart of the X-ray binary at its faintest-detected radio luminosity, while the X-ray observations reveal prolific, fast X-ray bursting. A time-resolved analysis reveals that the radio counterpart varies significantly between observing scans, displaying a fractional variability of $38 \pm 5$%. The radio faintness of the system prevents the robust identification of a causal relation between individual Type-II bursts and the evolution of the radio jet. However, based on a comparison of its low radio luminosity with archival Rapid Burster observations and other accreting neutron stars, and on a qualitative assessment of the X-ray and radio light curves, we explore the presence of a tentative connection between bursts and jet: i.e., the Type-II bursts may weaken or strengthen the jet. The former of those two scenarios would fit with magneto-rotational jet models; we discuss three lines of future research to establish this potential relation between Type-II bursts and jets more confidently.</description>

      <title>Atmospheric Response for MeV Gamma Rays Observed with Balloon-Borne Detectors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.03534v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The atmospheric response for MeV gamma rays (~ 0.1 - 10 MeV) can be characterized in terms of two observed components. The first component is due to photons that reach the detector without scattering. The second component is due to photons that reach the detector after scattering one or more times. While the former can be determined in a straightforward manner, the latter is much more complex to quantify, as it requires tracking the transport of all source photons that are incident on Earth's atmosphere. The scattered component can cause a significant energy-dependent distortion in the measured spectrum, which is important to account for when making balloon-borne observations. In this work we simulate the full response for gamma-ray transport in the atmosphere. We find that the scattered component becomes increasingly more significant towards lower energies, and at 0.1 MeV it may increase the measured flux by as much as a factor of ~2-4, depending on the photon index and off-axis angle of the source. This is particularly important for diffuse sources, whereas the effect from scattering can be significantly reduced for point sources observed with an imaging telescope.</description>

      <title>Investigating the interplay between the coronal properties and the hard X-ray variability of active galactic nuclei with NuSTAR</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06769v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Active galactic nuclei (AGN) are extremely variable in the X-ray band down to very short timescales. However, the driver behind the X-ray variability is still poorly understood. Previous results suggest that the hot corona responsible for the primary Comptonized emission observed in AGN is expected to play an important role in driving the X-ray variability. In this work, we investigate the connection between the X-ray amplitude variability and the coronal physical parameters; namely, the temperature ($kT$) and optical depth ($\tau$). We present the spectral and timing analysis of 46 {\it NuSTAR} observations corresponding to a sample of 20 AGN. For each source, we derived the coronal temperature and optical depth through X-ray spectroscopy and computed the normalized excess variance for different energy bands on a timescale of $10$ ks. We find a strong inverse correlation between $kT$ and $\tau$, with correlation coefficient of $r&lt;-0.9$ and negligible null probability. No clear dependence was found among the temperature and physical properties, such as the black hole mass or the Eddington ratio. We also see that the observed X-ray variability is not correlated with either the coronal temperature or optical depth under the thermal equilibrium assumption, whereas it is anticorrelated with the black hole mass. These results can be interpreted through a scenario where the observed X-ray variability could primarily be driven by variations in the coronal physical properties on a timescale of less than $10$~ks; whereas we assume thermal equilibrium on such timescales in this work, given the capability of the currently available hard X-ray telescopes. Alternatively, it is also possible that the X-ray variability is mostly driven by the absolute size of the corona, which depends on the supermassive black hole mass, rather than resulting from any of its physical properties.</description>

      <title>GRBAlpha and VZLUSAT-2: GRB observations with CubeSats after 3 years of operations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12555v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: GRBAlpha is a 1U CubeSat launched in March 2021 to a sun-synchronous LEO at an altitude of 550 km to perform an in-orbit demonstration of a novel gamma-ray burst detector developed for CubeSats. VZLUSAT-2 followed ten months later in a similar orbit carrying as a secondary payload a pair of identical detectors as used on the first mission. These instruments detecting gamma-rays in the range of 30-900 keV consist of a 56 cm2 5 mm thin CsI(Tl) scintillator read-out by a row of multi-pixel photon counters (MPPC or SiPM). The scientific motivation is to detect gamma-ray bursts and other HE transient events and serve as a pathfinder for a larger constellation of nanosatellites that could localize these events via triangulation.
  At the beginning of July 2024, GRBAlpha detected 140 such transients, while VZLUSAT-2 had 83 positive detections, confirmed by larger GRB missions. Almost a hundred of them are identified as gamma-ray bursts, including extremely bright GRB 221009A and GRB 230307A, detected by both satellites. We were able to characterize the degradation of SiPMs in polar orbit and optimize the duty cycle of the detector system also by using SatNOGS radio network for downlink.</description>

      <title>Flares from plasmoids and current sheets around Sgr A*</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14312v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The supermassive black hole Sgr A* at the center of our galaxy produces repeating near-infrared flares that are observed by ground and space based instruments. This activity has been simulated in the past with Magnetically Arrested Disk (MAD) models which include stable jet formations. The present study uses a different approach in that it considers a Standard and Normal Evolution (SANE) multi-loop model that lacks a stable jet structure. The main objective of this research is to identify regions that contain current sheets and high magnetic turbulence, and to subsequently generate a 2.2 micron light curve generated from non-thermal particles. Additionally, we investigate the properties of the flares, in particular, their evolution during flare events, and the similarity of flare characteristics between the generated and observed light curves. 2D GRMHD simulation data from a SANE multi-loop model is employed, and thermal radiation is introduced to generate a 230 GHz light curve. Physical variables are calibrated to align with the 230 GHz observations. Current sheets are identified by analyzing toroidal currents, magnetization, plasma beta, density, and dimensionless temperatures. The evolution of current sheets during flare events is studied, and higher-energy non-thermal light curves are calculated, focusing on the 2.2 micron near-infrared range. We obtain promising 2.2 micron light curves whose flare duration and spectral index behavior align well with observations. Our findings support the association of flares with particle acceleration and nonthermal emission in current sheet plasmoid chains and in the boundary of the disk inside the funnel above and below the central black hole.</description>

      <title>Energy-dependent and energy-integrated two-moment general-relativistic neutrino transport simulations of hypermassive neutron star</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16017v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compare two-moment based \emph{energy-dependent} and 3 variants of \emph{energy-integrated} neutrino transport general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamics simulations of hypermassive neutron star. To study the impacts due to the choice of the neutrino transport schemes, we perform simulations with the same setups and input neutrino microphysics. We show that the main differences between energy-dependent and energy-integrated neutrino transport are found in the disk and ejecta properties, as well as in the neutrino signals. The properties of the disk surrounding the neutron star and the ejecta in energy-dependent transport are very different from the ones obtained using energy-integrated schemes. Specifically, in the energy-dependent case, the disk is more neutron-rich at early times, and becomes geometrically thicker at later times. In addition, the ejecta is more massive, and on average more neutron-rich in the energy-dependent simulations. Moreover, the average neutrino energies and luminosities are about 30\% higher. Energy-dependent neutrino transport is necessary if one wants to better model the neutrino signals and matter outflows from neutron star merger remnants via numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Accretion, Evaporation and Superradiance Phase Diagram of (Primordial) Black Holes and $10^{-21}-10^{21}$ eV Scalar, Vector, Tensor Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.08267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.08267v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We obtain the accretion, evaporation and superradiance phase diagram of astrophysical and primordial black holes in the mass range $10^{-33}-10^{11} \, M_\odot $. This black hole mass range corresponds to production of $10^{-21} - 10^{21}$ eV particles for superradiance (bosons) and evaporation (bosons and fermions). Only accretion and superradiance processes are relevant for heavy black holes, on the other hand for light black holes of primordial origin, all three processes can be relevant. We find that superradiance instability can happen even for black hole spin values as low as $10^{-9}-10^{-2}$. Since light black holes are very unstable to these perturbations and sensitive probes of bosonic particles, a single moderately spinning BH can probe 2-9 orders of magnitude of mass parameter space depending on the nature of the perturbations that are scalar (axion), vector (dark photon and/or photon with effective mass) and spin-2. If spinning black holes are observed, namely superradiance is not observed, due to self-interactions, we find limits on the axion decay constant and energy density.</description>

      <title>Footprints of the QCD Crossover on Cosmological Gravitational Waves at Pulsar Timing Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.17136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.17136v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Pulsar Timing Arrays (PTAs) have reported evidence for a stochastic gravitational wave (GW) background at nHz frequencies, possibly originating in the early Universe. We show that the spectral shape of the low-frequency (causality) tail of GW signals sourced at temperatures around $T\gtrsim 1$ GeV is distinctively affected by confinement of strong interactions (QCD), due to the corresponding sharp decrease in the number of relativistic species. Bayesian analyses in the NANOGrav 15 years and the previous International PTA datasets reveal a significant improvement in the fit with respect to cubic power-law spectra, previously employed for the causality tail. This suggests that the inclusion of Standard Model effects on GWs can have a potentially decisive impact on model selection.</description>

      <title>Probing Light Dark Matter through Cosmic-Ray Cooling in Active Galactic Nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.09460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.09460v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent observations of high-energy neutrinos from active galactic nuclei (AGN), NGC 1068 and TXS 0506+056, suggest that cosmic rays (CRs) are accelerated in the vicinity of the central supermassive black hole and high-energy protons and electrons can cool efficiently via interactions with ambient photons and gas. The dark matter density may be significantly enhanced near the central black hole, and CRs could lose energies predominantly due to scatterings with the ambient dark matter particles. We propose CR cooling in AGN as a new probe of dark matter-proton and dark matter-electron scatterings. Under plausible astrophysical assumptions, our constraints on sub-GeV dark matter can be the strongest derived to date. Some of the parameter space favored by thermal light dark matter models might already be probed with current multimessenger observations of AGN.</description>

      <title>$\textit{Kilonova Seekers}$: the GOTO project for real-time citizen science in time-domain astrophysics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02334v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Time-domain astrophysics continues to grow rapidly, with the inception of new surveys drastically increasing data volumes. Democratised, distributed approaches to training sets for machine learning classifiers are crucial to make the most of this torrent of discovery -- with citizen science approaches proving effective at meeting these requirements. In this paper, we describe the creation of and the initial results from the $\textit{Kilonova Seekers}$ citizen science project, built to find transient phenomena from the GOTO telescopes in near real-time. $\textit{Kilonova Seekers}$ launched in July 2023 and received over 600,000 classifications from approximately 2,000 volunteers over the course of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA O4a observing run. During this time, the project has yielded 20 discoveries, generated a `gold-standard' training set of 17,682 detections for augmenting deep-learned classifiers, and measured the performance and biases of Zooniverse volunteers on real-bogus classification. This project will continue throughout the lifetime of GOTO, pushing candidates at ever-greater cadence, and directly facilitate the next-generation classification algorithms currently in development.</description>

      <title>What no one has seen before: gravitational waveforms from warp drive collapse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02466v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite originating in science fiction, warp drives have a concrete description in general relativity, with Alcubierre first proposing a spacetime metric that supported faster-than-light travel. Whilst there are numerous practical barriers to their implementation in real life, including a requirement for negative energy, computationally, one can simulate their evolution in time given an equation of state describing the matter. In this work, we study the signatures arising from a warp drive "containment failure", assuming a stiff equation of state for the fluid. We compute the emitted gravitational-wave signal and track the energy fluxes of the fluid. Apart from its rather speculative application to the search for extraterrestrial life in gravitational-wave detector data, this work is interesting as a study of the dynamical evolution and stability of spacetimes that violate the null energy condition. Our work highlights the importance of exploring strange new spacetimes, to (boldly) simulate what no one has seen before.</description>
