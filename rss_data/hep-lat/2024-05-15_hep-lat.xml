      <title>Quark and gluon momentum fractions in the pion and in the kaon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the full decomposition of the momentum fraction carried by quarks and gluons in the pion and the kaon. We employ three gauge ensembles generated with $N_f=2+1+1$ Wilson twisted-mass clover-improved fermions at the physical quark masses. For both mesons we perform a continuum extrapolation directly at the physical pion mass, which allows us to determine for the first time the momentum decomposition at the physical point. We find that the total momentum fraction carried by quarks is 0.532(56) and 0.618(32) and by gluons 0.388(49) and 0.408(61) in the pion and in the kaon, respectively, in the $\overline{\mathrm{MS}}$ scheme and at the renormalization scale of 2 GeV.
  Having computed both the quark and gluon contributions in the continuum limit, we find that the momentum sum is 0.926(68) for the pion and 1.046(90) for the kaon, verifying the momentum sum rule.</description>

      <title>2023 update of the extraction of the CKM matrix elements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08046v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: I discuss the extraction of the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix elements under the Standard Model (SM) framework from a global fit combining observables that satisfy the double requirement of being precisely known both experimentally and theoretically. The analysis shown here relies on the CKMfitter package, consisting of a frequentist approach that employs the Range fit (Rfit) scheme to handle theoretical uncertainties.</description>

      <title>From the Quantum Breakdown Model to the Lattice Gauge Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08273v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The one-dimensional quantum breakdown model, which features spatially asymmetric fermionic interactions simulating the electrical breakdown phenomenon, exhibits an exponential U(1) symmetry and a variety of dynamical phases including many-body localization and quantum chaos with quantum scar states. We investigate the minimal quantum breakdown model with the minimal number of on-site fermion orbitals required for the interaction, and identify a large number of local conserved charges in the model. We then reveal a mapping between the minimal quantum breakdown model in certain charge sectors and a quantum link model which simulates the $U(1)$ lattice gauge theory, and show that the local conserved charges map to the gauge symmetry generators. A special charge sector of the model further maps to the PXP model, which shows quantum many-body scars. This mapping unveils the rich dynamics in different Krylov subspaces characterized by different gauge configurations in the quantum breakdown model.</description>

      <title>Polyakov-loop phase, Roberge-Weiss periodicity and thermodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08333v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss the role of Roberge-Weiss periodicity in the thermodynamics of quantum chromodynamics at moderately high temperature, where the semi-quark-gluon plasma is expected. From the construction of the grand canonical partition function at zero and also at finite density via the canonical approach, we can discuss the relation between contributions of the Polyakov-loop phase and Roberge-Weiss periodicity. Then, we can conclude that the existence of Roberge-Weiss periodicity is a necessary condition to reproduce exact results at moderately high temperature.</description>

      <title>Dispersive approaches for the HVP and HLbL contributions to $(g-2)_\mu$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08500v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Calculations based on the analytic properties of the required matrix elements allow for a wide range of applications constraining the hadronic contributions to the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon $a_\mu=(g-2)_\mu/2$, both hadronic vacuum polarization (HVP) and hadronic light-by-light (HLbL) scattering. Here, we discuss such recent applications, including analyticity constraints on hadronic cross sections, radiative corrections, and isospin-breaking effects.</description>

      <title>On Holographic Vacuum Misalignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08714v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a bottom-up holographic model that provides the dual description of a strongly coupled field theory, in which the spontaneous breaking of an approximate global symmetry yields the SO(5)/SO(4) coset relevant to minimal composite-Higgs models. The gravity background is completely regular and smooth, and has an end of space that mimics confinement on the field theory side. We add to the gravity description a set of localised boundary terms, that introduce additional symmetry-breaking effects, capturing those that would result from coupling the dual strongly coupled field theory to an external, weakly coupled sector. Such terms encapsulate the gauging of a subgroup of the global $SO(5)$ symmetry of the dual field theory, as well as additional explicit symmetry-breaking effects. We show how to combine spurions and gauge fixing and how to take the appropriate limits, so as to respect gauge principles and avoid violations of unitarity.
  The interplay of bulk and boundary-localised couplings leads to the breaking of the SO(5) symmetry to either its SO(4) or SO(3) subgroup, via vacuum misalignment. In field theory terms, the model describes the spontaneous breaking of a SO(4) gauge symmetry to its SO(3) subgroup. We expose the implications of the higgsing phenomenon by computing the spectrum of fluctuations of the model, which we interpret in four-dimensional field-theory terms, for a few interesting choices of parameters. We conclude by commenting on the additional steps needed to build a realistic composite Higgs model.</description>

      <title>Towards the quark mass dependence of $T_{cc}^+$ from lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14715v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The $DD^*$ scattering phase shifts in the $T_{cc}^+=cc\bar{u}\bar{d}$ channel are extracted from lattice QCD for five different charm quark masses and a fixed light-quark mass corresponding to $m_\pi\simeq 280$~MeV. The phase shifts are analysed employing two approaches: effective range expansion and Lippmann--Schwinger equation derived in the effective field theory. In the latter case, the results imply an attraction at short range parametrised by contact terms and a slight repulsion at long range mediated by one-pion exchange with $m_\pi &gt;m_{D^*}-m_D$. The poles in the amplitude across the complex energy plane are extracted and their trajectories are discussed as the charm quark mass is varied. Two complex conjugate poles corresponding to a resonance below threshold are found for $m_c$ close to the physical value. They turn into a pair of virtual states at the largest $m_c$ studied. With further increasing $m_c$, one virtual pole representing $T_{cc}^+$ is expected to move towards the two-body threshold and turn into a bound state. The light-quark mass dependence of the $T_{cc}^+$ pole is briefly discussed using the data on $DD^*$ scattering from other lattice collaborations.</description>

      <title>Light quarkonium hybrid mesons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.19006v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the light quarkonium hybrid mesons of various spin-parities in QCD. Considering different interpolating currents made of the valence light quarks and single gluon, we calculate the mass and current coupling of the strange and nonstrange members of light hybrid mesons by including into computations the nonperturbative quark and gluon condensates up to ten dimensions in order to increase the accuracy of the results. The obtained results may be useful for future experimental searches of these hypothetical states. They can also be used in the calculations of different parameters related to the decays/interactions of light hybrid mesons to/with other states.</description>
