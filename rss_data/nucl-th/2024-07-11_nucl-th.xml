      <title>Mean-field derived IBM-1 Hamiltonian with intrinsic triaxial deformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07101v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An interacting-boson-model-1 (IBM-1) Hamiltonian, derived from self-consistent mean-field calculations using a Skyrme energy density functional is employed for the study of energy spectra and $B(E2)$ transition strengths in the even-even $^{162-184}\mathrm{Hf}$ and $^{168-186}\mathrm{W}$. An intrinsic triaxial deformation, derived from fermionic proxy-SU(3) irreps, is incorporated into the IBM-1 potential energy curve, which is subsequently mapped to the fermionic one, in order to derive the parameters of the IBM-1 Hamiltonian. It is shown that the inclusion of the intrinsic triaxial deformation derived from the proxy-SU(3) irreps leads to a significantly improved agreement between the theoretical predictions and experimental data for the low-lying quadrupole bands in the examined isotopes, without the need of higher-order terms in the IBM-1 Hamiltonian. The calculated $B(E2)$ transition strengths are also improved, compared to the axially symmetric case. The recently suggested preponderance of triaxial deformation over extended regions of the nuclear chart is obtained as a by-product. Future potential improvements and extensions to this mapping approach are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Triply-heavy/strange baryons with Cornell potential on a quantum computer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07232v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a computation of triply-heavy baryons on a quantum computer, employing the Cornell quark model in line with the earlier quarkonium work of Gallimore and Liao. These baryons are some of the most interesting Standard Model particles which have not yet been detected, as they bear on the short range (colour) behaviour of the nuclear force. The spectrum here obtained is compatible with predictions from earlier works, with our uncertainty dominated by traditional few-body approximations (size of the variational basis, center of mass recoil, parameter estimation...) and not by the statistical error from the quantum computer (deployed here as a small diagonalizer), which turns out to be negligible respect to the other sources of uncertainty, at least in the present unsophisticated few-body approximation. We have also substituted one or more heavy quarks for strange quarks.</description>

      <title>Angular anisotropy of secondary neutron spectra in $^{232}$Th+n</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07274v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neutron emission spectra (NES) of $^{232}$Th+n interaction provide strong evidence of angular anisotropy of secondary neutron emission, another evidence might be predicted in $^{232}$Th%(n,F)% prompt fission neutron spectra (PFNS). In case of NES observed angular anisotropy is presumably due to angular dependence of elastic scattering, direct excitation of collective levels and preequilibrium emission of (n,nX) neutrons. In $^{232}$Th+n direct excitation data analysis, ground state band levels are coupled within rigid rotator model, while those of beta bands, gamma bands and octupole band theta are coupled within soft deformable rotator model. NES of $^{232}$Th+n at En of 6, 12, 14, 18 MeV exhaustively described. The net effect of these procedures for En up to 20 MeV is the adequate approximation of angular distributions of $^{232}$Th$(n,nX)$ first neutron inelastic scattering in continuum, which corresponds to U of 1.2-6 MeV excitations of $^{232}$Th.
  The contribution of $^{232}$Th$(n,F)$ PFNS to the NES is exceptionally low. PFNS anisotropy occurs because some portion of $(n,nX)$ neutrons might be involved in exclusive prefission neutron spectra. In $^{232}$Th$(n,xnf)$ reactions PFNS demonstrate different response to forward and backward (n,xnf) neutron emission relative to the incident neutron momentum, when compared with $^{235}$U$(n,xnf)$ or 239Pu(n,xnf) reactions. Average energy of (n,xnf) neutrons depends on the neutron emission angle theta, i.e. fission cross section, prompt neutron number and total kinetic energy are shown to vary with the angle theta as well. Exclusive neutron spectra ($n,xnf)$ at theta equal to 90 degrees are consistent with observed $^{232}$Th$(n,F)$ and $^{232}$Th$(n,xn)$ reaction cross sections within En from 1 to 20 MeV energy range.</description>

      <title>Coherent photo- and electroproduction of charmonia on nuclear targets revisited: Green function formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02219v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study for the first time the production of charmonia in nuclear ultra-peripheral and electron-ion collisions based on a rigorous Green function formalism. Such formalism allows to incorporate properly formation effects (color transparency), as well as the quantum coherence inherent in higher twist shadowing corrections related to the $|Q \bar{Q}\rangle$ Fock component of the photon. The leading twist gluon shadowing associated with multi-gluon photon fluctuations is also included within the same formalism. The later effect represents the dominant source of shadowing at mid rapidities in the LHC kinematic region, while the reduced effect of quark shadowing leads to a significant modification of differential cross sections $d\sigma/dy$ at forward and/or backwards rapidities. Model calculations for $d\sigma/dy$ are in a good agreement with available UPC data on coherent charmonium production at RHIC and the LHC. In addition, we also perform predictions for nuclear effects in the electroproduction of charmonia, which can be verified by new data from electron-ion colliders.</description>

      <title>The neutron star mass, distance, and inclination from precision timing of the brilliant millisecond pulsar J0437$-$4715</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07132v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The observation of neutron stars enables the otherwise impossible study of fundamental physical processes. Timing of binary radio pulsars is particularly powerful, as it enables precise characterization of their (three-dimensional) positions and orbits. PSR J0437$-$4715 is an important millisecond pulsar for timing array experiments and is also a primary target for the Neutron Star Interior Composition ExploreR (NICER). The main aim of the NICER mission is to constrain the neutron star equation of state by inferring the compactness ($M_p/R$) of the star. Direct measurements of the mass $M_p$ from pulsar timing therefore substantially improve constraints on the radius $R$, and the equation of state. Here we use observations spanning 26 years from Murriyang, the 64-m Parkes radio telescope, to improve the timing model for this pulsar. Among the new precise measurements are the pulsar mass $M_p=1.418\pm 0.044$ M$_{\odot}$, distance $D=156.96 \pm 0.11$ pc, and orbital inclination angle $i=137.506 \pm 0.016^\circ$, which can be used to inform the X-ray pulse profile models inferred from NICER observations. We demonstrate that these results are consistent between multiple data sets from the Parkes Pulsar Timing Array (PPTA), each modelled with different noise assumptions. Using the longest available PPTA data set, we measure an apparent second derivative of the pulsar spin frequency and discuss how this can be explained either by kinematic effects due to the proper motion and radial velocity of the pulsar, or excess low-frequency noise such as a gravitational-wave background.</description>

      <title>Estimating centrality in heavy-ion collisions using Transfer Learning technique</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07210v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we explore the applicability of Transfer Learning techniques for estimating collision centrality in terms of the number of participants ($N_{\rm part}$) in high-energy heavy-ion collisions. In the present work, we leverage popular pre-trained CNN models such as VGG16, ResNet50, and DenseNet121 to determine $N_{\rm part}$ in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s}=200$ GeV on an event-by-event basis. Remarkably, all three models achieved good performance despite the pre-trained models being trained for databases of other domains. Particularly noteworthy is the superior performance of the VGG16 model, showcasing the potential of transfer learning techniques for extracting diverse observables from heavy-ion collision data.</description>

      <title>The Proton Electromagnetic Generalized Polarizabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07597v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The electromagnetic polarizabilities are fundamental properties of the proton that characterize its response to an external EM field. The generalization of the EM polarizabilities to non-zero four-momentum transfer opens up a powerful path to study the internal structure of the proton. They map out the spatial distribution of the polarization densities in the proton, provide access to key dynamical mechanisms that contribute to the electric and the magnetic polarizability effects, and allow to determine fundamental characteristics of the system, such as the electric and the magnetic polarizability radii. This article reviews the knowledge of the proton EM generalized polarizabilities. An introduction is given to the basic concepts and to the theoretical framework, that is then followed by a discussion that emphasizes the recent developments and findings of the Virtual Compton scattering experiments and future perspectives on the topic.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Inference of Fine-Features of Nuclear Equation of State from Future Neutron Star Radius Measurements to 0.1km Accuracy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07823v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To more precisely constrain the Equation of State (EOS) of supradense neutron-rich nuclear matter, future high-precision X-ray and gravitational wave observatories are proposed to measure the radii of neutron stars (NSs) with an accuracy better than about 0.1 km. However, it remains unclear what particular aspects (other than the stiffness generally spoken of in the literature) of the EOS and to what precision they will be better constrained. In this work, within a Bayesian framework using a meta-model EOS for NSs, we infer the posterior probability distribution functions (PDFs) of incompressibility $K_{0}$ and skewness $J_{0}$ of symmetric nuclear matter (SNM) as well as the slope $L$, curvature $K_{\rm{sym}}$, and skewness $J_{\rm{sym}}$ characterizing the density dependence of nuclear symmetry energy $E_{\rm{sym}}(\rho)$, respectively, from mean values of NS radii consistent with existing observations and an expected accuracy $\Delta R$ ranging from about 1.0 km to 0.1 km. We found that (1) the $\Delta R$ has little effect on inferring the stiffness of SNM at suprasaturation densities, (2) smaller $\Delta R$ reveals more accurately not only the PDFs but also pairwise correlations among parameters characterizing high-density $E_{\rm{sym}}(\rho)$, (3) a double-peak feature of the PDF($K_{\rm{sym}}$) corresponding to the strong $K_{\rm{sym}}-J_{\rm{sym}}$ and $K_{\rm{sym}}-L$ anti-correlations is revealed when $\Delta R$ is less than about 0.2 km, (4) the high-precision radius measurement for canonical NSs is more useful than that for massive ones for constraining the EOS of nucleonic matter around (2-3) times the saturation density of SNM.</description>

      <title>Inhibition of splitting of the chiral and deconfinement transition due to rotation in QCD: the phase diagram of linear sigma model coupled to Polyakov loop</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07828v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss the effect of rigid rotation on critical temperatures of deconfinement and chiral transitions in the linear sigma model coupled to quarks and the Polyakov loop. We point out the essential role of the causality condition, which requires that any point of the system should rotate slower than the velocity of light. We show that imposing this physical requirement leads to inhibition of the splitting between the chiral and confining transitions, which becomes negligibly small ($\Delta T \sim 1$~MeV or less) for experimentally relevant, slow angular velocities $\Omega \sim 10$~MeV of a $(5-10)$~fm-sized systems. Moreover, the boundedness of the system has a much bigger effect on temperature splitting than the rotation itself: the splitting reaches 10~MeV in a small, one-fermi-sized non-rotating system. The temperature splitting may, however, become enhanced in an academic limit of ultra-relativistic regimes when the boundary of the system rotates at near-to-light velocities.</description>

      <title>Probe and Prejudice: Classification of compact objects and model comparison using EOS knowledge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07837v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nuclear theory and experiments, alongside astrophysical observations, constrain the equation of state (EOS) of supranuclear-dense matter. Conversely, knowledge of the EOS allows an improved interpretation of nuclear or astrophysical data. In this article, we use several established constraints on the EOS and the new NICER measurement of PSR J0437-4715 to comment on the nature of the primary companion in GW230529 and the companion of PSR J0514-4002E. We find that, with a probability of $\gtrsim 84\%$ and $\gtrsim 68\%$, respectively, both objects are black holes. These likelihoods increase to above $95\%$ when one uses GW170817's remnant as an upper limit on the TOV mass. We also demonstrate that the current knowledge of the EOS substantially disfavors high masses and radii for PSR J0030+0451, inferred recently when combining NICER with XMM-Newton background data and using particular hot-spot models. Finally, we also use our obtained EOS knowledge to comment on measurements of the nuclear symmetry energy, finding that the large value predicted by the PREX-II measurement displays some mild tension with other constraints on the EOS.</description>

      <title>Electron scattering cross sections for 6,7Li and 7Be nuclei within the unified electroweak theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06407v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The present study employs the multipole expansion within the unified electroweak theory to investigate the electron scattering cross sections for 6,7Li and 7Be nuclei. The multipole form factors presented in the expressions of the cross sections are directly calculated based on the many-particle shell model and fractional parentage coefficients without using any approximations. The results obtained indicate that the conventional impulse approximation can be applied to the electron-nucleus scattering only when the energy of incident electrons does not exceed twice the nucleon mass. In addition, the quasi-elastic scattering cross section of 7Li in the excitation from its ground state to the nearest excited state and that of elastic scattering in the ground state are independently treated, whereas they have not been separately measured in experiments. The calculated scattering cross sections using the V-A structure agree reasonably well with the available experimental data at low (MeV) energies and provide predictive information at high (GeV) energies. The scattering cross sections are found to rapidly decrease in all cases with increasing the incident electron energy and scattering angle. In particular, at the energies of hundreds of GeV and higher, there are only the forward scattering processes. Furthermore, by comparing the elastic cross sections of three investigated nuclei at a certain energy and scattering angle, the rule that the nuclear size is proportional to the number of nucleons is clearly shown.</description>

      <title>An improved method to access initial states in relativistic heavy-ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.05157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.05157v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Observables in heavy-ion collisions are generally categorized into centralities, which reflect an average over events within a range of impact parameter including a wide variety of initial state configurations. A multiple binning method using spectator neutrons within each centrality has been previously shown to provide access to events with rare initial state conditions. This work suggests an improvement in quantifying the difference between standard centrality and spectator neutron binning towards accessing the initial state properties. A selection of events with higher initial state density at fixed participating nucleon number was observed to result in larger final state particle production and smaller elliptic flow. The relative difference between observables in centrality and spectator binning shows reduced sensitivity for the observables dominated by impact parameter fluctuations in initial state such as triangular flow. This property makes the spectator binning method a good candidate to separate geometric contributions from random fluctuations in initial state towards final state observables.</description>

      <title>Elliptic flow of identified hadrons in Au+Au collisions at $E_{lab} = 35\mathrm{~A~GeV}$ using the PHSD model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.11772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.11772v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present elliptic flow ($v_2$) of identified hadrons at mid-rapidity ($|y| &lt; 1.0$) in Au+Au collisions at $E_{lab} = 35\mathrm{~A~GeV}$ using the Parton Hadron String Dynamics (PHSD) model. Transverse momentum ($p_\mathrm{T}$) dependence of identified hadron $v_2$ in minimum bias (0-80%) and three different centrality intervals (0-10%, 10-40%, and 40-80%) are presented. A clear centrality dependence of $v_2(p_\mathrm{T})$ is observed for particles and anti-particles in Au+Au collisions at $E_{lab} = 35\mathrm{~A~GeV}$. We also present $p_\mathrm{T}$ dependence of $v_2$ difference ($\mathrm{\Delta} v_2$) between particles and corresponding antiparticles. A significant difference in $v_2$ values for baryons and anti-baryons is observed. The number of constituent quark (NCQ) scaling of $v_2$ is discussed in Au+Au collisions at $E_{lab} = 35\mathrm{~A~GeV}$. We also present ratio of $v_2(p_\mathrm{T})$ between the HSD and PHSD modes to explore the effect of hadronic and partonic interactions in the medium. We observe higher $v_2$ in PHSD mode than the HSD mode, which suggests the formation of partonic medium in Au+Au collisions at $E_{lab} = 35\mathrm{~A~GeV}$. These predictions are useful for the interpretation of data measured in Beam Energy Scan (BES) program at RHIC and will be useful for the future Compressed Baryonic Matter (CBM) experiment at the Facility for Antiproton and Ion Research (FAIR).</description>

Abstract: When a star undergoes core collapse, a vast amount of energy is released in a ~10 s long burst of neutrinos of all species. Inverse beta decay in the star's hydrogen envelope causes an electromagnetic cascade which ultimately results in a flare of gamma rays - an "echo" of the neutrino burst - at the characteristic energy of 0.511 MeV. We study the phenomenology and detectability of this flare. Its luminosity curve is characterized by a fast, seconds-long, rise and an equally fast decline, with a minute- or hour-long plateau in between. For a near-Earth star (distance D&lt;1 kpc) the echo will be observable at near future gamma ray telescopes with an effective area of 10^3 cm^2 or larger. Its observation will inform us on the envelope size and composition. In conjunction with the direct detection of the neutrino burst, it will also give information on the neutrino emission away from the line of sight and will enable tests of neutrino propagation effects between the stellar surface and Earth.</description>

      <title>Constraining the mass of fermionic dark matter from its feeble interaction with hadronic matter via dark mediators in neutron stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.14419v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Considering ten well-known relativistic mean field models, we invoke feeble interaction between hadronic matter and fermionic dark matter (DM) $\chi$ via new physics scalar ($\phi$) and vector ($\xi$) mediators in neutron star core, thereby forming DM admixed neutron stars (DMANSs). The chosen masses of the DM fermion ($m_{\chi}$) and the mediators ($m_{\phi}$ and $m_{\xi}$) are consistent with the self-interaction constraint from Bullet cluster while their respective couplings ($y_{\phi}$ and $y_{\xi}$) are also constrained by the present day relic abundance. Assuming that both $\phi$ and $\xi$ contribute equally to the relic abundance, we compute the equation of state of the DMANSs and consequently their structural properties. We found that for a particular (constant) DM density, the presence of lighter DM results in more massive DMANSs with larger radius. In the light of the various recent constraints like those from the massive pulsar PSR J0740+6620, the gravitational wave (GW170817) data and the results of NICER experiments for PSR J0030+0451 and PSR J0740+6620, we provide a bound on $m_{\chi}$ within the framework of the present work as $m_{\chi}\approx$ (0.1 $-$ 30) GeV for a wide range of fixed DM Fermi momenta $k_F^{\chi}$=(0.01 $-$ 0.07) GeV. In the case of the hadronic models that yield larger radii corresponding to the low mass neutron stars in the no-DM scenario, interaction with comparatively heavier DM fermion is necessary in order to ensure that the DMANSs obtained with such models satisfy the radius constraints from both GW170817 and NICER data for PSR J0030+0451.</description>

      <title>Primordial black hole capture, gravitational wave beats, and the nuclear equation of state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.01838v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Primordial black holes (PBHs), if captured by neutron stars (NSs), would emit a characteristic gravitational wave (GW) signal as they orbit inside the host star. We identify a specific and qualitatively new feature of these signals, namely quasi-periodic beats caused by the precession of noncircular PBH orbits. We demonstrate numerically and analytically that the beat frequency depends rather sensitively on the NS structure, so that hypothetical future observations with next-generation GW detectors would provide valuable constraints on the nuclear equation of state.</description>

      <title>Precision mass measurements in the zirconium region pin down the mass surface across the neutron midshell at $N=66$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.12107v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Precision mass measurements of $^{104}$Y, $^{106}$Zr, $^{104,104m,109}$Nb, and $^{111,112}$Mo have been performed with the JYFLTRAP double Penning trap mass spectrometer at the Ion Guide Isotope Separator On-Line facility. The order of the long-lived states in $^{104}$Nb was unambiguously established. The trend in two-neutron separation energies around the $N=66$ neutron midshell appeared to be steeper with respect to the Atomic Mass Evaluation 2020 extrapolations for the $_{39}$Y and $_{40}$Zr isotopic chains and less steep for the $_{41}$Nb chain, indicating a possible gap opening around $Z=40$. The experimental results were compared to the BSkG2 model calculations performed with and without vibrational and rotational corrections. All of them predict two low-lying minima for $^{106}$Zr. While the unaltered BSkG2 model fails to predict the trend in two-neutron separation energies, selecting the more deformed minima in calculations and removing the vibrational correction, the calculations are more in line with experimental data. The same is also true for the $2^+_1$ excitation energies and differences in charge radii in the Zr isotopes. The results stress the importance of improved treatment of collective corrections in large-scale models and further development of beyond-mean-field techniques.</description>

      <title>Comprehensive study of compact stars with dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12875v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive study of compact stars admixed with non-self annihilating self-interacting fermionic dark matter, delineating the dependence on the nuclear equation of state by considering the two limiting parametrized equations of state for neutron star matter obtained by smoothly matching the low-density chiral effective theory and the high-density perturbative QCD. These two parametrizations are the limiting cases of a wide variety of smooth equations of state, i.e. the softest and stiffest possible one without a phase transition, that generate masses and radii compatible with 2M$_\odot$ observations and the tidal constraint from GW170817. With an exhaustive analysis of the possible stable mass-radius configurations, we determine the quantity of dark matter contained in stars with masses and radii compatible with the aforementioned astrophysical constraints. We find that for dark particle masses of a few tenths of GeV, the dark core collapses and no stable solutions are found for the two limiting ordinary matter equations of state. For lower masses, the dark matter fraction is limited to 10%, being at most 1% for masses ranging from 0.1 to 10 GeV for the limiting soft nuclear equation of state. For the limiting stiff nuclear equation of state, the dark matter fraction can reach values of more than 10%, but the dark particle mass is being constrained to 0.3 GeV and 10 GeV for the weak self-interacting case and has to be at least 5 GeV for the strong self-interacting one. For dark particle masses of less than 0.1 GeV, stable neutron star configurations should have less than 1% of self-interacting dark matter to be compatible with the constraint of the tidal deformability from GW170817 for the two limiting ordinary matter equations of state studied.</description>

      <title>Approaching the conformal limit of quark matter with different chemical potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01032v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study in detail the influence of different chemical potentials (baryon, charged, strange, and neutrino) on how and how fast a free gas of quarks in the zero-temperature limit reaches the conformal limit. We discuss the influence of non-zero masses, the inclusion of leptons, and different constraints, such as charge neutrality, zero-net strangeness, and fixed lepton fraction. We also investigate for the first time how the symmetry energy of the system under some of these conditions approaches the conformal limit. Finally, we briefly discuss what kind of corrections are expected from perturbative QCD as one goes away from the conformal limit.</description>

      <title>Reconstructing generalised parton distributions from the lattice off-forward Compton amplitude</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06256v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a determination of the structure functions of the off-forward Compton amplitude $\mathcal{H}_1$ and $\mathcal{E}_1$ from the Feynman-Hellmann method in lattice QCD. At leading twist, these structure functions give access to the generalised parton distributions (GPDs) $H$ and $E$, respectively. This calculation is performed for an unphysical pion mass of $m_{\pi}=412\;\text{MeV}$ and four values of the soft momentum transfer, $t\approx 0, -0.3, -0.6, -1.1\;\text{GeV}^2$, all at a hard momentum scale of $\bar{Q}^2\approx 5\;\text{GeV}^2$. Using these results, we test various methods to determine properties of the real-time scattering amplitudes and GPDs: (1) we fit their Mellin moments, and (2) we use a simple GPD ansatz to reconstruct the entire distribution. Our final results show promising agreement with phenomenology and other lattice results, and highlight specific systematics in need of control.</description>

      <title>On the nature of yrast states in neutron-rich polonium isotopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03839v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Polonium isotopes having two protons above the shell closure at $Z=82$ show a wide variety of low-lying high-spin isomeric states across the whole chain. The structure of neutron-deficient isotopes up to $^{210}$Po ($N=126$) is well established as they are easily produced through various methods. However, there is not much information available for the neutron-rich counterparts for which only selective techniques can be used for their production. We report on the first fast-timing measurements of yrast states up to the 8$^+$ level in $^{214,216,218}$Po isotopes produced in the $\beta^-$ decay of $^{214,216,218}$Bi at ISOLDE, CERN. In particular, our new half-life value of 607(14) ps for the 8$_1^+$ state in $^{214}$Po is nearly 20 times shorter than the one available in literature and comparable with the newly measured half-lives of 409(16) and 628(25) ps for the corresponding 8$_1^+$ states in $^{216,218}$Po, respectively. The measured $B(E2;8_1^+ \to 6_1^+)$ transition probability values follow an increasing trend relative to isotope mass, reaching a maximum for $^{216}$Po. The increase contradicts the previous claims of isomerism for the $8^+$ yrast states in neutron-rich $^{214}$Po and beyond. Together with the other measured yrast transitions, the $B(E2)$ values provide a crucial test of the different theoretical approaches describing the underlying configurations of the yrast band. The new experimental results are compared to shell-model calculations using the KHPE and H208 effective interactions and their pairing modified versions, showing an increase in configuration mixing when moving towards the heavier isotopes.</description>
