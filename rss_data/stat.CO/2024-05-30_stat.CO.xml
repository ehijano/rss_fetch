      <title>The ARR2 prior: flexible predictive prior definition for Bayesian auto-regressions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19920v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the ARR2 prior, a joint prior over the auto-regressive components in Bayesian time-series models and their induced $R^2$. Compared to other priors designed for times-series models, the ARR2 prior allows for flexible and intuitive shrinkage. We derive the prior for pure auto-regressive models, and extend it to auto-regressive models with exogenous inputs, and state-space models. Through both simulations and real-world modelling exercises, we demonstrate the efficacy of the ARR2 prior in improving sparse and reliable inference, while showing greater inference quality and predictive performance than other shrinkage priors. An open-source implementation of the prior is provided.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Online Natural Gradient (BONG)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19681v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel approach to sequential Bayesian inference based on variational Bayes. The key insight is that, in the online setting, we do not need to add the KL term to regularize to the prior (which comes from the posterior at the previous timestep); instead we can optimize just the expected log-likelihood, performing a single step of natural gradient descent starting at the prior predictive. We prove this method recovers exact Bayesian inference if the model is conjugate, and empirically outperforms other online VB methods in the non-conjugate setting, such as online learning for neural networks, especially when controlling for computational costs.</description>

      <title>Reduced Rank Regression for Mixed Predictor and Response Variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19865v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose the generalized mixed reduced rank regression method, GMR$^3$ for short. GMR$^3$ is a regression method for a mix of numeric, binary and ordinal response variables. The predictor variables can be a mix of binary, nominal, ordinal, and numeric variables. For dealing with the categorical predictors we use optimal scaling. A majorization-minimization algorithm is derived for maximum likelihood estimation under a local independence assumption. We discuss in detail model selection for the dimensionality or rank, and the selection of predictor variables. We show an application of GMR$^3$ using the Eurobarometer Surveys data set of 2023.</description>

      <title>Scaling up archival text analysis with the blockmodeling of n-gram networks -- A case study of Bulgaria's representation in the Osservatore Romano (January-May 1877)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20156v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper seeks to bridge the gap between archival text analysis and network analysis by applying network clustering methods to analyze the coverage of Bulgaria in 123 issues of the newspaper Osservatore Romano published between January and May 1877. Utilizing optical character recognition and generalized homogeneity blockmodeling, the study constructs networks of relevant keywords. Those including the sets Bulgaria and Russia are rather isomorphic and they largely overlap with those for Germany, Britain, and War. In structural terms, the blockmodel of the two networks exhibits a clear core-semiperiphery-periphery structure that reflects relations between concepts in the newpaper's coverage. The newspaper's lexical choices effectively delegitimised the Bulgarian national revival, highlighting the influence of the Holy See on the newspaper's editorial line.</description>

      <title>Multidimensional spatiotemporal clustering -- An application to environmental sustainability scores in Europe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20191v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The assessment of corporate sustainability performance is extremely relevant in facilitating the transition to a green and low-carbon intensity economy. However, companies located in different areas may be subject to different sustainability and environmental risks and policies. Henceforth, the main objective of this paper is to investigate the spatial and temporal pattern of the sustainability evaluations of European firms. We leverage on a large dataset containing information about companies' sustainability performances, measured by MSCI ESG ratings, and geographical coordinates of firms in Western Europe between 2013 and 2023. By means of a modified version of the Chavent et al. (2018) hierarchical algorithm, we conduct a spatial clustering analysis, combining sustainability and spatial information, and a spatiotemporal clustering analysis, which combines the time dynamics of multiple sustainability features and spatial dissimilarities, to detect groups of firms with homogeneous sustainability performance. We are able to build cross-national and cross-industry clusters with remarkable differences in terms of sustainability scores. Among other results, in the spatio-temporal analysis, we observe a high degree of geographical overlap among clusters, indicating that the temporal dynamics in sustainability assessment are relevant within a multidimensional approach. Our findings help to capture the diversity of ESG ratings across Western Europe and may assist practitioners and policymakers in evaluating companies facing different sustainability-linked risks in different areas.</description>

      <title>A Multinomial Canonical Decomposition Model, with emphasis on the analysis of Multivariate Binary data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.07634v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose to decompose the canonical parameter of a multinomial model into a set of participant scores and category scores. Both sets of scores are linearly constraint to represent external information about the participants and categories. For the estimation of the parameters of the decomposition, we derive a majorization-minimization algorithm. We place special emphasis on the case where the categories represent profiles of binary response variables. In that case, the multinomial model becomes a regression model for multiple binary response variables and researchers might be interested in the relationship of an external variable for the participant (i.e., a predictor) and one of the binary response variable or in the relationship between this predictor and the association among binary response variables. We derive interpretational rules for these relationships in terms of changes in log odds or log odds ratios. Connections between our multinomial canonical decomposition and loglinear models, multinomial logistic regression, multinomial reduced rank logistic regression, and double constrained correspondence analysis are discussed. We illustrate our methodology with two empirical data sets.</description>
