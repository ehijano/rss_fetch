      <title>Quaternion tensor low rank approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new approaches for low rank approximation of quaternion tensors \cite{chen2019low,zhang1997quaternions,hamilton1866elements}. The first method uses quasi-norms to approximate the tensor by a low-rank tensor using the QT-product \cite{miao2023quaternion}, which generalizes the known L-product to N-mode quaternions. The second method involves Non-Convex norms to approximate the Tucker and TT-rank for the completion problem. We demonstrate that the proposed methods can effectively approximate the tensor compared to the convexifying of the rank, such as the nuclear norm. We provide theoretical results and numerical experiments to show the efficiency of the proposed methods in the Inpainting and Denoising applications.</description>

      <title>Numerical Analysis for Neumann Optimal Control Problems on Convex Polyhedral Domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with finite element error estimates for Neumann boundary control problems posed on convex and polyhedral domains. Different discretization concepts are considered and for each optimal discretization error estimates are established. In particular, for a full discretization with piecewise linear and globally continuous functions for the control and standard linear finite elements for the state optimal convergence rates for the controls are proven which solely depend on the largest interior edge angle. To be more precise, below the critical edge angle of $2\pi/3$, a convergence rate of two (times a log-factor) can be achieved for the discrete controls in the $L^2$-norm on the boundary. For larger interior edge angles the convergence rates are reduced depending on their size, which is due the impact of singular (domain dependent) terms in the solution. The results are comparable to those for the two dimensional case. However, new techniques in this context are used to prove the estimates on the boundary which also extend to the two dimensional case. Moreover, it is shown that the discrete states converge with a rate of two in the $L^2$-norm in the domain independent of the interior edge angles, i.e. for any convex and polyhedral domain. It is remarkable that this not only holds for a full discretization using piecewise linear and globally continuous functions for the control, but also for a full discretization using piecewise constant functions for the control, where the discrete controls only converge with a rate of one in the $L^2$-norm on the boundary at best. At the end, the theoretical results are confirmed by several numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>A node-based uniform strain virtual element method for elastoplastic solids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10808v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A recently proposed node-based uniform strain virtual element method (NVEM) is here extended to small strain elastoplastic solids. In the proposed method, the strain is averaged at the nodes from the strain of surrounding linearly-precise virtual elements using a generalization to virtual elements of the node-based uniform strain approach for finite elements. The averaged strain is then used to sample the weak form at the nodes of the mesh leading to a method in which all the field variables, including state and history-dependent variables, are related to the nodes and thus they are tracked only at these locations during the nonlinear computations. Through various elastoplastic benchmark problems, we demonstrate that the NVEM is locking-free while enabling linearly-precise virtual elements to solve elastoplastic solids with accuracy.</description>

      <title>A Fractional spectral method for weakly singular Volterra integro-differential equations with delays of the third-kind</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10861v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a fractional spectral collocation method for solving a class of weakly singular Volterra integro-differential equations (VDIEs) with proportional delays and cordial operators. Assuming the underlying solutions are in a specific function space, we derive error estimates in the $L^2_{\omega^{\alpha,\beta,\lambda}}$ and $L^{\infty}$-norms. A rigorous proof reveals that the numerical errors decay exponentially with the appropriate selections of parameters $\lambda$. Subsequently, numerical experiments are conducted to validate the effectiveness of the method.</description>

      <title>Spectral Volume from a DG perspective: Oscillation Elimination, Stability, and Optimal Error Estimates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10871v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method and the spectral volume (SV) method are two widely-used numerical methodologies for solving hyperbolic conservation laws. In this paper, we demonstrate that under specific subdivision assumptions, the SV method can be represented in a DG form with a different inner product. Building on this insight, we extend the oscillation-eliminating (OE) technique, recently proposed in [M. Peng, Z. Sun, and K. Wu, {\it Mathematics of Computation}, https://doi.org/10.1090/mcom/3998], to develop a new fully-discrete OESV method. The OE technique is non-intrusive, efficient, and straightforward to implement, acting as a simple post-processing filter to effectively suppress spurious oscillations. From a DG perspective, we present a comprehensive framework to theoretically analyze the stability and accuracy of both general Runge-Kutta SV (RKSV) schemes and the novel OESV method. For the linear advection equation, we conduct an energy analysis of the fully-discrete RKSV method, identifying an upwind condition crucial for stability. Furthermore, we establish optimal error estimates for the OESV schemes, overcoming nonlinear challenges through error decomposition and treating the OE procedure as additional source terms in the RKSV schemes. Extensive numerical experiments validate our theoretical findings and demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed OESV method. This work enhances the theoretical understanding and practical application of SV schemes for hyperbolic conservation laws, making the OESV method a promising approach for high-resolution simulations.</description>

      <title>High-order Accurate Entropy Stable Schemes for Relativistic Hydrodynamics with General Synge-type Equation of State</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10872v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: All the existing entropy stable (ES) schemes for relativistic hydrodynamics (RHD) in the literature were restricted to the ideal equation of state (EOS), which however is often a poor approximation for most relativistic flows due to its inconsistency with the relativistic kinetic theory. This paper develops high-order ES finite difference schemes for RHD with general Synge-type EOS, which encompasses a range of special EOSs. We first establish an entropy pair for the RHD equations with general Synge-type EOS in any space dimensions. We rigorously prove that the found entropy function is strictly convex and derive the associated entropy variables, laying the foundation for designing entropy conservative (EC) and ES schemes. Due to relativistic effects, one cannot explicitly express primitive variables, fluxes, and entropy variables in terms of conservative variables. Consequently, this highly complicates the analysis of the entropy structure of the RHD equations, the investigation of entropy convexity, and the construction of EC numerical fluxes. By using a suitable set of parameter variables, we construct novel two-point EC fluxes in a unified form for general Synge-type EOS. We obtain high-order EC schemes through linear combinations of the two-point EC fluxes. Arbitrarily high-order accurate ES schemes are achieved by incorporating dissipation terms into the EC schemes, based on (weighted) essentially non-oscillatory reconstructions. Additionally, we derive the general dissipation matrix for general Synge-type EOS based on the scaled eigenvectors of the RHD system. We also define a suitable average of the dissipation matrix at the cell interfaces to ensure that the resulting ES schemes can resolve stationary contact discontinuities accurately. Several numerical examples are provided to validate the accuracy and effectiveness of our schemes for RHD with four special EOSs.</description>

      <title>Adaptively Coupled Domain Decomposition Method for Multiphase and Multicomponent Porous Media Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10875v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Numerical simulation of large-scale multiphase and multicomponent flow in porous media is a significant field of interest in the petroleum industry. The fully implicit approach is favored in reservoir simulation due to its numerical stability and relaxed constraints on time-step sizes. However, this method requires solving a large nonlinear system at each time step, making the development of efficient and convergent numerical methods crucial for accelerating the nonlinear solvers. In this paper, we present an adaptively coupled subdomain framework based on the domain decomposition method. The solution methods developed within this framework effectively handle strong nonlinearities in global problems by addressing subproblems in the coupled regions. Furthermore, we propose several adaptive coupling strategies and develop a method for leveraging initial guesses to accelerate the solution of nonlinear problems, thereby improving the convergence and parallel performance of nonlinear solvers. A series of numerical experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework. Additionally, by utilizing tens of thousands of processors, we demonstrate the scalability of this approach through a large-scale reservoir simulation with over 2 billion degrees of freedom.</description>

Abstract: This paper aims to present a local discontinuous Galerkin (LDG) method for solving backward stochastic partial differential equations (BSPDEs) with Neumann boundary conditions. We establish the $L^2$-stability and optimal error estimates of the proposed numerical scheme. Two numerical examples are provided to demonstrate the performance of the LDG method, where we incorporate a deep learning algorithm to address the challenge of the curse of dimensionality in backward stochastic differential equations (BSDEs). The results show the effectiveness and accuracy of the LDG method in tackling BSPDEs with Neumann boundary conditions.</description>

      <title>A Nonlinear Generalization of the Bauer-Fike Theorem and Novel Iterative Methods for Solving Nonlinear Eigenvalue Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonlinear eigenvalue problems (NEPs) present significant challenges due to their inherent complexity and the limitations of traditional linear eigenvalue theory. This paper addresses these challenges by introducing a nonlinear generalization of the Bauer-Fike theorem, which serves as a foundational result in classical eigenvalue theory. This generalization provides a robust theoretical framework for understanding the sensitivity of eigenvalues in NEPs, extending the applicability of the Bauer-Fike theorem beyond linear cases. Building on this theoretical foundation, we propose novel iterative methods designed to efficiently solve NEPs. These methods leverage the generalized theorem to improve convergence rates and accuracy, making them particularly effective for complex NEPs with dense spectra. The adaptive contour integral method, in particular, is highlighted for its ability to identify multiple eigenvalues within a specified region of the complex plane, even in cases where eigenvalues are closely clustered. The efficacy of the proposed methods is demonstrated through a series of numerical experiments, which illustrate their superior performance compared to existing approaches. These results underscore the practical applicability of our methods in various scientific and engineering contexts. In conclusion, this paper represents a significant advancement in the study of NEPs by providing a unified theoretical framework and effective computational tools, thereby bridging the gap between theory and practice in the field of nonlinear eigenvalue problems.</description>

      <title>Nonconvex models for recovering images corrupted by salt-and-pepper noise on surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Image processing on surfaces has drawn significant interest in recent years, particularly in the context of denoising. Salt-and-pepper noise is a special type of noise which randomly sets a portion of the image pixels to the minimum or maximum intensity while keeping the others unaffected. In this paper, We propose the L$_p$TV models on triangle meshes to recover images corrupted by salt-and-pepper noise on surfaces. We establish a lower bound for data fitting term of the recovered image. Motivated by the lower bound property, we propose the corresponding algorithm based on the proximal linearization method with the support shrinking strategy. The global convergence of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated. Numerical examples are given to show good performance of the algorithm.</description>

      <title>GePUP-ES: High-order Energy-stable Projection Methods for the Incompressible Navier-Stokes Equations with No-slip Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11255v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inspired by the unconstrained PPE (UPPE) formulation [Liu, Liu, &amp; Pego 2007 Comm. Pure Appl. Math., 60 pp. 1443], we previously proposed the GePUP formulation [Zhang 2016 J. Sci. Comput., 67 pp. 1134] for numerically solving the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations (INSE) on no-slip domains. In this paper, we propose GePUP-E and GePUP-ES, variants of GePUP that feature (a) electric boundary conditions with no explicit enforcement of the no-penetration condition, (b) equivalence to the no-slip INSE, (c) exponential decay of the divergence of an initially non-solenoidal velocity, and (d) monotonic decrease of the kinetic energy. Different from UPPE, the GePUP-E and GePUP-ES formulations are of strong forms and are designed for finite volume/difference methods under the framework of method of lines. Furthermore, we develop semi-discrete algorithms that preserve (c) and (d) and fully discrete algorithms that are fourth-order accurate for velocity both in time and in space. These algorithms employ algebraically stable time integrators in a black-box manner and only consist of solving a sequence of linear equations in each time step. Results of numerical tests confirm our analysis.</description>

      <title>Numerical approximation of bi-harmonic wave maps into spheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11366v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a structure preserving non-conforming finite element approximation scheme for the bi-harmonic wave maps into spheres equation. It satisfies a discrete energy law and preserves the non-convex sphere constraint of the continuous problem. The discrete sphere constraint is enforced at the mesh-points via a discrete Lagrange multiplier. This approach restricts the spatial approximation to the (non-conforming) linear finite elements. We show that the numerical approximation converges to the weak solution of the continuous problem in spatial dimension $d=1$. The convergence analysis in dimensions $d&gt;1$ is complicated by the lack of a discrete product rule as well as the low regularity of the numerical approximation in the non-conforming setting. Hence, we show convergence of the numerical approximation in higher-dimensions by introducing additional stabilization terms in the numerical approximation. We present numerical experiments to demonstrate the performance of the proposed numerical approximation and to illustrate the regularizing effect of the bi-Laplacian which prevents the formation of singularities.</description>

      <title>A lattice Boltzmann method for Biot's consolidation model of linear poroelasticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Biot's consolidation model is a classical model for the evolution of deformable porous media saturated by a fluid and has various interdisciplinary applications. While numerical solution methods to solve poroelasticity by typical schemes such as finite differences, finite volumes or finite elements have been intensely studied, lattice Boltzmann methods for poroelasticity have not been developed yet. In this work, we propose a novel semi-implicit coupling of lattice Boltzmann methods to solve Biot's consolidation model in two dimensions. To this end, we use a single-relaxation-time lattice Boltzmann method for reaction-diffusion equations to solve the Darcy flow and combine it with a recent pseudo-time multi-relaxation-time lattice Boltzmann scheme for quasi-static linear elasticity by Boolakee, Geier and De Lorenzis (2023, DOI: 10.1016/j.cma.2022.115756). The numerical results demonstrate that naive coupling schemes lead to instabilities when the poroelastic system is strongly coupled. However, the newly developed centered coupling scheme using fully explicit and semi-implicit contributions is stable and accurate in all considered cases, even for the Biot--Willis coefficient being one. Furthermore, the numerical results for Terzaghi's consolidation problem and a two-dimensional extension thereof highlight that the scheme is even able to capture discontinuous solutions arising from instantaneous loading.</description>

      <title>Physics-Informed Neural Networks with Trust-Region Sequential Quadratic Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10777v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) represent a significant advancement in Scientific Machine Learning (SciML), which integrate physical domain knowledge into an empirical loss function as soft constraints and apply existing machine learning methods to train the model. However, recent research has noted that PINNs may fail to learn relatively complex Partial Differential Equations (PDEs). This paper addresses the failure modes of PINNs by introducing a novel, hard-constrained deep learning method -- trust-region Sequential Quadratic Programming (trSQP-PINN). In contrast to directly training the penalized soft-constrained loss as in PINNs, our method performs a linear-quadratic approximation of the hard-constrained loss, while leveraging the soft-constrained loss to adaptively adjust the trust-region radius. We only trust our model approximations and make updates within the trust region, and such an updating manner can overcome the ill-conditioning issue of PINNs. We also address the computational bottleneck of second-order SQP methods by employing quasi-Newton updates for second-order information, and importantly, we introduce a simple pretraining step to further enhance training efficiency of our method. We demonstrate the effectiveness of trSQP-PINN through extensive experiments. Compared to existing hard-constrained methods for PINNs, such as penalty methods and augmented Lagrangian methods, trSQP-PINN significantly improves the accuracy of the learned PDE solutions, achieving up to 1-3 orders of magnitude lower errors. Additionally, our pretraining step is generally effective for other hard-constrained methods, and experiments have shown the robustness of our method against both problem-specific parameters and algorithm tuning parameters.</description>

Abstract: Enlarged Krylov subspace methods and their s-step versions were introduced [7] in the aim of reducing communication when solving systems of linear equations Ax = b. These enlarged CG methods consist of enlarging the Krylov subspace by a maximum of t vectors per iteration based on the domain decomposition of the graph of A. As for the s-step versions, s iterations of the enlarged Conjugate Gradient methods are merged in one iteration. The Enlarged CG methods and their s-step versions converge in less iterations than the classical CG, but at the expense of requiring more memory storage than CG. Thus, in this paper we explore different options for reducing the memory requirements of these enlarged CG methods without affecting much their convergence.</description>

      <title>Removing the mask -- reconstructing a scalar field on the sphere from a masked field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.14815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.14815v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The paper analyses a spectral approach to reconstructing a scalar field on the sphere, given only information about a masked version of the field together with precise information about the (smooth) mask. The theory is developed for a general mask, and later specialised to the case of an axially symmetric mask. Numerical experiments are given for the case of an axial mask motivated by the cosmic microwave background, assuming that the underlying field is a realisation of a Gaussian random field with an artificial angular power spectrum of moderate degree ($\ell \le 100$). The recovery is highly satisfactory in the absence of noise and even in the presence of moderate noise.</description>

      <title>Stability estimates of Nystr\"om discretizations of Helmholtz decomposition boundary integral equation formulations for the solution of Navier scattering problems in two dimensions with Dirichlet boundary conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.17032v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Helmholtz decompositions of elastic fields is a common approach for the solution of Navier scattering problems. Used in the context of Boundary Integral Equations (BIE), this approach affords solutions of Navier problems via the simpler Helmholtz boundary integral operators (BIOs). Approximations of Helmholtz Dirichlet-to-Neumann (DtN) can be employed within a regularizing combined field strategy to deliver BIE formulations of the second kind for the solution of Navier scattering problems in two dimensions with Dirichlet boundary conditions, at least in the case of smooth boundaries. Unlike the case of scattering and transmission Helmholtz problems, the approximations of the DtN maps we use in the Helmholtz decomposition BIE in the Navier case require incorporation of lower order terms in their pseudodifferential asymptotic expansions. The presence of these lower order terms in the Navier regularized BIE formulations complicates the stability analysis of their Nystr\"om discretizations in the framework of global trigonometric interpolation and the Kussmaul-Martensen kernel singularity splitting strategy. The main difficulty stems from compositions of pseudodifferential operators of opposite orders, whose Nystr\"om discretization must be performed with care via pseudodifferential expansions beyond the principal symbol. The error analysis is significantly simpler in the case of arclength boundary parametrizations and considerably more involved in the case of general smooth parametrizations which are typically encountered in the description of one dimensional closed curves.</description>

      <title>A particle-in-Fourier method with semi-discrete energy conservation for non-periodic boundary conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13911v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a novel particle-in-Fourier (PIF) scheme that extends its applicability to non-periodic boundary conditions. Our method handles free space boundary conditions by replacing the Fourier Laplacian operator in PIF with a mollified Green's function as first introduced by Vico-Greengard-Ferrando. This modification yields highly accurate free space solutions to the Vlasov-Poisson system, while still maintaining energy conservation up to an error bounded by the time step size. We also explain how to extend our scheme to arbitrary Dirichlet boundary conditions via standard potential theory, which we illustrate in detail for Dirichlet boundary conditions on a circular boundary. We support our approach with proof-of-concept numerical results from two-dimensional plasma test cases to demonstrate the accuracy, efficiency, and conservation properties of the scheme. By avoiding grid heating and finite grid instability we are able to show an order of magnitude speedup compared to the standard PIC scheme for a long time integration cyclotron simulation.</description>

      <title>A Second Moment Method for k-Eigenvalue Acceleration with Continuous Diffusion and Discontinuous Transport Discretizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06162v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The second moment method is a linear acceleration technique which couples the transport equation to a diffusion equation with transport-dependent additive closures. The resulting low-order diffusion equation can be discretized independent of the transport discretization, unlike diffusion synthetic acceleration, and is symmetric positive definite, unlike quasi-diffusion. While this method has been shown to be comparable to quasi-diffusion in iterative performance for fixed source and time-dependent problems, it is largely unexplored as an eigenvalue problem acceleration scheme due to thought that the resulting inhomogeneous source makes the problem ill-posed. Recently, a preliminary feasibility study was performed on the second moment method for eigenvalue problems. The results suggested comparable performance to quasi-diffusion and more robust performance than diffusion synthetic acceleration. This work extends the initial study to more realistic reactor problems using state-of-the-art discretization techniques. Results in this paper show that the second moment method is more computationally efficient than its alternatives on complex reactor problems with unstructured meshes.</description>

      <title>Structure-Preserving Linear Quadratic Gaussian Balanced Truncation for Port-Hamiltonian Descriptor Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.05065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2111.05065v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a new balancing-based structure-preserving model reduction technique for linear port-Hamiltonian descriptor systems. The proposed method relies on a modification of a set of two dual generalized algebraic Riccati equations that arise in the context of linear quadratic Gaussian balanced truncation for differential algebraic systems. We derive an a priori error bound with respect to a right coprime factorization of the underlying transfer function thereby allowing for an estimate with respect to the gap metric. We further theoretically and numerically analyze the influence of the Hamiltonian and a change thereof, respectively. With regard to this change of the Hamiltonian, we provide a novel procedure that is based on a recently introduced Kalman-Yakubovich-Popov inequality for descriptor systems. Numerical examples demonstrate how the quality of reduced-order models can significantly be improved by first computing an extremal solution to this inequality.</description>

      <title>Interest Rate Dynamics and Commodity Prices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.07577v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In economic studies and popular media, interest rates are routinely cited as a major factor behind commodity price fluctuations. At the same time, the transmission channels are far from transparent, leading to long-running debates on the sign and magnitude of interest rate effects. Purely empirical studies struggle to address these issues because of the complex interactions between interest rates, prices, supply changes, and aggregate demand. To move this debate to a solid footing, we extend the competitive storage model to include stochastically evolving interest rates. We establish general conditions for existence and uniqueness of solutions and provide a systematic theoretical and quantitative analysis of the interactions between interest rates and prices.</description>

      <title>Robo-GS: A Physics Consistent Spatial-Temporal Model for Robotic Arm with Hybrid Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14873v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Real2Sim2Real plays a critical role in robotic arm control and reinforcement learning, yet bridging this gap remains a significant challenge due to the complex physical properties of robots and the objects they manipulate. Existing methods lack a comprehensive solution to accurately reconstruct real-world objects with spatial representations and their associated physics attributes.
  We propose a Real2Sim pipeline with a hybrid representation model that integrates mesh geometry, 3D Gaussian kernels, and physics attributes to enhance the digital asset representation of robotic arms.
  This hybrid representation is implemented through a Gaussian-Mesh-Pixel binding technique, which establishes an isomorphic mapping between mesh vertices and Gaussian models. This enables a fully differentiable rendering pipeline that can be optimized through numerical solvers, achieves high-fidelity rendering via Gaussian Splatting, and facilitates physically plausible simulation of the robotic arm's interaction with its environment using mesh-based methods.

      <title>Variance-reduced first-order methods for deterministically constrained stochastic nonconvex optimization with strong convergence guarantees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09906v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a class of deterministically constrained stochastic optimization problems. Existing methods typically aim to find an $\epsilon$-stochastic stationary point, where the expected violations of both constraints and first-order stationarity are within a prescribed accuracy $\epsilon$. However, in many practical applications, it is crucial that the constraints be nearly satisfied with certainty, making such an $\epsilon$-stochastic stationary point potentially undesirable due to the risk of significant constraint violations. To address this issue, we propose single-loop variance-reduced stochastic first-order methods, where the stochastic gradient of the stochastic component is computed using either a truncated recursive momentum scheme or a truncated Polyak momentum scheme for variance reduction, while the gradient of the deterministic component is computed exactly. Under the error bound condition with a parameter $\theta \geq 1$ and other suitable assumptions, we establish that the proposed methods achieve a sample complexity and first-order operation complexity of $\widetilde O(\epsilon^{-\max\{4, 2\theta\}})$ for finding a stronger $\epsilon$-stochastic stationary point, where the constraint violation is within $\epsilon$ with certainty, and the expected violation of first-order stationarity is within $\epsilon$. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to develop methods with provable complexity guarantees for finding an approximate stochastic stationary point of such problems that nearly satisfies all constraints with certainty.</description>
