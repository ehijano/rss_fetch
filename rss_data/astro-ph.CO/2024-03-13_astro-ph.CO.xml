      <title>Lagrangian Perturbation Theory for Biased Tracers: Halo numbers are conserved?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07046v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Lagrangian perturbation theory (LPT) provides a simple yet powerful way of computing the nonlinear matter power spectrum, and it has been applied to biased tracers such as halos and galaxies. The number conservation of matter particles allows a simple relation between the fluctuations at the initial and the late times, which is essential in deriving the exact expression for the nonlinear matter power spectrum. Biased tracers in contrast evolve through mergers and accretion, violating the assumption of number conservation. Furthermore, a sample of halos with a narrow mass bin at initial time evolves to become halos with very different masses at late time, making it difficult to directly connect predictions of the LPT to real observations, as observed samples have similar properties. Here we use $N$-body simulations to test these core predictions of the LPT for biased tracers and demonstrate that the LPT predictions for halos overestimates the power spectrum at $z=0$ by a factor of three for the mass bin sample $\Delta \log M_h~(h^{-1}M_{\odot})= 0.5$ at~$z\simeq 3$, while the predictions can be made consistent if we impose by hand the number conservation of halos in the simulations throughout the entire evolution. In reality, LPT modeling of biased tracers involves marginalization of unknown bias parameters, alleviating the problem. We discuss the implications for field-level models based on the LPT applications.</description>

      <title>Cosmology with shear ratios: a joint study of weak lensing and spectroscopic redshift datasets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07313v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ratio of the average tangential shear signal of different weak lensing source populations around the same lens galaxies, also known as a shear ratio, provides an important test of lensing systematics and a potential source of cosmological information. In this paper we measure shear ratios of three current weak lensing surveys -- KiDS, DES, and HSC -- using overlapping data from the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey. We apply a Bayesian method to reduce bias in shear ratio measurement, and assess the degree to which shear ratio information improves the determination of important astrophysical parameters describing the source redshift distributions and intrinsic galaxy alignments, as well as cosmological parameters, in comparison with cosmic shear and full 3x2-pt correlations (cosmic shear, galaxy-galaxy lensing, and galaxy clustering). We consider both Fisher matrix forecasts, as well as full likelihood analyses of the data. We find that the addition of shear ratio information to cosmic shear allows the mean redshifts of the source samples and intrinsic alignment parameters to be determined significantly more accurately. Although the additional constraining power enabled by the shear ratio is less than that obtained by introducing an accurate prior in the mean source redshift using photometric redshift calibration, the shear ratio allows for a useful cross-check. The inclusion of shear ratio data consistently benefits the determination of cosmological parameters such as S_8, for which we obtain improvements up to 34%. However these improvements are less significant when shear ratio is combined with the full 3x2-pt correlations. We conclude that shear ratio tests will remain a useful source of cosmological information and cross-checks for lensing systematics, whose application will be further enhanced by upcoming datasets such as the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument.</description>

      <title>Large fluctuations in the Sky</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07343v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Renormalization of quantum loop effects generated from large fluctuations is a hugely debatable topic of research these days which rules out the Primordial Black Hole (PBH) formation within the framework of single-field inflation. In this article, we briefly discuss that the correct implementation of regularization, renormalization, and resummation techniques in a setup described by an ultra-slow-roll phase sandwiched between two slow-roll phases in the presence of smooth or sharp transitions can lead to a stringent constraint on the PBH mass (i.e. ${\cal O}(10^{2}{\rm gm}$)), which we advertise as a new No-go theorem. Finally, we will give some of the possible way-outs using which one can evade this proposed No-go theorem and produce solar/sub-solar mass PBHs.</description>

      <title>FLAME: Fitting Ly{\alpha} Absorption lines using Machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07498v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce FLAME, a machine learning algorithm designed to fit Voigt profiles to HI Lyman-alpha (Ly$\alpha$) absorption lines using deep convolutional neural networks. FLAME integrates two algorithms: the first determines the number of components required to fit Ly$\alpha$ absorption lines, and the second calculates the Doppler parameter $b$, the HI column density N$_{\rm HI}$, and the velocity separation of individual components. For the current version of FLAME, we trained it on low-redshift Ly$\alpha$ forests observed with the Far Ultraviolet gratings of the Cosmic Origin Spectrograph (COS) aboard the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). Drawing on this data, we trained FLAME on $\sim$ $10^6$ simulated Voigt profiles, forward-modeled to Ly$\alpha$ absorption lines observed with HST-COS, to classify lines as either single or double components and then determine Voigt profile fitting parameters. FLAME shows impressive accuracy on the simulated data by identifying more than 98% (90%) of single (double) component lines. It determines $b$ values within $\approx \pm{8}~(15)$ km s$^{-1}$ and log $N_{\rm HI}/ {\rm cm}^2$ values within $\approx \pm 0.3~(0.8)$ for 90% of the single (double) component lines. However, when applied to real data, FLAME's component classification accuracy drops by $\sim$ 10%. Despite this, there is a reasonable agreement between the $b$ and N$_{\rm HI}$ distributions obtained from traditional Voigt profile fitting methods and FLAME's predictions. Our mock HST-COS data analysis, designed to emulate real data parameters, demonstrated that FLAME could achieve consistent accuracy comparable to its performance with simulated data. This finding suggests that the drop in FLAME's accuracy when used on real data primarily arises from the difficulty of replicating the full complexity of real data in the training sample.</description>

      <title>Memory of a Random Walk: Astrometric deflections from gravitational wave memory accumulation over cosmological scales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the impact of gravitational wave memory on the distribution of far away light sources in the sky. For the first time we compute the built up of small, but permanent tensor distortions of the metric over cosmological time-scales using realistic models of compact binary coalescences (CBCs) whose rate of occurrence is extrapolated at $z\sim {\cal O}(1)$. This allows for a consistent computation of the random-walk like evolution of gravitational wave memory which, in turn, is used to estimate the overall shape and magnitude of astrometric deflections of far away sources of light. We find that for pulsar or quasar proper motions, the near-Earth contribution to the astrometric deflections dominates the result and the deflection is analogous to a stochastic gravitational wave memory background that is generally subdominant to the primary stochastic gravitational wave background. We find that this contribution can be within the reach of future surveys such as Theia. Finally, we also study the deviation of the presently observed angular distribution of quasars from perfect isotropy, which arises from the slow build-up of gravitational wave memory over the entire history of the universe. In this case, we find that astrometric deflections depend on the entire light trajectory from the source to the Earth, yielding a quadruple pattern whose magnitude is unlikely to be within reach of the next generation of astrometric surveys due to shot noise and cosmic variance limitations.</description>

      <title>SIDE-real: Truncated marginal neural ratio estimation for Supernova Ia Dust Extinction with real data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07871v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first fully simulation-based hierarchical analysis of the light curves of a population of low-redshift type Ia supernovae (SNae Ia). Our hardware-accelerated forward model, released in the Python package slicsim, includes stochastic variations of each SN's spectral flux distribution (based on the pre-trained BayeSN model), extinction from dust in the host and in the Milky Way, redshift, and realistic instrumental noise. By utilising truncated marginal neural ratio estimation (TMNRE), a neural network-enabled simulation-based inference technique, we implicitly marginalise over 4000 latent variables (for a set of $\approx 100$ SNae Ia) to efficiently infer SN Ia absolute magnitudes and host-galaxy dust properties at the population level while also constraining the parameters of individual objects. Amortisation of the inference procedure allows us to obtain coverage guarantees for our results through Bayesian validation and frequentist calibration. Furthermore, we show a detailed comparison to full likelihood-based inference, implemented through Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, on simulated data and then apply TMNRE to the light curves of 86 SNae Ia from the Carnegie Supernova Project, deriving marginal posteriors in excellent agreement with previous work. Given its ability to accommodate arbitrarily complex extensions to the forward model -- e.g. different populations based on host properties, redshift evolution, complicated photometric redshift estimates, selection effects, and non-Ia contamination -- without significant modifications to the inference procedure, TMNRE has the potential to become the tool of choice for cosmological parameter inference from future, large SN Ia samples.</description>

      <title>Cosmological Amplitudes in Power-Law FRW Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07050v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The correlators of large-scale fluctuations belong to the most important observables in modern cosmology. Recently, there have been considerable efforts in analytically understanding the cosmological correlators and the related wavefunction coefficients, which we collectively call cosmological amplitudes. In this work, we provide a set of simple rules to directly write down analytical answers for arbitrary tree-level amplitudes of conformal scalars with time-dependent interactions in power-law FRW universe. With the recently proposed family-tree decomposition method, we identify an over-complete set of multivariate hypergeometric functions, called family trees, to which all tree-level conformal scalar amplitudes can be easily reduced. Our method yields series expansions and monodromies of family trees in various kinematic limits, together with a large number of functional identities. The family trees are in a sense generalizations of polylogarithms and do reduce to polylogarithmic expressions for the cubic coupling in inflationary limit. We further show that all family trees can be decomposed into linear chains by taking shuffle products of all subfamilies, with which we find simple connection between bulk time integrals and boundary energy integrals.</description>

      <title>Dark Matter-induced electron excitations in silicon and germanium with Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07053v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We train a deep neural network (DNN) to output rates of dark matter (DM) induced electron excitations in silicon and germanium detectors. Our DNN provides a massive speedup of around $5$ orders of magnitude relative to existing methods (i.e. QEdark-EFT), allowing for extensive parameter scans in the event of an observed DM signal. The network is also lighter and simpler to use than alternative computational frameworks based on a direct calculation of the DM-induced excitation rate. The DNN can be downloaded $\href{https://github.com/urdshals/DEDD}{\text{here}}$.</description>

      <title>Enhancement of $p$-wave dark matter annihilation by quasi-bound states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07108v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We scrutinize the Sommerfeld enhancement in dark matter pair annihilation for $p$-wave and higher-$\ell$ partial waves. For the Yukawa potential these feature a super-resonant Breit-Wigner peak in their velocity-dependence close to Sommerfeld resonances as well as a universal scaling with velocity for all $\ell\geq 1$ that differs from the $s$-wave case. We provide a quantum mechanical explanation for these phenomena in terms of quasi-bound states sustained by the centrifugal barrier of the partial-wave potential, and give approximate WKB expressions capturing the main effects. The impact of quasi-bound states is exemplified for wino dark matter and models with light mediators, with a focus on indirect detection signals. We note that quasi-bound states can also explain similar peaks in the bound-state formation and self-scattering cross sections.</description>

      <title>Selecting energy-momentum trace dependent gravity theories with LSS</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07130v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study scalar cosmological perturbations in $f(R, T)$ modified gravity theories being $T$ the trace of the energy-momentum tensor. We provide detailed equations for the matter energy density contrast. We solve then numerically to promote a comparison with available large scale structure (LSS) formation observational data on $f \sigma_8$ and also addressing the $S_8$ tension. We identify $f(R,T)$ models that lead either to growth enhancement or suppression. Since recent results in the literature indicate a preference for the latter feature, this type of analysis is quite useful to select viable modifications of gravity. We studied class of such $f(R,T)$ models are either ruled out or severely restricted.</description>

      <title>$\alpha$-Generalized No-Scale Inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07333v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose the $\alpha$-generalized no-scale supergravity, and study the corresponding inflationary models. With a new parameter $0&lt;\alpha\leq 1$, the $\alpha$-generalized no-scale supergravity provides the continuous connections among the generic no-scale supergravity from string theory compactifications. The resulting prediction of the CMB, spectrum index $n_s$, and tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ can be highly consistent with the latest Planck/BICEP/Keck Array observations. Notably, the models with $\alpha\neq 1$ give a smaller ratio $r\leq 10^{-3}$, which is flexible even under the anticipated tighter observational constraints at the future experiments. Additionally, these models have the potential to generate a broad-band stochastic gravitational wave background, and thus explain the NANOGrav 15yr signal. Furthermore, they predict the formation of primordial black holes (PBHs) with various mass scales, which could account for an significant portion of dark matter relic density in the Universe.</description>

      <title>Constraining the Initial Mass function in the Epoch of Reionization from Astrophysical and Cosmological data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07401v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: [abridged] We aim to constrain the stellar initial mass function (IMF) during the epoch of reionization. To this purpose, we build up a semi-empirical model for the reionization history of the Universe, based on various ingredients: the latest determination of the UV galaxy luminosity function from JWST out to redshift $z\lesssim 12$; data-inferred and simulation-driven assumptions on the redshift-dependent escape fraction of ionizing photons from primordial galaxies; a simple yet flexible parameterization of the IMF $\phi(m_\star)\sim m_\star^\xi\, e^{-m_{\star,\rm c}/m_\star}$ in terms of a high-mass end slope $\xi&lt;0$ and of a characteristic mass $m_{\star,\rm c}$ below which a flattening or a bending sets in; the PARSEC stellar evolution code to compute the UV and ionizing emission from different star's masses as a function of age and metallicity; a few physical constraints related to stellar and galaxy formation in faint galaxies at the reionization redshifts. We compare our model outcomes with the reionization observables from different astrophysical and cosmological probes, and perform Bayesian inference on the IMF parameters. We find that the IMF slope $\xi$ is within the range from $-2.8$ to $-2.3$, while appreciably flatter slopes are excluded at great significance. However, the bestfit value of the IMF characteristic mass $m_{\star,\rm c}\sim$ a few $M_\odot$ implies a suppression in the formation of small stellar masses, at variance with the IMF in the local Universe; this may be induced by the thermal background $\sim 20-30$ K provided by CMB photons at the reionization redshifts. Finally, we investigate the implications of our reconstructed IMF on the recent JWST detections of massive galaxies at and beyond the reionization epoch, showing that any putative tension with the standard cosmological framework is substantially alleviated.</description>

      <title>The post--quasi-static approximation: An analytical approach to gravitational collapse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07550v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A semi--numerical approach proposed many years ago for describing gravitational collapse in the post--quasi--static approximation, is modified in order to avoid the numerical integration of the basic differential equations the approach is based upon. For doing that we have to impose some restrictions on the fluid distribution. More specifically, we shall assume the vanishing complexity factor condition, which allows for analytical integration of the pertinent differential equations and leads to physically interesting models. Instead, we show that neither the homologous nor the quasi--homologous evolution are acceptable since they lead to geodesic fluids, which are unsuitable for being described in the post--quasi--static approximation. Also, we prove that, within this approximation, adiabatic evolution also leads to geodesic fluids and therefore we shall consider exclusively dissipative systems. Besides the vanishing complexity factor condition, additional information is required for a full description of models. We shall propose different strategies for obtaining such an information, which are based on observables quantities (e.g. luminosity and redshift), and/or heuristic mathematical ansatz. To illustrate the method, we present two models. One model is inspired in the well known Schwarzschild interior solution, and another one is inspired in Tolman VI solution.</description>

      <title>The Aemulus Project VI: Emulation of beyond-standard galaxy clustering statistics to improve cosmological constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.03203v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There is untapped cosmological information in galaxy redshift surveys in the non-linear regime. In this work, we use the AEMULUS suite of cosmological $N$-body simulations to construct Gaussian process emulators of galaxy clustering statistics at small scales ($0.1-50 \: h^{-1}\,\mathrm{Mpc}$) in order to constrain cosmological and galaxy bias parameters. In addition to standard statistics -- the projected correlation function $w_\mathrm{p}(r_\mathrm{p})$, the redshift-space monopole of the correlation function $\xi_0(s)$, and the quadrupole $\xi_2(s)$ -- we emulate statistics that include information about the local environment, namely the underdensity probability function $P_\mathrm{U}(s)$ and the density-marked correlation function $M(s)$. This extends the model of AEMULUS III for redshift-space distortions by including new statistics sensitive to galaxy assembly bias. In recovery tests, we find that the beyond-standard statistics significantly increase the constraining power on cosmological parameters of interest: including $P_\mathrm{U}(s)$ and $M(s)$ improves the precision of our constraints on $\Omega_m$ by 27%, $\sigma_8$ by 19%, and the growth of structure parameter, $f \sigma_8$, by 12% compared to standard statistics. We additionally find that scales below $\sim6 \: h^{-1}\,\mathrm{Mpc}$ contain as much information as larger scales. The density-sensitive statistics also contribute to constraining halo occupation distribution parameters and a flexible environment-dependent assembly bias model, which is important for extracting the small-scale cosmological information as well as understanding the galaxy-halo connection. This analysis demonstrates the potential of emulating beyond-standard clustering statistics at small scales to constrain the growth of structure as a test of cosmic acceleration.</description>

Abstract: The Einstein field equations of general relativity constrain the local curvature at every point in spacetime, but say nothing about the global topology of the Universe. Cosmic microwave background anisotropies have proven to be the most powerful probe of non-trivial topology since, within $\Lambda$CDM, these anisotropies have well-characterized statistical properties, the signal is principally from a thin spherical shell centered on the observer (the last scattering surface), and space-based observations nearly cover the full sky. The most generic signature of cosmic topology in the microwave background is pairs of circles with matching temperature and polarization patterns. No such circle pairs have been seen above noise in the WMAP or Planck temperature data, implying that the shortest non-contractible loop around the Universe through our location is longer than 98.5% of the comoving diameter of the last scattering surface. We translate this generic constraint into limits on the parameters that characterize manifolds with each of the nine possible non-trivial orientable Euclidean topologies, and provide a code which computes these constraints. In all but the simplest cases, the shortest non-contractible loop in the space can avoid us, and be shorter than the diameter of the last scattering surface by a factor ranging from 2 to at least 6. This result implies that a broader range of manifolds is observationally allowed than widely appreciated. Probing these manifolds will require more subtle statistical signatures than matched circles, such as off-diagonal correlations of harmonic coefficients.</description>

      <title>Mass-redshift dependency of Supermassive Black Hole Binaries for the Gravitational Wave Background</title>

Abstract: Studying how the black hole (BH) - (galaxy) bulge mass relation evolves with redshift provides valuable insights into the co-evolution of supermassive black holes and their host galaxies. However, obtaining accurate measurement of BH masses is challenging due to the bias towards the most massive and luminous galaxies. Instead we focus on the BH and bulge masses as they vary with redshift using the EAGLE, Illustris, TNG100, TNG300, Horizon-AGN and SIMBA large-scale cosmological simulations. We use an analytical astrophysical model with galaxy stellar mass function, pair fraction, merger timescale and BH-bulge mass relation extended to include redshift evolution. The model can predict the intensity of the gravitational wave background (GWB) produced by a population of supermassive black hole binary (SMBHB) as a function of the frequency. This allows us to compare the predictions of this model with the constraints of Pulsar Timing Array observations. Here, we employ Bayesian analysis for the parameter inference. We find that all six simulations are consistent $\leq 3.5\sigma$ with a range of simulated GWB spectra. By fixing the BH-bulge mass parameters to the simulations we analyze the changes in the constraints on the other astrophysical parameters. Furthermore, we also examine the variation in SMBHB merger rate with mass and redshift between these large-scale simulations.</description>

      <title>The weak, the strong and the ugly -- A comparative analysis of interacting stepped dark radiation</title>

Abstract: Models which address both the Hubble and $S_8$ tensions with the same mechanism generically cause a pre-recombination suppression of the small scale matter power spectrum. Here we focus on two such models. Both models introduce a self-interacting dark radiation fluid scattering with dark matter, which has a step in its abundance around some transition redshift. In one model, the interaction is weak and with all of the dark matter whereas in the other it is strong but with only a fraction of the dark matter. The weakly interacting case is able to address both tensions simultaneously and provide a good fit to a the Planck measurements of the cosmic microwave background (CMB), the Pantheon Type Ia supernovae, and a combination of low and high redshift baryon acoustic oscillation data, whereas the strongly interacting model cannot significantly ease both tensions simultaneously. The addition of high-resolution cosmic microwave background (CMB) measurements (ACT DR4 and SPT-3G) slightly limits both model's ability to address the Hubble tension. The use of the effective field theory of large-scale structures analysis of BOSS DR12 LRG and eBOSS DR16 QSO data additionally limits their ability to address the $S_8$ tension. We explore how these models respond to these data sets in detail in order to draw general conclusions about what is required for a mechanism to address both tensions. We find that in order to fit the CMB data the time dependence of the suppression of the matter power spectrum plays a central role.</description>

      <title>21-cm foreground removal using AI and frequency-difference technique</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.06518v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The deep learning technique has been employed in removing foreground contaminants from 21 cm intensity mapping, but its effectiveness is limited by the large dynamic range of the foreground amplitude. In this study, we develop a novel foreground removal technique grounded in U-Net networks. The essence of this technique lies in introducing an innovative data preprocessing step specifically, utilizing the temperature difference between neighboring frequency bands as input, which can substantially reduce the dynamic range of foreground amplitudes by approximately two orders of magnitude. This reduction proves to be highly advantageous for the U-Net foreground removal. We observe that the HI signal can be reliably recovered, as indicated by the cross-correlation power spectra showing unity agreement at the scale of $k &lt; 0.3 h^{-1}$Mpc in the absence of instrumental effects. Moreover, accounting for the systematic beam effects, our reconstruction displays consistent auto-correlation and cross-correlation power spectrum ratios at the $1\sigma$ level across scales $k \lesssim 0.1 h^{-1}$Mpc, with only a 10% reduction observed in the cross-correlation power spectrum at $k\simeq0.2 h^{-1}$Mpc. The effects of redshift-space distortion are also reconstructed successfully, as evidenced by the quadrupole power spectra matching. In comparison, our method outperforms the traditional Principal Component Analysis method, which derived cross-correlation ratios are underestimated by around 60%. We simulated various white noise levels in the map and found that the mean cross-correlation ratio $\bar{R}_\mathrm{cross} \gtrsim 0.8$ when the level of the thermal noise is smaller than or equal to that of the HI signal. We conclude that the proposed frequency-difference technique can significantly enhance network performance by reducing the amplitude range of foregrounds and aiding in the prevention of HI loss.</description>

      <title>A modified lognormal approximation of the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest: comparison with full hydrodynamic simulations at $2\leq z\leq 2.7$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.12720v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Observations of the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest in distant quasar spectra with upcoming surveys are expected to provide significantly larger and higher-quality datasets. To interpret these datasets, it is imperative to develop efficient simulations. One such approach is based on the assumption that baryonic densities in the intergalactic medium (IGM) follow a lognormal distribution. We extend our earlier work to assess the robustness of the lognormal model of the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest in recovering the parameters characterizing IGM state, namely, the mean-density IGM temperature ($T_0$), the slope of the temperature-density relation ($\gamma$), and the hydrogen photoionization rate ($\Gamma_{12}$), by comparing with high-resolution Sherwood SPH simulations across the redshift range $2 \leq z \leq 2.7$. These parameters are estimated through a Markov Chain Monte Carlo technique, using the mean and power spectrum of the transmitted flux. We find that the usual lognormal distribution of IGM densities cannot recover the parameters of the SPH simulations. This limitation arises from the fact that the SPH baryonic density distribution cannot be described by a simple lognormal form. To address this, we extend the model by scaling the linear density contrast by a parameter $\nu$. While the resulting baryonic density is still lognormal, the additional parameter gives us extra freedom in setting the variance of density fluctuations. With this extension, values of $T_0$ and $\gamma$ implied in the SPH simulations are recovered at $\sim 1-\sigma$ ($\lesssim$ 10%) of the median (best-fit) values for most redshifts bins. However, this extended lognormal model cannot recover $\Gamma_{12}$ reliably, with the best-fit value discrepant by $\gtrsim 3-\sigma$ for $z &gt; 2.2$. Despite this limitation in the recovery of $\Gamma_{12}$, we argue that the model remains useful for constraining cosmological parameters.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the nature of correlations in the small-scale flux statistics of the Lyman-$\alpha$ (Ly$\alpha$) forest across redshift bins. Understanding these correlations is important for unbiased cosmological and astrophysical parameter inference using the Ly$\alpha$ forest. We focus on the 1-dimensional flux power spectrum (FPS) and mean flux ($\bar F$) simulated using the semi-numerical lognormal model we developed in earlier work. The lognormal model can capture the effects of long wavelength modes with relative ease as compared to full smoothed particle hydrodynamical (SPH) simulations that are limited by box volume. For a single redshift bin of size $\Delta z\simeq 0.1$, we show that the lognormal model predicts positive cross-correlations between $k$-bins in the FPS, and a negative correlation for $\bar F\times$ FPS, in qualitative agreement with SPH simulations and theoretical expectations. For measurements across two neighbouring redshift bins of width $\Delta z$ each (obtained by 'splitting' skewers of length $2\Delta z$ in half), the lognormal model predicts an anti-correlation for FPS $\times$ FPS and a positive correlation for $\bar F\times$ FPS, caused by long wavelength modes. This is in contrast to SPH simulations which predict a negligible magnitude for cross-redshift correlations derived from such `split' skewers, and we discuss possible reasons for this difference. Finally, we perform a preliminary test of the impact of neglecting long wavelength modes on parameter inference, finding that whereas the correlation structure of neighbouring redshift bins has relatively little impact, the absence of long wavelength modes in the model can lead to $\gtrsim2-\sigma$ biases in the inference of astrophysical parameters. Our results motivate a more careful treatment of long wavelength modes in analyses that rely on the small scale Ly$\alpha$ forest for parameter inference.</description>

      <title>Probing the Physics of Reionization Using kSZ Power Spectrum from Current and Upcoming CMB Surveys</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.00315v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The patchiness in the reionization process alters the statistics of Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), with the kinematic Sunyaev-Zeldovich (kSZ) effect in the CMB temperature power spectrum being a notable consequence. In this work, we aim to explore the potential of future kSZ power spectrum measurements in inferring the details of the reionization process. In this pursuit, we capitalize on the recent developments in foreground mitigation techniques using the Cross-Internal Linear Combination (Cross-ILC) technique, which enables robust detection of the kSZ power spectrum with signal-to-noise ($S/N$) roughly $20-30\sigma$ in this decade by SPT-3G and Simons Observatory (SO); and $\geq 80\sigma$ by CMB-S4, substantially improving on the recent evidence for kSZ binned at $\ell=3000$ using SPT-SZ+SPTpol surveys. We use a fiducial kSZ power spectrum along with realistic error bars expected from the above technique for SPT-3G, SO, and CMB-S4 to constrain the parameter space for a physical model of reionization. We find that with the improved error bars it will be possible to place stringent constraints on reionization using solely the Cross-ILC recovered SPT-3G kSZ without imposing any prior on $\tau$ in the Bayesian inference. Notably, high-fidelity kSZ measurements from CMB-S4 coupled with $\tau$ measurements through LiteBIRD will enable unprecedented constraint on the midpoint of reionization with an error bar of $\sim 0.25$ and the duration of reionization with an error bar at $\sim 0.21$ exclusively using CMB data. This study highlights the need to capture kSZ power spectrum on a broad range of multipoles to gain insights into the inhomogeneous reionization era.</description>

      <title>Under Einstein's Microscope: Measuring Properties of Individual Rotating Massive Stars From Extragalactic Micro Caustic Crossings</title>

Abstract: Highly magnified stars residing in caustic crossing lensed galaxies at z ~ 0.7-1.5 in galaxy cluster lensing fields inevitably exhibit recurrent brightening events as they traverse a micro caustic network cast down by foreground intracluster stars. The detectable ones belong to Nature's most massive and luminous class of stars, with evolved blue supergiants being the brightest ones at optical wavelengths. Considering single stars in this work, we study to what extent intrinsic stellar parameters are measurable from multi-filter lightcurves, which can be obtained with optical/near-IR space telescopes during one or multiple caustic crossing events. We adopt a realistic model for the axisymmetric surface brightness profiles of rotating O/B stars and develop a numerical lensing code that treats finite-source-size effects. With a single micro caustic crossing, the ratio of the surface rotation velocity to the breakup value is measurable to an precision of ~ 0.1-0.2 for feasible observation parameters with current space telescopes, with all unknown intrinsic and extrinsic parameters marginalized over and without a degeneracy with inclination. Equatorial radius and bolometric luminosity can be measured to 1/3 and 2/3 of the fractional uncertainty in the micro caustic strength, for which the value is not known at each crossing but an informative prior can be obtained from theory. Parameter inference precision may be further improved if multiple caustic crossing events for the same lensed star are jointly analyzed. Our results imply new opportunities to survey individual massive stars in star-formation sites at z ~ 0.7-1.5 or beyond.</description>

      <title>Improved Weak Lensing Photometric Redshift Calibration via StratLearn and Hierarchical Modeling</title>

Abstract: Discrepancies between cosmological parameter estimates from cosmic shear surveys and from recent Planck cosmic microwave background measurements challenge the ability of the highly successful $\Lambda$CDM model to describe the nature of the Universe. To rule out systematic biases in cosmic shear survey analyses, accurate redshift calibration within tomographic bins is key. In this paper, we improve photo-$z$ calibration via Bayesian hierarchical modeling of full galaxy photo-$z$ conditional densities, by employing $\textit{StratLearn}$, a recently developed statistical methodology, which accounts for systematic differences in the distribution of the spectroscopic training/source set and the photometric target set. Using realistic simulations that were designed to resemble the KiDS+VIKING-450 dataset, we show that $\textit{StratLearn}$-estimated conditional densities improve the galaxy tomographic bin assignment, and that our $\textit{StratLearn}$-Bayesian framework leads to nearly unbiased estimates of the target population means. This leads to a factor of $\sim 2$ improvement upon the previously best photo-$z$ calibration method. Our approach delivers a maximum bias per tomographic bin of $\Delta \langle z \rangle = 0.0095 \pm 0.0089$, with an average absolute bias of $0.0052 \pm 0.0067$ across the five tomographic bins.</description>

      <title>Hubble tension may indicate time-dependent dark matter energy density</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.03484v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The values of Hubble constant H0 by direct measurements with standard distance ladder are typically larger than those obtained from the observation of cosmic microwave background and the galaxy survey with inverse distance ladder. On the other hand, although the errors are still large, various determinations of the value of matter density parameter Omega_m are consistent with each other. Therefore, it is possible that the difference in Hubble constant is translated to the difference of physical matter energy density omega_m = Omega_m h^2, where h = H0 / (100 Km/s/Mpc). In this article it is examined the possibility of an increase of the physical dark matter energy density by a fast transition at a certain value of redshift as a possible resolution of the Hubble tension. A phenomenological fluid model of the dark sector, which is the modification of a so-called unified dark matter model, is introduced to concretely realize such a fast transition in the physical dark matter energy density.</description>

      <title>The Simons Observatory: impact of bandpass, polarization angle and calibration uncertainties on small-scale power spectrum analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.05242v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the effects due to mismatches in passbands, polarization angles, and temperature and polarization calibrations in the context of the upcoming cosmic microwave background experiment Simons Observatory (SO). Using the SO multi-frequency likelihood, we estimate the bias and the degradation of constraining power in cosmological and astrophysical foreground parameters assuming different levels of knowledge of the instrumental effects. We find that incorrect but reasonable assumptions on the values of all the systematics examined here can have important effects in cosmological analyses, hence requiring marginalization approaches at likelihood level. When doing so, we find that the most relevant effect is due to bandpass shifts. When marginalizing over them, the posteriors of parameters describing astrophysical microwave foregrounds (such as radio point sources or dust) get degraded, while cosmological parameters constraints are not significantly affected. Marginalization over polarization angles with up to 0.25$^\circ$ uncertainty causes an irrelevant bias $\lesssim 0.05 \sigma$ in all parameters. Marginalization over calibration factors in polarization broadens the constraints on the effective number of relativistic degrees of freedom $N_\mathrm{eff}$ by a factor 1.2, interpreted here as a proxy parameter for non standard model physics targeted by high-resolution CMB measurements.</description>

      <title>Constraining Cosmological Parameters with Viscous Modified Chaplygin Gas and Generalized Cosmic Chaplygin Gas Models in Horava-Lifshitz Gravity: Utilizing Late-time Datasets</title>

Abstract: This study examines accelerated cosmic expansion using the Viscous Modified Chaplygin Gas (VMMG) and Generalized Cosmic Chaplygin Gas (GCCM) within Horava-Lifshitz gravity. Our aim is to constrain essential cosmological parameters, such as the Hubble Parameter ($H_{0}$) and Sound Horizon ($r_{d}$). We utilize late-time datasets: 17 Baryon Acoustic Oscillation observations, 33 Cosmic Chronometer measurements, 40 Type Ia Supernovae data points, 24 quasar Hubble diagram data points, and 162 Gamma Ray Bursts data points, along with the latest determination of the Hubble constant (R22). Treating $r_{d}$ as a free parameter offers several advantages, including mitigating bias, enhancing precision, and improving compatibility with various datasets. By introducing random correlations in the covariance matrix during simulation, errors are effectively reduced. Our estimated values of the Hubble constant ($H_0$) and $r_{d}$ consistently align with measurements from both the Planck and SDSS experiments. Cosmographic tests provide valuable insights into the dynamics of various cosmological models, enriching our understanding of cosmic evolution. Statefinder diagnostics offer deeper insights into cosmic expansion dynamics, aiding in distinguishing between cosmological frameworks. Furthermore, the $o_{m}$ diagnostic test reveals that at late times, VMMG falls into the phantom region, while GCCM falls into the quintessence region. The Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) support all models, indicating plausible explanations. Notably, the $\Lambda$CDM model emerges with the lowest AIC score, suggesting its relatively superior fit. Validation via the reduced $\chi_{\text{red}}^{2}$ statistic confirms satisfactory fits across all models, reinforcing their credibility.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.13135v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The presence of a plethora of light spin 0 and spin 1 fields is motivated in a number of BSM scenarios, such as the axiverse. The study of the interactions of such light bosonic fields with the Standard Model has focused mostly on interactions involving only one such field, such as the axion ($\phi$) coupling to photons, $\phi F \tilde F$, or the kinetic mixing between photon and the dark photon, $ F F_D$. In this work, we continue the exploration of interactions involving two light BSM fields and the standard model, focusing on the mixed axion-photon-dark-photon interaction $\phi F \tilde F_D$. If either the axion or dark photon are dark matter, we show that this interaction leads to conversion of the CMB photons into a dark sector particle, leading to a distortion in the CMB spectrum. We present the details of these unique distortion signatures and the resulting constraints on the $\phi F \tilde F_D$ coupling. In particular, we find that for a wide range of masses, the constraints from these effect are stronger than on the more widely studied axion-photon coupling.</description>

      <title>Inflation Correlators with Multiple Massive Exchanges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.10849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.10849v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The most general tree-level boundary correlation functions of quantum fields in inflationary spacetime involve multiple exchanges of massive states in the bulk, which are technically difficult to compute due to the multi-layer nested time integrals in the Schwinger-Keldysh formalism. On the other hand, correlators with multiple massive exchanges are well motivated in cosmological collider physics, with the original quasi-single-field inflation model as a notable example. In this work, with the partial Mellin-Barnes representation, we derive a simple rule, called family-tree decomposition, for directly writing down analytical answers for arbitrary nested time integrals in terms of multi-variable hypergeometric series. We present the derivation of this rule together with many explicit examples. This result allows us to obtain analytical expressions for general tree-level inflation correlators with multiple massive exchanges. As an example, we present the full analytical results for a range of tree correlators with two massive exchanges.</description>

      <title>Gravitational neutrino reheating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.07684v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite having important cosmological implications, the reheating phase is believed to play a crucial role in cosmology and particle physics model building. Conventionally, the model of reheating with an arbitrary coupling of inflaton to massless fields naturally lacks precise prediction and hence difficult to verify through observation. In this paper, we propose a simple and natural reheating mechanism where the particle physics model, namely the Type-I seesaw is shown to play a major role in the entire reheating process where inflaton is coupled with all the fields only gravitationally. Besides successfully resolving the well-known neutrino mass and baryon asymmetry problems, this scenario offers successful reheating, predicts distinct primordial gravitational wave spectrum and non-vanishing lowest active neutrino mass. Our novel mechanism opens up a new avenue of integrating particle physics and cosmology in the context of reheating.</description>

      <title>Diffuse Axion Background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.00100v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Relativistic axions can be readily produced in a broad variety of transient sources, such as axion star bosenova explosions, supernovae or even evaporating primordial black holes. We develop a general framework describing the resulting persistent diffuse axion background (D$a$B) due to accumulated axions from historic transient events. We derive strong constraints on the D$a$B flux from light axions $m\lesssim 10^{-3}\,{\rm eV}$ emitted from sources with energies $\omega \gtrsim{\rm MeV}$ considering the non-observation of excess photons associated with axion-photon coupling from experiments, including COMPTEL, NuSTAR, XMM-Newton, INTEGRAL, EGRET and Fermi. Future searches in experiments such as SKA, JWST, XRISM, Vera C. Rubin Observatory, AMEGO/e-ASTROGAM will allow probing D$a$B and associated axion-photon couplings with unprecedented sensitivity covering a wide range of possible source energies as low as $0.1\,\mu$eV and multiple decades in axion masses. We highlight the differences between astrophysical and dark sector sources of D$a$B. Further, we discuss complementarity with direct detection as well as prospects for other D$a$B searches. Our analysis demonstrates that D$a$B can act as a promising probe of populations of axion emission sources as well as emission mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Sliding into DM: Determining the local dark matter density and speed distribution using only the local circular speed of the Galaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04122v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use FIRE-2 zoom simulations of Milky Way size disk galaxies to derive easy-to-use relationships between the observed circular speed of the Galaxy at the Solar location, $v_\mathrm{c}$, and dark matter properties of relevance for direct detection experiments: the dark matter density, the dark matter velocity dispersion, and the speed distribution of dark matter particles near the Solar location. We find that both the local dark matter density and 3D velocity dispersion follow tight power laws with $v_\mathrm{c}$. Using this relation together with the observed circular speed of the Milky Way at the Solar radius, we infer the local dark matter density and velocity dispersion near the Sun to be $\rho = 0.42\pm 0.06\,\mathrm{GeV\,cm^{-3}}$ and $\sigma_\mathrm{3D} = 280^{+19}_{-18}\,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$. We also find that the distribution of dark matter particle speeds is well-described by a modified Maxwellian with two shape parameters, both of which correlate with the observed $v_{\rm c}$. We use that modified Maxwellian to predict the speed distribution of dark matter near the Sun and find that it peaks at a most probable speed of $250\,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$ and begins to truncate sharply above $470\,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$. This peak speed is somewhat higher than expected from the standard halo model, and the truncation occurs well below the formal escape speed to infinity, with fewer very-high-speed particles than assumed in the standard halo model.</description>

      <title>Evidence of a Past Merger of the Galactic Center Black Hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06416v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The origin of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) residing in the centers of most galaxies remains a mystery. Various growth models, such as accretion and hierarchical mergers, have been proposed to explain the existence and cosmological evolution of these SMBHs, but no direct observational evidence is available to test these models. The Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) offered direct imaging of nearby SMBHs, in particular, the one at the center of the Milky Way Galaxy named Sgr~A*. Measurements suggest that the Sgr~A* BH spins rapidly with significant spin axis misalignment relative to the angular momentum of the Galactic plane. Through investigating various SMBH growth models, here we show that the spin properties of Sgr~A* provides strong evidence of a past SMBH merger. Inspired by the merger between the Milky Way and Gaia-Enceladus, which has a 4:1 mass ratio as inferred from Gaia data, we have discovered that a 4:1 major merger of SMBH with a binary angular momentum inclination angle of 15-45 degrees with respect to the line of sight (LOS), can successfully replicate the measured spin properties of Sgr A*. This merger event in our galaxy provides observational support for the theory of hierarchical BH mergers in the formation and growth of SMBHs. The inferred merger rate, consistent with theoretical predictions, suggests a promising detection rate of SMBH mergers for space-borne gravitational wave detectors expected to operate in 2030s.</description>
