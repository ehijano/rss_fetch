      <title>Soft-ECM: An extension of Evidential C-Means for complex data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13417v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Clustering based on belief functions has been gaining increasing attention in the machine learning community due to its ability to effectively represent uncertainty and/or imprecision. However, none of the existing algorithms can be applied to complex data, such as mixed data (numerical and categorical) or non-tabular data like time series. Indeed, these types of data are, in general, not represented in a Euclidean space and the aforementioned algorithms make use of the properties of such spaces, in particular for the construction of barycenters. In this paper, we reformulate the Evidential C-Means (ECM) problem for clustering complex data. We propose a new algorithm, Soft-ECM, which consistently positions the centroids of imprecise clusters requiring only a semi-metric. Our experiments show that Soft-ECM present results comparable to conventional fuzzy clustering approaches on numerical data, and we demonstrate its ability to handle mixed data and its benefits when combining fuzzy clustering with semi-metrics such as DTW for time series data.</description>

      <title>Some short notes on oriented line graphs and related matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13821v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The notion of oriented line graphs is introduced by Kotani and Sunada, and they are closely related to Hashimato's non-backtracking matrix. It is known that for regular graphs $G$, the eigenvalues of the adjacency matrix of the oriented line graph $\vec{L}(G)$ of $G$ are the reciprocals of the poles of the Ihara zeta function of $G$. We determine the characteristic polynomial of the adjacency matrix of the underlying undirected graph of $\vec{L}(G)$ and the skew-symmetric adjacency matrix of $\vec{L}(G)$ for $d$-regular graphs $G$ with $d\geq 3$. We also exhibit a consequence of this result to star coloring of regular graphs.</description>

      <title>List strong and list normal edge-coloring of (sub)cubic graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01049v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A strong edge-coloring of a graph is a proper edge-coloring, in which the edges of every path of length 3 receive distinct colors; in other words, every pair of edges at distance at most 2 must be colored differently. The least number of colors needed for a strong edge-coloring of a graph is the strong chromatic index. We consider the list version of the coloring and prove that the list strong chromatic index of graphs with maximum degree 3 is at most 10. This bound is tight and improves the previous bound of 11 colors.
  We also consider the question whether the strong chromatic index and the list strong chromatic index always coincide. We answer it in negative by presenting an infinite family of graphs for which the two invariants differ. For the special case of the Petersen graph, we show that its list strong chromatic index equals 7, while its strong chromatic index is 5. Up to our best knowledge, this is the first known edge-coloring for which there are graphs with distinct values of the chromatic index and its list version.
  In relation to the above, we also initiate the study of the list version of the normal edge-coloring. A normal edge-coloring of a cubic graph is a proper edge-coloring, in which every edge is adjacent to edges colored with 4 colors or to edges colored with 2 colors. It is conjectured that 5 colors suffice for a normal edge-coloring of any bridgeless cubic graph which is equivalent to the Petersen Coloring Conjecture.
  Similarly to strong edge-coloring, list normal edge-coloring is much more restrictive and consequently for many graphs the list normal chromatic index is greater than the normal chromatic index. We show that there are cubic graphs with list normal chromatic index at least $9$, there are bridgeless cubic graphs with its value at least 8, and there are cyclically 4-edge-connected cubic graphs with value at least 7.</description>

      <title>Efficient Online Random Sampling via Randomness Recycling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18879v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: ``Randomness recycling'' is a powerful algorithmic technique for reusing a fraction of the random information consumed by a probabilistic algorithm to reduce its entropy requirements. This article presents a family of randomness recycling algorithms for efficiently sampling a sequence $X_1, X_2, X_3, \dots$ of discrete random variables whose joint distribution follows an arbitrary stochastic process. We develop randomness recycling techniques to reduce the entropy cost of a variety of prominent sampling algorithms, which include uniform sampling, inverse transform sampling, lookup-table sampling, alias sampling, and discrete distribution generating (DDG) tree sampling. Our method achieves an expected amortized entropy cost of $H(X_1,\dots,X_k)/k + \varepsilon$ input bits per output sample using $O(\log(1/\varepsilon))$ space as $k\to\infty$, which is arbitrarily close to the optimal Shannon entropy rate of $H(X_1,\dots,X_k)/k$ bits per sample. The combination of space, time, and entropy properties of our method improves upon the Knuth and Yao entropy-optimal algorithm and Han and Hoshi interval algorithm for sampling a discrete random sequence.
  On the empirical side, we show that randomness recycling enables state-of-the-art runtime performance on the Fisher-Yates shuffle when using a cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generator; and it can also speed up discrete Gaussian samplers. Accompanying the manuscript is a performant software library in the C programming language that uses randomness recycling to accelerate several existing algorithms for random sampling.</description>

      <title>On finite extensions of lamplighter groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13203v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a family of groups consisting of the simplest extensions of lamplighter groups. We use these groups to answer multiple open questions in combinatorial group theory, providing groups that exhibit various combinations of properties: 1) Decidable Subgroup Membership and undecidable Uniform Subgroup Membership Problem, 2) Rational volume growth series and undecidable Word Problem and 3) Recursive (even context-free) language of conjugacy geodesics, decidable Word Problem, and undecidable Conjugacy Problem. We also consider the co-Word Problem, residual finiteness and the Isomorphism Problem within this class.</description>
