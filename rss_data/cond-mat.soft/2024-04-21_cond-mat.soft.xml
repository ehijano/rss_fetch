      <title>Coil-to-globule collapse of active polymers: a Rouse perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive an effective Rouse model for tangentially active polymers, characterized by a constant active force tangent to their backbone. In particular, we show that, once extended to account for finite bending rigidity, such active Rouse model captures the reduction in the gyration radius, or coil-to-globule-like transition, that has been observed numerically in the literature for such active filaments. Interestingly, our analysis identifies the proper definition of the Peclet number, that allows to collapse all numerical data onto a master curve.</description>

      <title>Incorporation of the intensive and extensive entropy contributions in the disk intersection theory of a hard disk system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The one-body free volume, which determines the entropy of a hard disk system, has extensive (cavity) and intensive (cell) contributions. So far these contributions have not been unified and considered separately. The presented theory incorporates both contributions, and their sum is shown to determine the free volume and partition function. The approach is based on multiple intersections of the circles concentric with the disks but of twice larger radius. The result is exact formulae for the extensive and intensive entropy contributions in terms of the intersections of just two, three, four, and five circles. The method has an important advantage for applications in numerical simulations: the formulae enable one to convert the disk coordinates into the entropy contribution directly without any additional geometric construction. The theory can be straightforwardly applied to a system of hard spheres.</description>

      <title>Enumerating low-frequency nonphononic vibrations in computer glasses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12735v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In addition to Goldstone phonons that generically emerge in the low-frequency vibrational spectrum of any solid, crystalline or glassy, structural glasses also feature other low-frequency vibrational modes. The nature and statistical properties of these modes -- often termed `excess modes' -- have been the subject of decades-long investigation. Studying them, even using well-controlled computer glasses, has proven challenging due to strong spatial hybridization effects between phononic and nonphononic excitations, which hinder quantitative analyses of the nonphononic contribution ${\cal D}_{\rm G}(\omega)$ to the total spectrum ${\cal D}(\omega)$, per frequency $\omega$. Here, using recent advances indicating that ${\cal D}_{\rm G}(\omega)\!=\!{\cal D}(\omega)-{\cal D}_{\rm D}(\omega)$, where ${\cal D}_{\rm D}(\omega)$ is Debye's spectrum of phonons, we present a simple and straightforward scheme to enumerate nonphononic modes in computer glasses. Our analysis establishes that nonphononic modes in computer glasses indeed make an additive contribution to the total spectrum, including in the presence of strong hybridizations. Moreover, it cleanly reveals the universal ${\cal D}_{\rm G}(\omega)\!\sim\!\omega^4$ tail of the nonphononic spectrum, and opens the way for related analyses of experimental spectra of glasses.</description>

      <title>Interpreting neural operators: how nonlinear waves propagate in non-reciprocal solids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12918v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a data-driven pipeline for model building that combines interpretable machine learning, hydrodynamic theories, and microscopic models. The goal is to uncover the underlying processes governing nonlinear dynamics experiments. We exemplify our method with data from microfluidic experiments where crystals of streaming droplets support the propagation of nonlinear waves absent in passive crystals. By combining physics-inspired neural networks, known as neural operators, with symbolic regression tools, we generate the solution, as well as the mathematical form, of a nonlinear dynamical system that accurately models the experimental data. Finally, we interpret this continuum model from fundamental physics principles. Informed by machine learning, we coarse grain a microscopic model of interacting droplets and discover that non-reciprocal hydrodynamic interactions stabilise and promote nonlinear wave propagation.</description>

      <title>Diffusive contact between randomly driven colloidal suspensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12929v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the relaxation process of two driven colloidal suspensions in diffusive contact to a steady state, similar to thermalization. We start by studying a single suspension, subjecting it to random driving forces via holographic optical tweezers, which agitate it to a higher effective temperature. Interestingly, the effective temperature of the suspension, defined by the Einstein relation, exhibits a non-monotonic dependence on the driving frequency. Next, we follow the flux of particles between two such suspensions in diffusive contact, starting from a uniform density and relaxing to a state with zero net particle flux. The density remains uniform for systems with different frequencies but equal effective temperatures. At high driving frequencies, we show that the density distribution at steady state is determined by equating the ratio of the chemical potential to the effective temperature in both systems, mirroring thermal equilibrium behavior.</description>

      <title>The Hydrophobic Interaction Induced Strengthening of Hydrogen Bond in Water-DMSO Binary Mixture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13001v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The lifetime of a hydrogen bond between water and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) is found to be considerably longer than that between two water molecules in the neat water. This is counter-intuitive because the charge on the oxygen in DMSO is considerably less than that in water. Additionally, the strength of the water-dimethyl sulfoxide (w-D) hydrogen bond is found to be strongly composition dependent; the lifetime of the hydrogen bond is ten times larger at 30% over that at very low concentration. Using computer simulations, we perform microscopic structural and dynamic analysis to find that these anomalies arise at least partly from an action-at-a-distance effect where the attraction between the hydrophobic methyl groups results in self-aggregation of DMSO molecules that cages both rotational and linear motions of molecules involved. This is reflected in the observed strong correlation of the lifetime with the local coordination number of the associated methyl groups. The elongated w-D h-bond lifetime causes a slowdown of collective dynamics and affects the lifetime of the w-w h-bond. This nonlinear feedback mechanism explains the strong composition dependence of viscosity and anticipated to play a dominant role in many self-assemblies. Furthermore, the w-D hydrogen bond breaking mechanism changes from low to high DMSO concentration, a phenomenon not anticipated a priori. We introduce a new order parameter-based free energy surface of the bond breaking pathway. A two-dimensional transition state rate theory (TSRT) calculation is performed for the lifetime of the w-D h-bond that is found to be semi-quantitatively accurate</description>

      <title>Ionic conductivity of a lithium-doped deep eutectic solvent: Glass formation and rotation-translation coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.12186v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deep eutectic solvents with admixed lithium salts are considered as electrolytes in electrochemical devices like batteries or supercapacitors. Compared to eutectic mixtures of hydrogen-bond donors and lithium salts, their raw-material costs are significantly lower. Not much is known about the glassy freezing and rotation-translation coupling of such systems. Here we investigate these phenomena by applying dielectric spectroscopy to the widely studied deep eutectic solvent glyceline, to which 1 and 5 mol% LiCl were added. Our studies cover a wide temperature range, including the deeply supercooled state. The temperature dependences of the detected dipolar reorientation dynamics and of the ionic dc conductivity reveal the signatures of glassy freezing. In comparison to pure glyceline, lithium admixture leads to a reduction of ionic conductivity, which is accompanied by a slowing down of the rotational dipolar motions. However, this reduction is much smaller than for DESs, where one main component is a lithium salt, which we trace back to the smaller glass-transition temperatures of the lithium-doped DESs. In contrast to pure glyceline, the ionic and dipolar dynamics become increasingly decoupled at low temperatures and obey a fractional Debye-Stokes-Einstein relation as previously found in other glass-forming liquids. The obtained results demonstrate the relevance of decoupling effects and of the glass transition for the enhancement of the technically relevant ionic conductivity in such lithium-doped DESs.</description>

      <title>Ion Correlation Induced Non-monotonic Height Change and Microphase Separation of Polyelectrolyte Brushes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09103v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modeling ion correlations in inhomogeneous polymers and soft matters with spatially varying ionic strength or dielectric permittivity remains a great challenge. Here, we develop a new theory which systematically incorporates electrostatic fluctuations into the self-consistent field theory for polymers. Applied to polyelectrolyte brushes, the theory predicts that ion correlations induce non-monotonic change of the brush height: collapse followed by reexpansion. The scaling analysis elucidates the competition between the repulsive osmotic pressure due to translational entropy and the attraction induced by ion correlations. We also clarify the absence of causal relationship between the brush collapse-reexpansion and the inversion of the surface electrostatic potential. Furthermore, strong ion correlations can trigger microphase separation, either in the lateral direction as pinned micelles or in the normal direction as oscillatory layers. Our theoretical predictions are in good agreement with the experimental results reported in the literature.</description>
