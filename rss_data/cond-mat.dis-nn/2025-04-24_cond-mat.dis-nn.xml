      <title>2D Anderson Localization and KPZ sub-Universality Classes : sensitivity to boundary conditions and insensitivity to symmetry classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We challenge two foundational principles of localization physics by analyzing conductance fluctuations in two dimensions with unprecedented precision: (i) the Thouless criterion, which defines localization as insensitivity to boundary conditions, and (ii) that symmetry determines the universality class of Anderson localization. We reveal that the fluctuations of the conductance logarithm fall into distinct sub-universality classes inherited from Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) physics, dictated by the lead configurations of the scattering system and unaffected by the presence of a magnetic field. Distinguishing between these probability distributions poses a significant challenge due to their striking similarity, requiring sampling beyond the usual threshold of $\sim 10^{-6}$ accessible through independent disorder realizations. To overcome this, we implement an importance sampling scheme - a Monte Carlo approach in disorder space - that enables us to probe rare disorder configurations and sample probability distribution tails down to $10^{-30}$. This unprecedented precision allows us to unambiguously differentiate between KPZ sub-universality classes of conductance fluctuations for different lead configurations, while demonstrating the insensitivity to magnetic fields.</description>

      <title>Emergent fractals in dirty topological crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17786v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-trivial geometry of electronic Bloch states gives birth to topological insulators that are robust against sufficiently weak randomness, inevitably present in any quantum material. However, increasing disorder triggers a quantum phase transition into a featureless normal insulator. As the underlying quantum critical point is approached from the topological side, small scattered droplets of normal insulators start to develop in the system and their coherent nucleation causes ultimate condensation of a trivial insulation. Unless disorder is too strong, the normal insulator accommodates disjoint tiny topological puddles. Furthermore, in the close vicinity of such a transition the emergent islands of topological and trivial insulators display spatial fractal structures, a feature that is revealed only by local topological markers. Here we showcase this (possibly) generic phenomenon that should be apposite to dirty topological crystals of any symmetry class in any dimension from the Bott index and local Chern marker for a square lattice-based disordered Chern insulator model.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Shock Recovery in IO Networks with Priority Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17120v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Physical risks, such as droughts, floods, rising temperatures, earthquakes, infrastructure failures, and geopolitical conflicts, can ripple through global supply chains, raising costs, and constraining production across industries. Assessing these risks requires understanding not only their immediate effects, but also their cascading impacts. For example, a localized drought can disrupt the supply of critical raw materials such as cobalt or copper, affecting battery and electric vehicle production. Similarly, regional conflicts can impede cross-border trade, leading to broader economic consequences. Building on an existing model of simultaneous supply and demand shocks, we introduce a new propagation algorithm, Priority with Constraint, which modifies standard priority-based rationing by incorporating a minimum supply guarantee for all customers, regardless of their size or priority ranking. We also identify a buffer effect inherent in the Industry Proportional algorithm, which reflects real-world economic resilience. Finally, we extend the static shock propagation model to incorporate dynamic processes. We introduce mechanisms for gradual shock propagation, reflecting demand stickiness and the potential buffering role of inventories, and gradual recovery, modeling the simultaneous recovery of supply capacity and the inherent tendency for demand to return to pre-shock levels. Simulations demonstrate how the interplay between demand adjustment speed and supply recovery speed significantly influences the severity and duration of the economic impact after a shock.</description>

      <title>Fragmentation, Zero Modes, and Collective Bound States in Constrained Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17627v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Kinetically constrained models were originally introduced to capture slow relaxation in glassy systems, where dynamics are hindered by local constraints instead of energy barriers. Their quantum counterparts have recently drawn attention for exhibiting highly degenerate eigenstates at zero energy -- known as zero modes -- stemming from chiral symmetry. Yet, the structure and implications of these zero modes remain poorly understood. In this work, we focus on the properties of the zero mode subspace in quantum kinetically constrained models with a $U(1)$ particle-conservation symmetry. We use the $U(1)$ East, which lacks inversion symmetry, and the inversion-symmetric $U(1)$ East-West models to illustrate our two main results. First, we observe that the simultaneous presence of constraints and chiral symmetry generally leads to a parametric increase in the number of zero modes due to the fragmentation of the many-body Hilbert space into disconnected sectors. Second, we generalize the concept of compact localized states from single particle physics and introduce the notion of collective bound states. We formulate sufficient criteria for their existence, arguing that the degenerate zero mode subspace plays a central role, and demonstrate bound states in both example models. Our results motivate a systematic study of bound states and their relation to ergodicity breaking, transport, and other properties of quantum kinetically constrained models.</description>

      <title>Programmable glassy dynamics using tunable disorder in tweezer arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17659v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a unifying framework for non-equilibrium relaxation dynamics in ensembles of positionally disordered interacting quantum spins based on the statistical properties, such as mean and variance, of the underlying disorder distribution. Our framework is validated through extensive exact numerical calculations and we use it to disentangle and understand the importance of dimensionality and interaction range for the observation of glassy (i.e., sub-exponential) decay dynamics. Leveraging the deterministic control of qubit positioning enabled by modern tweezer array architectures, we also introduce a method (``J-mapping'') that can be used to emulate the relaxation dynamics of a disordered system with arbitrary dimensionality and interaction range in bespoke one-dimensional arrays. Our approach paves the way towards tunable relaxation dynamics that can be explored in quantum simulators based on arrays of neutral atoms and molecules.</description>

      <title>Universal properties of Wigner delay times and resonance widths of tight-binding random graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13511v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The delay experienced by a probe due to interactions with a scattering media is highly related to the internal dynamics inside that media. This property is well captured by the Wigner delay time and the resonance widths. By the use of the equivalence between the adjacency matrix of a random graph and the tight-binding Hamiltonian of the corresponding electronic media, the scattering matrix approach to electronic transport is used to compute Wigner delay times and resonance widths of Erd\"os-R\'enyi graphs and random geometric graphs, including bipartite random geometric graphs. In particular, the situation when a single-channel lead attached to the graphs is considered. Our results show a smooth crossover towards universality as the graphs become complete. We also introduce a parameter $\xi$, depending on the graph average degree $\langle k \rangle$ and graph size $N$, that scales the distributions of both Wigner delay times and resonance widths; highlighting the universal character of both distributions. Specifically, $\xi = \langle k \rangle N^{-\alpha}$ where $\alpha$ is graph-model dependent.</description>

      <title>Robust Hilbert space fragmentation in group-valued loop models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19386v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a large class of models exhibiting robust ergodicity breaking in quantum dynamics. Our work is inspired by recent discussions of "topologically robust Hilbert space fragmentation," but massively generalizes in two directions: firstly from states describable as "loop-soups" to a broader class of states reminiscent of string-nets and sponges, and secondly from models restricted to square or cubic lattices, to models defined on arbitrary lattices (and even arbitrary graphs without translation invariance). Our constructions leverage a recently proposed group-theory framework [PRX 14, 021034 (2024)], and identify a host of new phenomena arising from the interplay of "group-model dynamics" and lattice structure. We make crisp connections to gauge theories, and our construction generalizes Kitaev's quantum double to infinite groups.</description>

      <title>Quantum linear algebra for disordered electrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00434v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We describe how to use quantum linear algebra to simulate a physically realistic model of disordered non-interacting electrons. The physics of disordered electrons outside of one dimension challenges classical computation due to the critical nature of the Anderson localization transition or the presence of large localization lengths, while the atypical distribution of the local density of states limits the power of disorder averaged approaches. Starting from the block-encoding of a disordered non-interacting Hamiltonian, we describe how to simulate key physical quantities, including the reduced density matrix, Green's function, and local density of states, as well as bulk-averaged observables such as the linear conductivity, using the quantum singular value transformation, quantum amplitude estimation, and trace estimation. We further discuss a quantum advantage that scales polynomially with system size and exponentially with lattice dimension.</description>
