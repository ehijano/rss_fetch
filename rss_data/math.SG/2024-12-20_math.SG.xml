      <title>Equivariant cohomological rigidity for four-dimensional Hamiltonian $\mathbf{S^1}$-manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14310v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For manifolds equipped with group actions, we have the following natural question: To what extent does the equivariant cohomology determine the equivariant diffeotype? We resolve this question for Hamiltonian circle actions on compact, connected symplectic four-manifolds. They are equivariantly diffeomorphic if and only if their equivariant cohomology rings are isomorphic as algebras over the equivariant cohomology of a point. In fact, we prove a stronger claim: each isomorphism between their equivariant cohomology rings is induced by an equivariant diffeomorphism.</description>

      <title>On the geometry of Lagrangian one-forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14700v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lagrangian multiform theory is a variational framework for integrable systems. In this article we introduce a new formulation which is based on symplectic geometry and which treats position, momentum and time coordinates of a finite-dimensional integrable hierarchy on an equal footing. This formulation allows a streamlined one-step derivation of both the multi-time Euler-Lagrange equations and the closure relation (encoding integrability). We argue that any Lagrangian one-form for a finite-dimensional system can be recast in our new framework. We also show that our new framework easily extends to non-commuting flows corresponding to nonabelian Lie groups. Thus Hamiltonian Lie group actions can be derived from a variational principle.</description>

      <title>A universal characterization of uncurving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14851v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a category of non-symmetric operads with distinguished curvature term, and determine the right adjoint to the functor forgetting the distinction. As a result we give a universal characterization of the procedure of "twisting by a Maurer-Cartan element", and also of the curved A-infinity operad itself.</description>

      <title>Linking disks, spinning vortices and exponential networks of augmentation curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14901v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a mirror derivation of the quiver description of open topological strings known as the knots-quivers correspondence, based on enumerative invariants of augmentation curves encoded by exponential networks. Quivers are obtained by studying M2 branes wrapping holomorphic disks with Lagrangian boundary conditions on an M5 brane, through their identification with a distinguished sector of BPS kinky vortices in the 3d-3d dual QFT. Our proposal suggests that holomorphic disks with Lagrangian boundary conditions are mirror to calibrated 1-chains on the associated augmentation curve, whose intersections encode the linking of boundaries.</description>

      <title>Equivariant Lagrangian correspondence and a conjecture of Teleman</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.13926v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the Floer theory of equivariant Lagrangian correspondences and apply it to deduce a conjecture of Teleman, which finds the relation between the disc potential of an invariant Lagrangian submanifold and that of its quotient. A main step is to extend Fukaya's construction of an $A_\infty$ tri-module for Lagrangian correspondences to Borel spaces. We find that the equivariant obstruction of a Lagrangian correspondence plays an essential role, which leads to quantum corrections in the disc potentials of quotients. We solve the obstruction in the toric setup and find the relation with mirror maps for compact semi-Fano toric manifolds.</description>

      <title>Current Algebras from DG Symplectic Pairs in Supergeometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1308.0100</link>
      <description>arXiv:1308.0100v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a new unified formulation of the current algebra theory in terms of supergeometry. We take a QP-structure, i.e. a differential graded symplectic structure, on a graded cotangent bundle as a fundamental framework. A Poisson bracket in a current algebra is constructed by the so called derived bracket of the graded Poisson structure induced from the above symplectic structure. By taking a canonical transformation on a QP-manifold, correct anomalous terms in physical theories are derived. A large class of current algebras with and without anomalous terms are constructed from this structure. Moreover, a new class of current algebras related higher structures are obtained systematically.</description>

      <title>Mirror Construction for Nakajima Quiver Varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16172v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we construct the ADHM quiver representations and the corresponding sheaves as the mirror objects of formal deformations of the framed immersed Lagrangian sphere decorated with flat bundles. More generally, we construct Nakajima quiver varieties as localized mirrors of framed nodal unions of Lagrangian spheres in dimension two. This produces a mirror functor from the Fukaya category of a framed plumbing of surfaces to the dg category of complexes of bundles over the corresponding Nakajima quiver varieties.
  For affine ADE quivers in specific multiplicities, the corresponding (unframed) Lagrangian immersions are homological tori, whose moduli of stable deformations are asymptotically locally Euclidean (ALE) spaces. We show that framed stable Lagrangian branes are transformed into monadic complexes of framed torsion-free sheaves over the ALE spaces.
  A main ingredient is the notion of framed Lagrangian immersions and their Maurer-Cartan deformations. Moreover, using the formalism of quiver algebroid stacks, we find isomorphisms between the moduli of stable Lagrangian immersions and that of special Lagrangian fibers of an SYZ fibration in the affine $A_n$ cases.</description>
