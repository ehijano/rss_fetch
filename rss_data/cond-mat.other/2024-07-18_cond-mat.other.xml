      <title>Influence of different mutual friction models on two-way coupled quantized vortices and normal fluid in superfluid $^4$He</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the influence of two mutual friction models on quantized vortices and normal fluid using two-way coupled simulations of superfluid $^4$He. The normal fluid is affected by quantized vortices via mutual friction. A previous study [Y. Tang, et al. Nat. Commun. 14, 2941 (2023)] compared the time evolutions of the vortex ring radius and determined that the self-consistent two-way coupled mutual friction (S2W) model yielded better agreement with the experimental results than the two-way coupled mutual friction (2W) model whose model parameters were determined through experiments with rotating superfluid helium. In this study, we compare the two models in more detail in terms of the quantized vortex ring propagation, reconnection, and thermal counterflow. We found that the S2W model exhibits better results than the 2W model on the microscopic scale near a quantized vortex, such as during quantized vortex ring propagation and reconnection, although the S2W model requires a higher spatial resolution. For complex flows such as a thermal counterflow, the 2W model can be applied even to a low-resolution flow while maintaining the anisotropic normal fluid velocity fluctuations. In contrast, the 2W model predicts lower normal fluid velocity fluctuations than the S2W model. The two models show probability density functions with $- 3$ power-law tails for the normal fluid velocity fluctuations.</description>

      <title>3He adsorbed on molecular hydrogen surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using a diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC) technique, we calculated the phase diagram of 3He adsorbed on a first solid layer of a molecular hydrogen isotope (H2,HD and D2) on top of graphite. The results are qualitatively similar in all cases: a two-dimensional gas spanning from the infinite dilution limit to a second-layer helium density of 0.048 +/- 0.004 Ang^{-2}. That gas is in equilibrium with a 7/12 commensurate structure, more stable than any incommensurate triangular solid of similar density. These findings are in reasonably good agreement with available experimental data.</description>

      <title>A primary quantum current standard based on the Josephson and the quantum Hall effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12562v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The new definition of the ampere calls for a quantum current standard able to deliver a flow of elementary charges per second controlled with a relative uncertainty of one part in $10^8$. Despite many efforts, nanodevices handling electrons one by one have never been able to demonstrate such an accuracy. The alternative route based on applying Ohm's law to the Josephson voltage and quantum Hall standards recently reached the target uncertainty but this was at the expense of the application of error corrections, hampering simplicity and further improvement. As a result, national metrology institutes still lack an operational quantum current standard. Here, we present a new quantum current generator, combining both quantum standards and a superconducting cryogenic amplifier, free of error correction, which provides quantized currents driven by the Josephson microwave signal. We show that it can realize the ampere definition with the target uncertainty over a range extended from mA down to $\mu$A and improve end-user current measurements, which are up to now a hundred times less accurate. Other prospects include measuring large resistances using the new current standard in conjunction with a quantum voltmeter and, by exploiting its low-noise performances, bridging the gap with the lower currents of other quantum current sources.</description>

      <title>Discrete $Z_4$ symmetry in quantum gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00718v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the discrete $Z_4$ symmetry ${\hat {\bf i}}$, which takes place in the scenario of quantum gravity where the gravitational tetrads emerge as the order parameter. Under this symmetry operation $\hat {\bf i}$, the emerging tetrads are multiplied by the imaginary unit, $\hat {\bf i}\,e^a_\mu = - i e^a_\mu$. The existence of such symmetry and the spontaneous breaking of this symmetry are also supported by the consideration of the symmetry breaking scheme in the topological superfluid $^3$He-B. The order parameter $^3$He-B is the analogue of the tetrad field, but it has complex values. The $\hat {\bf i}$-symmetry operation changes the phase of the complex order parameter by $\pi/2$, which corresponds to the $Z_4$ discrete symmetry in quantum gravity. We also considered the alternative scenario of the breaking of this $Z_4$ symmetry, in which the $\hat {\bf i}$-operation changes sign of the scalar curvature, $\hat {\bf i} \,{\cal R} = - {\cal R}$, and thus the Einstein-Hilbert action violates the $\hat {\bf i}$-symmetry. In the alternative scenario of symmetry breaking, the gravitational coupling $K=1/16\pi G$ plays the role of the order parameter, which changes sign under $\hat {\bf i}$-transformation.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic cold plasma modes in chiral vector Maxwell-Carroll-Field-Jackiw electrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.13196v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we study the propagation and absorption of plasma waves in the context of the Maxwell-Carroll-Field-Jackiw (MCFJ) electrodynamics with a purely spacelike background playing the role of the anomalous Hall conductivity, concerning the anomalous Hall current. Such a current is also found in an axion field which increases linearly with a space coordinate. The Maxwell equations are rewritten for a cold, uniform, and collisionless fluid plasma model, allowing us to determine the new refractive indices and propagating modes. The analysis begins for propagation along the magnetic axis, examined in the cases of chiral vectors parallel and orthogonal to the magnetic field. Two distinct refractive indices (associated with right-handed circularly polarized [RCP] and left-handed circularly polarized [LCP] waves) are obtained and the associated propagation and absorption zones are determined. The low-frequency regime is discussed and we obtain RCP and LCP helicons. We scrutinize optical effects, such as birefringence and dichroism, and observe rotatory power sign reversion, a property of chiral MCFJ plasmas. We also examine the case of transversal propagation in the direction orthogonal to the magnetic field, providing much more involved results.</description>

      <title>Integrated workflows and interfaces for data-driven semi-empirical electronic structure calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15625v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modern software engineering of electronic structure codes has seen a paradigm shift from monolithic workflows towards object-based modularity. Software objectivity allows for greater flexibility in the application of electronic structure calculations, with particular benefits when integrated with approaches for data-driven analysis. Here, we discuss different approaches to create "deep" modular interfaces that connect big-data workflows and electronic structure codes, and explore the diversity of use cases that they can enable. We present two such interface approaches for the semi-empirical electronic structure package, DFTB+. In one case, DFTB+ is applied as a library and provides data to an external workflow; and in another, DFTB+ receives data via external bindings and processes the information subsequently within an internal workflow. We provide a general framework to enable data exchange workflows for embedding new machine-learning-based Hamiltonians within DFTB+, or to enabling deep integration of DFTB+ in multiscale embedding workflows. These modular interfaces demonstrate opportunities in emergent software and workflows to accelerate scientific discovery by harnessing existing software capabilities.</description>
