      <title>Inferring Option Movements Through Residual Transactions: A Quantitative Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This research presents a novel approach to predicting option movements by analyzing residual transactions, which are trades that deviate from standard hedging activities. Unlike traditional methods that primarily focus on open interest and trading volume, this study argues that residuals can reveal nuanced insights into institutional sentiment and strategic positioning. By examining these deviations, the model identifies early indicators of market trends, providing a refined framework for forecasting option prices. The proposed model integrates classical machine learning and regression techniques to analyze patterns in high frequency trading data, capturing complex, non linear relationships. This predictive framework allows traders to anticipate shifts in option values, enhancing strategies for better market timing, risk management, and portfolio optimization. The model's adaptability, driven by real time data processing, makes it particularly effective in fast paced trading environments, where early detection of institutional behavior is crucial for gaining a competitive edge. Overall, this research contributes to the field of options trading by offering a strategic tool that detects early market signals, optimizing trading decisions based on predictive insights derived from residual trading patterns. This approach bridges the gap between conventional metrics and the subtle behaviors of institutional players, marking a significant advancement in options market analysis.</description>

      <title>Is the difference between deep hedging and delta hedging a statistical arbitrage?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14736v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The recent work of Horikawa and Nakagawa (2024) claims that under a complete market admitting statistical arbitrage, the difference between the hedging position provided by deep hedging and that of the replicating portfolio is a statistical arbitrage. This raises concerns as it entails that deep hedging can include a speculative component aimed simply at exploiting the structure of the risk measure guiding the hedging optimisation problem. We test whether such finding remains true in a GARCH-based market model, which is an illustrative case departing from complete market dynamics. We observe that the difference between deep hedging and delta hedging is a speculative overlay if the risk measure considered does not put sufficient relative weight on adverse outcomes. Nevertheless, a suitable choice of risk measure can prevent the deep hedging agent from engaging in speculation.</description>

      <title>UCFE: A User-Centric Financial Expertise Benchmark for Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14059v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces the UCFE: User-Centric Financial Expertise benchmark, an innovative framework designed to evaluate the ability of large language models (LLMs) to handle complex real-world financial tasks. UCFE benchmark adopts a hybrid approach that combines human expert evaluations with dynamic, task-specific interactions to simulate the complexities of evolving financial scenarios. Firstly, we conducted a user study involving 804 participants, collecting their feedback on financial tasks. Secondly, based on this feedback, we created our dataset that encompasses a wide range of user intents and interactions. This dataset serves as the foundation for benchmarking 12 LLM services using the LLM-as-Judge methodology. Our results show a significant alignment between benchmark scores and human preferences, with a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.78, confirming the effectiveness of the UCFE dataset and our evaluation approach. UCFE benchmark not only reveals the potential of LLMs in the financial sector but also provides a robust framework for assessing their performance and user satisfaction. The benchmark dataset and evaluation code are available.</description>
