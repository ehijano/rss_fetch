      <title>Funicular preorders can be prelinearized without nonprincipal ultrafilters over $\mathbb N$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13819v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is a consequence of the axiom of choice that every preorder can be extended to a total preorder while respecting the strict preorder relation. We call such an extension a prelinearization of the preorder and study the extent to which the axiom of choice is needed to construct prelinearizations. We isolate the class of funicular preorders, and show that these have prelinearizations in models of $\mathsf{ZF+DC}$ containing no nonprincipal ultrafilters over $\omega$. Funicular preorders include coordinatewise domination on $\mathbb{R}^\omega$, Turing reducibility, and various preorders arising in social choice theory. The relevant models are constructed first using tools from the geometric set theory of Larson and Zapletal, which requires an inaccessible cardinal, and then the inaccessible cardinal is eliminated using methods of amalgamation for Cohen reals.</description>

      <title>First-Order Implication-Space Semantics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13908v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper extends implication-space semantics to include first-order quantification. Implication-space semantics has recently been introduced as an inferentialist formal semantics that can capture nonmonotonic and nontransitive material inferences. Extant versions, however, include only propositional logic. This paper extends the framework so as to recover classical first-order logic. The goal is to formulate a theory in which consequence relations can be nonmonotonic and supraclassical, while obeying the deduction-detachment theorem and disjunction simplification, while also including conjunctions that behave multiplicatively as premises and counterexamples to the usual quantifier rules. The paper explains these constraints and shows how they can be met jointly. The result is a first-order version of implication-space semantics that has all the virtues for which inferentialists and inferential expressivists praise propositional implication-space semantics.</description>

      <title>An equiconsistency proof for $\mathrm{CZF} + V = L$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13917v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In many axiomatic set theories, G\"odel's constructible universe $L$ is known as an inner model, that is, a definable class satisfying the same axioms (and containing the same ordinals). This gives a trivial proof that adding the axiom $V = L$ does not increase the consistency strength of the theory. In this paper, we shall look at a system of intuitionistic set theory known as $\mathrm{CZF}$, where $L$ fails to exhibit such nice properties. We will demonstrate that, here, the theory $\mathrm{CZF} + V = L$ is still equiconsistent with $\mathrm{CZF}$, but the proof will involve a much more complicated realisability model and a recursion-theoretic argument.</description>

      <title>Universality of Infinite Chess</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that chess played on the infinite chessboard $\mathbb{Z}^2$ with infinitely many pieces is as powerful as it could possibly be, by showing that every open Gale-Stewart game with draws is strategically equivalent to some infinite chess position and vice versa. As our construction is computable and open Gale-Stewart games are well understood, this allows us to resolve many open questions about the complexity of infinite chess with infinitely many pieces. In particular, all countable ordinals arise as the game value of some such chess position. We also give an alternate construction that realizes all countable ordinals as game values, with the pleasing property that it consists only of the king pair and pawns.</description>

      <title>Square-bracket operations clubs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper continues the investigation of the three square-bracket operations $[\cdot\cdot]$ from chapter 5 of \cite{Walks}. \ We say that a square-bracket operation $[\cdot\cdot]$ has the \emph{Ramsey club property} if for every club $C\subseteq\omega_{1}$, there is an uncountable subset $W$ $\subseteq \omega_{1}$ such that $\left[ \alpha\beta\right] \in C$ for every $\alpha,\beta\in W.$ \ The second author proved that the Proper Forcing Axiom\textsf{ }implies that all the square-bracket operations induced by Aronszajn trees have this property. We extend this result to the other two classes. We conclude that each of the statements \textquotedblleft all square-bracket operations have the Ramsey club property\textquotedblright\ and \textquotedblleft No square-bracket operation has the Ramsey club property\textquotedblright\ are consistent with \textsf{ZFC. }In other words, \textsf{ZFC }is unable to decide the status of the Ramsey club property for any square-bracket operation. Furthermore, we analyze the status of the Ramsey club property for square-bracket operations under Martin's Axiom and the Continuum Hypothesis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.14243v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Constraint satisfaction problems are computational problems that naturally appear in many areas of theoretical computer science. One of the central themes is their computational complexity, and in particular the border between polynomial-time tractability and NP-hardness. In this course we introduce the universal-algebraic approach to study the computational complexity of finite-domain CSPs. The course covers in particular the cyclic terms and bounded width theorems. To keep the presentation accessible, we start the course in the tangible setting of directed graphs and graph homomorphism problems.</description>

      <title>$2$-dimensional Lawvere theories: commutativity and lax phenomena</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14332v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to study categorified algebraic structures and their pseudo- and lax homomorphisms using the framework of Lawvere $2$-theories, and more generally, (enhanced) $2$-dimensional sketches. The key notion we focus on is that of $2$-dimensional commutativity. As one of the main results, we prove that if a Lawvere $2$-theory $\mathbb{T}$ is equipped with such a structure, then the $2$-category $\mathsf{Mod}_l(\mathbb{T},\mathbf{Cat})$ of $\mathbb{T}$-models, lax homomorphisms, and modifications admits a natural structure of a closed $2$-multicategory. From this, we deduce a generalization of Fox's theorem. We also discuss the analogue in the higher setting for Lawvere $(\infty,2)$-theories. As a result of independent interest, we construct a multicategory (or $\infty$-operad) structure on the hom-category $\mathsf{Hom}_{\mathbb{V}}(\mathcal{M},\mathcal{N})$, where $\mathbb{V}$ is a monoidal $(\infty,2)$-category and $\mathcal{M},\mathcal{N}$ are monoids therein.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2004.00174v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider an old question of Slaman and Steel: whether Turing equivalence is an increasing union of Borel equivalence relations none of which contain a uniformly computable infinite sequence. We show this question is deeply connected to problems surrounding Martin's conjecture, and also in countable Borel equivalence relations. In particular, if Slaman and Steel's question has a positive answer, it implies there is a universal countable Borel equivalence which is not uniformly universal, and that there is a $(\equiv_T,\equiv_m)$-invariant function which is not uniformly invariant on any pointed perfect set.</description>

      <title>Beautiful pairs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.00651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2112.00651v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce an abstract framework to study certain classes of stably embedded pairs of models of a complete $\mathcal{L}$-theory $T$, called \textit{beautiful pairs}, which comprises Poizat's belles paires of stable structures and van den Dries-Lewenberg's tame pairs of o-minimal structures. Using an amalgamation construction, we relate several properties of beautiful pairs with properties analogous to properties in Fra\"{i}ss\'e classes.
  After characterizing beautiful pairs of various theories of ordered abelian groups and valued fields, including the theories of algebraically closed, $p$-adically closed and real closed valued fields, we show an Ax-Kochen-Ershov type result for beautiful pairs of henselian valued fields. As an application, we derive strict pro-definability of particular classes of definable types. When $T$ is one of the theories of valued fields mentioned above, the corresponding classes of types are related to classical geometric spaces and our main result specializes to their strict pro-definability. Most notably, we exhibit the strict pro-definability of a natural space of types associated to Huber's analytification. In this way, we also recover a result of Hrushovski-Loeser on the strict pro-definability of stably dominated types in algebraically closed valued fields, which corresponds to Berkovich's analytification.</description>

      <title>Categorical structure in coherent theory of arithmetic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.05477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.05477v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we provide a semantic and syntactic analysis of parametrised natural numbers object in coherent categories, or pr-coherent categories. Semantically, we show the definable functions in the initial pr-coherent category are exactly given by primitive recursive functions. We also show that any pr-coherent category supports the construction of bounded universal quantifications, which are absent in an arbitrary coherent category. Under these semantic consideration, we construct a coherent theory of arithmetic and we show its syntactic category is equivalent to the initial pr-coherent category. From a logical perspective, we also show that this theory can be identified as the {\Sigma}1-fragment of I{\Sigma}1. Thus as an application, we provide a structural proof of the classical result in proof theory that the strongly {\Sigma}1-representable functions in I{\Sigma}1 are exactly primitive recursive functions.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the logical strength of the cohesiveness principle when restricted to finite sequences of sets, denoted by fin-COH, over different base theories. Our main result shows that fin-COH entails $I\Sigma_1^0$ over the weaker base theory $RCA_0^*$, thereby answering a question posed by Fiori-Carones, Ko{\l}odziejczyk and Kowalik. In addition, we show that fin-COH is not provable over $WKL_0$.</description>

      <title>Uniform validity of atomic Split rule in monotonic proof-theoretic semantics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19930v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Proof-theoretic semantics (PTS) is normally understood today as Base-Extension Semantics (B-eS), i.e., as a theory of proof-theoretic consequence over atomic proof systems. Intuitionistic logic (IL) has been proved to be incomplete over a number of variants of B-eS, including a monotonic one where introduction rules play a prior role (miB-eS). In its original formulation by Prawitz, however, PTS consequence is not a primitive, but a derived notion. The main concept is that of argument structure valid relative to atomic systems and assignments of reductions for eliminating generalised detours of inferences in non-introduction form. This is called Proof-Theoretic Validity (P-tV), and it can be given in a monotonic and introduction-based form too (miP-tV). It is unclear whether, and under what conditions, the incompleteness results proved for IL over miB-eS can be transferred to miP-tV. As has been remarked, the main problem seems to be that the notion of argumental validity underlying the miB-eS notion of consequence is one where reductions are either forced to be non-uniform, or non-constructive. Building on some Prawitz-fashion incompleteness proofs for IL based on the notion of (intuitionistic) construction, I provide in what follows a set of reductions which are surely uniform (however uniformity is defined) and constructive, and which make the atomic Split rule logically valid over miP-tV, thus implying the incompleteness of IL over a Prawitzian (monotonic, introduction-based) framework strictly understood.</description>

Abstract: The article offers a fresh perspective on Grzegorczyk logic Grz, introducing a simplified axiomatization and extending the analysis to its natural modal extensions, Grz.2 and Grz.3. I develop a control statement theory for these logics, utilizing concepts such as buttons, switches, and ratchets. Through this framework, I establish that Grz.2 is characterized by finite Boolean algebras.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.12736v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We generalize the diamond principle and its variants using the notion of stationarity in trees introduced by Brodsky in [Brodsky, A. M., A theory of stationary trees and the balanced Baumgartner--Hajnal--Todorcevic theorem for trees. The Bulletin of Symbolic Logic]. In particular, we show that if $T$ is a nonspecial $\omega_1$-tree, then $\diamondsuit_T \implies \diamondsuit$, and if $T$ is a Suslin tree, then $\diamondsuit_T \iff \diamondsuit$. We also prove that $\diamondsuit^*$ implies $\diamondsuit_T$ (yielding the consistency of $\diamondsuit_T$) and establish the consistency of $\neg\diamondsuit^* + (\forall T\text{ nonspecial }\omega_1\text{-tree }(\diamondsuit_T))$. Finally, we demonstrate that it is consistent with $\diamondsuit$ that there exists a nonspecial $\omega_1$-tree with $(\neg\diamondsuit_T)$, introducing two forcing properties -- $\sigma(S)$-closed and strategically closed in models -- which are preserved under countable support iterations.</description>
