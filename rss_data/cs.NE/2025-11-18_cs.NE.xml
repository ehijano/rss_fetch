      <title>Phase-Coded Memory and Morphological Resonance: A Next-Generation Retrieval-Augmented Generator Architecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11848v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a cognitive Retrieval-Augmented Generator (RAG) architecture that transcends transformer context-length limitations through phase-coded memory and morphological-semantic resonance. Instead of token embeddings, the system encodes meaning as complex wave patterns with amplitude-phase structure. A three-tier design is presented: a Morphological Mapper that transforms inputs into semantic waveforms, a Field Memory Layer that stores knowledge as distributed holographic traces and retrieves it via phase interference, and a Non-Contextual Generator that produces coherent output guided by resonance rather than fixed context. This approach eliminates sequential token dependence, greatly reduces memory and computational overhead, and enables unlimited effective context through frequency-based semantic access. The paper outlines theoretical foundations, pseudocode implementation, and experimental evidence from related complex-valued neural models, emphasizing substantial energy, storage, and time savings.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking that Matters: Rethinking Benchmarking for Practical Impact</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12264v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Benchmarking has driven scientific progress in Evolutionary Computation, yet current practices fall short of real-world needs. Widely used synthetic suites such as BBOB and CEC isolate algorithmic phenomena but poorly reflect the structure, constraints, and information limitations of continuous and mixed-integer optimization problems in practice. This disconnect leads to the misuse of benchmarking suites for competitions, automated algorithm selection, and industrial decision-making, despite these suites being designed for different purposes.
  We identify key gaps in current benchmarking practices and tooling, including limited availability of real-world-inspired problems, missing high-level features, and challenges in multi-objective and noisy settings. We propose a vision centered on curated real-world-inspired benchmarks, practitioner-accessible feature spaces and community-maintained performance databases. Real progress requires coordinated effort: A living benchmarking ecosystem that evolves with real-world insights and supports both scientific understanding and industrial use.</description>

      <title>Random-Key Metaheuristic and Linearization for the Quadratic Multiple Constraints Variable-Sized Bin Packing Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12367v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the Quadratic Multiple Constraints Variable-Sized Bin Packing Problem (QMC-VSBPP), a challenging combinatorial optimization problem that generalizes the classical bin packing by incorporating multiple capacity dimensions, heterogeneous bin types, and quadratic interaction costs between items. We propose two complementary methods that advance the current state-of-the-art. First, a linearized mathematical formulation is introduced to eliminate quadratic terms, enabling the use of exact solvers such as Gurobi to compute strong lower bounds - reported here for the first time for this problem. Second, we develop RKO-ACO, a continuous-domain Ant Colony Optimization algorithm within the Random-Key Optimization framework, enhanced with adaptive Q-learning parameter control and efficient local search. Extensive computational experiments on benchmark instances show that the proposed linearized model produces significantly tighter lower bounds than the original quadratic formulation, while RKO-ACO consistently matches or improves upon all best-known solutions in the literature, establishing new upper bounds for large-scale instances. These results provide new reference values for future studies and demonstrate the effectiveness of evolutionary and random-key metaheuristic approaches for solving complex quadratic packing problems.

      <title>Evolving Prompts for Toxicity Search in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12487v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models remain vulnerable to adversarial prompts that elicit toxic content even after safety alignment. We present ToxSearch, a black-box evolutionary framework that tests model safety by evolving prompts in a synchronous steady-state loop. The system employs a diverse set of operators, including lexical substitutions, negation, back-translation, paraphrasing, and two semantic crossover operators, while a moderation oracle provides fitness guidance. Operator-level analysis shows heterogeneous behavior: lexical substitutions offer the best yield-variance trade-off, semantic-similarity crossover acts as a precise low-throughput inserter, and global rewrites exhibit high variance with elevated refusal costs. Using elite prompts evolved on LLaMA 3.1 8B, we observe practically meaningful but attenuated cross-model transfer, with toxicity roughly halving on most targets, smaller LLaMA 3.2 variants showing the strongest resistance, and some cross-architecture models retaining higher toxicity. These results suggest that small, controllable perturbations are effective vehicles for systematic red-teaming and that defenses should anticipate cross-model reuse of adversarial prompts rather than focusing only on single-model hardening.</description>

      <title>On Counts and Densities of Homogeneous Bent Functions: An Evolutionary Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12652v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Boolean functions with strong cryptographic properties, such as high nonlinearity and algebraic degree, are important for the security of stream and block ciphers. These functions can be designed using algebraic constructions or metaheuristics. This paper examines the use of Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) to evolve homogeneous bent Boolean functions, that is, functions whose algebraic normal form contains only monomials of the same degree and that are maximally nonlinear. We introduce the notion of density of homogeneous bent functions, facilitating the algorithmic design that results in finding quadratic and cubic bent functions in different numbers of variables.</description>

      <title>DS-ATGO: Dual-Stage Synergistic Learning via Forward Adaptive Threshold and Backward Gradient Optimization for Spiking Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13050v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Brain-inspired spiking neural networks (SNNs) are recognized as a promising avenue for achieving efficient, low-energy neuromorphic computing. Direct training of SNNs typically relies on surrogate gradient (SG) learning to estimate derivatives of non-differentiable spiking activity. However, during training, the distribution of neuronal membrane potentials varies across timesteps and progressively deviates toward both sides of the firing threshold. When the firing threshold and SG remain fixed, this may lead to imbalanced spike firing and diminished gradient signals, preventing SNNs from performing well. To address these issues, we propose a novel dual-stage synergistic learning algorithm that achieves forward adaptive thresholding and backward dynamic SG. In forward propagation, we adaptively adjust thresholds based on the distribution of membrane potential dynamics (MPD) at each timestep, which enriches neuronal diversity and effectively balances firing rates across timesteps and layers. In backward propagation, drawing from the underlying association between MPD, threshold, and SG, we dynamically optimize SG to enhance gradient estimation through spatio-temporal alignment, effectively mitigating gradient information loss. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves significant performance improvements. Moreover, it allows neurons to fire stable proportions of spikes at each timestep and increases the proportion of neurons that obtain gradients in deeper layers.</description>

      <title>Tokenize Once, Recommend Anywhere: Unified Item Tokenization for Multi-domain LLM-based Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12922v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language model (LLM)-based recommender systems have achieved high-quality performance by bridging the discrepancy between the item space and the language space through item tokenization. However, existing item tokenization methods typically require training separate models for each item domain, limiting generalization. Moreover, the diverse distributions and semantics across item domains make it difficult to construct a unified tokenization that preserves domain-specific information. To address these challenges, we propose UniTok, a Unified item Tokenization framework that integrates our own mixture-of-experts (MoE) architecture with a series of codebooks to convert items into discrete tokens, enabling scalable tokenization while preserving semantic information across multiple item domains. Specifically, items from different domains are first projected into a unified latent space through a shared encoder. They are then routed to domain-specific experts to capture the unique semantics, while a shared expert, which is always active, encodes common knowledge transferable across domains. Additionally, to mitigate semantic imbalance across domains, we present a mutual information calibration mechanism, which guides the model towards retaining similar levels of semantic information for each domain. Comprehensive experiments on wide-ranging real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed UniTok framework is (a) highly effective: achieving up to 51.89% improvements over strong benchmarks, (b) theoretically sound: showing the analytical validity of our architectural design and optimization; and (c) highly generalizable: demonstrating robust performance across diverse domains without requiring per-domain retraining, a capability not supported by existing baselines.</description>

      <title>Self-Organization of Attractor Landscapes in High-Capacity Kernel Logistic Regression Hopfield Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13053v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Kernel-based learning methods can dramatically increase the storage capacity of Hopfield networks, yet the dynamical mechanism behind this enhancement remains poorly understood. We address this gap by conducting a geometric analysis of the network's energy landscape. We introduce a novel metric, ``Pinnacle Sharpness,'' to quantify the local stability of attractors. By systematically varying the kernel width and storage load, we uncover a rich phase diagram of attractor shapes. Our central finding is the emergence of a ``ridge of optimization,'' where the network maximizes attractor stability under challenging high-load and global-kernel conditions. Through a theoretical decomposition of the landscape gradient into a direct ``driving'' force and an indirect ``feedback'' force, we reveal the origin of this phenomenon. The optimization ridge corresponds to a regime of strong anti-correlation between the two forces, where the direct force, amplified by the high storage load, dominates the opposing collective feedback force. This demonstrates a sophisticated self-organization mechanism: the network adaptively harnesses inter-pattern interactions as a cooperative feedback control system to sculpt a robust energy landscape. Our findings provide a new physical picture for the stability of high-capacity associative memories and offer principles for their design.</description>

      <title>A Generalized and Configurable Benchmark Generator for Continuous Unconstrained Numerical Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.07083v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As optimization challenges continue to evolve, so too must our tools and understanding. To effectively assess, validate, and compare optimization algorithms, it is crucial to use a benchmark test suite that encompasses a diverse range of problem instances with various characteristics. Traditional benchmark suites often consist of numerous fixed test functions, making it challenging to align these with specific research objectives, such as the systematic evaluation of algorithms under controllable conditions. This paper introduces the Generalized Numerical Benchmark Generator (GNBG) for singleobjective, box-constrained, continuous numerical optimization. Unlike the commonly used test suites that rely on multiple baseline functions and transformations, GNBG utilizes a single, parametric, and configurable baseline function. This design allows for control over various problem characteristics. Researchers using GNBG can generate instances that cover a broad range of morphological features, from unimodal to highly multimodal functions, various local optima patterns, and symmetric to highly asymmetric structures. The generated problems can also vary in separability, variable interaction structures, dimensionality, conditioning, and basin shapes. These customizable features enable the systematic evaluation and comparison of optimization methods, allowing researchers to examine the strengths and weaknesses of algorithms under diverse and controllable conditions.</description>

      <title>State-Space Constraints Can Improve the Generalisation of the Differentiable Neural Computer to Input Sequences With Unseen Length</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.09138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2110.09138v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Memory-augmented neural networks (MANNs) can perform algorithmic tasks such as sorting. However, they often fail to generalise to input sequence lengths not encountered during training. We introduce two approaches that constrain the state space of the MANN's controller network: state compression and state regularisation. We empirically demonstrated that both approaches can improve generalisation to input sequences of out-of-distribution lengths for a specific type of MANN: the differentiable neural computer (DNC). The constrained DNC could process input sequences that were up to 2.3 times longer than those processed by an unconstrained baseline controller network. Notably, the applied constraints enabled the extension of the DNC's memory matrix without the need for retraining and thus allowed the processing of input sequences that were 10.4 times longer. However, the improvements were not consistent across all tested algorithmic tasks. Interestingly, solutions that performed better often had a highly structured state space, characterised by state trajectories exhibiting increased curvature and loop-like patterns. Our experimental work demonstrates that state-space constraints can enable the training of a DNC using shorter input sequences, thereby saving computational resources and facilitating training when acquiring long sequences is costly.</description>

      <title>Ken Utilization Layer: Hebbian Replay Within a Student's Ken for Adaptive Exercise Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00032v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Adaptive exercise recommendation (ER) aims to choose the next activity that matches a learner's evolving Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD). We present KUL-Rec, a biologically inspired ER system that couples a fast Hebbian memory with slow replay-based consolidation to enable continual, few-shot personalization from sparse interactions. The model operates in an embedding space, allowing a single architecture to handle both tabular knowledge-tracing logs and open-ended short-answer text. We align evaluation with tutoring needs using bidirectional ranking and rank-sensitive metrics (nDCG, Recall@K). Across ten public datasets, KUL-Rec improves macro nDCG (0.316 vs. 0.265 for the strongest baseline) and Recall@10 (0.305 vs. 0.211), while achieving low inference latency and an $\approx99$\% reduction in peak GPU memory relative to a competitive graph-based model. In a 13-week graduate course, KUL-Rec personalized weekly short-answer quizzes generated by a retrieval-augmented pipeline and the personalized quizzes were associated with lower perceived difficulty and higher helpfulness (p &lt; .05). An embedding robustness audit highlights that encoder choice affects semantic alignment, motivating routine audits when deploying open-response assessment. Together, these results indicate that Hebbian replay with bounded consolidation offers a practical path to real-time, interpretable ER that scales across data modalities and classroom settings.</description>

      <title>Amorphous Solid Model of Vectorial Hopfield Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22787v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a three-dimensional vectorial extension of the Hopfield associative-memory model in which each neuron is a unit vector on $S^2$ and synaptic couplings are $3\times 3$ blocks generated through a vectorial Hebbian rule. The resulting block-structured operator is mathematically analogous to the Hessian of amorphous solids and induces a rigid energy landscape with deep minima for stored patterns. Simulations and spectral analysis show that the vectorial network substantially outperforms the classical binary Hopfield model. For moderate connectivity, the critical storage ratio $\gamma_c$ grows approximately linearly with the coordination number $Z$, while for $Z\gtrsim 40$ a high-connectivity regime emerges in which $\gamma_c$ systematically exceeds the extrapolated low-$Z$ linear fit. At the same time, a persistent spectral gap separates pattern modes from the bulk and basins of attraction enlarge, yielding enhanced robustness to initialization noise. Thus geometric constraints combined with amorphous-solid-inspired structure produce associative memories with superior storage and retrieval performance, especially in the high-connectivity ($Z \gtrsim 20$-$30$) regime.</description>

      <title>Hyperellipsoid Density Sampling: Exploitative Sequences to Accelerate High-Dimensional Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07836v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The curse of dimensionality presents a pervasive challenge in optimization problems, with exponential expansion of the search space rapidly causing traditional algorithms to become inefficient or infeasible. An adaptive sampling strategy is presented to accelerate optimization in this domain as an alternative to uniform quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) methods.
  This method, referred to as Hyperellipsoid Density Sampling (HDS), generates its sequences by defining multiple hyperellipsoids throughout the search space. HDS uses three types of unsupervised learning algorithms to circumvent high-dimensional geometric calculations, producing an intelligent, non-uniform sample sequence that exploits statistically promising regions of the parameter space and improves final solution quality in high-dimensional optimization problems.
  A key feature of the method is optional Gaussian weights, which may be provided to influence the sample distribution towards known locations of interest. This capability makes HDS versatile for applications beyond optimization, providing a focused, denser sample distribution where models need to concentrate their efforts on specific, non-uniform regions of the parameter space.
  The method was evaluated against Sobol, a standard QMC method, using differential evolution (DE) on the 29 CEC2017 benchmark test functions. The results show statistically significant improvements in solution geometric mean error (p &lt; 0.05), with average performance gains ranging from 3% in 30D to 37% in 10D. This paper demonstrates the efficacy of HDS as a robust alternative to QMC sampling for high-dimensional optimization.</description>
