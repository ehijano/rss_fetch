      <title>FDTD with Auxiliary Bath Fields for Condensed-Phase Polaritonics: Fundamentals and Implementation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23963v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding condensed-phase polariton experiments requires accurately accounting for both realistic cavity geometries and the interplay between polaritons and material dark modes arising from microscopic molecular interactions. The finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) approach numerically propagates classical Maxwell's equations in the time domain, offering a versatile scheme for modeling polaritons in realistic cavities. However, the simple dielectric functions routinely used in FDTD often fail to describe molecular details. Consequently, standard FDTD calculations, to date, cannot accurately describe processes involving the complex coupling between polaritons and dark modes, such as polariton relaxation, transport, and condensation. For more faithful simulations of the energy flow between the polaritons and dark modes, herein, local bath degrees of freedom coupled to the material polarization are explicitly included in FDTD to describe the dark-mode dynamics. This method -- FDTD with auxiliary bath fields (FDTD-Bath) -- is implemented in the open-source MEEP package by adding a Lorentz-Bath material susceptibility, where explicit bath modes are coupled to conventional Lorentz oscillators. With this Lorentz-Bath susceptibility, linear polariton spectra and Rabi-splitting-dependent polariton relaxation rates in planar Fabry--P\'erot cavities are reproduced more accurately than those with the conventional Lorentz susceptibility. Supported by a user-friendly Python interface and efficient MPI parallelism, the FDTD-Bath approach implemented in MEEP is ready to model a wide range of polariton phenomena involving realistic cavity geometries.</description>

      <title>All-optical mapping of ultrafast carrier dynamics in a Dirac semimetal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-harmonic generation (HHG), the hallmark effect of attosecond science, is a nonperturbative nonlinear process leading to the emission of high harmonic light from gases and solids. In gases, extreme driving laser pulse intensities can deplete the ground state, suppressing harmonic emission during the trailing edge of the pulse. Here, we report pronounced ultrafast depletion dynamics during HHG in a gapless Dirac semimetal -- highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG). Remarkably, HOPG supports nonperturbative harmonic generation at laser intensities as low as $10^{10}$ W cm$^{-2}$, facilitated by its vanishing bandgap. Using two-color spectroscopy, we reveal the excitation dynamics of Dirac electron-hole pairs as it affects the emission of harmonics during the presence of the driving laser pulse. Notably, valence band depletion near the Dirac points leads to a marked suppression of interband harmonics and induces measurable temporal shifts. These observations are supported by simulations based on semiconductor Bloch equations. Our findings uncover a new regime of strong-field light-matter interaction in gapless solids and establish HHG as a sensitive, all-optical probe of ultrafast carrier dynamics, offering new opportunities for ultrafast optoelectronics in Dirac materials.</description>

      <title>Fourier ptychographic microscopy aided with transport of intensity equation for robust full phase spectrum reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24322v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fourier ptychographic microscopy (FPM) is a pivotal computational imaging technique that achieves phase and amplitude reconstruction with high resolution and wide field of view, using low numerical aperture objectives and LED array illumination. Despite its unique strengths, FPM remains fundamentally limited in retrieving low spatial frequency phase information due to the absence of phase encoding in all brightfield illumination angles. To overcome this, we present a novel hybrid approach that combines FPM with the transport of intensity equation (TIE), enabling accurate, full-spectrum phase retrieval without compromising system simplicity. Our method extends standard FPM acquisitions with a single additional on-axis defocused image, from which low-frequency phase components are reconstructed via TIE method, employing large defocus distance to suppress low-frequency artifacts and enhance robustness to intensity noise. To additionally compensate for defocus-induced magnification variations caused by spherical wavefront illumination, we employ an affine transform-based correction scheme upon image registration. Notably, by restoring the missing low-frequency content, our hybrid method appears capable of recovering phase values beyond the conventional 0-2{\pi} range - an area where conventional FPM techniques often struggle when dealing with optically thick samples. We validated our method using a quantitative phase test target for benchmarking accuracy and biological cheek cells, mouse neurons, and mouse brain tissue slice samples to demonstrate applicability for in vitro bioimaging. Experimental results confirm substantial improvements in phase reconstruction fidelity across spatial frequencies, establishing this hybrid FPM+TIE framework as a practical and high-performance solution for quantitative phase imaging in biomedical and optical metrology applications.</description>

      <title>High resolution up-conversion imaging in the 10 {\mu}m band under incoherent illumination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24367v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Long-wavelength infrared band exhibits significant utility in thermal signature acquisition and molecular spectral analysis, among other applications. The up-conversion detection technique enables effective signal transduction into the detection bandwidth of silicon-based photodetectors, thereby facilitating high-sensitivity photonic measurements. We realized high-resolution up-conversion imaging for incoherent thermal targets in the 10 {\mu}m spectral regime for the first time. Furthermore, this work presents the first derivation of analytical models characterizing depth of field and astigmatic aberration in up-conversion imaging systems, which show excellent agreement between theoretical and experimental results. The results demonstrate generalisability to various up-conversion imaging systems, thus providing critical insights for the design and optimisation of such systems.</description>

      <title>Optical frequency division referenced to microhertz-linewidth quantum-noise-limited lasers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24557v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical frequency division (OFD) implements the conversion of ultra-stable optical frequencies into microwave frequencies through an optical frequency comb flywheel, generating microwave oscillators with record-low phase noise and time jitter. However, conventional OFD systems face significant trade-off between division complexity and noise suppression due to severe thermal noise and technical noise in the optical frequency references. Here, we address this challenge by generating common-cavity bi-color Brillouin lasers as the optical frequency references, which operate at the fundamental quantum noise limit with Schawlow-Townes linewidth on the 10 {\mu}Hz level. Enabled by these ultra-coherent reference lasers, our OFD system uses a dramatically simplified comb divider with an unprecedented small division factor of 10, and successfully generates 10 GHz microwave signal with exceptional phase noise of -65 dBc/Hz at 1Hz, -151 dBc/Hz at 10 kHz, and -170 dBc/Hz at 10 MHz offset. Our work redefines the trade-off between noise suppression and division complexity in OFD, paving the way for compact, high-performance microwave synthesis for next-generation atomic clocks, quantum sensors, and low-noise radar systems.</description>

      <title>Molecular Chiral Response Enhanced by Crosstalking Quasi-Bound States in the Continuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Identifying the handedness of chiral molecules is of fundamental importance in chemistry, biology, pharmacy, and medicine. Nanophotonic structures allow us to control light at the nanoscale and offer powerful tools for chiral sensing, enabling the detection of small analyte volumes and low molecular concentrations by harnessing optical resonances. Most existing strategies rely on intuitive concepts such as strong local field enhancement or large local optical chirality, often achieved by engineering electric and magnetic Mie resonances in dielectric or plasmonic nanostructures. Recent insights, however, reveal that the chiroptical response of resonant systems is governed not only by local field effects, but also by less obvious mechanisms such as modal crosstalk. In this work, we present a dielectric metasurface engineered to amplify the modal crosstalk by supporting two nearly degenerate, high-quality-factor resonant states known as quasi-bound states in the continuum. Our theoretical and numerical analysis predicts a pronounced differential transmittance that exceeds the detection threshold of standard spectrometers. In particular, the differential transmittance reaches up to $10^{-2}$ for the Pasteur parameter $\kappa = 1\cdot10^{-4}$. These findings advance the capabilities of nanophotonic sensors for chiral detection, paving the way toward ultrasensitive identification of molecular handedness in increasingly smaller volumes and concentrations at the experimentally visible level.</description>

      <title>Frequency-Domain Joint Monitoring of Differential Group Delay and Dependent Loss of Optical Singleand Few-Mode Fiber Channels Based on CAZAC Sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24589v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the challenges of monitoring optical-fiber channels subject to complex, multidimensional impairments-such as dynamic interference across polarization or modal dimensions-where conventional methods suffer from high equipment costs, poor impairment discrimination and limited scalability. We propose an in-service, frequency-domain joint monitoring scheme based on constant-amplitude zero-autocorrelation (CAZAC) sequences. Exploiting their flat spectra and ideal autocorrelation, we model the channel as a multi-input multi-output (MIMO) system and estimate its frequency response to extract both differential group delay (DGD) and dimension-dependent loss (DL) regardless of dimensionality. Experimental validation in polarization-division-multiplexing (PDM) and mode-division-multiplexing (MDM) scenarios demonstrates robust performance: in a 2x2 PDM setup, polarization-dependent loss (PDL) error stays below 0.3 dB and polarization-mode dispersion (PMD) accuracy is 0.3 ps; in a 4x4 MDM system, mode-dependent loss (MDL) and differential mode-group delay (DMGD) errors remain around 0.3 dB and 0.3 ps, respectively. Fully compatible with existing coherent DSP without additional hardware, the scheme enables continuous, cost-effective, real-time monitoring of multidimensional optical channels.</description>

      <title>Three-Dimensional Hieratical Twist in Polar Fluids: Ultra-Low Field-Induced Chirality Regulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24628v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently discovered helical polar fluid adopts a spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking (CSB) driven by polarization escape and conformational chirality. Ferroelectric nematic and smectic phases are intrinsically chiral in the ground state and can be stabilized in an extrinsic twisted configuration through surface anchoring. Herein, we introduce extrinsic CSB as a novel technique in chiral engineering. To demonstrate this concept, we constructed the extrinsic structure of a helielectric conical mesophase (HEC)-multi-dimensional chiral system. Considering the challenges of controlling chirality at the macroscopic scale owing to magnetic fields, light, and fluid vortex motion, the proposed multi-dimensional chiral system enables chirality (twist) modulation through an ultralow electric field, thereby controlling unique diffraction pattern and circular polarized light-switching capabilities.</description>

      <title>All-optical diode via nonreciprocal nonlinear absorption and interfacial charge transfer in two-dimensional van der Waals heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24678v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonreciprocity is fundamental to photonic and optoelectronic devices such as all-optical diodes for ultrafast optical signal processing. However, previous nonreciprocity is mainly based on linear optical response instead of nonlinear optical response based on recently developed two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals heterostructures. Herein, an all-optical diode prototype based on nonreciprocal nonlinear absorption and interfacial charge transfer is proposed and designed by both simulation and experiment based on ready van der Waals heterostructures. The giant saturable absorption from 2D MXenes (NbC) and reverse saturable absorption from 2D chalcogenides (GaS) play a synergistic role in the designed all-optical diodes, which is characterized by a femtosecond laser based Z-scan system. The comprehensive physical mechanism of this all-optical diode based on 2D van der Waals NbC/GaS heterostructure designed by simulations, is consistent with experiments under the consideration of both nonreciprocal nonlinear absorption and interfacial effect. This all-optical diode based on the 2D van der Waals heterostructure features the simplicity, scalability, stability, integration, and compatibility with the complementary planar fabrication technology, which can further extend and miniaturize the nonlinear photonic and optoelectric devices.</description>

      <title>Strong coupling of chiral light with chiral matter: a macroscopic study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24800v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Maximizing the interaction between chiral light and chiral matter is pivotal for the advancement of technologies enabling optical detection that distinguishes between different handedness in chiral organic molecules. One strategy involves developing a resonator that sustains photonic modes with non-zero electromagnetic handedness, which interact differently with chiral molecules of opposite enantiomers. When chiral molecules are positioned in resonator hotspots, they can alter the system's characteristics due to their inherent electric and magnetic transition dipole moments. In this study, we explore this interaction by incorporating the Lorentz pole into the macroscopic parameters of the chiral medium: dielectric permittivity, magnetic permeability, and chirality coefficient. The latter, also known as the Pasteur parameter, is a dimensionless macroscopic measure indicating the medium's chirality, interlinking electric and magnetic fields in the constitutive relations. We show that introducing the Lorentz pole into these macroscopic material parameters of the chiral medium results in chiral strong coupling between light and matter, with the strength of coupling determined by both the medium's chirality and the photonic mode's chirality.</description>

Abstract: A characterization of the focused space-time structures of radially chirped beams is provided, detailing different tunable properties such as: variable on-axis centroid velocity, symmetric pulse front tilt, transverse intensity modulations, and polarization states. While the practical generation of ideal radially chirped beams and polarizations can be problematic, it is shown that the primary characteristics of these beams can be mimicked with simple arrays of axisymmetric, 1D spatially chirped beams.</description>

      <title>Terahertz prototype for air pollutants detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23956v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a prototype set-up exploiting terahertz time-domain spectroscopy (THz-TDS) to investigate gaseous compounds. The system is portable and allows to perform remote measurements. We used the prototype to characterise for the first time in literature over a broad THz range, pure dichloromethane and chloroform, two pollutants known as very short-lived substances (VSLS) that strongly contribute to ozone depletion. The THz range allows selectively detecting their absorption lines related to the rotational molecular motion for which we also present the theoretical confirmation. Then, we investigate the optical response of a multi-component mixture achieved with the two aforementioned chlorine-based compounds mixed with two widely distributed volatile pollutants (acetone and methanol). For these first measurements, we developed the set-up specifically for laboratory condition in which the substances are directly injected into the gas-cell circuit. Finally, we modified the prototype to ensure that the ambient atmosphere is drawn directly into the gas cell via a long pipe and a suction system opportunely developed. The analysis of the mixtures in both laboratory and in-field conditions demonstrates that the prototype together with the approach employed in this work can simultaneously identify and quantify single components in the atmosphere. The results obtained open up new possibilities for the development and applications of an efficient portable THz-based sensor for the remote detection of multi-component environmental contaminants.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast High-Flux Single-Photon LiDAR Simulator via Neural Mapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23992v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Efficient simulation of photon registrations in single-photon LiDAR (SPL) is essential for applications such as depth estimation under high-flux conditions, where hardware dead time significantly distorts photon measurements. However, the conventional wisdom is computationally intensive due to their inherently sequential, photon-by-photon processing. In this paper, we propose a learning-based framework that accelerates the simulation process by modeling the photon count and directly predicting the photon registration probability density function (PDF) using an autoencoder (AE). Our method achieves high accuracy in estimating both the total number of registered photons and their temporal distribution, while substantially reducing simulation time. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach, highlighting its potential to enable fast and accurate SPL simulations for data-intensive imaging tasks in the high-flux regime.</description>

      <title>Leveraging machine learning features for linear optical interferometer control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24032v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have developed an algorithm that constructs a model of a reconfigurable optical interferometer, independent of specific architectural constraints. The programming of unitary transformations on the interferometer's optical modes relies on either an analytical method for deriving the unitary matrix from a set of phase shifts or an optimization routine when such decomposition is not available. Our algorithm employs a supervised learning approach, aligning the interferometer model with a training set derived from the device being studied. A straightforward optimization procedure leverages this trained model to determine the phase shifts of the interferometer with a specific architecture, obtaining the required unitary transformation. This approach enables the effective tuning of interferometers without requiring a precise analytical solution, paving the way for the exploration of new interferometric circuit architectures.</description>

Abstract: We demonstrate that a conventional hollow conductor waveguide filled with a material exhibiting the coexistence of chiral magnetic and anomalous quantum Hall effects supports the propagation of transverse electromagnetic modes within its interior. This simple setup provides an optically feasible and direct method to probe the simultaneous presence of these phenomena, potentially enabling the detection of the axion field in the condensed matter realm.</description>

      <title>From Pixels to Camera: Scaling Superconducting Nanowire Single-Photon Detectors for Imaging at the Quantum-Limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24725v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors (SNSPDs) have emerged as essential devices that push the boundaries of photon detection with unprecedented sensitivity, ultrahigh timing precision, and broad spectral response. Recent advancements in materials engineering, superconducting electronics integration, and cryogenic system design are enabling the evolution of SNSPDs from single-pixel detectors toward scalable arrays and large-format single-photon time tagging cameras. This perspective article surveys the rapidly evolving technological landscape underpinning this transition, focusing on innovative superconducting materials, advanced multiplexed read-out schemes, and emerging cryo-compatible electronics. We highlight how these developments are set to profoundly impact diverse applications, including quantum communication networks, deep-tissue biomedical imaging, single-molecule spectroscopy, remote sensing with unprecedented resolution, and the detection of elusive dark matter signals. By critically discussing both current challenges and promising solutions, we aim to articulate a clear, coherent vision for the next generation of SNSPD-based quantum imaging systems.</description>

      <title>Electro-optically tunable Brillouin microlasers on lithium niobate platform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17443v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Miniature, monolithic, tunable sources of coherent radiation with narrow linewidths and low noise are highly sought after for photonic integration. Brillouin lasers, known for their intrinsically narrow linewidths, present an appealing solution. However, achieving the strong optomechanical coupling necessary for lasing in optical microresonators remains challenging due to the difficulty of simultaneously confining optical and acoustic modes with substantial modal overlap. Additionally, most Brillouin lasers lack tunability. Lithium niobate (LN) emerges as an excellent platform for integrated photonics, offering large photoelastic coefficients and electro-optic tunability. In this work, we demonstrate strong optomechanical interactions in a 117-um-diameter LN microdisk resonator, achieved through post-fabrication dispersion management and enhanced mode matching enabled by the large off-diagonal elements of the photoelastic tensor. This approach yields an impressive optomechanical coupling rate of up to 30 kHz per photon, resulting in a tunable, integrated Brillouin microlaser with an intrinsic linewidth of 118 Hz and a low lasing threshold of 3.15 mW -- a remarkable performance for such a compact device. Furthermore, we demonstrate electro-optic tuning of the microlaser with an efficiency of 43.2 kHz/V, showcasing the versatility of LN for next-generation tunable photonic systems.</description>

      <title>Non-resonant Optical Injection Locking in Quantum Cascade Laser Frequency Combs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10052v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Optical injection locking of the repetition frequency of a quantum cascade laser frequency comb is demonstrated using an intensity modulated near-infrared light at 1.55 $\mu$m illuminating the front facet of the laser. Compared to the traditional electrical modulation approach, the introduced technique presents benefits from several perspectives such as the availability of mature and high bandwidth equipment in the near-infrared, circumvent the need of dedicated electronic components for the quantum cascade laser, and allows a direct link between the near and mid-infrared for amplitude to frequency modulation. We show that this stabilization scheme, used with moderate near-infrared power of a few milliwatts, allows for a strong reduction of the frequency noise. We also perform a full characterization of the mechanism and evidence that the locking range follows Adler's law. A comparison of our results with those in recent literature indicates that the optical approach leads to better performance compared to the traditional method, which we expect to benefit mid-infrared spectroscopy and metrological applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.19627v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Real-time optics and spectroscopy simulations ideally provide results at update rates of 120 Hz or more without any noticeable delay between changing input parameters and the calculated results. Such calculations require models of sufficient speed yet adequate level of detail in the physical approximations to contain the essential features of the simulated phenomena. We discuss a representation of femtosecond laser pulses in which fast phase oscillations due to carrier frequency and due to spatial propagation are separated out and amplitude modulations due to Gaussian beam propagation are also separated and treated explicitly. We derive simplified expressions for the spatial modulations of laser beams. Further, we derive visibility and beam-overlap factors describing multi-pulse interference. We obtain simplified expressions for radius and curvature of nonlinear signal beams in the case of fundamental beams with different convergence, different beam waist, and imperfect mutual overlap. The described model is implemented in the virtual-reality laser laboratory simulation "femtoPro," but the derived equations can be used independently for other applications.</description>

Abstract: Space group theory is pivotal in the design of nanophotonics devices, enabling the characterization of periodic optical structures such as photonic crystals. The aim of this study is to extend the application of nonsymmorphic space groups in the field of numerical analysis for research and design of nanophotonics devices. In this work, we introduce the nonsymmorphic symmetry adapted finite element method, and provide a systematic approach for efficient band structure analysis of photonic structures with nonsymmorphic groups. We offer a formal and rigorous treatment by specifically deriving the boundary constraint conditions associated with the symmetry operations and their irreducible representations and decomposing the original problem into different subtasks. our method fully accounting for non-primitive translations and nonstructural symmetries like time-reversal symmetry and hidden symmetries. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method via computing the band structure of photonic structures with a layer group, a plane group, and a space group. The results exhibit excellent agreement with those obtained using the standard finite element method, showcasing improved computational efficiency. Furthermore, the decomposition of the original problem facilitates band structure classification and analysis, enabling the identification of the different bands among the band structure in various subtasks. This advancement paves the way for innovative designs in nanophotonics.</description>

      <title>Machine learning assisted speckle and OAM spectrum analysis for enhanced turbulence characterisation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.21878v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Atmospheric turbulence presents a major obstacle to the performance of free-space optical (FSO) communication and environmental sensing. While most studies focused on robust detection and recognition of transmitted structured light in turbulent media, a critical, yet often underexplored, avenue involves leveraging the structure of light itself to detect and characterize the medium itself. Here we introduce a deep learning framework that synergistically leverages post-transmission intensity speckle patterns and orbital angular momentum (OAM) spectral data to enhance turbulence state classification, essential for applications such as energy delivery, effective adaptive optics and communications. The proposed architecture builds upon an enhanced InceptionNet backbone optimized for multi-scale feature extraction from complex optical inputs, where we demonstrate that multiple degree of freedom analysis outperforms the conventional single parameter approaches, reaching validation accuracies in excess of 80%. Our approach is benchmarked against standard implementations and found to be superior in handling diverse turbulence scenarios, demonstrating enhanced stability across varying turbulence conditions defined by different Reynolds numbers and Fried parameters. Our method offers a scalable, data-efficient solution for precise atmospheric turbulence detection, with strong potential for deployment in real-world optical sensing applications.</description>

      <title>Modified Transfer Matrix Method for the Extraction of Material Properties via Terahertz Time-Domain Spectroscopy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.21924v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Terahertz Time-Domain Spectroscopy is a powerful technique for extracting the low-frequency optical properties of materials. However, the optical constants are difficult to determine directly from the experimental transfer function, such that various numerical approximations must be implemented to describe specific conditions. Here, we introduce a modified Transfer Matrix Method that uses a genetic algorithm for optimization to determine the refractive index of materials in the THz regime. We show that this approach is generally applicable across a wide range of refractive indices, structures, and frequency ranges. Our method is intuitive and yields accurate results compared to leading methods across a wide spectral range (0.1 - 15 THz).</description>

      <title>AC-Stark Spectroscopy of Interactions between Moir\'e Excitons and Polarons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.16630v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use nonlinear pump-probe spectroscopy to study optical excitations in a charge-tunable MoSe$_2$\WS$_2$ moir\'e heterostructure. An intense red-detuned laser pulse creates a photonic dressing of the material by introducing a large virtual population of excitons or exciton polarons in a deep moir\'e potential. By measuring the resulting ac Stark effect with a weak resonant laser pulse, we gain access to the nature and mutual interactions of the elementary optical excitations. At charge neutrality, our measurements reveal that different exciton resonances, associated with confinement of their center-of-mass motion in the moir\'e potential, have a significant spatial overlap. The resulting short-range interactions manifest themselves as a density-dependent blueshift for same-valley excitons and bound biexciton states for opposite-valley excitons. The attractive polaron resonance that appears upon injection of electrons into the heterostructure shows a contrasting behavior: Here, we observe an electron-density-independent light shift and a clear pump-power-dependent saturation. These features are equivalent to that of an ensemble of independent two-level emitters and indicate a breakdown of the Fermi-polaron picture for optical excitations of electrons subject to a strong moir\'e potential. Our work establishes an experimental approach to elucidate the elementary optical excitations of semiconductor moir\'e heterostructures, providing a solid ground for the spectroscopy of correlated electronic and excitonic states in such materials.</description>

      <title>Preparing magnonic non-Gaussian states by adding a single magnon onto Gaussian states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11052v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum magnonics based on YIG spheres provides a new arena for observing macroscopic quantum states. Here we propose to prepare two kinds of non-Gaussian magnonic states by adding a single magnon onto two Gaussian states, namely, coherent and thermal states. We adopt an optomagnonic system of a YIG sphere and use fast optical pulses to weakly activate the magnon-induced Stokes scattering. Conditioned on the detection of a polarized single photon, a single magnon can be added onto an initial Gaussian state. We use a microwave cavity to prepare an initial magnon coherent state and finally read out the generated single-magnon added coherent or thermal state. Both the non-Gaussian states of a magnon mode in a large-size YIG sphere are macroscopic quantum states, which exhibit many nonclassical properties, such as sub-Poissonian statistics, quadrature squeezing, and a negative Wigner function. Further, both states show a smooth transition from a quantum state to a classical state by changing the coherent or thermal magnon excitations and thus can be used for the fundamental study of the quantum-to-classical transition.</description>

      <title>High-Efficiency Plasma-Based Compressor for Ultrafast Soft X-ray Free-Electron Lasers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.16768v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The generation of intense, femtosecond-scale X-ray pulses is crucial for probing matter under extreme temporal and field conditions. Current chirped-pulse amplification (CPA) techniques in free-electron lasers (FELs), however, face efficiency limitations in the soft X-ray regime due to the inherent constraints of conventional optical compressors. To address this challenge, we propose a high-efficiency plasma-based compressor utilizing highly ionized noble gas plasma. Exploiting strong refractive index dispersion near ionic resonances, this scheme achieves over 70% transmission efficiency around 5.2 nm, and is extendable to other highly charged ions for operation across the soft X-ray to vacuum ultraviolet range. Simulations demonstrate that a 25 fs FEL pulse can be compressed to 1.4 fs with peak power boosted to over 100 GW, while maintaining high energy throughput. This approach overcomes the long-standing efficiency bottleneck of soft X-ray CPA and opens a scalable path toward compact, high-brightness attosecond FEL sources.</description>
