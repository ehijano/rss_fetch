      <title>Precise Computation of Forced Response Backbone Curves of Frictional Structures Using Analytical Hessian Tensor of Contact Elements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14990v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Predicting the forced vibration response of nonlinear mechanical systems with friction is critical for engineering applications. Accurately determining the backbone curve of resonance peaks is pivotal for the design of friction devices. However, the prediction of these curves is computationally challenging owing to the nonconservative and nonsmooth nature of friction nonlinearity. Although techniques such as damped nonlinear normal modes (dNNMs) and phase resonance methods have been applied, they often suffer from convergence issues, and their computational accuracy is compromised under certain conditions. This study proposes a novel method for computing the forced response backbone curves of structures with frictional contact interfaces. The method accurately tracks the backbone curve through a parameter continuation scheme, formulated via Lagrange multipliers and accelerated by incorporating a derived analytical Hessian Tensor of contact elements. This approach yields highly accurate numerical results and enables numerical singularities on the curve to be identified and robustly traversed. The proposed method is validated using an Euler-Bernoulli beam finite-element model and a lumped-parameter blade-damper-blade model. The results demonstrate superior accuracy compared to conventional dNNMs and phase resonance methods, particularly in cases involving either high structural damping or strong frictional damping. This work provides a robust computational tool and presents a detailed comparative analysis that clarifies the applicability and limitations of the proposed and conventional methods.</description>

      <title>Modelling Lateral Spread in Wire Flat Rolling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06300v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A mathematical model for wire rolling is developed, focusing on predicting the lateral spread. This provides, for the first time, an analytic model of lateral spread without any fitting parameters. The model is derived directly from the governing equations, assuming a rigid, perfectly plastic material and exploiting the thinness of the wire (in thickness and width) relative to the roller size. Results are compared against experiments performed on stainless steel wire using 100mm diameter rolls, demonstrating accurate predictions of lateral spread across a wide range of wire diameters (2.96mm-7.96mm) and reduction ratios (20%-60%), all without the need for fitting parameters. Since the model requires only seconds to compute, the model's valid range is explored for varying roll diameter, wire diameter, and reduction ratio, and their effects on the resulting lateral spread characterized. The model can serve as a robust tool for validating FE results, guiding process design, and laying the foundation for future improved models. Matlab code to evaluate the model is provided in the supplementary material.</description>

      <title>Planck Law from a Classical Free Energy Extremum Involving Fisher Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00586v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive the Planck law from a classical variational principle over probability densities, without invoking quantum states, quantized oscillator energies, or ensemble averages. We construct a generalized free energy functional involving entropy and Fisher information, with weights determined by the dimensionless ratio of quantum to thermal energy. When extremized under a Gaussian ansatz, this functional yields the exact Planck distribution. The only quantum input is a minimal threshold assumption: that an oscillator emits a photon only when a thermal fluctuation delivers at least as much energy as the photon has. We also present a complementary kinetic derivation, based on threshold-activated thermal cascades, that yields the same result through classical stochastic reasoning. Together, these approaches provide a thermodynamic and information-theoretic route to black-body radiation, grounded in classical principles and variational stability.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.22936v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By means of a brief review of the derivation of the causal modified Lorentz-Abraham-Dirac classical equation of motion from the renormalization of the mass in the modified equation of motion of an extended charged sphere as its radius approaches zero, it is shown that Zin and Pylak's objection that the jumps in velocity allowed across transition intervals near nonanalytic points in time of the externally applied force produce delta functions in the radiated fields is incorrect.</description>
