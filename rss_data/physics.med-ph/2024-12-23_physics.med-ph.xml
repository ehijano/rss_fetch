      <title>A Digital Phantom for 3D MR Spectroscopy Data Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15869v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simulated data is increasingly valued by researchers for validating MRS and MRSI processing and analysis algorithms. However, there is no consensus on the optimal approaches for simulation models and parameters. This study introduces a novel 3D MRS digital brain phantom framework, providing a comprehensive and modular foundation for MRS and MRSI data simulation. We generate a digital brain phantom by combining anatomical and tissue label information with metabolite data from the literature. This phantom contains all necessary information for simulating spectral data. We integrate the phantom with a signal-based model to demonstrate its functionality and usability in generating various spectral datasets. Outputs are saved in the NIfTI-MRS format, enabling their use in downstream applications. We successfully implemented and tested the 3D MRS digital brain phantom framework using two different anatomical models at two resolutions. The resulting metabolite maps and spectral datasets demonstrate realistic data quality, flexibility based on user inputs, and reasonable computational efficiency. This innovative 3D digital brain phantom framework provides a clear and structured approach to simulating MRS and MRSI data. Its modular design establishes a strong, adaptable foundation for future advancements in MRS and MRSI simulation, allowing researchers to extend and refine the model to meet the field's evolving needs.</description>

      <title>Probing lactate exchange and compartmentation in Gray Matter via time-dependent diffusion-weighted MRS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16014v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lactate is crucial in the brain, as it is involved in neuronal activity and memory formation. This is thought to be related to the astrocyte-neuron lactate shuttle hypothesis (ANLS), which has been debated for 30 years, not least because it is difficult to measure lactate compartmentation and exchange in vivo. In particular, while ANLS requires transfer of lactate via the extracellular space, intracellular/extracellular exchange rate remains unknown. In this work, we propose to use time-dependent diffusion MRS to assess lactate exchange and lactate compartmentation in mouse brain gray matter in vivo. First, by comparing lactate time-dependent diffusivity and kurtosis with those of water and purely intracellular metabolites (which exhibit "fast" and "no" exchange signatures, respectively), we estimate that lactate exchange is slow (i.e. on the order of hundreds of milliseconds). Then, using biophysical models neglecting exchange, we estimate extracellular, neuronal and astrocytic lactate fractions compatible with the ANLS hypothesis.</description>

      <title>Convolutional Deep Operator Networks for Learning Nonlinear Focused Ultrasound Wave Propagation in Heterogeneous Spinal Cord Anatomy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Focused ultrasound (FUS) therapy is a promising tool for optimally targeted treatment of spinal cord injuries (SCI), offering submillimeter precision to enhance blood flow at injury sites while minimizing impact on surrounding tissues. However, its efficacy is highly sensitive to the placement of the ultrasound source, as the spinal cord's complex geometry and acoustic heterogeneity distort and attenuate the FUS signal. Current approaches rely on computer simulations to solve the governing wave propagation equations and compute patient-specific pressure maps using ultrasound images of the spinal cord anatomy. While accurate, these high-fidelity simulations are computationally intensive, taking up to hours to complete parameter sweeps, which is impractical for real-time surgical decision-making. To address this bottleneck, we propose a convolutional deep operator network (DeepONet) to rapidly predict FUS pressure fields in patient spinal cords. Unlike conventional neural networks, DeepONets are well equipped to approximate the solution operator of the parametric partial differential equations (PDEs) that govern the behavior of FUS waves with varying initial and boundary conditions (i.e., new transducer locations or spinal cord geometries) without requiring extensive simulations. Trained on simulated pressure maps across diverse patient anatomies, this surrogate model achieves real-time predictions with only a 2% loss on the test set, significantly accelerating the modeling of nonlinear physical systems in heterogeneous domains. By facilitating rapid parameter sweeps in surgical settings, this work provides a crucial step toward precise and individualized solutions in neurosurgical treatments.</description>

      <title>Joint Supervised and Self-supervised Learning for MRI Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.15856v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) represents an important diagnostic modality; however, its inherently slow acquisition process poses challenges in obtaining fully-sampled $k$-space data under motion. In the absence of fully-sampled acquisitions, serving as ground truths, training deep learning algorithms in a supervised manner to predict the underlying ground truth image becomes challenging. To address this limitation, self-supervised methods have emerged as a viable alternative, leveraging available subsampled $k$-space data to train deep neural networks for MRI reconstruction. Nevertheless, these approaches often fall short when compared to supervised methods. We propose Joint Supervised and Self-supervised Learning (JSSL), a novel training approach for deep learning-based MRI reconstruction algorithms aimed at enhancing reconstruction quality in cases where target datasets containing fully-sampled $k$-space measurements are unavailable. JSSL operates by simultaneously training a model in a self-supervised learning setting, using subsampled data from the target dataset(s), and in a supervised learning manner, utilizing datasets with fully-sampled $k$-space data, referred to as proxy datasets. We demonstrate JSSL's efficacy using subsampled prostate or cardiac MRI data as the target datasets, with fully-sampled brain and knee, or brain, knee and prostate $k$-space acquisitions, respectively, as proxy datasets. Our results showcase substantial improvements over conventional self-supervised methods, validated using common image quality metrics. Furthermore, we provide theoretical motivations for JSSL and establish "rule-of-thumb" guidelines for training MRI reconstruction models. JSSL effectively enhances MRI reconstruction quality in scenarios where fully-sampled $k$-space data is not available, leveraging the strengths of supervised learning by incorporating proxy datasets.</description>
