      <title>Extreme mixed-mode oscillatory bursts in the Helmholtz-Duffing oscillator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11889v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report a new type of extreme event - extreme irregular mixed-mode oscillatory burst - appearing in an asymmetric double-welled, driven Helmholtz-Duffing oscillator. The interplay of cubic and quadratic nonlinearities in the system, along with the external drive, contributes to this type of unusual extreme event. These extreme events are classified using the peak-over threshold method and found to be well-fitted with the generalized extreme value distribution. The asymmetry in the depth of one of the potential wells allows the oscillator to exhibit rare irregular mixed-mode oscillations between the two wells, manifesting as extremely irregular mixed-mode oscillatory bursts. Furthermore, we also find that such an irregular transition between the two potential wells occurs during the up phase of the periodic external drive. Importantly, we also find that the system velocity can be tracked and utilized as a reliable lead indicator of the occurrence of this novel type of extreme event.</description>

      <title>Extreme Events in the Higgs Oscillator: A Dynamical Study and Forecasting Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11894v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many dynamical systems exhibit unexpected large amplitude excursions in the chronological progression of a state variable. In the present work, we consider the dynamics associated with the one-dimensional Higgs oscillator which is realized through gnomic projection of a harmonic oscillator defined on a spherical space of constant curvature onto a Euclidean plane which is tangent to the spherical space. While studying the dynamics of such a Higgs oscillator subjected to damping and an external forcing, various bifurcation phenomena, such as symmetry breaking, period doubling, and intermittency crises are encountered. As the driven parameter increases, the route to chaos takes place via intermittency crisis and we also identify the occurrence of extreme events due to the interior crisis. The study of probability distribution also confirms the occurrence of extreme events. Finally, we train the Long Short-Term Memory neural network model with the time-series data to forecast the extreme events (EEs).</description>

      <title>Two-Player Yorke's Game of Survival in Chaotic Transients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel two-player game in a chaotic dynamical system where players have opposing objectives regarding the system's behavior. The game is analyzed using a methodology from the field of chaos control known as partial control. Our aim is to introduce the utility of this methodology in the scope of game theory. These algorithms enable players to devise winning strategies even when they lack complete information about their opponent's actions. To illustrate the approach, we apply it to a chaotic system, the logistic map. In this scenario, one player aims to maintain the system's trajectory within a transient chaotic region, while the opposing player seeks to expel the trajectory from this region. The methodology identifies the set of initial conditions that guarantee victory for each player, referred to as the winning sets, along with the corresponding strategies required to achieve their respective objectives.</description>

      <title>A simple method to enlarge a basin of attraction using a memristive function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12220v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents an innovative approach to chaotic attractor stabilization introducing a memristor in discrete dynamical systems. Using the H\'enon map as a test case, we replace a system parameter with a memristive function governed by a sigmoid activation function. The method relies on leveraging attractors with larger basins of attraction to attract the orbits and guide them towards the desired chaotic attractor. The effectiveness of the method is confirmed through numerical simulations, showing substantial enhancement in attractor stability without requiring explicit parameter control.</description>

      <title>Spectral dynamics of natural and forced supersonic twin-rectangular jet flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10894v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the stationary, intermittent, and nonlinear dynamics of natural and forced supersonic twin-rectangular turbulent jets using spectral modal decomposition. We decompose large-eddy simulation data into four reflectional symmetry components about the major and minor axes. In the natural jet, spectral proper orthogonal decomposition (SPOD) uncovers two resonant instabilities antisymmetric about the major axis. Known as screech tones, the more energetic of the two is symmetric about the minor axis and steady, while the other is intermittent. We test the hypothesis that flow symmetry can be leveraged for control design. Time-periodic forcing symmetric about the major and minor axes is implemented using a plasma actuation model, and succeeds in removing screech from a different symmetry component. We investigate the spectral peaks of the forced jet using an extension of bispectral mode decomposition (BMD), where the bispectrum is bounded by unity and which conditionally recovers the SPOD. We explain the appearance of harmonic peaks as three sets of triadic interactions between reflectional symmetries, forming an interconnected triad network. BMD modes of active triads distil coherent structures comprising multiple coupled instabilities, including Kelvin-Helmholtz, core, and guided-jet modes (G-JM). Downstream-propagating core modes can be symmetric or antisymmetric about the major axis, whereas upstream-propagating G-JM responsible for screech closure (Edgington-Mitchell et al., 2022, JFM) are antisymmetric only. The dependence of G-JM on symmetry hence translates from the azimuthal symmetry of the round jet to the dihedral group symmetry of the twin-rectangular jet, and explains why the twin jet exhibits antisymmetric but not symmetric screech modes.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised Learning in Echo State Networks for Input Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11409v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conventional echo state networks (ESNs) require supervised learning to train the readout layer, using the desired outputs as training data. In this study, we focus on input reconstruction (IR), which refers to training the readout layer to reproduce the input time series in its output. We reformulate the learning algorithm of the ESN readout layer to perform IR using unsupervised learning (UL). By conducting theoretical analysis and numerical experiments, we demonstrate that IR in ESNs can be effectively implemented under realistic conditions without explicitly using the desired outputs as training data; in this way, UL is enabled. Furthermore, we demonstrate that applications relying on IR, such as dynamical system replication and noise filtering, can be reformulated within the UL framework. Our findings establish a theoretically sound and universally applicable IR formulation, along with its related tasks in ESNs. This work paves the way for novel predictions and highlights unresolved theoretical challenges in ESNs, particularly in the context of time-series processing methods and computational models of the brain.</description>

      <title>Resolvent-Based Optimisation for Approximating the Statistics of a Chaotic Lorenz System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13120v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a novel framework for approximating the statistical properties of turbulent flows by combining variational methods for the search of unstable periodic orbits with resolvent analysis for dimensionality reduction. Traditional approaches relying on identifying all short, fundamental unstable periodic orbits to compute ergodic averages via cycle expansion are computationally prohibitive for high-dimensional fluid systems. Our framework stems from the observation in Lasagna, Phys. Rev. E (2020), that a single unstable periodic orbit with a period sufficiently long to span a large fraction of the attractor captures the statistical properties of chaotic trajectories. Given the difficulty of identifying unstable periodic orbits for high-dimensional fluid systems, approximate trajectories residing in a low-dimensional subspace are instead constructed using resolvent modes, which inherently capture the temporal periodicity of unstable periodic orbits. The amplitude coefficients of these modes are adjusted iteratively with gradient-based optimisation to minimise the violation of the projected governing equations, producing trajectories that approximate, rather than exactly solve, the system dynamics. A first attempt at utilising this framework on a chaotic system is made here on the Lorenz 1963 equations, where resolvent analysis enables an exact dimensionality reduction from three to two dimensions. Key observables averaged over these trajectories produced by the approach as well as probability distributions and spectra rapidly converge to values obtained from long chaotic simulations, even with a limited number of iterations. This indicates that exact solutions may not be necessary to approximate the system's statistical behaviour, as the trajectories obtained from partial optimisation provide a sufficient ``sketch'' of the attractor in state space.</description>

      <title>Parametric Autoresonance with Time-Delayed Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10105v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate how a constant time delay influences a parametric autoresonant system. This is a nonlinear system driven by a parametrically chirped force with a negative delay-feedback that maintains adiabatic phase locking with the driving frequency. This phase locking results in a continuous amplitude growth, regardless of parameter changes. Our study reveals a critical threshold for delay strength; above this threshold, autoresonance is sustained, while below it, autoresonance diminishes. We examine the interplay between time delay and autoresonance stability, using multi-scale perturbation methods to derive analytical results, which are corroborated by numerical simulations. Ultimately, the goal is to understand and control autoresonance stability through the time-delay parameters.</description>

      <title>Network reconstruction may not mean dynamics prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04240v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With an increasing amount of observations on the dynamics of many complex systems, it is required to reveal the underlying mechanisms behind these complex dynamics, which is fundamentally important in many scientific fields such as climate, financial, ecological, and neural systems. The underlying mechanisms are commonly encoded into network structures, e.g., capturing how constituents interact with each other to produce emergent behavior. Here, we address whether a good network reconstruction suggests a good dynamics prediction. The answer is quite dependent on the nature of the supplied (observed) dynamics sequences measured on the complex system. When the dynamics are not chaotic, network reconstruction implies dynamics prediction. In contrast, even if a network can be well reconstructed from the chaotic time series (chaos means that many unstable dynamics states coexist), the prediction of the future dynamics can become impossible as at some future point the prediction error will be amplified. This is explained by using dynamical mean-field theory on a toy model of random recurrent neural networks.</description>

      <title>Streamlined Krylov construction and classification of ergodic Floquet systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19797v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We generalize Krylov construction to periodically driven (Floquet) quantum systems using the theory of orthogonal polynomials on the unit circle. Compared to other approaches, our method works faster and maps any quantum dynamics to a one-dimensional tight-binding Krylov chain, which is efficiently simulated on both classical and quantum computers. We also suggest a classification of chaotic and integrable Floquet systems based on the asymptotic behavior of Krylov chain hopping parameters (Verblunsky coefficients). We illustrate this classification with random matrix ensembles, kicked top, and kicked Ising chain.</description>
