      <title>Computational models of astrocyte function at glutamatergic synapses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13345v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: At tripartite synapses, astrocytes are in close contact with neurons and contribute to various functions, from synaptic transmission, maintenance of ion homeostasis and glutamate uptake to metabolism. However, disentangling the precise contribution of astrocytes to those phenomena and the underlying biochemical mechanisms is remarkably challenging. This notably results from their highly ramified morphology, the nanoscopic size of the majority of astrocyte processes, and the poorly understood information encoded by their spatiotemporally diverse calcium signals. This book chapter presents selected computational models of the involvement of astrocytes in glutamatergic transmission. The goal of this chapter is to present representative models of astrocyte function in conjunction with the biological questions they can investigate.</description>

      <title>A stable and accurate discretization for fractional-order adaptive exponential integrate-and-fire models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce an efficient discretization of a novel fractional-order adaptive exponential (FrAdEx) integrate-and-fire model, which is used to study the fractional-order dynamics of neuronal activities. The discretization is based on extension of L1-type methods that can accurately handle the exponential growth and the spiking mechanism of the model. This new method is implicit and uses adaptive time stepping to robustly handle the stiff system that arises due to the exponential term. The implicit nonlinear system can be solved exactly, without the need for iterative methods, making the scheme efficient while maintaining accuracy. We present a complete error model for the numerical scheme that can be extended to other integrate-and-fire models with minor changes. To show the feasibility of our approach, the numerical method has been rigorously validated and used to investigate several different spiking oscillations of the model. We observed that the fractional-order model is capable of predicting biophysical activities, which are interpreted through phase diagrams describing the transition from one firing type to another. This simple model shows significant promise, as it has sufficient expressive dynamics to reproduce several features qualitatively from a biophysical dynamical perspective.</description>

      <title>Single-sample image-fusion upsampling of fluorescence lifetime images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13102v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) provides detailed information about molecular interactions and biological processes. A major bottleneck for FLIM is image resolution at high acquisition speeds, due to the engineering and signal-processing limitations of time-resolved imaging technology. Here we present single-sample image-fusion upsampling (SiSIFUS), a data-fusion approach to computational FLIM super-resolution that combines measurements from a low-resolution time-resolved detector (that measures photon arrival time) and a high-resolution camera (that measures intensity only). To solve this otherwise ill-posed inverse retrieval problem, we introduce statistically informed priors that encode local and global dependencies between the two single-sample measurements. This bypasses the risk of out-of-distribution hallucination as in traditional data-driven approaches and delivers enhanced images compared for example to standard bilinear interpolation. The general approach laid out by SiSIFUS can be applied to other image super-resolution problems where two different datasets are available.</description>

      <title>Wave-driven phase wave patterns in a ring of FitzHugh-Nagumo oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13363v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore a biomimetic model that simulates a cell, with the internal cytoplasm represented by a two-dimensional circular domain and the external cortex by a surrounding ring, both modeled using FitzHugh-Nagumo systems. The external ring is dynamically influenced by a pacemaker-driven wave originating from the internal domain, leading to the emergence of three distinct dynamical states based on the varying strengths of coupling. The range of dynamics observed includes phase patterning, the propagation of phase waves, and interactions between traveling and phase waves. A simplified linear model effectively explains the mechanisms behind the variety of phase patterns observed, providing insights into the complex interplay between a cell's internal and external environments.</description>

      <title>Quantitative Analysis of Roles of Direct and Indirect Pathways for Action Selection in The Basal Ganglia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13888v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The basal ganglia (BG) show diverse functions for motor and cognition. Here, we are concerned about action selection performed by the BG. Particularly, we make quantitative analysis of roles of direct pathway (DP) and indirect pathway (IP) for action selection in a spiking neural network with 3 competing channels. For such quantitative work, in each channel, we get the competition degree ${\cal C}_d$, given by the ratio of strength of DP (${\cal S}_{DP}$) to strength of IP (${\cal S}_{IP}$) (i.e., ${\cal C}_d = {\cal S}_{DP} / {\cal S}_{IP}$). Then, desired action is selected in the channel with the largest ${\cal C}_d$. Desired action selection is made mainly due to strong focused inhibitory projection to the output nucleus, SNr (substantia nigra pars reticulata) via the "Go" DP in the corresponding channel. Unlike the case of DP, there are two types of IPs; intra-channel IP and inter-channel IP, due to widespread diffusive excitation from the STN (subthalamic nucleus). The intra-channel "No-Go" IP plays a role of brake to suppress the desired action selection. On the other hand, the inter-channel IP to the SNr in the neighboring channels suppresses competing actions, leading to spotlight the desired action selection. In this way, role of the inter-channel IP is opposite to that of the intra-channel IP. But, to the best of our knowledge, no quantitative analysis for such roles of the DP and the two IPs was made. Here, by direct calculations of the DP and the intra- and the inter-channel IP presynaptic currents into the SNr in each channel, we get the competition degree of each channel to determine a desired action, and then roles of the DP and the intra- and inter-channel IPs are quantitatively made clear.</description>

      <title>Internal sites of actuation and activation in thin elastic films and membranes of finite thickness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14011v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Functionalized thin elastic films and membranes frequently feature internal sites of net forces or stresses. These are, for instance, active sites of actuation, or rigid inclusions in a strained membrane that induce counterstress upon externally imposed deformations. We theoretically analyze the geometry of isotropic, flat, thin, linearly elastic films or membranes of finite thickness, laterally extended to infinity. At the mathematical core of such characterizations are the fundamental solutions for localized force and stress singularities associated with corresponding Green's functions. We derive such solutions in three dimensions and place them into the context of previous two-dimensional calculations. To this end, we consider both no-slip and stress-free conditions at the top and/or bottom surfaces. We provide an understanding for why the fully free-standing thin elastic membrane leads to diverging solutions in most geometries and compare these situations to the truly two-dimensional case. A no-slip support of at least one of the surfaces stabilizes the solution, which illustrates that the divergences in the fully free-standing case are connected to global deformations. Within the mentioned framework, our results are important for associated theoretical characterizations of thin elastic films, whether supported or free-standing, and of membranes subject to internal or external forces or stresses.</description>

      <title>Non-equilibrium structure and relaxation in active microemulsions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14176v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Microphase separation is common in active biological systems as exemplified by the separation of RNA and DNA-rich phases in the cell nucleus driven by the transcriptional activity of polymerase enzymes acting similarly to amphiphiles in a microemulsion. Here we propose an analytically tractable model of an active microemulsion to investigate how the activity affects its structure and relaxation dynamics. Continuum theory derived from a lattice model exhibits two distinct regimes of the relaxation dynamics and is linked to the broken detailed balance due to intermittent activity of the amphiphiles.</description>

      <title>Transitions and Thermodynamics on Species Graphs of Chemical Reaction Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14336v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chemical reaction networks (CRNs) exhibit complex dynamics governed by their underlying network structure. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to study the dynamics of CRNs by representing them on species graphs (S-graphs). By scaling concentrations by conservation laws, we obtain a graph representation of transitions compatible with the S-graph, which allows us to treat the dynamics in CRNs as transitions between chemicals. We also define thermodynamic-like quantities on the S-graph from the introduced transitions and investigate their properties, including the relationship between specieswise forces, activities, and conventional thermodynamic quantities. Remarkably, we demonstrate that this formulation can be developed for a class of irreversible CRNs, while for reversible CRNs, it is related to conventional thermodynamic quantities associated with reactions. The behavior of these specieswise quantities is numerically validated using an oscillating system (Brusselator). Our work provides a novel methodology for studying dynamics on S-graphs, paving the way for a deeper understanding of the intricate interplay between the structure and dynamics of chemical reaction networks.</description>

      <title>Toward stochastic neural computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.13982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.13982v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The highly irregular spiking activity of cortical neurons and behavioral variability suggest that the brain could operate in a fundamentally probabilistic way. Mimicking how the brain implements and learns probabilistic computation could be a key to developing machine intelligence that can think more like humans. In this work, we propose a theory of stochastic neural computing (SNC) in which streams of noisy inputs are transformed and processed through populations of nonlinearly coupled spiking neurons. To account for the propagation of correlated neural variability, we derive from first principles a moment embedding for spiking neural network (SNN). This leads to a new class of deep learning model called the moment neural network (MNN) which naturally generalizes rate-based neural networks to second order. As the MNN faithfully captures the stationary statistics of spiking neural activity, it can serve as a powerful proxy for training SNN with zero free parameters. Through joint manipulation of mean firing rate and noise correlations in a task-driven way, the model is able to learn inference tasks while simultaneously minimizing prediction uncertainty, resulting in enhanced inference speed. We further demonstrate the application of our method to Intel's Loihi neuromorphic hardware. The proposed theory of SNC may open up new opportunities for developing machine intelligence capable of computing uncertainty and for designing unconventional computing architectures.</description>

      <title>Poissonian cellular Potts models reveal nonequilibrium kinetics of cell sorting</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.04443v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cellular Potts models are broadly applied across developmental biology and cancer research. We overcome limitations of the traditional approach, which reinterprets a modified Metropolis sampling as ad hoc dynamics, by introducing a physical timescale through Poissonian kinetics and by applying principles of stochastic thermodynamics to separate thermal and relaxation effects from athermal noise and nonconservative forces. Our method accurately describes cell-sorting dynamics in mouse-embryo development and identifies the distinct contributions of nonequilibrium processes, e.g. cell growth and active fluctuations.</description>
