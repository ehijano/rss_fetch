      <title>Labor Market Policies in High- and Low-Interest Rate Environments: Evidence from the Euro Area</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12024v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Do labor market policies initiated in periods of loose monetary policy yield different outcomes from those introduced when monetary tightening prevails? Using data from 11 euro-area members up to 2010 -- and extending to 17 countries up to 2020 -- we analyze three labor market policies: replacement rates, spending on active labor market policies (ALMPs), and employment protection. We find that these policies deliver different macroeconomic outcomes in low- and high-interest rate environments. In particular, ALMPs reduce unemployment if implemented under a loose monetary policy but not otherwise, whereas higher employment protection delivers expansionary effects under a tight monetary policy. These findings highlight that the effectiveness of labor market policies is significantly influenced by the monetary policy environment, emphasizing the need for coordinated policy design. Methodologically, we contribute by proposing to average local projections using Mallow's $C_{p}$ criterion, allowing for inferences that are robust to mis-specification and accommodate non-linearities.</description>

      <title>Designing Scientific Grants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12356v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper overviews the economics of scientific grants, focusing on the interplay between the inherent uncertainty in research, researchers' incentives, and grant design. Grants differ from traditional market systems and other science and innovation policy tools, such as prizes and patents. We outline the main economic forces specific to science, noting the limited attention given to grant funding in the economics literature. Using tools from information economics, we identify key incentive problems at various stages of the grant funding process and offer guidance for effective grant design.
  In the allocation stage, funders aim to select the highest-merit applications while minimizing evaluation costs. The selection rule, in turn, impacts researchers' incentives to apply and invest in their proposals. In the grant management stage, funders monitor researchers to ensure efficient use of funds. We discuss the advantages and potential pitfalls of (partial) lotteries and emphasize the effectiveness of staged grant design in promoting a productive use of grants.
  Beyond these broadly applicable insights, our overview highlights the need for further research on grantmaking. Understudied areas include, at the micro level, the interplay of different grant funding stages, and at the macro level, the interaction of grants with other instruments in the market for science.</description>

      <title>Cancellation of principal in banking: Four radical ideas emerge from deep examination of double entry bookkeeping in banking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.10703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2010.10703v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Four radical ideas are presented. First, that the rationale for cancellation of principal can be modified in modern banking. Second, that non-cancellation of loan principal upon payment may cure an old problem of maintenance of positive equity in the non-governmental sector. Third and fourth, that crediting this money to local/state government, and crediting to at-risk loans that create new utility value, creates an additional virtuous monetary circuit that ties finances of government directly to commercial activity.
  Taking these steps can cure a problem I have identified with modern monetary theory, which is that breaking the monetary circuit of taxation in the minds of politicians will free them from centuries of restraint, optimizing their opportunities for implementing tyranny. It maintains and strengthens the current circuit, creating a new, more direct monetary circuit that in some respects combats inequality.</description>

      <title>From Marx's fundamental equalities to the solving of the transformation problem -- Coherence of the model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.09097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.09097v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, V. Laure van Bambeke used an original approach to solve the famous problem of transformation of values into production prices by considering that capital reallocation to each department (branch) was part of the problem. Here, we confirm the validity of this consideration in relation with the satisfaction of demand (social need which is able to pay for the given product). In contrast to V. Laure van Bambeke's method of solving an overdetermined system of equations (implying that compliance with Marx's fundamental equalities could only be approached), we show that the transformation problem is solvable from a determined (two-branch models) or an underdetermined system of equations enabling to obtain exact solutions through an algorithm we provide, with no approximation needed. For systems with three branches or more, the solution of the transformation problem belongs to an infinite ensemble, accounting for the observed high competition-driven market fluidity. Furthermore, we show that the transformation problem is solvable in the absence of fixed capital, supporting that dealing with the latter is not essential and cannot be seen as a potential flaw of the approach. Our algorithm enables simulations illustrating how the transient rise in the rate of profit predicted by the Okishio theorem is consistent with the tendency of the rate of profit to fall (TRPF) subsequent to capital reallocation, and how the TRPF is governed by the increase of organic composition, in value. We establish that the long-standing transformation problem is not such a problem since it is easily solved through our algorithm, whatever the number of branches considered. This emphasizes the high coherence of Marx's conception, and its impressive relevance regarding issues such as the TRPF, which have remained intensely debated.</description>

      <title>Score-Driven Exponential Random Graphs: A New Class of Time-Varying Parameter Models for Dynamical Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.10806</link>
      <description>arXiv:1905.10806v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the increasing abundance of data describing real-world networks that exhibit dynamical features, we propose an extension of the Exponential Random Graph Models (ERGMs) that accommodates the time variation of its parameters. Inspired by the fast-growing literature on Dynamic Conditional Score models, each parameter evolves according to an updating rule driven by the score of the ERGM distribution. We demonstrate the flexibility of score-driven ERGMs (SD-ERGMs) as data-generating processes and filters and show the advantages of the dynamic version over the static one. We discuss two applications to temporal networks from financial and political systems. First, we consider the prediction of future links in the Italian interbank credit network. Second, we show that the SD-ERGM allows discriminating between static or time-varying parameters when used to model the U.S. Congress co-voting network dynamics.</description>

      <title>Do LLM Agents Exhibit Social Behavior?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.15198v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As LLMs increasingly take on roles in human-AI interactions and autonomous AI systems, understanding their social behavior becomes important for informed use and continuous improvement. However, their behaviors in social interactions with humans and other agents, as well as the mechanisms shaping their responses, remain underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce a novel probabilistic framework, State-Understanding-Value-Action (SUVA), to systematically analyze LLM responses in social contexts based on their textual outputs (i.e., utterances). Using canonical behavioral economics games and social preference concepts relatable to LLM users, SUVA assesses LLMs' social behavior through both their final decisions and the response generation processes leading to those decisions. Our analysis of eight LLMs -- including two GPT, four LLaMA, and two Mistral models -- suggests that most models do not generate decisions aligned solely with self-interest; instead, they often produce responses that reflect social welfare considerations and display patterns consistent with direct and indirect reciprocity. Additionally, higher-capacity models more frequently display group identity effects. The SUVA framework also provides explainable tools -- including tree-based visualizations and probabilistic dependency analysis -- to elucidate how factors in LLMs' utterance-based reasoning influence their decisions. We demonstrate that utterance-based reasoning reliably predicts LLMs' final actions; references to altruism, fairness, and cooperation in the reasoning increase the likelihood of prosocial actions, while mentions of self-interest and competition reduce them. Overall, our framework enables practitioners to assess LLMs for applications involving social interactions, and provides researchers with a structured method to interpret how LLM behavior arises from utterance-based reasoning.</description>

      <title>Multi Agent Influence Diagrams for DeFi Governance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.15037v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Decentralized Finance (DeFi) governance models have become increasingly complex due to the involvement of numerous independent agents, each with their own incentives and strategies. To effectively analyze these systems, we propose using Multi Agent Influence Diagrams (MAIDs) as a powerful tool for modeling and studying the strategic interactions within DeFi governance. MAIDs allow for a comprehensive representation of the decision-making processes of various agents, capturing the influence of their actions on one another and on the overall governance outcomes. In this paper, we study a simple governance game that approximates real governance protocols and compute the Nash equilibria using MAIDs. We further outline the structure of a MAID in MakerDAO.</description>
