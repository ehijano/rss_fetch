      <title>Coherence for Pseudo Commutative Monads</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15101v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that the free algebra functor associated to a symmetric, pseudo commutative 2-monad, from the underlying symmetric monoidal 2-category to the 2-category of algebras and pseudo maps over the 2-monad can be enhanced to a multifunctor. Furthermore, we prove that this multifunctor is pseudo symmetric. Our proof implies coherence results for both symmetric and non-symmetric pseudo commutative 2-monads conjectured by Hyland and Power.</description>

      <title>$c$-structures and trace methods beyond connective rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14774v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of a $c$-category, which is a kind of category whose behaviour is controlled by connective ring spectra. More precisely, any $c$-category admits a finite step resolution by categories of compact modules over connective ring spectra. We introduce nilpotent extensions of $c$-categories, and show that they induce isomorphisms on truncating invariants, such as the fiber of the cyclotomic trace map. We show that for many stacks, the category of perfect complexes is naturally a $c$-category and deduce a generalization of the Dundas--Goodwillie--McCarthy theorem to such stacks.</description>

      <title>Integrals for Bialgebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14823v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A well-known result by Larson and Sweedler shows that integrals on a Hopf algebra can be obtained by applying the Structure Theorem for Hopf modules to the rational part of its linear dual. This fact can be rephrased by saying that taking the space of integrals comes from a right adjoint functor from a category of modules to the category of vector spaces. This observation inspired the categorical approach that we advocate in this work, which yields to a new notion of integrals for bialgebras in the linear setting. Despite the novelty of the construction, it returns the classical definition in the presence of an antipode. We test this new concept on bialgebras that satisfy at least one of the following properties: being coseparable as regular module coalgebras, having a one-sided antipode, being commutative, being cocommutative, or being finite-dimensional. One of the main results we obtain in this process is a dual Maschke-type theorem relating coseparability and total integrals. Remarkably, there are cases in which the space of integrals turns out to be isomorphic to that of the associated Hopf envelope. In particular, this space results to be one-dimensional for finite-dimensional bialgebras, providing an existence and uniqueness theorem for integrals in the finite-dimensional case. Furthermore, explicit computations are given for concrete examples including the polynomial bialgebra with one group-like variable, the quantum plane and the coordinate bialgebra of $n$-by-$n$ matrices.</description>

      <title>Tangentads: a formal approach to tangent categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18354v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tangent category theory is a well-established categorical context for differential geometry. In a previous paper, a formal approach was adopted to provide a genuine Grothendieck construction in the context of tangent categories by introducing tangentads. A tangentad is to a tangent category as a formal monad is to a monad of a category. In this paper, we discuss the formal notion of tangentads, construct a $2$-comonad structure on the $2$-functor of tangentads, and introduce Cartesian, adjunctable, and representable tangentads. We also reinterpret the subtangent structure with negatives of a tangent structure as a right Kan extension. Furthermore, we present numerous examples of tangentads, such as tangent (split) restriction categories, tangent fibrations, tangent monads, display tangent categories, and infinitesimal objects. Finally, we employ the formal approach to prove that every tangent monad admits the construction of algebras, provided the underlying monad does, and show that tangent split restriction categories are $2$-equivalent to tangent $\mathscr{M}$-categories.</description>

      <title>$\mathbb{P}^n$-functors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.05740</link>
      <description>arXiv:1905.05740v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a new theory of (non-split) P^n-functors. These are F: A -&gt; B for which the adjunction monad RF is a repeated extension of Id_A by powers of an autoequivalence H and three conditions are satisfied: the monad condition, the adjoints condition, and the highest degree term condition. This unifies and extends the two earlier notions of spherical functors and split P^n-functors. We construct the P-twist of such F and prove it to be an autoequivalence. We then give a criterion for F to be a P^n-functor which is stronger than the definition but much easier to check in practice. It involves only two conditions: the strong monad condition and the weak adjoints condition. For split P^n-functors, we prove Segal's conjecture on their relation to spherical functors. Finally, we give four examples of non-split P^n-functors: spherical functors, extensions by zero, cyclic covers, and family P-twists. For the latter, we show the P-twist to be the derived monodromy of associated Mukai flop, the so-called `flop-flop = twist' formula.</description>
