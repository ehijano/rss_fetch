      <title>The Impact of Foreign Players in the English Premier League: A Mathematical Analys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19285v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We undertake extensive analysis of English Premier League data over the period 2009/10 to 2017/18 to identify and rank key factors affecting the economic and footballing performances of the teams. Alternative end-of-season league tables are generated by re-ranking the teams based on five different descriptors - total expenditure, total funds spent on players, total funds spent on foreign players, the ratio of foreign to British players and the overall profit. The unequal distribution of resources and expenditure between the clubs is analyzed through Lorenz curves. A comparative analysis of the differences between the alternative tables and the conventional end-of-season league table establishes the most likely factors to influence the performances of the teams that we also rank using Principal Component Analysis. We find that the top teams in the league are also those that tend to have the highest expenditure overall, for all players, including foreign players; they also have the highest ratios of foreign to British players. Our statistical and machine learning study also indicates that successful performance on the field may not guarantee healthy profits at the end of the season.</description>

      <title>How Books Tell a History of Statistics in Portugal: Works of Foreigners, Estrangeirados, and Others</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Foreigners and "estrangeirados", an expression meaning "people going to a foreign country ["estrangeiro"] getting there further education", had a leading role in the development of Mathematical Statistics in Portugal. In what concerns Statistics, "estrangeirados" in the nineteenth century were mainly liberal intellectuals exiled for political reasons. From 1930 onwards, the research funding authority sent university professors abroad, and hired foreign researchers to stay in Portuguese institutions, and some of them were instrumental in the importation of new concepts and methods of inferential statistics. After 1970, there was a huge program of sending young researchers abroad for doctoral studies. At the same time, many new universities and polytechnic institutes have been created in Portugal. After that, aside from foreigners who choose to have a research career in those institutions and the "estrangeirados" who had returned and created programs of doctoral studies, others, who hadn't the opportunity of studying abroad, began to play a decisive role in the development of Statistics in Portugal. The publication of handbooks on Probability and Statistics, thesis and core papers in Portuguese scientific journals, and also of works for the layman, reveals how Statistics progressed from descriptive to a mathematical discipline used for inference in all fields of knowledge, from natural sciences to methodology of scientific research.</description>

      <title>Optimal Pre-Analysis Plans: Statistical Decisions Subject to Implementability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.09638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.09638v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: What is the purpose of pre-analysis plans, and how should they be designed? We model the interaction between an agent who analyzes data and a principal who makes a decision based on agent reports. The agent could be the manufacturer of a new drug, and the principal a regulator deciding whether the drug is approved. Or the agent could be a researcher submitting a research paper, and the principal an editor deciding whether it is published. The agent decides which statistics to report to the principal. The principal cannot verify whether the analyst reported selectively. Absent a pre-analysis message, if there are conflicts of interest, then many desirable decision rules cannot be implemented. Allowing the agent to send a message before seeing the data increases the set of decision rules that can be implemented, and allows the principal to leverage agent expertise. The optimal mechanisms that we characterize require pre-analysis plans. Applying these results to hypothesis testing, we show that optimal rejection rules pre-register a valid test, and make worst-case assumptions about unreported statistics. Optimal tests can be found as a solution to a linear-programming problem.</description>

      <title>Structural restrictions in local causal discovery: identifying direct causes of a target variable</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.16048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.16048v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of learning a set of direct causes of a target variable from an observational joint distribution. Learning directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) that represent the causal structure is a fundamental problem in science. Several results are known when the full DAG is identifiable from the distribution, such as assuming a nonlinear Gaussian data-generating process. Here, we are only interested in identifying the direct causes of one target variable (local causal structure), not the full DAG. This allows us to relax the identifiability assumptions and develop possibly faster and more robust algorithms. In contrast to the Invariance Causal Prediction framework, we only assume that we observe one environment without any interventions. We discuss different assumptions for the data-generating process of the target variable under which the set of direct causes is identifiable from the distribution. While doing so, we put essentially no assumptions on the variables other than the target variable. In addition to the novel identifiability results, we provide two practical algorithms for estimating the direct causes from a finite random sample and demonstrate their effectiveness on several benchmark and real datasets.</description>

      <title>Quotient geometry of bounded or fixed rank correlation matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.03126v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper studies the quotient geometry of bounded or fixed-rank correlation matrices. We establish a bijection between the set of bounded-rank correlation matrices and a quotient set of a spherical product manifold by an orthogonal group. We show that it forms an orbit space, whose stratification is determined by the rank of the matrices, and the principal stratum has a compatible Riemannian quotient manifold structure. We show that any minimizing geodesic in the orbit space has constant rank on the interior of the segment. We also develop efficient Riemannian optimization algorithms for computing the distance and weighted the Frechet mean in the orbit space. Moreover, we examine geometric properties of the quotient manifold, including horizontal and vertical spaces, Riemannian metric, injectivity radius, exponential and logarithmic map, curvature, gradient and Hessian. Finally, we apply our approach to a functional connectivity study using the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange.</description>
