      <title>Linearization via Rewriting (Long Version)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the structural resource lambda-calculus, a new formalism in which strongly normalizing terms of the lambda-calculus can naturally be represented, and at the same time any type derivation can be internally rewritten to its linearization. The calculus is shown to be normalizing and confluent. Noticeably, every strongly normalizable lambda-term can be represented by a type derivation. This is the first example of a system where the linearization process takes place internally, while remaining purely finitary and rewrite-based.</description>

      <title>Modular Reasoning about Error Bounds for Concurrent Probabilistic Programs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04512v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present Coneris, the first higher-order concurrent separation logic for reasoning about error probability bounds of higher-order concurrent probabilistic programs with higher-order state. To support modular reasoning about concurrent (non-probabilistic) program modules, state-of-the-art program logics internalize the classic notion of linearizability within the logic through the concept of logical atomicity.
  Coneris extends this idea to probabilistic concurrent program modules. Thus Coneris supports modular reasoning about probabilistic concurrent modules by capturing a novel notion of randomized logical atomicity within the logic. To do so, Coneris utilizes presampling tapes and a novel probabilistic update modality to describe how state is changed probabilistically at linearization points. We demonstrate this approach by means of smaller synthetic examples and larger case studies.
  All of the presented results, including the meta-theory, have been mechanized in the Rocq proof assistant and the Iris separation logic framework</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.00959v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Riemann zeta function, and more generally the L-functions of Dirichlet characters, are among the central objects of study in number theory. We report on a project to formalize the theory of these objects in Lean's "Mathlib" library, including a proof of Dirichlet's theorem on primes in arithmetic progressions and a formal statement of the Riemann hypothesis</description>

      <title>Boolean Algebras as Clones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04430v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Clones are many-sorted algebraic structures abstracting the composition of finitary operations, and play a central role in universal algebra and theoretical computer science. In this paper, we investigate the variety of clones generated by the clone whose only elements are the projections. Inspired by the algebraic studies of conditional statements in programming, we provide an equational axiomatisation of this class of clones, which we call partition clones. We prove that every partition clone is a subdirect product of the clone of projections. Partition clones arise from Boolean algebras via a natural construction, and we show that every partition clone can be actually constructed in this way. Finally, we investigate the algebras associated with partition clones; we prove that they correspond precisely to sets equipped with an action of a Boolean algebra, aligning with a well-known definition due to Bergman.</description>

      <title>Learning Deterministic One-Counter Automata in Polynomial Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04525v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give an active learning algorithm for deterministic one-counter automata (DOCAs) where the learner can ask the teacher membership and minimal equivalence queries. The algorithm called OL* learns a DOCA in time polynomial in the size of the smallest DOCA, recognising the target language.
  All existing algorithms for learning DOCAs, even for the subclasses of deterministic real-time one-counter automata (DROCAs) and visibly one-counter automata (VOCAs), in the worst case, run in exponential time with respect to the size of the DOCA under learning. Furthermore, previous learning algorithms are ``grey-box'' algorithms relying on an additional query type - counter value query - where the teacher returns the counter value reached on reading a given word. In contrast, our algorithm is a ``black-box'' algorithm.
  It is known that the minimisation of VOCAs is NP-hard. However, OL* can be used for approximate minimisation of DOCAs. In this case, the output size is at most polynomial in the size of a minimal DOCA.</description>

      <title>Matrix Factorization for Inferring Associations and Missing Links</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04680v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Missing link prediction is a method for network analysis, with applications in recommender systems, biology, social sciences, cybersecurity, information retrieval, and Artificial Intelligence (AI) reasoning in Knowledge Graphs. Missing link prediction identifies unseen but potentially existing connections in a network by analyzing the observed patterns and relationships. In proliferation detection, this supports efforts to identify and characterize attempts by state and non-state actors to acquire nuclear weapons or associated technology - a notoriously challenging but vital mission for global security. Dimensionality reduction techniques like Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) and Logistic Matrix Factorization (LMF) are effective but require selection of the matrix rank parameter, that is, of the number of hidden features, k, to avoid over/under-fitting. We introduce novel Weighted (WNMFk), Boolean (BNMFk), and Recommender (RNMFk) matrix factorization methods, along with ensemble variants incorporating logistic factorization, for link prediction. Our methods integrate automatic model determination for rank estimation by evaluating stability and accuracy using a modified bootstrap methodology and uncertainty quantification (UQ), assessing prediction reliability under random perturbations. We incorporate Otsu threshold selection and k-means clustering for Boolean matrix factorization, comparing them to coordinate descent-based Boolean thresholding. Our experiments highlight the impact of rank k selection, evaluate model performance under varying test-set sizes, and demonstrate the benefits of UQ for reliable predictions using abstention. We validate our methods on three synthetic datasets (Boolean and uniformly distributed) and benchmark them against LMF and symmetric LMF (symLMF) on five real-world protein-protein interaction networks, showcasing an improved prediction performance.</description>

      <title>Satisfiability of Non-Linear Transcendental Arithmetic as a Certificate Search Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.16582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.16582v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For typical first-order logical theories, satisfying assignments have a straightforward finite representation that can directly serve as a certificate that a given assignment satisfies the given formula. For non-linear real arithmetic augmented with trigonometric and exponential functions (NTA), however, there is no known direct representation of satisfying assignments that allows for a simple independent check of whether the represented numbers exist and satisfy the given formula. Hence, in this paper, we introduce a different form of satisfiability certificate for NTA, and formulate the satisfiability problem as the problem of searching for such a certificate. This does not only ease the independent verification of satisfiability, but also allows the design of new algorithms that show satisfiability by systematically searching for such certificates. Computational experiments document that the resulting algorithms are able to prove satisfiability of a substantially higher number of benchmark problems than existing methods. We also characterize the formulas whose satisfiability can be demonstrated by such a certificate, by providing lower and upper bounds in terms of relevant well-known classes. Finally we show the existence of a procedure for checking the satisfiability of NTA-formulas that terminates for formulas that satisfy certain robustness assumptions.</description>

      <title>Parameterized Model-checking of Discrete-Timed Networks and Symmetric-Broadcast Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.02466v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the complexity of the model-checking problem for parameterized discrete-timed systems with arbitrarily many anonymous and identical processes, with and without a distinguished "controller", and communicating via synchronous rendezvous. Our framework extends the seminal work from German and Sistla on untimed systems by adding discrete-time clocks to processes. For the case without a controller, we show that the systems can be efficiently simulated -- and vice versa -- by systems of untimed processes that communicate via rendezvous and symmetric broadcast, which we call "RB-systems". Symmetric broadcast is a novel communication primitive that allows all processes to synchronize at once; however, it does not distinguish between sending and receiving processes. We show that the parameterized model-checking problem for safety specifications is pspace-complete, and for liveness specifications it is decidable in exptime. The latter result is proved using automata theory, rational linear programming, and geometric reasoning for solving certain reachability questions in a new variant of vector addition systems called "vector rendezvous systems". We believe these proof techniques are of independent interest and will be useful in solving related problems. For the case with a controller, we show that the parameterized model-checking problems for RB-systems and systems with asymmetric broadcast as a primitive are inter-reducible. This allows us to prove that for discrete timed-networks with a controller the parameterized model-checking problem is undecidable for liveness specifications. Our work exploits the intimate connection between parameterized discrete-timed systems and systems of processes communicating via broadcast, providing a rare and surprising decidability result for liveness properties of parameterized timed-systems, as well as extend work from untimed systems to timed systems.</description>

      <title>Descriptive complexity for neural networks via Boolean networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.06277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.06277v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the descriptive complexity of a class of neural networks with unrestricted topologies and piecewise polynomial activation functions. We consider the general scenario where the networks run for an unlimited number of rounds and floating-point numbers are used to simulate reals. We characterize these neural networks with a recursive rule-based logic for Boolean networks. In particular, we show that the sizes of the neural networks and the corresponding Boolean rule formulae are polynomially related. In fact, in the direction from Boolean rules to neural networks, the blow-up is only linear. Our translations result in a time delay, which is the number of rounds that it takes for an object's translation to simulate a single round of the object. In the translation from neural networks to Boolean rules, the time delay of the resulting formula is polylogarithmic in the neural network size. In the converse translation, the time delay of the neural network is linear in the formula size. As a corollary, by restricting our logic, we obtain a similar characterization for classical feedforward neural networks. We also obtain translations between the rule-based logic for Boolean networks, the diamond-free fragment of modal substitution calculus and a class of recursive Boolean circuits where the number of input and output gates match. Ultimately, our translations offer a method of translating a given neural network into an equivalent neural network with different activation functions, including linear activation functions!</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.12113v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a new perspective on deep ReLU networks, namely as circuit counterparts of Lukasiewicz infinite-valued logic -- a many-valued (MV) generalization of Boolean logic. An algorithm for extracting formulae in MV logic from deep ReLU networks is presented. As the algorithm applies to networks with general, in particular also real-valued, weights, it can be used to extract logical formulae from deep ReLU networks trained on data.</description>

      <title>Autoformalizing Natural Language to First-Order Logic: A Case Study in Logical Fallacy Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02318v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Translating natural language into formal language such as First-Order Logic (FOL) is a foundational challenge in NLP with wide-ranging applications in automated reasoning, misinformation tracking, and knowledge validation. In this paper, we introduce Natural Language to First-Order Logic (NL2FOL), a framework to autoformalize natural language to FOL step by step using Large Language Models (LLMs). Our approach addresses key challenges in this translation process, including the integration of implicit background knowledge. By leveraging structured representations generated by NL2FOL, we use Satisfiability Modulo Theory (SMT) solvers to reason about the logical validity of natural language statements. We present logical fallacy detection as a case study to evaluate the efficacy of NL2FOL. Being neurosymbolic, our approach also provides interpretable insights into the reasoning process and demonstrates robustness without requiring model fine-tuning or labeled training data. Our framework achieves strong performance on multiple datasets. On the LOGIC dataset, NL2FOL achieves an F1-score of 78%, while generalizing effectively to the LOGICCLIMATE dataset with an F1-score of 80%.</description>

      <title>Generalized Hostadter functions G, H and beyond: numeration systems and discrepancy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12615v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hofstadter's G function is recursively defined via $G(0)=0$ and then $G(n)=n-G(G(n-1))$. Following Hofstadter, a family $(F_k)$ of similar functions is obtained by varying the number $k$ of nested recursive calls in this equation. We study here some Fibonacci-like sequences that are deeply connected with these functions $F_k$. In particular, the Zeckendorf theorem can be adapted to provide digital expansions via sums of terms of these sequences. On these digital expansions, the functions $F_k$ are acting as right shifts of the digits. These Fibonacci-like sequences can be expressed in terms of zeros of the polynomial $X^k{-}X^{k-1}{-}1$. Considering now the discrepancy of each function $F_k$, i.e., the maximal distance between $F_k$ and its linear equivalent, we retrieve the fact that this discrepancy is finite exactly when $k \le 4$. Thanks to that, we solve two twenty-year-old OEIS conjectures stating how close the functions $F_3$ and $F_4$ are from the integer parts of their linear equivalents. Moreover we establish that $F_k$ can coincide exactly with such an integer part only when $k\le 2$, while $F_k$ is almost additive exactly when $k \le 4$. Finally, a nice fractal shape a la Rauzy has been encountered when investigating the discrepancy of $F_3$. Almost all this article has been formalized and verified in the Coq/Rocq proof assistant.</description>
