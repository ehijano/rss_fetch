      <title>The trace distance between density matrices, a nifty tool in new-physics searches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum information methods have been brought to bear on high-energy physics, including the study of entanglement and Bell nonlocality in collider experiments. Quantum information observables have also been employed to constrain possible new physics effects. We improve on this point by introducing quantum information tools routinely used to compare quantum states: the trace distance and the fidelity. We find that the former outperforms other quantum information observables considered in the literature and, together with the cross section, yields the strongest bounds on possible departures from the Standard Model. The power of the proposed methodology is demonstrated with three examples of new physics searches. The first concerns the chromomagnetic dipole moment of the top quark and yields the first bound computed by means of quantum tomography and actual experimental data. The other two examples use Monte Carlo simulations and set the projected limits on the anomalous couplings of the $\tau$ leptons at Belle and at a future collider, which is taken to be LEP3. For these new physics searches we also compare the sensitivity of the trace distance to those of other quantum information quantities like concurrence, magic, and the fidelity distance. In passing, we provide the first determinations of magic in colliders data by analyzing the top-quark pair production at the LHC and the charmonium decays. The significance is well above the $5\sigma$ level in both the cases.</description>

      <title>Neutrino energy and momentum emission from magnetized dense quark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03318v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using first-principles field-theoretic methods, we investigate neutrino emission from strongly magnetized dense quark matter under conditions relevant to compact stars. We develop a customized approximation that fully accounts for the Landau-level quantization of electron states while neglecting such quantization for quarks. This approach is well-justified in dense quark matter, where the chemical potentials of up and down quarks significantly exceed those of electrons. Our analysis provides a detailed exploration of the influence of strong magnetic fields on neutrino emission, including both the modification of the total emission rate and the emergence of emission asymmetry relative to the magnetic field direction. We further examine the role of temperature in smoothing the oscillatory behavior of neutrino emission as a function of magnetic field strength. Additionally, we study the interplay between the Landau-level quantization of electrons and the Fermi-liquid effects of quarks in modifying the phase space of relevant weak processes. Finally, we briefly discuss the broader implications of magnetic fields on stellar cooling processes and the potential contribution of asymmetric neutrino emission to pulsar kicks.</description>

      <title>Bell Inequality Violation of Light Quarks in Back-to-Back Dihadron Pair Production at Lepton Colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin correlations between particles produced at colliders provide valuable insights for quantum information studies. While traditional studies of quantum information at colliders are typically limited to massive particles with perturbative decay, we propose an innovative method to explore the Bell inequality in massless quark pair systems by analyzing the azimuthal correlations in back-to-back $\pi^+\pi^-$ dihadron pair production at lepton colliders. Revisiting the Belle data, we have shown the potential to detect Bell inequality violation of light quarks by introducing an additional angular cut, achieving a significance of 2.5 $\sigma$ even in the worst-case scenario of 100% correlated systematic uncertainties in each bins. The significance substantially exceeds $5\sigma$ when considering uncorrelated systematic uncertainties. Our approach opens avenues for exploring spin quantum information in the non-perturbative aspect and leverages existing data for quantum information research.</description>

      <title>Complementarity between Cosmic String Gravitational Waves and long lived particle searches in laboratory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03326v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cosmic strings are powerful witnesses to cosmic events including any period of early matter domination. If such a period of matter domination was catalysed by metastable, long-lived particles, then there will be complementary signals to ascertain the nature of dark sector in experiments detecting primordial features in the gravitational wave (GW) power spectrum and laboratory searches for long-lived particles. We give explicit examples of global and local U(1) gauge extended dark sectors to demonstrate such a complementarity as the union of the two experiments reveals more information about the dark sector than either experiment. Demanding that Higgs-portal long-lived scalar be looked for, in various experiments such as DUNE, FASER, FASER-II, MATHUSLA, SHiP, we identify the parameter space which leads to complementary observables for GW detectors such as LISA and ET.</description>

      <title>Effective field theories for dark matter pairs in the early universe: Debye mass effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03327v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In some scenarios for the early universe, non-relativistic thermal dark matter chemically decouples from the thermal environment once the temperature drops below the Hubble rate. The value at which the energy density freezes out depends on the underlying model. In a simple setting, we provide a comprehensive study of heavy fermionic dark matter interacting with the light degrees of freedom of a dark thermal sector whose temperature $T$ decreases from an initial value close to the freeze-out temperature. Different temperatures imply different hierarchies of energy scales. By exploiting the methods of non-relativistic effective field theories at finite $T$, we systematically determine the thermal and in-vacuum interaction rates. In particular, we address the impact of the Debye mass on the observables and ultimately on the dark matter relic abundance. We numerically compare the corrections to the present energy density originating from the resummation of Debye mass effects with the corrections coming from a next-to-leading order treatment of the bath-particle interactions. We observe that the fixed-order calculation of the inelastic heavy-light scattering at high temperatures provides a larger dark matter depletion, and hence an undersized yield for given benchmark points in the parameter space, with respect to the calculation where Debye mass effects are resummed.</description>

      <title>Rapidity asymmetry of jet-hadron correlation as a robust signal of diffusion wake induced by di-jets in high-energy heavy-ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03419v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The diffusion wake accompanying a Mach cone is a unique feature of the medium response to jet-medium interaction inside the quark-gluon plasma in high-energy heavy-ion collisions. It leads to a depletion of soft hadrons in the opposite direction of the propagating jet as recently observed in $Z$-jet events of Pb+Pb collisions at LHC. In di-jet events, however, the diffusion wake of one jet usually overlaps with the medium-induced hadron enhancement of other jet with no clear signal of the diffusion wake except a reduction of the hadron enhancement, unless there is a large rapidity gap between the two jets. We propose to use the rapidity asymmetry of jet-hadron correlations in di-jets with a finite rapidity gap relative to that without, as a robust signal of the diffusion wake. The asymmetry emerges because the diffusion wake of one jet is shifted to a finite rapidity relative to the other jet. This shift leads to a depletion of soft hadrons in the rapidity region of the diffusion wake and an enhancement in the rapidity region of the other jet whose soft hadron enhancement is no longer or less reduced by the diffusion wake as in di-jets without a rapidity gap. We predict the rapidity asymmetry using both theoretical and mixed-event background subtraction for different values of the rapidity gap within the CoLBT-hydro model. Experimental measurements of this rapidity asymmetry with high statistics data on di-jets should provide more precise insights into the jet-induced diffusion wake and properties of the quark-gluon plasma.</description>

      <title>Right-handed weak currents in neutrinoless $\beta \beta $ decays and ton scale $\beta\beta$ detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03454v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Right handed weak currents (RHCs) in the left-right (L-R) symmetric model are examined in neutrinoless double beta decays ($0\nu$ DBDs) of both $0^+ \to 0^+$ and $0^+ \to 2^+$ transitions. The structures of the nuclear matrix elements (NMEs) of $\langle m\rangle$, $\langle\lambda\rangle$ and $\langle\eta\rangle$ terms are studied in detail for these two transitions. In case of $0^+ \to 0^+$ transition, the enhancement mechanisms of the $\langle\eta\rangle$ term over the $\langle\lambda\rangle$ term are shown. The $\Delta$ isobar contribution to the NME for the transition to the $2^+$ state is evaluated to be of the order of 10-20% of the NME. Measurements of both $\beta\beta $ and $\gamma$ rays associated with $0\nu$ DBDs by means of the ton-scale DBD detectors under construction are used to study the effective RHCs around $\langle\lambda\rangle \approx 10^{-7}$ and $\langle\eta\rangle \approx 10^{-10}$. These values depend on the phase space and the NME with the effective weak coupling of $g_{\rm A}^{eff}$.</description>

      <title>Strange mesons with one dynamical gluon: A light-front approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We obtain the mass spectra of strange mesons using a light-front quantized Hamiltonian with Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) input, incorporating quark-antiquark and quark-antiquark-gluon Fock components, along with a three-dimensional confinement. We work within the basis light-front quantization framework. The resulting eigenvectors can simultaneously describe the kaon's electromagnetic form factor, decay constant, distribution amplitude, and quark and gluon distribution functions under QCD scale evolution. Using the obtained kaon parton distribution functions (PDFs), supplemented by established nuclear PDFs, we also predict the kaon-nucleus-induced Drell-Yan cross section, which is expected to be measured soon by COMPASS++/AMBER at CERN.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the inner structure of the pion first excited state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By capturing the characteristics of the Bethe-Salpeter amplitude for the pion excitation state, we construct an algebraic model to provide the overall features of the pion first excitation state parton distribution amplitude and distribution function. We find that, at the hadronic scale, the distribution amplitude of the excited state exhibits nodes, while the distribution function is unimodal, with a peak at $x=1/2$ and distinct concave and convex fluctuations in the valence region. These findings provide new insights into the partonic structure of excited mesons and contribute significantly to our understanding of hadronic excitations.</description>

      <title>Study of some properties of deconfined matter: Resummed perturbation theory and beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03604v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The present thesis is devoted to the study of some of the features of the deconfined state of matter dubbed Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP). The different properties of the extreme matter that have been studied in this thesis are next-to-leading order dispersion properties for soft-moving quarks, screening masses of mesons, drag and diffusion properties of heavy quarks, the specific shear viscosity of QGP and energy loss of heavy quarks propagating in QGP background. The theoretical techniques which are utilized in order to study these properties are mainly hard thermal loop effective theory, which is required when one is interested in studying the soft scale physics of the underlined theory QCD at finite temperatures, and the other techniques, which are utilized here is the nonperturbative resummation approach dubbed as Gribov quantization. This nonperturbative resummation deals with the magnetic scale of the theory through the Gribov mass parameter.</description>

      <title>McMule -- a Monte Carlo generator for low energy processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03703v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: McMule, a Monte Carlo for MUons and other LEptons, implements many major QED processes at NNLO (eg. $ee\to ee$, $e\mu\to e\mu$, $ee\to\mu\mu$, $\ell p\to\ell p$, $\mu\to\nu\bar\nu e$) including effects from the lepton masses, making it suitable for predictions for low-energy experiments such as MUonE, CMD-III, PRad, or MUSE. Recently, McMule gained the ability to generate events at NNLO rather than just pre-defined differential distributions. To avoid negative event weights, it employs cellular resampling directly as part of the generation step which further reduces the fraction of negative weights.</description>

      <title>Additional evidence of a new 690 GeV scalar resonance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03708v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An alternative to the idea of a metastable electroweak vacuum would be an initial restriction to the pure scalar sector of the Standard Model, but describing spontaneous symmetry breaking consistently with studies indicating that there are two different mass scales in the problem: a mass scale $M_H$ associated with the zero-point energy and a mass scale $m_h$ defined by the quadratic shape of the potential at its minimum. Therefore, differently from perturbation theory where these two mass scales coincide, the Higgs field could exhibit a second resonance with mass $(M_H)^{\rm Theor} = 690\,(30)$ GeV. This stabilises the potential, but the heavy Higgs $H$ would couple to longitudinal $W$s with the same typical strength as the low-mass state with $m_h=125$ GeV and so would still remain a relatively narrow resonance.
  While interesting signals from LHC experiments were previously pointed out, we have now enlarged our data sample, sharpened the analysis of some final states, and noted correlations between different channels that point directly to such a second resonance. The combined statistical evidence, even if roughly estimated, is thus so large that the observed deviations from the background cannot represent statistical fluctuations.</description>

      <title>Reinvestigating the semileptonic $B\to D^{(\ast)}\tau\bar{\nu}_{\tau}$ decays in the model independent scenarios and leptoquark models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03734v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we revisit the possible new physics (NP) solutions by analyzing the observables associated with $B\to D^{(\ast)}\tau\bar{\nu}_{\tau}$ decays. To explore the structure of new physics, the form factors of $B\to D^{(\ast)}$ decays play a crucial role. In this study, we utilize the form factor results obtained from a simultaneous fit to Belle data and lattice QCD calculations. Using these form factors, we conduct a global fit of the new physics Wilson coefficients, incorporating the most recent experimental data. Additionally, we use the form factors and Wilson coefficients to make predictions for physical observables, including the lepton flavor universality ratio $R_{D^{(\ast)}}$, polarized observables, and the normalized angular coefficients $\langle I\rangle$'s related to the four-fold decays $B\to D^{\ast}(\to D\pi, D\gamma)\tau\bar{\nu}_{\tau}$. These predictions are calculated in both model-independent scenarios and for three different leptoquark models.</description>

      <title>Effective textures from a $[SU(3)]^3$ flavored scalar sector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03872v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current constraints on flavor-changing neutral currents (FCNCs) strongly indicate that any new physics emerging at the 1-10 TeV scale must adhere to the Minimal Flavor Violation (MFV) principle, where Yukawa couplings are the sole sources of flavor violation. In this work, we present a model inspired by a gauged $SU(3)$ flavor symmetry that dynamically generates leptonic Yukawa matrices through effective operators. The model incorporates a scalar sector with two sets of flavons, characterized by their vacuum expectation values (VEVs), which govern the suppression scale of the Yukawa couplings and the hierarchy of neutrino masses. By leveraging phenomenologically viable Yukawa textures, we derive restrictions on the flavon VEVs and demonstrate the compatibility of the model with experimental neutrino oscillation data. Furthermore, the model predicts at least one neutrino mass to be strongly suppressed, consistent with the normal mass ordering and experimental upper bounds. This framework provides a robust mechanism for dynamically generating neutrino masses and mixing while addressing key challenges in leptonic flavor physics, such as FCNC suppression and CP-violating phases.</description>

      <title>Cosmological Perturbation Theory with Trinity of Scalar Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02991v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper explicitly develops the three-field cosmological perturbation theory with a flat field space. We solve the background and perturbation equations numerically for three different cases. First, to check the consistency of the three-field formalism, we investigate an effective two-field model motivated by the two-block case of the multi-giant vacua matrix Inflation model. Then we investigate a completely three-field case without any direct interaction between different fields, and finally, a three-field case containing direct interactions. The power spectra of the curvature perturbations in all cases are computed numerically, and the effects of rapid turn in the power spectrum are highlighted.</description>

      <title>Mixture-of-Experts Graph Transformers for Interpretable Particle Collision Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03432v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Large Hadron Collider at CERN produces immense volumes of complex data from high-energy particle collisions, demanding sophisticated analytical techniques for effective interpretation. Neural Networks, including Graph Neural Networks, have shown promise in tasks such as event classification and object identification by representing collisions as graphs. However, while Graph Neural Networks excel in predictive accuracy, their "black box" nature often limits their interpretability, making it difficult to trust their decision-making processes. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that combines a Graph Transformer model with Mixture-of-Expert layers to achieve high predictive performance while embedding interpretability into the architecture. By leveraging attention maps and expert specialization, the model offers insights into its internal decision-making, linking predictions to physics-informed features. We evaluate the model on simulated events from the ATLAS experiment, focusing on distinguishing rare Supersymmetric signal events from Standard Model background. Our results highlight that the model achieves competitive classification accuracy while providing interpretable outputs that align with known physics, demonstrating its potential as a robust and transparent tool for high-energy physics data analysis. This approach underscores the importance of explainability in machine learning methods applied to high energy physics, offering a path toward greater trust in AI-driven discoveries.</description>

      <title>Is excess smoothing of Planck CMB ansiotropy data partially responsible for evidence for dark energy dynamics in other $w(z)$CDM parametrizations?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03480v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study spatially-flat dynamical dark energy parametrizations, $w(z)$CDM, with redshift-dependent dark energy equation of state parameter $w(z)$ expressed using three different quadratic and other polynomial forms (as functions of $1-a$, where $a$ is the scale factor), without and with a varying cosmic microwave background (CMB) lensing consistency parameter $A_L$. We use Planck CMB anisotropy data (P18 and lensing) and a large, mutually-consistent non-CMB data compilation that includes Pantheon+ type Ia supernova, baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO), Hubble parameter ($H(z)$), and growth factor ($f\sigma_8$) measurements, but not recent DESI BAO data. The six $w(z)$CDM ($+A_L$) parametrizations show higher consistency between the CMB and non-CMB data constraints compared to the XCDM ($+A_L$) and $w_0 w_a$CDM ($+A_L$) cases. Constraints from the most-restrictive P18+lensing+non-CMB data compilation on the six $w(z)$CDM ($+A_L$) parametrizations indicate that dark energy dynamics is favored over a cosmological constant by $\gtrsim 2\sigma$ when $A_L = 1$, but only by $\gtrsim 1\sigma$ when $A_L$ is allowed to vary (and $A_L&gt;1$ at $\sim2\sigma$ significance). Non-CMB data dominate the P18+lensing+non-CMB compilation at low $z$ and favor quintessence-like dark energy. At high $z$ P18+lensing data dominate, favoring phantom-like dark energy with significance from $1.5\sigma$ to $2.9 \sigma$ when $A_L = 1$, and from $1.1\sigma$ to $1.8\sigma$ when $A_L$ varies. These results suggest that the observed excess weak lensing smoothing of some of the Planck CMB anistropy multipoles is partially responsible for the $A_L = 1$ cases $\gtrsim 2\sigma$ evidence for dark energy dynamics over a cosmological constant.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.03509v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present quark number susceptibilities and conserved charge fluctuations for (2+1)-flavor QCD using M\"obius Domain Wall fermions with a pion mass of \(135~\rm{MeV}\). Our results are compared with hadron resonance gas models below the QCD transition temperature and with \(\mathcal{O}(g^2)\) perturbation theory at high temperatures. Additionally, we compare our findings with results from staggered fermion discretizations. Furthermore, we also present results of leading order Kurtosis of electric charge and strangeness fluctuations.</description>

      <title>The Gallium Solar Neutrino Capture Cross Section Revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03528v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Solar neutrino flux constraints from the legacy GALLEX/GNO and SAGE experiments continue to influence contemporary global analyses of neutrino properties. The constraints depend on the neutrino absorption cross sections for various solar sources. Following recent work updating the $^{51}$Cr and $^{37}$Ar neutrino source cross sections, we reevaluate the $^{71}$Ga solar neutrino cross sections, focusing on contributions from transitions to $^{71}$Ge excited states, but also revising the ground-state transition to take into account new $^{71}$Ge electron-capture lifetime measurements and various theory corrections. The excited-state contributions have been traditionally taken from forward-angle $(p,n)$ cross sections. Here we correct this procedure for the $\approx 10\%-20\%$ tensor operator contribution that alters the relationship between Gamow-Teller and $(p,n)$ transition strengths. Using state-of-the-art nuclear shell-model calculations to evaluate this correction, we find that it lowers the $^8$B and hep neutrino cross sections. However, the addition of other corrections, including contributions from near-threshold continuum states that radiatively decay, leads to an overall increase in the $^8$B and hep cross sections of $\approx 10\%$ relative to the values recommended by Bahcall. Uncertainties are propagated using Monte Carlo simulations.</description>

      <title>Potential search for direct slepton pair production in $\sqrt{s}$ = 360 GeV at CEPC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03600v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The center-of-mass energy of Circular Electron Positron Collider (CEPC) could be upgrade to 360 GeV level (CEPC@360GeV) after its ten-year running at 240 GeV. Besides SM precision measurements, CEPC@360GeV also has good potential for BSM physics searches, which is a good complementary for hadron colliders. This paper presents the sensitivity study of direct stau and smuon pair production at CEPC with $\sqrt{s}$ = 360 GeV by full Monte Carlo (MC) simulation. With 1.0 ab$^{-1}$ integrated luminosity and the assumption of flat 5% systematic uncertainty, the CEPC@360 GeV has the potential to discover the production of combined left-handed and right-handed stau up to 168.5 GeV if exists, or up to 159 GeV for the production of pure left-handed or right-handed stau; the discovery potential of direct smuon reaches up to 175 GeV with the same assumption.</description>

      <title>Determining the Duration of the Hadronic Stage at RHIC-BES Energies via Resonance Suppression Using a Full Set of Rate Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03893v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present realistic estimates for the duration of the hadronic stage in central Au+Au reactions in the RHIC-BES energy regime. To this aim, we employ a full set of coupled rate equations to describe the time evolution of the system from chemical to kinetic freeze-out. Combined with the recently measured data by the STAR collaboration on $K^*/K$ ratios, we show that the previous estimates substantially underestimated the duration of this stage due to the omission of the regeneration of hadron resonances. We provide an improved relation between the $K^*/K$ ratio at chemical and kinetic freeze-out and the life time of the hadronic phase. The calculated improved life times are now in line with estimates from other methods and are relevant for the NA61 and STAR collaborations and for upcoming experiments at the FAIR facility.</description>

      <title>Deep observations of the Type IIB flux landscape</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03984v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present deep observations in targeted regions of the string landscape through a combination of analytic and dedicated numerical methods. Specifically, we devise an algorithm designed for the systematic construction of Type IIB flux vacua in finite regions of moduli space. Our algorithm is universally applicable across Calabi-Yau orientifold compactifications and can be used to enumerate flux vacua in a region given sufficient computational efforts. As a concrete example, we apply our methods to a two-modulus Calabi-Yau threefold, demonstrating that systematic enumeration is feasible and revealing intricate structures in vacuum distributions. Our results highlight local deviations from statistical expectations, providing insights into vacuum densities, superpotential distributions, and moduli mass hierarchies. This approach opens pathways for precise, data-driven mappings of the string landscape, complementing analytic studies and advancing the understanding of the distribution of flux vacua. This allows us to obtain different types of solutions with hierarchical suppressions, e.g.~vacua with small values of the Gukov-Vafa-Witten superpotential $|W_0|$. We find an example with $|W_0| = 5.547 \times 10^{-5}$ at large complex structure, without light directions and the use of non-perturbative effects.</description>

Abstract: We perform the first simultaneous dispersive analysis of the $B\to K$, $B\to K^*$, and $B_s\to \phi$ form factors. By means of an improved parametrization, we take into account the form factors' below-threshold branch cuts arising from on-shell $\bar{B}_s \pi^0$ and $\bar{B}_s \pi^0 \pi^0$ states, which so far have been ignored in the literature. In this way, we eliminate a source of hard-to-quantify systematic uncertainties. We provide machine-readable files to obtain the full set of the $\bar{B}\to \bar{K}^{(*)}$ and $\bar{B}_s\to \phi$ form factors in and beyond the entire semileptonic phase space.</description>

      <title>Mapping and Probing Froggatt-Nielsen Solutions to the Quark Flavor Puzzle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.08026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.08026v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Froggatt-Nielsen (FN) mechanism is an elegant solution to the flavor problem. In its minimal application to the quark sector, the different quark types and generations have different charges under a $U(1)_X$ flavor symmetry. The SM Yukawa couplings are generated below the flavor breaking scale with hierarchies dictated by the quark charge assignments. Only a handful of charge assignments are generally considered in the literature. We analyze the complete space of possible charge assignments with $|X_{q_i}| \leq 4$ and perform both a set of Bayesian-inspired numerical scans and an analytical spurion analysis to identify those charge assignments that reliably generate SM-like quark mass and mixing hierarchies. The resulting set of top-20 flavor charge assignments significantly enlarges the viable space of FN models but is still compact enough to enable focused phenomenological study. We then apply our numerical methodology to demonstrate that these distinct charge assignments result in the generation of correlated flavor-violating four-quark operators characterized by significantly varied strengths, potentially differing substantially from the possibilities previously explored in the literature. Future precision measurement of $\Delta F =2 $ observables, along with increasingly accurate SM predictions, may therefore enable us to distinguish among otherwise equally plausible FN charges, thus shedding light on the UV structure of the flavor sector.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02097v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By investigating the soft gluon radiation in the $J/\psi$ plus jet photoproduction at the electron-ion collider (EIC), we demonstrate that the azimuthal angular correlations between the leading jet and heavy quarkonium provide a unique probe to the production mechanism of the latter. In particular, a significant $\cos(\phi)$ asymmetry is found for the color-singlet channel, whereas it vanishes or has an opposite sign for color-octet production, depending on the jet transverse momentum. Numerical results of $\cos(\phi)$ and $\cos(2\phi)$ asymmetries employing both the color-singlet model and the nonrelativistic QCD approach are presented for typical kinematics at the future EIC.</description>

      <title>Self-Interacting Dark Sectors in Supernovae Can Behave as a Relativistic Fluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07714v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit supernova (SN) bounds on a hidden sector consisting of millicharged particles $\chi$ and a massless dark photon. Unless the self-coupling is fine-tuned to be small, rather than exiting the SN core as a gas, the particles form a relativistic fluid and subsequent dark QED fireball, streaming out against the drag due to the interaction with matter. Novel bounds due to excessive energy deposition in the mantle of low-energy SNe can be obtained. The cooling bounds from SN 1987A are unexpectedly not affected in the free-streaming regime. The inclusion of $\chi\bar{\chi}\rightarrow \rm SM$ substantially modifies the constraints in the trapping regime, which can only be treated hydrodynamically. Our results can be adapted to generic sub-GeV self-interacting dark sectors.</description>

      <title>Distinguishing charged lepton flavor violation scenarios with inelastic $\mu\rightarrow e$ conversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17166v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Mu2e and COMET experiments are expected to improve existing limits on charged lepton flavor violation (CLFV) by roughly four orders of magnitude. $\mu\rightarrow e$ conversion experiments are typically optimized for electrons produced without nuclear excitation, as this maximizes the electron energy and minimizes backgrounds from the free decay of the muon. Here we argue that Mu2e and COMET will be able to extract additional constraints on CLFV from inelastic $\mu \rightarrow e$ conversion, given the $^{27}$Al target they have chosen and backgrounds they anticipate. We describe CLFV scenarios in which inelastic CLFV can induce measurable distortions in the near-endpoint spectrum of conversion electrons, including cases where certain contributing operators cannot be probed in elastic $\mu \rightarrow e$ conversion. We extend the nonrelativistic EFT treatment of elastic $\mu \rightarrow e$ conversion to include the new nuclear operators needed for the inelastic process, evaluate the associated nuclear response functions, and describe several new-physics scenarios where the inelastic process can provide additional information on CLFV.</description>

      <title>Classical Casimir pressure in the presence of axion dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18710v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the effects of an oscillating axion field on the pressure between two metallic plates. We consider the situation where a magnetic field parallel to the plates is present and show that the electric field induced by the coupling of the axion to photons leads to resonances. When the boundary plates are perfect conductors, the resonances are infinitely thin whilst they are broadened when the conductivity of the boundary plates is taken into account. The resonances take place at the tower of distances close to dn = (2n+1){\pi}/m where m is the axion mass and have a finite width and height depending on the conductivity. The resulting resonant pressure on the plate depends on the induced polarisation at the surface of the plates. We investigate the reach of future Casimir experiments in terms of the axion mass and the conductivity of the boundary plates. We find that for large enough conductivities, the axion-induced pressure could be larger than the quantum Casimir effect between the plates.</description>

      <title>ALP-ine quests at the LHC: hunting axion-like particles via peaks and dips in $t \bar{t}$ production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19014v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an analysis of the sensitivity of current and future LHC searches for new spin-0 particles in top-anti-top-quark ($t\bar{t}$) final states, focusing on generic axion-like particles (ALPs) that are coupled to top quarks and gluons. As a first step, we derive new limits on the effective ALP Lagrangian in terms of the Wilson coefficients $c_t$ and $c_{\tilde{G}}$ based on the results of the CMS search using $35.9$ fb$^{-1}$ of data, collected at $\sqrt{s} = 13$ TeV. We then investigate how the production of an ALP with generic couplings to gluons and top quarks can be distinguished from the production of a pseudoscalar which couples to gluons exclusively via a top-quark loop. To this end, we make use of the invariant $t\bar{t}$ mass distribution and angular correlations that are sensitive to the $t\bar{t}$ spin correlation. Using a mass of 400 GeV as an example, we find that already the data collected during Run 2 and Run 3 of the LHC provides an interesting sensitivity to the underlying nature of a possible new particle. We also analyze the prospects for data anticipated to be collected during the high-luminosity phase of the LHC. Finally, we compare the limits obtained from the $t \bar t$ searches to existing experimental bounds from LHC searches for narrow di-photon resonances, from measurements of the production of four top quarks, and from global analyses of ALP-SMEFT interference effects.</description>

      <title>Relic Neutrino Background from Cosmic-Ray Reservoirs</title>

Abstract: We compute the flux of relic neutrino background (R$\nu$B) up-scattered by ultra-high-energy (UHE) cosmic rays (CRs) in clusters that act as CR-reservoirs. The long trapping times of UHECRs make this flux larger than that of R$\nu$B up-scattered by UHECRs on their way to Earth, which we also compute. We find that IceCube excludes R$\nu$B weighted overdensities larger than $10^{10}$ in clusters, and that PUEO, RNO-G, GRAND and IceCube-Gen2 will test values down to $10^{8}$. Our treatment incorporates the momentum transfer dependence of the neutrino-nucleus cross section, deep inelastic scattering, a mixed UHECR composition, and flavour information on the up-scattered R$\nu$B fluxes for both cases of neutrino mass spectrum with normal and inverted ordering, providing new handles to possibly disentangle the up-scattered R$\nu$B from cosmogenic neutrinos.</description>

      <title>Theory of neutrino fast flavor evolution. Part II. Solutions at the edge of instability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17232v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In dense neutrino environments, such as provided by core-collapse supernovae or neutron-star mergers, neutrino angular distributions may be unstable to collective flavor conversions, whose outcome remains to be fully understood. These conversions are much faster than hydrodynamical scales, suggesting that self-consistent configurations may never be strongly unstable. With this motivation in mind, we study weakly unstable modes, i.e., those with small growth rates. We show that our newly developed dispersion relation (Paper~I of this series) allows for an expansion in powers of the small growth rate. For weakly unstable distributions, we show that the unstable modes must either move with subluminal phase velocity, or very close to the speed of light. The instability is fed from neutrinos moving resonantly with the waves, allowing us to derive explicit expressions for the growth rate. For axisymmetric distributions, often assumed in the literature, numerical examples show the accuracy of these expressions. We also note that for the often-studied one-dimensional systems one should not forget the axial-symmetry-breaking modes, and we provide explicit expressions for the range of wavenumbers that exhibit instabilities.</description>

      <title>Hadronic Weak Decays of Charmed Baryons in the Topological Diagrammatic Approach: An Update</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04675v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There exist two distinct ways in realizing the approximate SU(3) flavor symmetry of QCD to describe the two-body nonleptonic decays of charmed baryons: the irreducible SU(3) approach (IRA) and the topological diagram approach (TDA). The TDA has the advantage that it is more intuitive, graphic and easier to implement model calculations. We perform a global fit to the currently available data of two-body charmed baryon decays within the framework of the TDA and IRA. The number of the minimum set of tensor invariants in the IRA and the topological amplitudes in the TDA is the same, namely, five in the tree-induced amplitudes and four in the penguin amplitudes. Since we employ the new LHCb measurements to fix the sign ambiguity of the decay parameters $\beta$ and $\gamma$, the fit results for the magnitudes of $S$- and $P$-wave amplitudes and their phase shift $\delta_P-\delta_S$ in both the TDA and IRA are more trustworthy than our previous analyses with uncertainties substantially improved. These results can be tested in the near future. The perspective of having direct {\it CP} violation in the charmed baryon sector at the per mille level is briefly discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.16536v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The formation of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) at high red shift $z$ by ultralight axion dark matter (DM) is discussed in the general relativistic framework. The critical condition of collapsing of self-attracting DM in non-relativistic treatment corresponds to dust particle, which allows to estimate the time scale of the SMBH formation and the its length scale in the general relativistic framework. It gives the support of ultralight axion model based on the string model as the origins of the early universe SMBH and the Little Red Dots (LRDs) etc. observed by JWST.</description>

      <title>Scaling density of axion strings in terasite simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18064v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report on a study of axion string networks using fixed-grid simulations of up to $16384$ points per side. The length of string can be characterised in terms of standard dimensionless parameters $\zeta_\text{w}$ and $\zeta_\text{r}$, the length density measured in the cosmic rest frame and the string rest frame, scaled with the cosmic time. The motion of the string can be characterised by the root-mean-square (RMS) velocity of the string. Starting from a range of initial length densities and velocities, we analyse the string network in the standard scaling framework and find evolution towards a fixed point with estimated values $\hat{\zeta}_{\text{w},*} = 1.220(57)$ and $\hat{\zeta}_{\text{r},*} = 1.491(93)$. The two measures are related by the RMS velocity, which we estimate to be $\hat{v}_{*} = 0.5705(93)$. The length density is consistent with previous measurements, while the velocity is about 5% lower. For simulations starting from low enough density, the length density parameters $\zeta_\text{w}$ and $\zeta_\text{r}$ remain below their fixed point values throughout, while growing slowly, giving rise to an impression of approximately logarithmic increase with time. This has been proposed as the true long-term behaviour. We find that the growth tends to slow down as the values of $\zeta_\text{w}$ and $\zeta_\text{r}$ identified as fixed points are approached. In the case of $\zeta_\text{r}$, the growth stops for simulations which started close to the fixed point length density. The difference between $\zeta_\text{w}$ and $\zeta_\text{r}$ can be understood to result from the continuing velocity evolution. Our results indicate that the growth of $\zeta_\text{w}$ is a transient appearing at low densities and while the velocity is converging. This highlights the importance of studying the string density and the velocity together, and the preparation of initial conditions.</description>

      <title>Back to the phase space: thermal axion dark radiation via couplings to standard model fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21253v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the cosmological consequences of axion interactions with standard model fermions accurately and precisely. Our analysis is entirely based on a phase space framework that allows us to keep track of the axion distribution in momentum space across the entire expansion history. First, we consider flavor-diagonal couplings to charged leptons and quantify the expected amount of dark radiation as a function of the coupling strength. Leptophilic axions are immune from complications due to strong interactions and our predictions do not suffer from theoretical uncertainties. We then focus on flavor-diagonal interactions with the three heavier quarks whose masses are all above the scale where strong interactions become non-perturbative. The top quark case is rather safe because its mass is orders of magnitude above the confinement scale, and the consequent predictions are solid. The bottom and charm masses are in more dangerous territory because they are very close to the QCD crossover. We present a comprehensive discussion of theoretical uncertainties due to both the choice of the scale where we stop the Boltzmann evolution and the running of QCD parameters. Finally, we compute the predicted amount of dark radiation expressed as an effective number of additional neutrino species. We compare our predictions with the ones obtained via standard approximate procedures, and we find that adopting a rigorous phase space framework alters the prediction by an amount larger than the sensitivity of future CMB observatories.</description>

      <title>Hunting New Animalcula with Rare K and B Decays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03440v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We summarize the recent strategy for an efficient hunting of new animalcula with the help of rare K and B decays that avoids the use of the $V_{cb}$ and $V_{ub}$ parameters that are subject to tensions between their determinations from inclusive and exclusive decays. In particular we update the values of the $V_{cb}$-independent ratios of various K and B decay branching ratios predicted by the Standard Model. We also stress the usefulness of the $V_{cb}-\gamma$ plots in the search for new physics. We select the magnificant seven among rare K and B decays that should play a leading role in the search for new physics due to their theoretical cleanness: $B^+\to K^+(K^*)\nu\bar\nu$ and $K^+\to\pi^+\nu\bar\nu$ measured recently by Belle II and NA62, respectively, $K_L\to\pi^0\nu\bar\nu$ investigated by KOTO and also $B_{s,d}\to\mu^+\mu^-$ and $K_S\to\mu^+\mu^-$ measured by the LHCb, CMS and ATLAS experiments at CERN. %</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.06203v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit particle creation in strong fields, and backreaction on those fields, from an amplitudes perspective. We describe the strong field by an initial coherent state of photons which we explicitly evolve in time, thus going beyond the background field approximation, and then consider observables which quantify the effects of backreaction. We present expressions for the waveform, vacuum persistence probability, and number of produced photons at next-to-leading order, all of which are impacted by backreaction, along with the number and statistics of produced pairs. We find that converting between in-out (amplitude) and in-in (expectation value) expressions requires explicit resummation of an infinite number of disconnected loop diagrams.</description>

      <title>Left-right asymmetry calculation comparisons and projected sensitivity to the weak mixing angle in polarized Bhabha scattering at 10.58 GeV</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16592v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Consideration is being given to upgrading the SuperKEKB electron-positron collider with the introduction of electron-beam polarization. This would enable a unique precision electroweak physics program that opens new ways to search for physics beyond the Standard Model. The upgrade would enable Belle II to make a number of high precision measurements, one of which is the left-right cross-section asymmetry in the $e^+e^-\rightarrow e^+e^-$ Bhabha scattering process. The expected level of precision in such a measurement will require the theoretical values of the asymmetry to be calculated at least to the next-to-leading order (NLO) level, and the implementation of simulation event generators with a similar level of precision. In this study, we compare the calculations of the ReneSANCe Monte Carlo generator with those of an independent NLO calculation to determine the level of agreement in this process. A 2.3% difference between the calculations is found and attributed to some higher-order effects being accounted for in the ReneSANCe generator. Using the published Belle II efficiency for selecting Bhabha events and assuming a 40 ab$^{-1}$ dataset having 70% polarization, the projected uncertainty on the weak mixing angle, sin$^2\theta_W$ , is calculated using ReneSANCe to be $\pm$0.00032 or better. Combining this with left-right asymmetry measurements from muons and taus under the assumption of lepton universality yields a projected overall uncertainty of $\pm$0.00019 on sin$^2\theta_W$ with SuperKEKB upgraded to have polarized electron beams.</description>

      <title>Neutrino nucleus Quasi-Elastic and resonant Neutral Current scatterings with Non-Standard Interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13349v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As well known, the cross sections of the resonance and Quasi-Elastic (QE) scattering off nucleons depend on quantities known as form factors that describe the nucleon structure. There are alternative approaches to determine the values of these non-perturbative quantities, some of them relying on the Neutral Current (NC) scattering of neutrinos off nucleons. In the presence of NC Non-Standard Interactions (NSI), such derivations must be revisited. The aim of the present paper is to discuss how information on NSI can be extracted by combining alternative approaches for deriving the form factors. We discuss how the KamLAND atmospheric neutrino data with $E_\nu&lt;{\rm GeV}$ (used to determine the axial strange form factor $g_A^s$) can already constrain the axial NSI of $\nu_\tau$ with nucleons. We also argue that if the precision measurement of $\nu_\mu$ NC QE scattering establishes unexpectedly large vector strange form factor ({\it e.g.,} $F_1^s(Q^2)\sim 0.01$), it will be an indication for nonzero NSI coupling with $u$ and $d$ quarks ($\epsilon_{\mu\mu}^{Au/d}\sim 0.01$). We study the QE and resonance scattering cross sections of $\nu_\tau$ and $\nu_e$ off Argon and show that if their axial NSI is of the order of (but of course below) the present bounds, the deviation of QE cross sections from the SM prediction will be sizable and distinct from the uncertainties induced by the form factors.</description>

      <title>Towards UV-Models of Kinetic Mixing and Portal Matter VII: A Light Dark Photon in the $3_c3_L1_A1_B$ Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17174v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The kinetic mixing (KM) portal, by which the Standard Model (SM) photon mixes with a light dark photon arising from a new $U(1)_D$ gauge group, allows for the possibility of viable scenarios of sub-GeV thermal dark matter (DM) with appropriately suppressed couplings to the SM. This KM can only occur if particles having both SM and dark quantum numbers, here termed portal matter (PM), also exist. The presence of such types of states and the strong suggestion of a need to embed $U(1)_D$ into a non-abelian gauge structure not too far above the TeV scale based on the RGE running of the $U(1)_D$ gauge coupling is potentially indicative of an enlarged group linking together the visible and dark sectors. The gauge group $G=SU(3)_c\times SU(3)_L\times U(1)_A\times U(1)_B=3_c3_L1_A1_B$ is perhaps the simplest setup wherein the SM and dark interactions are partially unified in a non-abelian fashion that is not a simple product group of the form $G=G_{SM}\times G_D$ encountered frequently in earlier work. The present paper describes the implications and phenomenology of this type of setup.</description>

Abstract: To meet the precision targets of upcoming LHC runs in the simulation of top pair production events it is essential to also consider off-shell effects. Due to their great computational cost I propose to encode them in neural networks. For that I use a combination of neural networks that take events with approximate off-shell effects and transform them into events that match those obtained with full off-shell calculations. This was shown to work reliably and efficiently at leading order. Here I discuss first steps extending this method to include higher order effects.</description>

      <title>Studying the $B^{0} \to J/\psi h_{1}$ decays with $h_{1}(1170)-h_{1}(1415)$ mixing in the perturbative QCD approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01075v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the $B^{0} \to J/\psi h_{1}$ decays for the first time by using perturbative QCD approach up to the presently known next-to-leading order accuracy. The vertex corrections present significant contribution to the amplitude. In the calculation, the mixing between two light axial-vector mesons $h_{1}(1170)$ and $h_{1}(1415)$ are also studied in detail. The observables including the branching ratios, polarization fractions and $CP$ asymmetries are predicted and discussed explicitly. It is found that the $B^{0} \to J/\psi h_{1}$ decays have relatively large branching fractions, which are generally at the order of ${\cal O}(10^{-6}\sim10^{-3})$, and thus are possible to be observed by the LHCb and Belle-II experiments in the near future. Moreover, they are very sensitive to the mixing angle $\theta$ and can be used to test the values of $\theta$. In addition, some ratios between the branching fractions of $B^{0} \to J/\psi h_{1}$ decays can provide much stronger constraints on $\theta$ due to their relatively small theoretical errors. The $B^{0} \to J/\psi h_{1}$ decays are generally dominated by the longitudinal polarization contributions, specifically, $f_{L}(B^{0} \to J/\psi h_{1})&gt;80\%$, except for the case that $\theta\sim 35^\circ$ and $-55^\circ$. Unfortunately, the direct $CP$ asymmetries of $B^{0} \to J/\psi h_{1}$ decays are too small to be observed soon even if the effect of $\theta$ is considered. The future precise measurements on $B^{0} \to J/\psi h_{1}$ decays are expected for testing these theoretical findings and exploring the interesting nature of $h_{1}(1170)$ and $h_{1}(1415)$.</description>

Abstract: The two main approaches to quantum computing are gate-based computation and analog computation, which are polynomially equivalent in terms of complexity, and they are often seen as alternatives to each other. In this work, we present a method for fitting one-dimensional probability distributions as a practical example of how analog and gate-based computation can be used together to perform different tasks within a single algorithm. In particular, we propose a strategy for encoding data within an adiabatic evolution model, which accomodates the fitting of strictly monotonic functions, as it is the cumulative distribution function of a dataset. Subsequently, we use a Trotter-bounded procedure to translate the adiabatic evolution into a quantum circuit in which the evolution time t is identified with the parameters of the circuit. This facilitates computing the probability density as derivative of the cumulative function using parameter shift rules.</description>

      <title>Strong constraints on a simple self-interacting neutrino cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05496v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Some cosmic microwave background (CMB) data allow a cosmological scenario in which the free streaming of neutrinos is delayed until close to matter-radiation equality. Interestingly, recent analyses have revealed that large-scale structure (LSS) data also align with this scenario, discarding the possibility of an accidental feature in the CMB sky and calling for further investigation into the free-streaming nature of neutrinos. By assuming a simple representation of self-interacting neutrinos, we investigate whether this nonstandard scenario can accommodate a consistent cosmology for both the CMB power spectra and the large-scale distribution of galaxies simultaneously. Employing three different approaches - a profile likelihood exploration, a nested sampling method, and a heuristic Metropolis-Hasting approximation - we exhaustively explore the parameter space and demonstrate that galaxy data exacerbates the challenge already posed by the Planck polarization data for this nonstandard scenario. We find that the Bayes factor disfavor strong interactions among neutrinos over the $\Lambda$CDM and $\Lambda$CDM + $N_\mathrm{eff}$ + $\sum m_\nu$ models with odds of $7:10000$ and $23:1000$, respectively, providing large evidence against the simple self-interacting neutrino model. Our analysis emphasizes the need to consider a broader range of phenomenologies in the early Universe. We also highlight significant numerical and theoretical challenges ahead in uncovering the exact nature of the feature observed in the data or, ultimately, confirming the standard chronological evolution of the Universe.</description>

      <title>To curve, or not to curve: Is curvature-assisted quintessence observationally viable?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09212v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Single-field models of accelerated expansion with nearly flat potentials, despite being able to provide observationally viable explanations for the early-time cosmic inflation and the late-time cosmic acceleration, are in strong tension with string theory evidence and the associated de Sitter swampland constraints. It has recently been argued that in an open universe, where the spatial curvature is negative (i.e., with $\Omega_k&gt;0$), a new stable fixed point arises, which may lead to viable single-field-based accelerated expansion with an arbitrarily steep potential. Here, we show, through a dynamical systems analysis and a Bayesian statistical inference of cosmological parameters, that the additional cosmological solutions based on the new fixed point do not render steep-potential, single-field, accelerated expansion observationally viable. We mainly focus on quintessence models of dark energy, but we also argue that a similar conclusion can be drawn for cosmic inflation.</description>

      <title>QCD with background electromagnetic fields on the lattice: a review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19780v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This review provides a comprehensive summary of results on the physics of strongly interacting matter in the presence of background electromagnetic fields, obtained via numerical lattice simulations of the underlying theory, Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). Lattice QCD has guided our understanding of magnetized quarks and gluons via landmark results on the phase diagram, the equation of state, the confinemenent mechanism, anomalous transport phenomena as well as many more fascinating effects. Some of the lattice results lead to completely new paradigms in the description of hot magnetized quark matter and provided useful insights to a broad high-energy particle physics community. Since the first lattice QCD simulations with background fields, this field has been established as an independent research direction. We present the current status and recent developments of this field, together with an outlook including open questions to be answered in the near future.</description>

      <title>Neutrino cosmology after DESI: tightest mass upper limits, preference for the normal ordering, and tension with terrestrial observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18047v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recent DESI Baryon Acoustic Oscillation measurements have led to tight upper limits on the neutrino mass sum, potentially in tension with oscillation constraints requiring $\sum m_{\nu} \gtrsim 0.06\,{\text{eV}}$. Under the physically motivated assumption of positive $\sum m_{\nu}$, we study the extent to which these limits are tightened by adding other available cosmological probes, and robustly quantify the preference for the normal mass ordering over the inverted one, as well as the tension between cosmological and terrestrial data. Combining DESI data with Cosmic Microwave Background measurements and several late-time background probes, the tightest $2\sigma$ limit we find without including a local $H_0$ prior is $\sum m_{\nu}&lt;0.05\,{\text{eV}}$. This leads to a strong preference for the normal ordering, with Bayes factor relative to the inverted one of $46.5$. Depending on the dataset combination and tension metric adopted, we quantify the tension between cosmological and terrestrial observations as ranging between $2.5\sigma$ and $5\sigma$. These results are strenghtened when allowing for a time-varying dark energy component with equation of state lying in the physically motivated non-phantom regime, $w(z) \geq -1$, highlighting an interesting synergy between the nature of dark energy and laboratory probes of the mass ordering. If these tensions persist and cannot be attributed to systematics, either or both standard neutrino (particle) physics or the underlying cosmological model will have to be questioned.</description>

      <title>On the determination of the $D$ meson width in the nuclear medium with the transparency ratio</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19295v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We have studied the feasibility of the experimental determination of the width of a $D$ meson in a nuclear medium by using the method of the nuclear transparency. The cross section for inclusive production of a $D^+$ in different nuclei is evaluated, taking care of the $D^+$ absorption in the nucleus, or equivalently, the survival probability of the $D^+$ in its way out of the nucleus from the point of production. We use present values of the in medium width of $D$ mesons and calculate ratios of the cross sections for different nuclei to the $^{12} \text{C} $ nucleus as reference. We find ratios of the order of $0.6$ for heavy nuclei, a large deviation from unity, which indicates that the method proposed is adequate to measure this relevant magnitude, so far only known theoretically.</description>

      <title>Measuring the Time Variation of the Fine-structure Constant with Quasars Detected by LAMOST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01554v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The [O III] $\lambda\lambda\ 4960,5008$ emission lines in the optical spectra of galaxies and quasars have been widely used to investigate the possible variation of the fine-structure constant $\alpha$ over cosmic time. In this work, we utilize the Large Sky Area Multi-object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope (LAMOST) quasar survey, for the first time, to measure the relative $\alpha$ variation $\Delta\alpha/\alpha$ in time through the [O III] doublet method. From the LAMOST Data Release 9 quasar catalog, we refine a sample of 209 quasar spectra with strong and narrow [O III] emission lines over a redshift range of $0&lt;z&lt;0.8$. Analysis on all of the 209 spectra obtains $\Delta\alpha/\alpha = (0.5 \pm 3.7) \times 10^{-4}$, which suggests that there is no evidence of varying $\alpha$ on the explored cosmological timescales. Assuming a linear variation, the mean rate of change in $\Delta\alpha/\alpha$ is limited to be $(-3.4 \pm 2.4)\times 10^{-13}$ $\mathrm{yr^{-1}}$ in the last 7.0 Gyr. While our LAMOST-based constraint on $\Delta\alpha/\alpha$ is not competitive with those of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) quasar observations, our analysis serves to corroborate the results of SDSS with another independent survey.</description>

      <title>Collinear anatomy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11886v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the collinear factorization of off-shell scattering amplitudes in maximally supersymmetric Yang-Mills (sYM) theory. These are constructed starting from six-dimensional N = (1,1) sYM, taking advantage of an available unconstrained spinor-helicity formalism combined with a unitarity-cut sewing procedure. After generalized dimensional reduction, their collinear behavior is dissected with assistance from the Method of Regions. We then construct off-shell splitting amplitudes directly using the same techniques, establishing equivalence to the amplitude analysis. The calculations are performed at one-loop order.</description>
