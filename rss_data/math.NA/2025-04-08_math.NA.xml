      <title>A Machine Learning and Finite Element Framework for Inverse Elliptic PDEs via Dirichlet-to-Neumann Mapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03895v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inverse problems for partial differential equations (PDEs) are crucial in numerous applications such as geophysics, biomedical imaging, and material science, where unknown physical properties must be inferred from indirect measurements. In this work, we address the inverse problem for elliptic PDEs by leveraging the Dirichlet-to-Neumann (DtN) map, which captures the relationship between boundary inputs and flux responses. Thus, this approach enables to solve the inverse problem that seeks the material properties inside the domain by utilizing the boundary data. Our framework employs an unsupervised machine learning algorithm that integrates a finite element method (FEM) in the inner loop for the forward problem, ensuring high accuracy. Moreover our approach is flexible to utilize partial observations of the boundary data, which is often the case in real-world scenarios. By incorporating carefully designed loss functions that accommodate discontinuities, the method refines coefficient reconstructions iteratively. This combined FEM and machine learning approach offers a robust, accurate solution strategy for a broad range of inverse problems, enabling improved estimation of critical parameters in applications from medical diagnostics to subsurface exploration.</description>

      <title>Besov regularity of multivariate non-periodic functions in terms of half-period cosine coefficients and consequences for recovery and numerical integration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03903v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the setting of $d$-variate periodic functions, often modelled as functions on the torus $\mathbb{T}^d\cong[0,1]^d$, the classical tensorized Fourier system is the system of choice for many applications. Turning to non-periodic functions on $[0,1]^d$ the Fourier system is not as well-suited as exemplified by the Gibbs phenomenon at the boundary. Other systems have therefore been considered for this setting. One example is the half-period cosine system, which occurs naturally as the eigenfunctions of the Laplace operator under homogeneous Neumann boundary conditions. We introduce and analyze associated function spaces, $S^{r}_{p,q}B_{\mathrm{hpc}}([0,1]^d)$, of dominating mixed Besov-type generalizing earlier concepts in this direction. As a main result, we show that there is a natural parameter range, where $S^{r}_{p,q}B_{\mathrm{hpc}}([0,1]^d)$ coincides with the classical Besov space of dominating mixed smoothness $S^{r}_{p,q}B([0,1]^d)$. This finding has direct implications for different functional analytic tasks in $S^{r}_{p,q}B([0,1]^d)$. It allows to systematically transfer methods, originally taylored to the periodic domain, to the non-periodic setup. To illustrate this, we investigate half-period cosine approximation, sampling reconstruction, and tent-transformed cubature. Concerning cubature, for instance, we are able to reproduce the optimal convergence rate $n^{-r}(\log n)^{(d-1)(1-1/q)}$ for tent-transformed digital nets in the range $1\le p,q\le\infty$, $\tfrac{1}{p}&lt;r&lt;2$, where $n$ is the number of samples. In our main proof we rely on Chui-Wang discretization of the dominating mixed Besov space $S^{r}_{p,q}B(\mathbb{R}^d)$, which we provide for the first time for the multivariate domain.</description>

      <title>Optimal Krylov On Average</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03914v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an adaptive randomized truncation estimator for Krylov subspace methods that optimizes the trade-off between the solution variance and the computational cost, while remaining unbiased. The estimator solves a constrained optimization problem to compute the truncation probabilities on the fly, with minimal computational overhead. The problem has a closed-form solution when the improvement of the deterministic algorithm satisfies a diminishing returns property. We prove that obtaining the optimal adaptive truncation distribution is impossible in the general case. Without the diminishing return condition, our estimator provides a suboptimal but still unbiased solution. We present experimental results in GP hyperparameter training and competitive physics-informed neural networks problem to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.</description>

      <title>The Fascinating World of 2 $\times$ 2 $\times$ 2 Tensors: Its Geometry and Optimization Challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03937v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This educational article highlights the geometric and algebraic complexities that distinguish tensors from matrices, to supplement coverage in advanced courses on linear algebra, matrix analysis, and tensor decompositions. Using the case of real-valued 2 $\times$ 2 $\times$ 2 tensors, we show how tensors violate many well-known properties of matrices: (1) The rank of a matrix is bounded by its smallest dimension, but a 2 $\times$ 2 $\times$ 2 tensor can be rank 3. (2) Matrices have a single typical rank, but the rank of a generic 2 $\times$ 2 $\times$ 2 tensor can be 2 or 3 - it has two typical ranks. (3) Any limit point of a sequence of matrices of rank $r$ is at most rank $r$, but a limit point of a sequence of 2 $\times$ 2 $\times$ 2 tensors of rank 2 can be rank 3 (a higher rank). (4) Matrices always have a best rank-$r$ approximation, but no rank-3 tensor of size 2 $\times$ 2 $\times$ 2 has a best rank-2 approximation. We unify the analysis of the matrix and tensor cases using tools from algebraic geometry and optimization, providing derivations of these surprising facts. To build intuition for the geometry of rank-constrained sets, students and educators can explore the geometry of matrix and tensor ranks via our interactive visualization tool.</description>

      <title>Parametric Operator Inference to Simulate the Purging Process in Semiconductor Manufacturing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03990v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents the application of parametric Operator Inference (OpInf) -- a nonintrusive reduced-order modeling (ROM) technique that learns a low-dimensional representation of a high-fidelity model -- to the numerical model of the purging process in semiconductor manufacturing. Leveraging the data-driven nature of the OpInf framework, we aim to forecast the flow field within a plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) chamber using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation data. Our model simplifies the system by excluding plasma dynamics and chemical reactions, while still capturing the key features of the purging flow behavior. The parametric OpInf framework learns nine ROMs based on varying argon mass flow rates at the inlet and different outlet pressures. It then interpolates these ROMs to predict the system's behavior for 25 parameter combinations, including 16 scenarios that are not seen in training. The parametric OpInf ROMs, trained on 36\% of the data and tested on 64\%, demonstrate accuracy across the entire parameter domain, with a maximum error of 9.32\%. Furthermore, the ROM achieves an approximate 142-fold speedup in online computations compared to the full-order model CFD simulation. These OpInf ROMs may be used for fast and accurate predictions of the purging flow in the PECVD chamber, which could facilitate effective particle contamination control in semiconductor manufacturing.</description>

      <title>Semi-Lagrangian methods of a plasma hybrid model with multi-species kinetic ions and massless electrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04282v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The semi-Lagrangian methods with the improved number of one-dimensional advections are proposed for a plasma hybrid model with kinetic ions and mass-less electrons. Two subsystems with mass, momentum, and energy conservation are obtained by a Poisson bracket-based splitting method. For the subsystem in which the distribution functions and the fields are coupled, the second order and reversible modified implicit mid-point rule is used in time with the specially designed mean velocity. The distribution functions are not involved in the iterations and are solved by exact splittings with only one dimensional advections, which makes the proposed schemes efficient. The cancellation problem is overcome by the numerical schemes constructed. Moreover, for the case with a periodic boundary condition, the magnetic field obtained is divergence free, mass, momentum, and energy are conserved. The methods can be extended to cases with multiple ion species.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel localized Fourier extension method for approximating non-periodic functions through domain segmentation. By subdividing the computational domain into subregions and employing uniform discretization scales, the method achieves spectral accuracy with $\mathcal{O}(M)$ computational complexity. Theoretical error bounds and parameter dependency analyses validate the robustness of the proposed method. The relationship among the key parameters involved is analytically established, accompanied by an optimized parameter selection strategy. Numerical experiments further verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Splitting Method for Stochastic Navier-Stokes Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the two-dimensional stochastic steady-state Navier-Stokes(NS) equations with additive random noise. We introduce an innovative splitting method that decomposes the stochastic NS equations into a deterministic NS component and a stochastic equation. We rigorously analyze the proposed splitting method from the perspectives of equivalence, stability, existence and uniqueness of the solution. We also propose a modified splitting scheme, which simplified the stochastic equation by omitting its nonlinear terms. A detailed analysis of the solution properties for this modified approach is provided. Additionally, we discuss the statistical errors with both the original splitting format and the modified scheme. Our theoretical and numerical studies demonstrate that the equivalent splitting scheme exhibits significantly enhanced stability compared to the original stochastic NS equations, enabling more effective handling of nonlinear characteristics. Several numerical experiments were performed to compare the statistical errors of the splitting method and the modified splitting method. Notably, the deterministic NS equation in the splitting method does not require repeated solving, and the stochastic equation in the modified scheme is free of nonlinear terms. These features make the modified splitting method particularly advantageous for large-scale computations, as it significantly improves computational efficiency without compromising accuracy.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we derive first-order Euler finite element discretization schemes for a time-dependent natural convection model with variable density (NCVD). The model is governed by the variable density Navier-Stokes equations coupled with a parabolic partial differential equation that describes the evolution of temperature. Stability and error estimate for the velocity, pressure, density and temperature in $L^2$-norm are proved by using finite element approximations in space and finite differences in time. Finally, the numerical results are showed to support the theoretical analysis.</description>

      <title>Sampling patterns for Zernike-like bases in non-standard geometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04442v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Zernike polynomials are widely used in optics and ophthalmology due to their direct connection to classical optical aberrations. While orthogonal on the unit disk, their application to discrete data or non-circular domains--such as ellipses, annuli, and hexagons--presents challenges in terms of numerical stability and accuracy. In this work, we extend Zernike-like orthogonal functions to these non-standard geometries using diffeomorphic mappings and construct sampling patterns that preserve favorable numerical conditioning. We provide theoretical bounds for the condition numbers of the resulting collocation matrices and validate them through extensive numerical experiments. As a practical application, we demonstrate accurate wavefront interpolation and reconstruction in segmented mirror telescopes composed of hexagonal facets. Our results show that appropriately transferred sampling configurations, especially Optimal Concentric Sampling and Lebesgue points, allow stable high-order interpolation and effective wavefront modeling in complex optical systems. Moreover, the Optimal Concentric Samplings can be computed with an explicit expression, which is a significant advantage in practice.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.04483v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the numerical reconstruction of inclusions in a semilinear elliptic equation arising in the mathematical modeling of cardiac ischemia. We propose an adaptive finite element method for the resulting constrained minimization problem that is relaxed by a phase-field approach. The \textit{a posteriori} error estimators of the adaptive algorithm consist of three components, i.e., the state variable, the adjoint variable and the complementary relation. Moreover, using tools from adaptive finite element analysis and nonlinear optimization, we establish the strong convergence for a subsequence of adaptively generated discrete solutions to a solution of the continuous optimality system. Several numerical examples are presented to illustrate the convergence and efficiency of the adaptive algorithm</description>

Abstract: In this paper, a novel high order semi-Lagrangian (SL) spectral volume (SV) method is proposed and studied for nonlinear Vlasov-Poisson (VP) simulations via operator splitting. The proposed algorithm combines both advantages of semi-Lagrangian and spectral volume approaches, exhibiting strong stability, robustness under large time steps, arbitrary high-order accuracy in space, local mass conservation, and positivity preservation. Numerical study of the SLSV method applied to the one-dimensional and two-dimensional transport equations, the Vlasov-Poisson system, the classical benchmark problems including Landau damping and two-stream instabilities is conducted, confirming the effectiveness, accuracy, and robustness of our algorithm in addressing complex nonlinear phenomena.</description>

      <title>Truncated Huber Penalty for Sparse Signal Recovery with Convergence Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04509v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sparse signal recovery from under-determined systems presents significant challenges when using conventional L_0 and L_1 penalties, primarily due to computational complexity and estimation bias. This paper introduces a truncated Huber penalty, a non-convex metric that effectively bridges the gap between unbiased sparse recovery and differentiable optimization. The proposed penalty applies quadratic regularization to small entries while truncating large magnitudes, avoiding non-differentiable points at optima. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that, for an appropriately chosen threshold, any s-sparse solution recoverable via conventional penalties remains a local optimum under the truncated Huber function. This property allows the exact and robust recovery theories developed for other penalty regularization functions to be directly extended to the truncated Huber function. To solve the optimization problem, we develop a block coordinate descent (BCD) algorithm with finite-step convergence guarantees under spark conditions. Numerical experiments are conducted to validate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed approach. Furthermore, we extend the truncated Huber-penalized model to the gradient domain, illustrating its applicability in signal denoising and image smoothing.</description>

      <title>Optimal Order Space-Time Discretization Methods for the Nonlinear Stochastic Elastic Wave Equations with Multiplicative Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper develops and analyzes an optimal-order semi-discrete scheme and its fully discrete finite element approximation for nonlinear stochastic elastic wave equations with multiplicative noise. A non-standard time-stepping scheme is introduced for time discretization, it is showed that the scheme converges with rates $O(\tau)$ and $O(\tau^{\frac32})$ respectively in the energy- and $L^2$-norm, which are optimal with respect to the time regularity of the PDE solution. For spatial discretization, the standard finite element method is employed. It is proven that the fully discrete method converges with optimal rates $O(\tau + h)$ and $O(\tau^{\frac{3}{2}} + h^2)$ respectively in the energy- and $L^2$-norm. The cruxes of the analysis are to establish some high-moment stability results and utilize a refined error estimate for the trapezoidal quadrature rule to control the nonlinearities from the drift term and the multiplicative noise. Numerical experiments are also provided to validate the theoretical results.</description>

      <title>A Note on the Stability of the Sherman-Morrison-Woodbury Formula</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the numerical stability of the Sherman-Morrison-Woodbury (SMW) identity. Let $B = A + UV^T$ and assume $U$ and $V$ both have full-column rank. We explore error bounds for the SMW identity when we are only able to compute approximate inverses. For both forward and backward errors, we present upper bounds as a function of the two-norm error of the approximate inverses. We verify with numerical experiments that, in certain cases, our bounds accurately capture the behavior of the errors.</description>

      <title>Lippmann-Schwinger-Lanczos approach for inverse scattering problem of Schrodinger equation in the resonance frequency domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reconstructions of potential in Schrodinger equation with data in the diffusion frequency domain have been successfully obtained within Lippmann-Schwinger-Lanczos (LSL) approach, however limited resolution away from the sensor positions resulted in rather blurry images. To improve the reconstructions, in this work we extended the applicability of the approach to the data in the resonance frequency domain. We proposed a specific data sampling according to Weyl's law that allows us to obtain sharp images without oversampling and overwhelming computational complexity. Numerical results presented at the end illustrate the performance of the algorithm.</description>

      <title>A structure and asymptotic preserving scheme for the quasineutral limit of the Vlasov-Poisson system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a new numerical method for the Vlasov-Poisson system that is both asymptotically consistent and stable in the quasineutral regime, i.e. when the Debye length is small compared to the characteristic spatial scale of the physical domain. Our approach consists in reformulating the Vlasov-Poisson system as a hyperbolic problem by applying a spectral expansion in the basis of Hermite functions in the velocity space and in designing a structure-preserving scheme for the time and spatial variables. Through this Hermite formulation, we establish a convergence result for the electric field toward its quasineutral limit together with optimal error estimates. Following this path, we then propose a fully discrete numerical method for the Vlasov-Poisson system, inspired by the approach in arXiv:2306.14605 , and rigorously prove that it is uniformly consistent in the quasineutral limit regime. Finally, we present several numerical simulations to illustrate the behavior of the proposed scheme. These results demonstrate the capability of our method to describe quasineutral plasmas and confirm the theoretical findings: stability and asymptotic preservation.</description>

      <title>An invariant-region-preserving scheme for a convection-reaction-Cahn-Hilliard multiphase model of biofilm growth in slow sand filters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04852v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A multidimensional model of biofilm growth present in the supernatant water of a Slow Sand Filter is derived. The multiphase model, consisting of solid and liquid phases, is written as a convection-reaction system with a Cahn-Hilliard-type equation with degenerate mobility coupled to a Stokes-flow equation for the mixture velocity. An upwind discontinuous Galerkin approach is used to approximate the convection-reaction equations, whereas an $H^1$-conforming primal formulation is proposed for the Stokes system. By means of a splitting procedure due to the reaction terms, an invariant-region principle is shown for the concentration unknowns, namely non-negativity for all phases and an upper bound for the total concentration of the solid phases. Numerical examples with reduced biofilm reactions are presented to illustrate the performance of the model and numerical scheme.</description>

      <title>Block BDDC/FETI-DP Preconditioners for Three-Field mixed finite element Discretizations of Biot's consolidation model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we construct and analyze a block dual-primal preconditioner for Biot's consolidation model approximated by three-field mixed finite elements based on a displacement, pressure, and total pressure formulation. The domain is decomposed into nonoverlapping subdomains, and the continuity of the displacement component across the subdomain interface is enforced by introducing a Lagrange multiplier. After eliminating all displacement variables and the independent subdomain interior components of pressure and total pressure, the problem is reduced to a symmetric positive definite linear system for the subdomain interface pressure, total pressure, and the Lagrange multiplier. This reduced system is solved by a preconditioned conjugate gradient method, with a block dual-primal preconditioner using a Balancing Domain Decomposition by Constraints (BDDC) preconditioner for both the interface total pressure block and the interface pressure blocks, as well as a Finite Element Tearing and Interconnecting-Dual Primal (FETI-DP) preconditioner for the Lagrange multiplier block. By analyzing the conditioning of the preconditioned subsystem associated with the interface pressure and total pressure components, we obtain a condition number bound of the preconditioned system, which is scalable in the number of subdomains, poly-logarithmic in the ratio of subdomain and mesh sizes, and robust with respect to the parameters of the model. Extensive numerical experiments confirm the theoretical result of the proposed algorithm.</description>

      <title>The Linearized Vlasov-Maxwell System as a Hamiltonian System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04929v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a Hamiltonian formulation for the linearized Vlasov-Maxwell system with a Maxwellian background distribution function. We discuss the geometric properties of the model at the continuous level, and how to discretize the model in the GEMPIC framework [1]. This method allows us to keep the structure of the system at the semi-discrete level. To integrate the model in time, we employ a Poisson splitting and discuss how to integrate each subsystem separately. We test the model against the full Vlasov-Maxwell model with a control variate method for noise reduction; the two chosen test-cases are the weak Landau damping and the Bernstein waves. Both test-cases exhibit the same physical properties for short simulations but our model enjoys better long-time stability and energy conservation due to its geometric construction. The model is implemented in the open-source Python library STRUPHY [2, 3].</description>

      <title>Anisotropic space-time goal-oriented error control and mesh adaptivity for convection-diffusion-reaction equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an anisotropic goal-oriented error estimator based on the Dual Weighted Residual (DWR) method for time-dependent convection-diffusion-reaction (CDR) equations. Using anisotropic interpolation operators the estimator is elementwise separated with respect to the single directions in space and time leading to adaptive, anisotropic mesh refinement in a natural way. To prevent spurious oscillations the streamline upwind Petrov-Galerkin (SUPG) method is applied to stabilize the underlying system in the case of high P\'{e}clet numbers. Efficiency and robustness of the underlying algorithm are demonstrated for different goal functionals. The directional error indicators quantify anisotropy of the solution with respect to the goal, and produce meshes that efficiently capture sharp layers. Numerical examples show the superiority of the proposed approach over isotropic adaptive and global mesh refinement using established benchmarks for convection-dominated transport.</description>

      <title>Solving the fully nonlinear Monge-Amp\`ere equation using the Legendre-Kolmogorov-Arnold Network method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05022v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel neural network framework, the Legendre-Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (Legendre-KAN) method, designed to solve fully nonlinear Monge-Amp\`ere equations with Dirichlet boundary conditions. The architecture leverages the orthogonality of Legendre polynomials as basis functions, significantly enhancing both convergence speed and solution accuracy compared to traditional methods. Furthermore, the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem provides a strong theoretical foundation for the interpretability and optimization of the network. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method through numerical examples, involving both smooth and singular solutions in various dimensions. This work not only addresses the challenges of solving high-dimensional and singular Monge-Amp\`ere equations but also highlights the potential of neural network-based approaches for complex partial differential equations. Additionally, the method is applied to the optimal transport problem in image mapping, showcasing its practical utility in geometric image transformation. This approach is expected to pave the way for further enhancement of KAN-based applications and numerical solutions of PDEs across a wide range of scientific and engineering fields.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.05036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend the distributed finite element method of [1], built upon model order reduction, to arbitrary polynomial degree using a hybrid Nitsche scheme. This new method considerably simplifies the transformation of the finite element system to the reduced basis for large problems. We prove that the error of the reduced Nitsche solution converges optimally with respect to the approximation order of the finite element spaces and linearly with respect to the dimension reduction parameter $\epsilon$. Numerical tests with nontrivial tetrahedral meshes using second-degree polynomial bases support the theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Generators of $H^1(\Gamma, \partial \Gamma^c)$ with $\partial \Gamma^c \subset \partial \Gamma$ for Triangulated Surfaces $\Gamma$: Construction and Classification of Global Loops</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a compact surface $\Gamma$ embedded in $\mathbb R^3$ with boundary $\partial \Gamma$, our goal is to construct a set of representatives for a basis of the relative cohomology group $H^1(\Gamma, \partial \Gamma^c)$, where $\Gamma^c$ is a specified subset of $\partial \Gamma$. To achieve this, we propose a novel graph-based algorithm with two key features: it is applicable to non-orientable surfaces, thereby generalizing previous approaches, and it has a worst-case time complexity that is linear in the number of edges of the mesh $\mathcal{K}$ triangulating $\Gamma$. Importantly, this algorithm serves as a critical pre-processing step to address the low-frequency breakdown encountered in boundary element discretizations of integral equation formulations.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05149v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mathbb{Z}^2\backslash SE(2)$ denote the right coset space of the subgroup consisting of translational isometries of the orthogonal lattice $\mathbb{Z}^2$ in the non-Abelian group of planar motions $SE(2)$. This paper develops a fast and accurate numerical scheme for approximation of functions on $\mathbb{Z}^2\backslash SE(2)$. We address finite Fourier series of functions on the right coset space $\mathbb{Z}^2\backslash SE(2)$ using finite Fourier coefficients. The convergence/error analysis of finite Fourier coefficients are investigated. Conditions are established for the finite Fourier coefficients to converge to the Fourier coefficients. The matrix forms of the finite transforms are discussed. The implementation of the discrete method to compute numerical approximation of $SE(2)$-convolutions with functions which are radial in translations are considered. The paper is concluded by discussing capability of the numerical scheme to develop fast algorithms for approximating multiple convolutions with functions with are radial in translations.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates explicit expressions for the error associated with the block rational Krylov approximation of matrix functions. Two formulas are proposed, both derived from characterizations of the block FOM residual. The first formula employs a block generalization of the residual polynomial, while the second leverages the block collinearity of the residuals. A posteriori error bounds based on the knowledge of spectral information of the argument are derived and tested on a set of examples. Notably, both error formulas and their corresponding upper bounds do not require the use of quadratures for their practical evaluation.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05266v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we address the problem of interpolating and approximating differential forms starting from data defined by integration. We show that many aspects of nodal interpolation can naturally be carried to this more general framework; in contrast, some of them require the introduction of geometric and measure theoretic hypotheses. After characterizing the norms of the operators involved, we introduce the concept of admissible integral k-mesh, which allows for the construction of robust approximation schemes, and is used to extract interpolation sets with high stability properties. To this end, the concepts of Fekete currents and Leja sequences of currents are formalized, and a numerical scheme for their approximation is proposed.</description>

      <title>Improvement of Clamonds solution of the Colebrook-White equation -- highest accuracy for engineering purposes with one iteration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03678v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Colebrook-White equation is the widely used basis for the calculation of the friction factor lambda for flows in pipes and ducts. Because this equation is implicit in lambda, many solutions have been developed to ease the calculation in order to reduce the effort and to reach a sufficient accuracy. Clamond has proposed in 2008 an iterative solution that requires maximally two iterations to obtain the machine double precision. Here an improvement of this solution is presented, that achieves already with one iteration a maximal error of 2.79E-7, what is more than sufficient for most engineering purposes. This solution is compared in a chart of CPU time versus accuracy with 28 solutions from the literature and in the group of the fastest solutions, that require only two calls of the logarithm function, it proved to be by far the most accurate one.</description>

      <title>Computing cone-constrained singular values of matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04069v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The concept of singular values of a rectangular matrix $A$ relative to a pair of closed convex cones $(P,Q)$ has been recently introduced by Seeger and Sossa (Cone-constrained singular value problems, Journal of Convex Analysis 30, pp. 1285-1306, 2023). These singular values are the critical (stationary) values of the non-convex optimization problem of minimizing $\langle u,Av\rangle$ such that $u$ and $v$ are unit vectors in $P$ and $Q$, respectively. When $A$ is the identity matrix, the singular values coincide with the cosine of the critical angles between $P$ and $Q$. When $P$ and $Q$ are positive orthants, the singular values are called Pareto singular values of $A$ and have applications, for instance, in spectral graph theory. This paper deals with the numerical computation of these cone-constrained singular values. We prove the NP-hardness of all the above problems, while identifying cases when such problems can be solved in polynomial time. We then propose four algorithms. Two are exact algorithms, meaning that they are guaranteed to compute a globally optimal solution; one uses an exact non-convex quadratic programming solver, and the other a brute-force active-set method. The other two are heuristics, meaning that they rapidly compute locally optimal solutions; one uses an alternating projection algorithm with extrapolation, and the other a sequential partial linearization approach based on fractional programming. We illustrate the use of these algorithms on several examples.</description>

Abstract: The Bayesian conjugate gradient method offers probabilistic solutions to linear systems but suffers from poor calibration, limiting its utility in uncertainty quantification tasks. Recent approaches leveraging postiterations to construct priors have improved computational properties but failed to correct calibration issues. In this work, we propose a novel randomised postiteration strategy that enhances the calibration of the BayesCG posterior while preserving its favourable convergence characteristics. We present theoretical guarantees for the improved calibration, supported by results on the distribution of posterior errors. Numerical experiments demonstrate the efficacy of the method in both synthetic and inverse problem settings, showing enhanced uncertainty quantification and better propagation of uncertainties through computational pipelines.</description>

      <title>Randomised Splitting Methods and Stochastic Gradient Descent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04274v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore an explicit link between stochastic gradient descent using common batching strategies and splitting methods for ordinary differential equations. From this perspective, we introduce a new minibatching strategy (called Symmetric Minibatching Strategy) for stochastic gradient optimisation which shows greatly reduced stochastic gradient bias (from $\mathcal{O}(h^2)$ to $\mathcal{O}(h^4)$ in the optimiser stepsize $h$), when combined with momentum-based optimisers. We justify why momentum is needed to obtain the improved performance using the theory of backward analysis for splitting integrators and provide a detailed analytic computation of the stochastic gradient bias on a simple example.
  Further, we provide improved convergence guarantees for this new minibatching strategy using Lyapunov techniques that show reduced stochastic gradient bias for a fixed stepsize (or learning rate) over the class of strongly-convex and smooth objective functions. Via the same techniques we also improve the known results for the Random Reshuffling strategy for stochastic gradient descent methods with momentum. We argue that this also leads to a faster convergence rate when considering a decreasing stepsize schedule. Both the reduced bias and efficacy of decreasing stepsizes are demonstrated numerically on several motivating examples.</description>

      <title>Binary Weight Allocation for Multi-Objective Path Optimization: Efficient Earliest and Latest Path Discovery in Network Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04499v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes earliest and latest path algorithms based on binary weight allocation, assigning weights of 2(i-1) and 2(m-i) to the i-th arc in a network. While traditional shortest path algorithms optimize only distance, our approach leverages Binary-Addition-Tree ordering to efficiently identify lexicographically smallest and largest paths that establish connectivity. These paths partition the solution space into three regions: guaranteed disconnection, transitional connectivity, and guaranteed no simple paths. Our weight allocation enables implicit encoding of multiple objectives directly in binary representations, maintaining the O((|V|+|E|)log|V|) complexity of Dijkstra's algorithm while allowing simultaneous optimization of competing factors like reliability and cost. Experimental validation demonstrates significant computational time reduction compared to traditional multi-objective methods. Applications span telecommunications, transportation networks, and supply chain management, providing efficient tools for network planning and reliability analysis under multiple constraints.</description>

      <title>Nonlocal techniques for the analysis of deep ReLU neural network approximations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04847v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, Daubechies, DeVore, Foucart, Hanin, and Petrova introduced a system of piece-wise linear functions, which can be easily reproduced by artificial neural networks with the ReLU activation function and which form a Riesz basis of $L_2([0,1])$. This work was generalized by two of the authors to the multivariate setting. We show that this system serves as a Riesz basis also for Sobolev spaces $W^s([0,1]^d)$ and Barron classes ${\mathbb B}^s([0,1]^d)$ with smoothness $0&lt;s&lt;1$. We apply this fact to re-prove some recent results on the approximation of functions from these classes by deep neural networks. Our proof method avoids using local approximations and allows us to track also the implicit constants as well as to show that we can avoid the curse of dimension. Moreover, we also study how well one can approximate Sobolev and Barron functions by ANNs if only function values are known.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.04887v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The theoretical and numerical understanding of the key concept of topological entropy is an important problem in dynamical systems. Most studies have been carried out on maps (discrete-time systems). We analyse a scenario of global changes of the structure of an attractor in continuous-time systems leading to an unbounded growth of the topological entropy of the underlying dynamical system. As an example, we consider the classical Roessler system. We show that for an explicit range of parameters a chaotic attractor exists. We also prove the existence of a sequence of bifurcations leading to the growth of the topological entropy. The proofs are computer-aided.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we deal with the feasibility-seeking problem for unions of convex sets (UCS) sets and propose an iterative process for its solution. Renewed interest in this problem stems from the fact that it was recently discovered to serve as a modeling approach in fields of applications and from the ongoing recent research efforts to handle non-convexity in feasibility-seeking.</description>

      <title>Multi-level Neural Networks for high-dimensional parametric obstacle problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05026v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A new method to solve computationally challenging (random) parametric obstacle problems is developed and analyzed, where the parameters can influence the related partial differential equation (PDE) and determine the position and surface structure of the obstacle. As governing equation, a stationary elliptic diffusion problem is assumed. The high-dimensional solution of the obstacle problem is approximated by a specifically constructed convolutional neural network (CNN). This novel algorithm is inspired by a finite element constrained multigrid algorithm to represent the parameter to solution map. This has two benefits: First, it allows for efficient practical computations since multi-level data is used as an explicit output of the NN thanks to an appropriate data preprocessing. This improves the efficacy of the training process and subsequently leads to small errors in the natural energy norm. Second, the comparison of the CNN to a multigrid algorithm provides means to carry out a complete a priori convergence and complexity analysis of the proposed NN architecture. Numerical experiments illustrate a state-of-the-art performance for this challenging problem.</description>

      <title>Turing instability for nonlocal heterogeneous reaction-diffusion systems: A computer-assisted proof approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.05066v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper provides a computer-assisted proof for the Turing instability induced by heterogeneous nonlocality in reaction-diffusion systems. Due to the heterogeneity and nonlocality, the linear Fourier analysis gives rise to \textit{strongly coupled} infinite differential systems. By introducing suitable changes of basis as well as the Gershgorin disks theorem for infinite matrices, we first show that all $N$-th Gershgorin disks lie completely on the left half-plane for sufficiently large $N$. For the remaining finitely many disks, a computer-assisted proof shows that if the intensity $\delta$ of the nonlocal term is large enough, there is precisely one eigenvalue with positive real part, which proves the Turing instability. Moreover, by detailed study of this eigenvalue as a function of $\delta$, we obtain a sharp threshold $\delta^*$ which is the bifurcation point for Turing instability.</description>

      <title>Dimension-Free Convergence of Diffusion Models for Approximate Gaussian Mixtures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05300v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models are distinguished by their exceptional generative performance, particularly in producing high-quality samples through iterative denoising. While current theory suggests that the number of denoising steps required for accurate sample generation should scale linearly with data dimension, this does not reflect the practical efficiency of widely used algorithms like Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs). This paper investigates the effectiveness of diffusion models in sampling from complex high-dimensional distributions that can be well-approximated by Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs). For these distributions, our main result shows that DDPM takes at most $\widetilde{O}(1/\varepsilon)$ iterations to attain an $\varepsilon$-accurate distribution in total variation (TV) distance, independent of both the ambient dimension $d$ and the number of components $K$, up to logarithmic factors. Furthermore, this result remains robust to score estimation errors. These findings highlight the remarkable effectiveness of diffusion models in high-dimensional settings given the universal approximation capability of GMMs, and provide theoretical insights into their practical success.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1912.04007v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the Subspace Power Method (SPM) for calculating the CP decomposition of low-rank real symmetric tensors. This algorithm calculates one new CP component at a time, alternating between applying the shifted symmetric higher-order power method (SS-HOPM) to a certain modified tensor, constructed from a matrix flattening of the original tensor; and using appropriate deflation steps. We obtain rigorous guarantees for SPM regarding convergence and global optima for input tensors of dimension $d$ and order $m$ of CP rank up to $O(d^{\lfloor m/2\rfloor})$, via results in classical algebraic geometry and optimization theory. As a by-product of our analysis we prove that SS-HOPM converges unconditionally, settling a conjecture in [Kolda, T.G., Mayo, J.R.: Shifted power method for computing tensor eigenpairs. SIAM Journal on Matrix Analysis and Applications 32(4), 1095-1124 (2011)]. We present numerical experiments which demonstrate that SPM is efficient and robust to noise, being up to one order of magnitude faster than state-of-the-art CP decomposition algorithms in certain experiments. Furthermore, prior knowledge of the CP rank is not required by SPM.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2211.06859v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The convergence rate of domain decomposition methods (DDMs) strongly depends on the transmission condition at the interfaces between subdomains. Thus, an important aspect in improving the efficiency of such solvers is careful design of appropriate transmission conditions. In this work, we will develop an efficient solver for Helmholtz equations based on perfectly matched layers (PMLs) as transmission conditions at the interfaces within an optimised restricted additive Schwarz (ORAS) domain decomposition preconditioner, in both two and three dimensional domains. We perform a series of numerical simulations on a model problem and will assess the convergence rate and accuracy of our solutions compared to the situation where impedance boundary conditions are used.</description>

      <title>Exponentially Convergent Numerical Method for Abstract Cauchy Problem with Fractional Derivative of Caputo Type</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.13099v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an exponentially convergent numerical method to approximate the solution of the Cauchy problem for the inhomogeneous fractional differential equation with an unbounded operator coefficient and Caputo fractional derivative in time. The numerical method is based on the newly obtained solution formula that consolidates the mild solution representations of sub-parabolic, parabolic and sub-hyperbolic equations with sectorial operator coefficient $A$ and non-zero initial data. The involved integral operators are approximated using the sinc-quadrature formulas that are tailored to the spectral parameters of $A$, fractional order $\alpha$ and the smoothness of the first initial condition, as well as to the properties of the equation's right-hand side $f(t)$. The resulting method possesses exponential convergence for positive sectorial $A$, any finite $t$, including $t = 0$ and the whole range $\alpha \in (0,2)$. It is suitable for a practically important case, when no knowledge of $f(t)$ is available outside the considered interval $t \in [0, T]$. The algorithm of the method is capable of multi-level parallelism. We provide numerical examples that confirm the theoretical error estimates.</description>

      <title>Projected Newton method for large-scale Bayesian linear inverse problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01920v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Computing the regularized solution of Bayesian linear inverse problems as well as the corresponding regularization parameter is highly desirable in many applications. This paper proposes a novel iterative method, termed the Projected Newton method (PNT), that can simultaneously update the regularization parameter and solution step by step without requiring any high-cost matrix inversions or decompositions. By reformulating the Tikhonov regularization as a constrained minimization problem and writing its Lagrangian function, a Newton-type method coupled with a Krylov subspace method, called the generalized Golub-Kahan bidiagonalization, is employed for the unconstrained Lagrangian function. The resulting PNT algorithm only needs solving a small-scale linear system to get a descent direction of a merit function at each iteration, thus significantly reducing computational overhead. Rigorous convergence results are proved, showing that PNT always converges to the unique regularized solution and the corresponding Lagrangian multiplier. Experimental results on both small and large-scale Bayesian inverse problems demonstrate its excellent convergence property, robustness and efficiency. Given that the most demanding computational tasks in PNT are primarily matrix-vector products, it is particularly well-suited for large-scale problems.</description>

      <title>Learning Coarse-Grained Dynamics on Graph</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09324v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a Graph Neural Network (GNN) non-Markovian modeling framework to identify coarse-grained dynamical systems on graphs. Our main idea is to systematically determine the GNN architecture by inspecting how the leading term of the Mori-Zwanzig memory term depends on the coarse-grained interaction coefficients that encode the graph topology. Based on this analysis, we found that the appropriate GNN architecture that will account for $K$-hop dynamical interactions has to employ a Message Passing (MP) mechanism with at least $2K$ steps. We also deduce that the memory length required for an accurate closure model decreases as a function of the interaction strength under the assumption that the interaction strength exhibits a power law that decays as a function of the hop distance. Supporting numerical demonstrations on two examples, a heterogeneous Kuramoto oscillator model and a power system, suggest that the proposed GNN architecture can predict the coarse-grained dynamics under fixed and time-varying graph topologies.</description>

      <title>Generalized Moving Least-Squares Methods for Solving Vector-valued PDEs on Unknown Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12210v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we extend the Generalized Moving Least-Squares (GMLS) method in two different ways to solve the vector-valued PDEs on unknown smooth 2D manifolds without boundaries embedded in $\mathbb{R}^{3}$, identified with randomly sampled point cloud data. The two approaches are referred to as the intrinsic method and the extrinsic method. For the intrinsic method which relies on local approximations of metric tensors, we simplify the formula of Laplacians and covariant derivatives acting on vector fields at the base point by calculating them in a local Monge coordinate system. On the other hand, the extrinsic method formulates tangential derivatives on a submanifold as the projection of the directional derivative in the ambient Euclidean space onto the tangent space of the submanifold. One challenge of this method is that the discretization of vector Laplacians yields a matrix whose size relies on the ambient dimension. To overcome this issue, we reduce the dimension of vector Laplacian matrices by employing a coordinate transformation. The complexity of both methods scales well with the dimension of manifolds rather than the ambient dimension. We also present supporting numerical examples, including eigenvalue problems, linear Poisson equations, and nonlinear Burgers' equations, to examine the numerical accuracy of proposed methods on various smooth manifolds.</description>

      <title>Embrace rejection: Kernel matrix approximation by accelerated randomly pivoted Cholesky</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03969v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Randomly pivoted Cholesky (RPCholesky) is an algorithm for constructing a low-rank approximation of a positive-semidefinite matrix using a small number of columns. This paper develops an accelerated version of RPCholesky that employs block matrix computations and rejection sampling to efficiently simulate the execution of the original algorithm. For the task of approximating a kernel matrix, the accelerated algorithm can run over $40\times$ faster. The paper contains implementation details, theoretical guarantees, experiments on benchmark data sets, and an application to computational chemistry.</description>

      <title>Hypergraph $p$-Laplacian equations for data interpolation and semi-supervised learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12601v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hypergraph learning with $p$-Laplacian regularization has attracted a lot of attention due to its flexibility in modeling higher-order relationships in data. This paper focuses on its fast numerical implementation, which is challenging due to the non-differentiability of the objective function and the non-uniqueness of the minimizer. We derive a hypergraph $p$-Laplacian equation from the subdifferential of the $p$-Laplacian regularization. A simplified equation that is mathematically well-posed and computationally efficient is proposed as an alternative. Numerical experiments verify that the simplified $p$-Laplacian equation suppresses spiky solutions in data interpolation and improves classification accuracy in semi-supervised learning. The remarkably low computational cost enables further applications.</description>

      <title>Sequential data assimilation for PDEs using shape-morphing solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16593v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Shape-morphing solutions (also known as evolutional deep neural networks, reduced-order nonlinear solutions, and neural Galerkin schemes) are a new class of methods for approximating the solution of time-dependent partial differential equations (PDEs). Here, we introduce a sequential data assimilation method for incorporating observational data in a shape-morphing solution (SMS). Our method takes the form of a predictor-corrector scheme, where the observations are used to correct the SMS parameters using Newton-like iterations. Between observation points, the SMS equations (a set of ordinary differential equations) are used to evolve the solution forward in time. We prove that, under certain conditions, the data assimilated SMS (DA-SMS) converges uniformly towards the true state of the system. We demonstrate the efficacy of DA-SMS on three examples: the nonlinear Schrodinger equation, the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation, and a two-dimensional advection-diffusion equation. Our numerical results suggest that DA-SMS converges with relatively sparse observations and a single iteration of the Newton-like method.</description>

      <title>The Carleman Contraction Mapping Method for a Coefficient Inverse Problem of the Epidemiology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00297v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is proposed to monitor spatial and temporal spreads of epidemics via solution of a Coefficient Inverse Problem for a system of three coupled nonlinear parabolic equations. To solve this problem numerically, a version of the so-called Carleman contraction mapping method is developed for this problem. On each iteration, a linear problem with the incomplete lateral Cauchy data is solved by the weighted Quasi-Reversibility Method, where the weight is the Carleman Weight Function. This is the function, which is involved as the weight in the Carleman estimate for the corresponding parabolic operator. Convergence analysis ensures the global convergence of this procedure. Numerical results demonstrate an accurate performance of this technique for noisy data.</description>

      <title>Virtual finite element and hyperbolic problems: the PAMPA algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01341v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore the use of the Virtual Element Method concepts to solve scalar and system hyperbolic problems on general polygonal grids. The new schemes stem from the active flux approach \cite{AF1}, which combines the usage of point values at the element boundaries with an additional degree of freedom representing the average of the solution within each control volume. Along the lines of the family of residual distribution schemes introduced in \cite{Abgrall_AF,abgrall2023activefluxtriangularmeshes} \red{that integrate the active flux technique}, we devise novel third order accurate methods that rely on the VEM technology to discretize gradients of the numerical solution by means of a polynomial-free approximation, \red{by} adopting a virtual basis that is locally defined for each element. The obtained discretization is globally continuous, and for nonlinear problems it needs a stabilization which is provided by \new{a monolithic convex limiting strategy extended from \cite{Abgrall_BP_PAMPA}}. This is applied to both point and average values of the discrete solution. We show applications to scalar problems, as well as to the acoustics and Euler equations in two dimension. The accuracy and the robustness of the proposed schemes are assessed against a suite of benchmarks involving smooth solutions, shock waves and other discontinuities.</description>

      <title>A note on indefinite matrix splitting and preconditioning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01554v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The solution of systems of linear(ized) equations lies at the heart of many problems in Scientific Computing. In particular for systems of large dimension, iterative methods are a primary approach. Stationary iterative methods are generally based on a matrix splitting, whereas for polynomial iterative methods such as Krylov subspace iteration, the splitting matrix is the preconditioner. The smoother in a multigrid method is generally a stationary or polynomial iteration. Here we consider real symmetric indefinite and complex Hermitian indefinite coefficient matrices and prove that no splitting matrix can lead to a contractive stationary iteration unless the inertia is exactly preserved. This has consequences for preconditioning for indefinite systems and smoothing for multigrid as we further describe.</description>

      <title>Mass conservation, positivity and energy identical-relation preserving scheme for the Navier-Stokes equations with variable density</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.00405v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider a mass conservation, positivity and energy identical-relation preserving scheme for the Navier-Stokes equations with variable density. Utilizing the square transformation, we first ensure the positivity of the numerical fluid density, which is form-invariant and regardless of the discrete scheme. Then, by proposing a new recovery technique to eliminate the numerical dissipation of the energy and to balance the loss of the mass when approximating the reformation form, we preserve the original energy identical-relation and mass conservation of the proposed scheme. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that can preserve the original energy identical-relation for the Navier-Stokes equations with variable density. Moreover, the error estimates of the considered scheme are derived. Finally, we show some numerical examples to verify the correctness and efficiency.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.22813v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Complexes and cohomology, traditionally central to topology, have emerged as fundamental tools across applied mathematics and the sciences. This survey explores their roles in diverse areas, from partial differential equations and continuum mechanics to reformulations of the Einstein equations and network theory. Motivated by advances in compatible and structure-preserving discretisation such as Finite Element Exterior Calculus (FEEC), we examine how differential complexes encode critical properties such as existence, uniqueness, stability and rigidity of solutions to differential equations. We demonstrate that various fundamental concepts and models in solid and fluid mechanics are essentially formulated in terms of differential complexes.</description>

      <title>Subordination based approximation of Caputo fractional propagator and related numerical methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00958v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we propose an exponentially convergent numerical method for the Caputo fractional propagator $S_\alpha(t)$ and the associated mild solution of the Cauchy problem with time-independent sectorial operator coefficient $A$ and Caputo fractional derivative of order $\alpha \in (0,2)$ in time. The proposed methods are constructed by generalizing the earlier developed approximation of $S_\alpha(t)$ with help of the subordination principle. Such technique permits us to eliminate the dependence of the main part of error estimate on $\alpha$, while preserving other computationally relevant properties of the original approximation: native support for multilevel parallelism, the ability to handle initial data with minimal spatial smoothness, and stable exponential convergence for all $t \in [0, T]$. Ultimately, the use of subordination leads to a significant improvement of the method's convergence behavior, particularly for small $\alpha &lt; 0.5$, and opens up further opportunities for efficient data reuse. To validate theoretical results, we consider applications of the developed methods to the direct problem of solution approximation, as well as to the inverse problem of fractional order identification.</description>

      <title>The Empirical Spectral Distribution of i.i.d. Random Matrices with Random Perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21919v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Consider a $d\times d$ random matrix $\mathbf{M} :=\frac{1}{\sqrt{d}}\mathbf{W}+\mathbf{U}\mathbf{\Lambda}\mathbf{U}^*$, where the entries of $\mathbf{W}$ are i.i.d.\ complex variables with zero mean, unit variance, and finite fourth moment; $\mathbf{\Lambda}=\operatorname{diag}(\lambda_1, \lambda_2, \ldots, \lambda_r)$ is a diagonal matrix with $\lambda_1\ge\lambda_2\ge \ldots\ge \lambda_r&gt;1$ and $\mathbf{U}$ is uniformly drawn from the Stiefel manifold $\operatorname{Stief}(d,r)$ or its complex counterpart $\operatorname{Stief}_\mathbb{C}(d,r)$. We propose three results: (i) We show that the top $r$ eigenvalues of $\mathbf{M}$ concentrate around $\lambda_1,\lambda_2,\ldots,\lambda_r$, respectively, and the magnitude of the $(r{+}1)$-th eigenvalue concentrates around $1$. (ii) For the case $r=1$ (i.e., $\mathbf{M}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{d}}\mathbf{W}+\lambda\mathbf{u}\mathbf{u}^*$), we prove that the top eigenvector (namely $\mathbf{v}_1(\mathbf{M})$) aligns with $\mathbf{u}$ in the sense that $\left|\langle\mathbf{v}_1(\mathbf{M}), \mathbf{u}\rangle\right|$ converges to a limit which depends on $\lambda$ (in probability). (iii) In applications, we present the first optimal \textit{query complexity} lower bound for approximating the top eigenvector of asymmetric matrices. We show that for every $\operatorname{gap}=\frac{\lambda-1}{\lambda}\in (0,1/2]$, then $\operatorname{gap}(\mathbf{M})=\Omega(\operatorname{gap})$ with high probability, and if a matrix-vector product algorithm can identify a vector $\hat{\mathbf{v}}$ which satisfies $\left\|\hat{\mathbf{v}}-\mathbf{v}_1(\mathbf{M}) \right\|_2^2\le \operatorname{const}\times \operatorname{gap}$, it needs at least $\mathcal{O}\left(\frac{\log d}{\operatorname{gap}}\right)$ queries of matrix-vector products.</description>

      <title>High Probability Complexity Bounds of Trust-Region Stochastic Sequential Quadratic Programming with Heavy-Tailed Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19091v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider nonlinear optimization problems with a stochastic objective and deterministic equality constraints. We propose a Trust-Region Stochastic Sequential Quadratic Programming (TR-SSQP) method and establish its high-probability iteration complexity bounds for identifying first- and second-order $\epsilon$-stationary points. In our algorithm, we assume that exact objective values, gradients, and Hessians are not directly accessible but can be estimated via zeroth-, first-, and second-order probabilistic oracles. Compared to existing complexity studies of SSQP methods that rely on a zeroth-order oracle with sub-exponential tail noise (i.e., light-tailed) and focus mostly on first-order stationarity, our analysis accommodates irreducible and heavy-tailed noise in the zeroth-order oracle and significantly extends the analysis to second-order stationarity. We show that under heavy-tailed noise conditions, our SSQP method achieves the same high-probability first-order iteration complexity bounds as in the light-tailed noise setting, while further exhibiting promising second-order iteration complexity bounds. Specifically, the method identifies a first-order $\epsilon$-stationary point in $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-2})$ iterations and a second-order $\epsilon$-stationary point in $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-3})$ iterations with high probability, provided that $\epsilon$ is lower bounded by a constant determined by the irreducible noise level in estimation. We validate our theoretical findings and evaluate the practical performance of our method on CUTEst benchmark test set.</description>

      <title>Data-driven construction of a generalized kinetic collision operator from molecular dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24208v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a data-driven approach to learn a generalized kinetic collision operator directly from molecular dynamics. Unlike the conventional (e.g., Landau) models, the present operator takes an anisotropic form that accounts for a second energy transfer arising from the collective interactions between the pair of collision particles and the environment. Numerical results show that preserving the broadly overlooked anisotropic nature of the collision energy transfer is crucial for predicting the plasma kinetics with non-negligible correlations, where the Landau model shows limitations.</description>
