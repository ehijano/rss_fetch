      <title>Investigation of thermal properties of Hulth\'{e}n potential from statistical and superstatistical perspectives with various distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03962v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Hulth\'{e}n potential is a short-range potential that has been widely used in various fields of physics. In this paper, we investigate the distribution functions for the Hulth\'{e}n potential by using statistical and superstatistical methods. We first review the ordinary statistics and superstatistics methods. We then consider some distribution functions, such as uniform, 2-level, gamma, and log-normal and F distributions. Finally, we investigate the behavior of the Hulth\'{e}n potential for statistical and superstatistical methods and compare the results with each other. We use the Tsallis statistics of the superstatistical system. We conclude that the Tsallis behavior of different distribution functions for the Hulth\'{e}n potential exhibits better results than the statistical method. We examined the thermal properties of the Hulth\'{e}n potential for five different distributions: Uniform, 2-level, Gamma, Log-normal, and F. We plotted the Helmholtz free energy and the entropy as functions of temperature for various values of q. It shows that the two uniform and 2-level distributions have the same results due to the universal relationship and that the F distribution does not become ordinary statistics at q=1. It also reveals that the curves of the Helmholtz free energy and the entropy change their order and behavior as q increases and that some distributions disappear or coincide at certain values of q. One can discuss the physical implications of our results and their applications in nuclear and atomic physics in the future.</description>

      <title>Thermal quasi-particle theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The widely used thermal Hartree-Fock (HF) theory is generalized to include the effect of electron correlation while maintaining its quasi-independent-particle framework. An electron-correlated internal energy (or grand potential) is defined by the second-order finite-temperature many-body perturbation theory (MBPT), which then dictates the corresponding thermal orbital (quasi-particle) energies in such a way that all thermodynamic relations are obeyed. The associated density matrix is of the one-electron type, whose diagonal elements take the form of the Fermi-Dirac distribution functions, when the grand potential is minimized. The formulas for the entropy and chemical potential are unchanged from those of Fermi-Dirac or thermal HF theory. The theory thus postulates a finite-temperature extension of the second-order Dyson self-energy of one-particle many-body Green's function theory and can be viewed as a second-order, diagonal, frequency-independent, thermal inverse Dyson equation. At low temperature, the theory approaches finite-temperature MBPT of the same order, but it outperforms the latter at intermediate temperature by including additional electron-correlation effects through orbital energies. A physical meaning of these thermal orbital energies (including that of thermal HF orbital energies, which has been elusive) is proposed.</description>

      <title>Structural transitions of calcium carbonate by molecular dynamics simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Calcium carbonate plays a crucial role in the global carbon cycle, and its phase diagram has always been of significant scientific interest. In this study, we used molecular dynamics (MD) to investigate several structural phase transitions of calcium carbonate. Using the Raiteri potential model, we explored the structural transitions occurring at a constant pressure of 1 bar with temperatures ranging from 300 K to 2500 K, and at a constant temperature of 1600 K with pressures ranging from 0 to 13 GPa. At increasing temperatures, the transitions calcite, CaCO$_3$-IV, and CaCO$_3$-V are observed and characterized. Within the calcite structure, CO$_3^{2-}$ ions are ordered between layers. As temperature increases, the calcite to CaCO$_3$-IV transition occurs, determining the partial disordering of CO$_3^{2-}$ ions. At a higher temperature, CaCO$_3$-IV transforms into CaCO$_3$-V. By applying free energy analysis, we have classified the last transition as a continuous order-disorder phase transition. At a temperature of 2000 K, it appears a `disordered CaCO$_3$' structure, characterized by low order within the calcium and carbonate sublattices and the free rotation of CO$_3^{2-}$ ions. At increasing pressures, two calcium carbonate transformations were observed. At $P=$ 2 GPa, the CaCO$_3$-IV phase undergoes a phase transition into CaCO$_3$-V, demonstrating that the model can describe the transition between these two phases as pressure and temperature-driven. Another phase transition was detected at $P=$ 4.25 GPa -- CaCO$_3$-V transits into the recently discovered CaCO$_3$-Vb phase. This transition is classified as a first-order phase transition by structural analysis and free energy-based arguments.</description>

      <title>Symmetry induced enhancement in finite-time thermodynamic trade-off relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Symmetry imposes constraints on open quantum systems, affecting the dissipative properties in nonequilibrium processes. Superradiance is a typical example in which the decay rate of the system is enhanced via a collective system-bath coupling that respects permutation symmetry. Such model has also been applied to heat engines. However, a generic framework that addresses the impact of symmetry in finite-time thermodynamics is not well established. Here, we show a symmetry-based framework that describes the fundamental limit of collective enhancement in finite-time thermodynamics. Specifically, we derive a general upper bound on the average jump rate, which quantifies the fundamental speed set by thermodynamic speed limits and trade-off relations. We identify the symmetry condition which achieves the obtained bound, and explicitly construct an open quantum system model that goes beyond the enhancement realized by the conventional superradiance model.</description>

      <title>Beyond Nearest-neighbour Universality of Spectral Fluctuations in Quantum Chaotic and Complex Many-body Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04345v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Discerning chaos in quantum systems is an important problem as the usual route of Lyapunov exponents in classical systems is not straightforward in quantum systems. A standard route is the comparison of statistics derived from model physical systems to those from random matrix theory (RMT) ensembles, of which the most popular is the nearest-neighbour-spacings distribution (NNSD), which almost always shows good agreement with chaotic quantum systems. However, even in these cases, the long-range statistics (like number variance, spectral rigidity etc.), which are also more difficult to calculate, often show disagreements with RMT. As such, a more stringent test for chaos in quantum systems, via an analysis of intermediate-range statistics is needed, which will additionally assess the extent of agreement with RMT universality. In this paper, we deduce the effective level-repulsion parameters and the corresponding Wigner-surmise-like results of the next-nearest-neighbor spacing distribution (nNNSD) for integrable systems (semi-Poissonian statistics) as well as the three classical quantum-chaotic Wigner-Dyson regimes, by stringent comparisons to numerical RMT models and benchmarking against our exact analytical results for $3\times 3$ Gaussian matrix models, along with a semi-analytical form for the nNNSD in the Orthogonal-to-Unitary symmetry crossover. To illustrate the robustness of these RMT based results, we test these predictions against the nNNSD obtained from quantum chaotic models as well as disordered lattice spin models. This reinforces the Bohigas-Giannoni-Schmit and the Berry-Tabor conjectures, extending the associated universality to longer range statistics. In passing, we also highlight the equivalence of nNNSD in the apparently distinct Orthogonal-to-Unitary and diluted-Symplectic-to-Unitary crossovers.</description>

      <title>Cumulants and large deviations for the linear statistics of the one-dimensional trapped Riesz gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04437v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the classical trapped Riesz gas, i.e., $N$ particles at positions $x_i$ in one dimension with a repulsive power law interacting potential $\propto 1/|x_i-x_j|^{k}$, with $k&gt;-2$, in an external confining potential of the form $V(x) \sim |x|^n$. We focus on the equilibrium Gibbs state of the gas, for which the density has a finite support $[-\ell_0/2,\ell_0/2]$. We study the fluctuations of the linear statistics ${\cal L}_N = \sum_{i=1}^N f(x_i)$ in the large $N$ limit for smooth functions $f(x)$. We obtain analytic formulae for the cumulants of ${\cal L}_N$ for general $k&gt;-2$. For long range interactions, i.e. $k&lt;1$, which include the log-gas ($k \to 0$) and the Coulomb gas ($k =-1$) these are obtained for monomials $f(x)= |x|^m$. For short range interactions, i.e. $k&gt;1$, which include the Calogero-Moser model, i.e. $k=2$, we compute the third cumulant of ${\cal L}_N$ for general $f(x)$ and arbitrary cumulants for monomials $f(x)= |x|^m$. We also obtain the large deviation form of the probability distribution of ${\cal L}_N$, which exhibits an "evaporation transition" where the fluctuation of ${\cal L}_N$ is dominated by the one of the largest $x_i$. In addition, in the short range case, we extend our results to a (non-smooth) indicator function $f(x)$, obtaining thereby the higher order cumulants for the full counting statistics of the number of particles in an interval $[-L/2,L/2]$. We show in particular that they exhibit an interesting scaling form as $L/2$ approaches the edge of the gas $L/\ell_0 \to 1$, which we relate to the large deviations of the emptiness probability of the complementary interval on the real line.</description>

      <title>Diffusive hydrodynamics from long-range correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04502v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the hydrodynamic theory, the non-equilibrium dynamics of a many-body system is approximated, at large scales of space and time, by irreversible relaxation to local entropy maximisation. This results in a convective equation corrected by viscous or diffusive terms in a gradient expansion, such as the Navier-Stokes equations. Diffusive terms are evaluated using the Kubo formula, and possibly arising from an emergent noise due to discarded microscopic degrees of freedom. In one dimension of space, diffusive scaling is often broken as noise leads to super-diffusion. But in linearly degenerate hydrodynamics, such as that of integrable models, diffusive behaviors are observed, and it has long be thought that the standard diffusive picture remains valid. In this letter, we show that in such systems, the Navier-Stokes equation breaks down beyond linear response. We demonstrate that diffusive-order corrections do not take the form of a gradient expansion. Instead, they are completely determined by ballistic transport of initial-state fluctuations, and obtained from the non-local two-point correlations recently predicted by the ballistic macroscopic fluctuation theory (BMFT); the resulting hydrodynamic equations are reversible. To do so, we establish a regularised fluctuation theory, putting on a firm basis the recent idea that ballistic transport of initial-state fluctuations determines fluctuations and correlations beyond the Euler scale. This extends the idea of "diffusion from convection" previously developed to explain the Kubo formula in integrable systems, to generic non-equilibrium settings.</description>

      <title>Nonuniversality in random criticality</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.04548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider $N$ two-dimensional Ising models coupled in presence of quenched disorder and use scale invariant scattering theory to exactly show the presence of a line of renormalization group fixed points for any fixed value of $N$ other than 1. We show how this result relates to perturbative studies and sheds light on numerical simulations. We also observe that the limit $N\to 1$ may be of interest for the Ising spin glass, and point out potential relevance for nonuniversality in other contexts of random criticality.</description>

      <title>Time-cost-error trade-off relation in thermodynamics: The third law and beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04576v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Elucidating the fundamental limitations inherent in physical systems is a central subject in physics. For important thermodynamic operations such as information erasure, cooling, and copying, resources like time and energetic cost must be expended to achieve the desired outcome within a predetermined error margin. In this study, we introduce the concept of {\it separated states}, which consist of fully unoccupied and occupied states. This concept generalizes many critical states involved in relevant thermodynamic operations. We uncover a three-way trade-off relation between {\it time}, {\it cost}, and {\it error} for a general class of thermodynamic operations aimed at creating separated states, simply expressed as $\tau{\cal C}\varepsilon_{\tau}\ge 1-\eta$. This fundamental relation is applicable to diverse thermodynamic operations, including information erasure, cooling, and copying. It provides a profound quantification of the unattainability principle in the third law of thermodynamics in a general form. Building upon this relation, we explore the quantitative limitations governing cooling operations, the preparation of separated states, and a no-go theorem for exact classical copying. Furthermore, we extend these findings to the quantum regime, encompassing both Markovian and non-Markovian dynamics. Specifically, within Lindblad dynamics, we derive a similar three-way trade-off relation that quantifies the cost of achieving a pure state with a given error. The generalization to general quantum dynamics involving a system coupled to a finite bath implies that heat dissipation becomes infinite as the quantum system is exactly cooled down to the ground state or perfectly reset to a pure state, thereby resolving an open question regarding the thermodynamic cost of information erasure.</description>

      <title>Generalizations of Kitaev's honeycomb model from braided fusion categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04006v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fusion surface models, as introduced by Inamura and Ohmori, extend the concept of anyon chains to 2+1 dimensions, taking fusion 2-categories as their input. In this work, we construct and analyze fusion surface models on the honeycomb lattice built from braided fusion 1-categories. These models preserve mutually commuting plaquette operators and anomalous 1-form symmetries. Their Hamiltonian is chosen to mimic the structure of Kitaev's honeycomb model, which is unitarily equivalent to the Ising fusion surface model. In the anisotropic limit, where one coupling constant is dominant, the fusion surface models reduce to Levin-Wen string-nets. In the isotropic limit, they are described by weakly coupled anyon chains and are likely to realize chiral topological order. We focus on three specific examples: (i) Kitaev's honeycomb model with a perturbation breaking time-reversal symmetry that realizes chiral Ising topological order, (ii) a $\mathbb{Z}_N$ generalization proposed by Barkeshli et al., which potentially realizes chiral parafermion topological order, and (iii) a novel Fibonacci honeycomb model featuring a non-invertible 1-form symmetry.</description>

Abstract: In this study, we uncover the intrinsic information processes in non-Hermitian quantum systems and their thermodynamic effects. We demonstrate that these systems can exhibit negative entropy production, making them potential candidates for information engines. We also identify a key informational quantity that can characterize phase transitions beyond the reach of traditional partition functions. This work enhances our understanding of the interplay between information and thermodynamics, providing a new perspective on non-Hermitian quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Strong-to-weak symmetry breaking states in stochastic dephasing stabilizer circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04241v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Discovering mixed state quantum orders is an on-going issue. Recently, it has been recognized that there are (at least) two kinds of symmetries in the mixed state; strong and weak symmetries. Under symmetry-respective decoherence, spontaneous strong-to-weak symmetry breaking (SSSB) can occur. This work provides a scheme to describe SSSB and other decoherence phenomena in the mixed state by employing the stabilizer formalism and the efficient numerical algorithm of Clifford circuits. We present two systematic numerical studies. In a two-dimensional (2D) circuit with a stochastic Ising type decoherence, an SSSB phase transition is clearly observed and its criticality is elucidated by the numerical methods. In particular, we calculate R\'{e}nyi-2 correlations and estimate critical exponents of the SSSB transition. For the second system, we introduce an idea of subsystem SSSB. As an example, we study a system with symmetry-protected-topological (SPT) order provided by both one-form and zero-form symmetries, and observe how the system evolves under decoherence. After displaying numerical results, we show that viewpoint of percolation is quite useful to understand the SSSB transition, which is applicable for a wide range of decohered states. Finally, we comment on SSSB of one-form-symmetry exemplifying toric code.</description>

      <title>Localized RG flows on composite defects and $\mathcal{C}$-theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04428v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a composite defect system where a lower-dimensional defect (sub-defect) is embedded to a higher-dimensional one, and examine renormalization group (RG) flows localized on the defect. A composite defect is constructed in the $(3-\epsilon)$-dimensional free $\text{O}(N)$ vector model with line and surface interactions by triggering localized RG flows to non-trivial IR fixed points. Focusing on the case where the symmetry group $\text{O}(N)$ is broken to a subgroup $\text{O}(m)\times\text{O}(N-m)$ on the line defect, there is an $\text{O}(N)$ symmetric fixed point for all $N$, while two additional $\text{O}(N)$ symmetry breaking ones appear for $N\ge 23$. We also examine a $\mathcal{C}$-theorem for localized RG flows along the sub-defect and show that the $\mathcal{C}$-theorem holds in our model by perturbative calculations.</description>

      <title>Edge modes of topologically ordered systems as emergent integrable flows: Robustness of algebraic structures in nonlinear quantum fluid dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04451v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In these decades, it has been gradually established that edge modes of a wide class of topologically ordered systems are governed by the bulk-edge correspondence and anyon condensation. The former has been studied many times because it can be summarized as the correspondence between conformal field theory and topological quantum field theory, but the latter has captured attention more recently because it suggests that one can deform the theories from one to another condensable or Witt equivalent. We reinterpret this phenomenon as the appearance of integrable flow at the edges of a topologically ordered system. By revisiting the existing phenomena from this view, one can relate the anyon condensation to the existing formalism of integrable models and their renormalization group flow. Moreover, we observe the robustness of the bulk-edge correspondence even under the existence of irrelevant perturbations at the edges. This formulation can enable one to analyze edge modes at the level of quantum fluid (non-linear) dynamics, or mixed state topological order even in non-Hermitian systems. Moreover, especially in the study of a class of non-Hermitian systems, we show a fundamental necessity to revisit Rogers-Ramanujan type identities as an appearance of the hidden (fractional) supersymmetric model which has a close relation to string field theories. Our view can give a unified paradigm to study edge modes of topologically ordered systems at the level of their dynamics potentially in both Hermitian and non-Hermitian systems.</description>

      <title>How to escape atypical regions in the symmetric binary perceptron: a journey through connected-solutions states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04479v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the binary symmetric perceptron model, and in particular its atypical solutions. While the solution-space of this problem is dominated by isolated configurations~\cite{aubin2019storage}, it is also solvable for a certain range of constraint density $\alpha$ and threshold $\kappa$. We provide in this paper a statistical measure probing sequences of solutions, where two consecutive elements shares a strong overlap. After simplifications, we test its predictions by comparing it to Monte-Carlo simulations. We obtain good agreement and show that connected states with a Markovian correlation profile can fully decorrelate from their initialization only for $\kappa&gt;\kappa_{\rm no-mem.\, state}$ ($\kappa_{\rm no-mem.\, state}\sim \sqrt{0.91\log(N)}$ for $\alpha=0.5$ and $N$ being the dimension of the problem). For $\kappa&lt;\kappa_{\rm no-mem.\, state}$, we show that decorrelated sequences still exist but have a non-trivial correlations profile. To study this regime we introduce an $Ansatz$ for the correlations that we label as the nested Markov chain.</description>

      <title>Information gain at the onset of habituation to repeated stimuli</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.12812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.12812v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Biological and living systems process information across spatiotemporal scales, exhibiting the hallmark ability to constantly modulate their behavior to ever-changing and complex environments. In the presence of repeated stimuli, a distinctive response is the progressive reduction of the activity at both sensory and molecular levels, known as habituation. Here, we solve a minimal microscopic model devoid of biological details to show that habituation is driven by negative feedback provided by a slow storage mechanism. Crucially, an intermediate level of habituation is associated with a steep increase in the information that the system collects on the external input over time. We find that the region characterized both by maximal information gain and by the onset of habituation can be retrieved if the system tunes its parameters to minimize dissipation and maximize information at the same time. We test our dynamical predictions against experimentally recorded neural responses in a zebrafish larva subjected to repeated looming stimulation. Our work makes a fundamental step towards uncovering the core mechanisms that shape habituation in biological systems, elucidating its information-theoretic and functional role.</description>

      <title>Geometric theory of (extended) time-reversal symmetries in stochastic processes -- Part I: finite dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.04217v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we analyze three classes of time-reversal of a Markov process with Gaussian noise on a manifold. We first unveil a commutativity constraint for the most general of these time-reversals to be well defined. Then we give a triad of necessary and sufficient conditions for the stochastic process to be time-reversible. While most reversibility conditions in the literature require knowledge of the stationary probability, our conditions do not, and therefore can be analytically checked in a systematic way. We then show that the mathematical objects whose cancellation is required by our reversibility conditions play the role of independent sources of entropy production. Furthermore, we give a geometric interpretation of the so-called irreversible cycle-affinity as the vorticity of a certain vector field for a Riemannian geometry given by the diffusion tensor. We also discuss the relation between the time-reversability of the stochastic process and that of an associated deterministic dynamics: its Stratonovitch average. Finally, we show that a suitable choice of a reference measure - that can be considered as a prior or a gauge, depending on the context - allows to study a stochastic process in a way that is both coordinate-free and independent of the prescription used to define stochastic integrals. When this reference measure plays the role of a gauge choice, we interpret our previous results through the lens of gauge theory and prove them to be gauge-invariant.</description>

      <title>On Gibbs Equilibrium and Hillert Nonequilibrium Thermodynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.14231v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: During his time at Royal Institute of Technology (Kungliga Tekniska Hogskolan, KTH) in Sweden, the present author learned nonequilibrium thermodynamics from Mats Hillert. The key concepts are the separation of internal and external variables of a system and the definitions of potentials and molar quantities. In equilibrium thermodynamics derived by Gibbs, the internal variables are not independent and can be fully evaluated from given external variables. While irreversible thermodynamics led by Onsager focuses on internal variables though often mixed with external variables. Hillert integrated them together by first emphasizing their differences and then examining their connections. His philosophy was reflected by the title of his book "Phase Equilibria, Phase Diagrams and Phase Transformations" that puts equilibrium, nonequilibrium, and internal processes on equal footing. In the present paper honoring Hillert, the present author reflects his experiences with Hillert and his work in last 40 years and expresses his gratitude for all the wisdom and support from him in terms of "Hillert nonequilibrium thermodynamics" and discusses some recent topics that the present author has been working on.</description>

      <title>Consistent expansion of the Langevin propagator with application to entropy production</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13855v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stochastic thermodynamics is a developing theory for systems out of thermal equilibrium. It allows to formulate a wealth of nontrivial relations among thermodynamic quantities such as heat dissipation, excess work, and entropy production in generic nonequilibrium stochastic processes. A key quantity for the derivation of these relations is the propagator - the probability to observe a transition from one point in phase space to another after a given time. Here, applying stochastic Taylor expansions, we devise a formal expansion procedure for the propagator of overdamped Langevin dynamics. The three leading orders are obtained explicitly. The technique resolves the shortcomings of the current mathematical machinery for the calculation of the propagator. For the evaluation of the first two displacement cumulants, the leading order Gaussian propagator is sufficient. However, some functionals of the propagator, such as the entropy production, which we refer to as "first derivatives of the trajectory", need to be evaluated to a previously-unrecognized higher order. The method presented here can be extended to arbitrarily higher orders in order to accurately compute any other functional of the propagator.</description>

      <title>Quantum Thermodynamic Integrability for Canonical and non-Canonical Statistics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08344v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Abstract We extend the Carath\'{e}odory principle of the Second Law to quantum thermodynamics with energy levels depending on macroscopic variables, such as volume and magnetic field. This extension introduces the concept of Quantum Thermodynamic Integrability (QTI), offering an alternative foundation for statistical mechanics. QTI is characterized by the path-independence of work and heat within the thermodynamic manifold, which is locally described by energy levels and specific thermodynamic parameters. Within this framework, temperature naturally emerges as an integrating factor, allowing for the derivation of both canonical and non-canonical states from the Entropy Integrable Equations (EIE) based on QTI. Notably, non-canonical states, which become particularly significant outside the thermodynamic limit, reveal the existence of informational correlations in finite-size thermodynamic systems.</description>

      <title>From logarithmic delocalization of the six-vertex height function under sloped boundary conditions to weakened crossing probability estimates for the Ashkin-Teller, generalized random-cluster, and $(q_{\sigma},q_{\tau})$-cubic models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.14934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.14934v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To obtain Russo-Seymour-Welsh estimates for the height function of the six-vertex model under sloped boundary conditions, which can be leveraged to demonstrate that the height function logarithmically delocalizes under a broader class of boundary conditions, we formulate crossing probability estimates in strips of the square lattice and the cylinder, for parameters satisfying $a\equiv b$, $c \in [1,2]$, and $\mathrm{max} \{ a , b \} \leq c$, in which each of the first two conditions respectively relate to invariance under vertical and diagonal reflections enforced through the symmetry $\sigma \xi \geq -\xi$ for domains in strips of the square lattice, and satisfaction of FKG, for the height function and for its absolute value. To determine whether arguments for estimating crossing probabilities of the height function for flat boundary conditions from a recent work due to Duminil-Copin, Karila, Manolescu, and Oulamara remain applicable for sloped boundary conditions, from the set of possible slopes given by the interior of the set of rational points from $[-1,1] \times [-1,1]$, we analyze sloped Gibbs states, which do not have infinitely many disjointly oriented circuits. In comparison to Russo-Seymour-Welsh arguments for flat boundary conditions, arguments for sloped boundary conditions present additional complications for both planar and cylindrical settings, in which crossing events that are considered in the strip, and then extended to the annulus and cylinder, must be maintained across rectangles of large aspect ratio, in spite of the fact that some proportion of faces within the strip freeze with positive probability.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.11108v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show how the stability conditions for a system of interacting fermions that conventionally involve variations of thermodynamic potentials can be rewritten in terms of one- and two-particle correlators. We illustrate the applicability of this alternative formulation in a multi-orbital model of strongly correlated electrons at finite temperatures, inspecting the lowest eigenvalues of the generalized local charge susceptibility in proximity of the phase-separation region. Additionally to the conventional unstable branches, we address unstable solutions possessing a positive, rather than negative compressibility. Our stability conditions require no derivative of free energy functions with conceptual and practical advantages for actual calculations and offer a clear-cut criterion for analyzing the thermodynamics of correlated complex systems.</description>

      <title>Random pure Gaussian states and Hawking radiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.10562v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A black hole evaporates by Hawking radiation. Each mode of that radiation is thermal. If the total state is nevertheless to be pure, modes must be entangled. Estimating the minimum size of this entanglement has been an important outstanding issue. We develop a new theory of constrained random symplectic transformations, based on that the total state is pure and Gaussian with given marginals. In the random constrained symplectic model we then compute the distribution of mode-mode correlations, from which we bound mode-mode entanglement. Modes of frequency much larger than $\frac{k_B T_{H}(t)}{\hbar}$ are not populated at time $t$ and drop out of the analysis.Among the other modes we find that correlations and hence entanglement between relatively thinly populated modes (early-time high-frequency modes and/or late modes of any frequency) to be strongly suppressed. Relatively highly populated modes (early-time low-frequency modes) can on the other hand be strongly correlated, but a detailed analysis reveals that they are nevertheless very unlikely to be entangled. Our analysis hence establishes that restoring unitarity after a complete evaporation of a black hole does not require any significant quantum entanglement between any pair of Hawking modes. Our analysis further gives exact general expressions for the distribution of mode-mode correlations in random, pure, Gaussian states with given marginals, which may have applications beyond black hole physics.</description>

      <title>Chaotic and Thermal Aspects in the Highly Excited String S-Matrix</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.02127v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compute tree level scattering amplitudes involving more than one highly excited states and tachyons in bosonic string theory. We use these amplitudes to understand chaotic and thermal aspects of the excited string states lending support to the Susskind-Horowitz-Polchinski correspondence principle. The unaveraged amplitudes exhibit chaos in the resonance distribution as a function of kinematic parameters, which can be described by random matrix theory. Upon coarse-graining these amplitudes are shown to exponentiate, and capture various thermal features, including features of a stringy version of the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis as well as notions of typicality. Further, we compute the effective string form factor corresponding to the highly excited states, and argue for the random walk behaviour of the long strings.</description>
