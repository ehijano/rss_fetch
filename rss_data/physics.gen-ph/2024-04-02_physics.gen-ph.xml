      <title>Negative-energy and tachyonic solutions in the Weinberg-Tucker-Hammer equation for spin 1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We considered Weinberg-like equations in the article [1] in order to construct the Feynman-Dyson propagator for the spin-1 particles. This construction is based on the concept of the Weinberg field as a system of four field functions differing by parity and by dual transformations. We also analyzed the recent controversy in the definitions of the Feynman-Dyson propagator for the field operator containing the S=1/2 self/anti-self charge conjugate states in the papers by D. Ahluwalia et al and by W. Rodrigues Jr. et al. The solution to this mathematical controversy is obvious. I proposed the necessary doubling of the Fock Space (as in the Barut and Ziino works), thus extending the corresponding Clifford Algebra. Meanwhile, the N. Debergh et al article considered our old ideas of doubling the Dirac equation, and other forms of T- and PT-conjugation [5]. Both algebraic equation Det (\hat p - m) =0 and Det (\hat p + m) =0 for u- and v- 4-spinors have solutions with p_0= \pm E_p =\pm \sqrt{{\bf p}^2 +m^2}. The same is true for higher-spin equations (or they may even have more complicated dispersion relations). Meanwhile, every book considers the equality p_0=E_p for both u- and v- spinors of the (1/2,0)\oplus (0,1/2)) representation only, thus applying the Dirac-Feynman-Stueckelberg procedure for elimination of negative-energy solutions. It seems, that it is imposible to consider the relativistic quantum mechanics appropriately without negative energies, tachyons and appropriate forms of the discrete symmetries.</description>

      <title>The 1932 Majorana equation: a forgotten but surprisingly modern particle theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01357v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Standard Model is an up-to-date theory that best summarizes current knowledge in particle physics. Although some problems still remain open, it represents the leading model which all physicists refer to. One of the pillars which underpin the Standard Model is represented by the Lorentz invariance of the equations that form its backbone. These equations made it possible to predict the existence of particles and phenomena that experimental physics had not yet been able to detect. The first hint of formulating a fundamental theory of particles can be found in the 1932 Majorana equation, formulated when electrons and protons were the only known particles. Today we know that parts of the hypotheses set by Majorana were not correct, but his equation hid concepts that are found in the Standard Model. In this study, the Majorana equation is revisited and solved for free particles. The time-like, light-like and space-like solutions, represented by infinite-component wave functions, are discussed. Furthermore, by introducing subsidiary conditions on the mass term, it is possible to quantize both the fermionic and the bosonic towers, obtaining the mass spectrum of the entire family of charged leptons, baryons and mesons.</description>

      <title>The physical basis of teleological evolutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.18927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.18927v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is easily seen that the mere existence of an optimal quantum computational speedup logically implies the mutually exclusive or of well-defined causal loops. In each of them, it is as if the problem-solver knew in advance one of the possible halves of the information about the solution she will produce and measure in the future and used this knowledge to produce the solution with correspondingly fewer computation steps. Involving only the measurements of commuting observables, quantum algorithms are submitted to the same (classical) logic and should therefore host the quantum superposition of the causal loops in question. However, being causal in character, their ordinary quantum description cannot describe causal loops. We argue that it must therefore be incomplete and show that it is completed by time-symmetrizing it. This leaves the ordinary quantum description mathematically unaltered but replaces its single causal process by the quantum superposition of causal loops in question. In their completed quantum description, quantum algorithms respond to the pre-scientific notion of teleological evolution, that is, an evolution toward a goal (the solution) with an attractor in the goal it will produce in the future (the solution again). Once applied to the evolutions of the living, this notion was dismissed with the advent of modern science for the alleged absence of a physical basis. We show that, under a quantum cosmological interpretation of the Anthropic Principle, the same quantum superposition of causal loops underlying the teleological character of quantum algorithms becomes the missing physical basis of the teleological character of natural evolutions.</description>

      <title>In-Depth Search for a Coupling between Gravity and Electromagnetism with Steady Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.15640v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Any means to control gravity like electromagnetism is currently out of reach by many orders of magnitude even under extreme laboratory conditions. Some often poorly executed experiments or pseudoscience theories appear from time to time claiming for example anomalous forces from capacitors that suggest a connection between the two fields. We developed novel and high resolution horizontal-, vertical- and rotation-balances that allow to test electric devices completely shielded and remotely controlled under high vacuum conditions to perform the first in-depth search for such a coupling using steady fields. Our testing included a variety of capacitors of different shapes and compositions as well as for the first-time solenoids and tunneling currents from Zener diodes and varistors. A comprehensive coupling-scheme table was used to test almost all combinations including capacitors and solenoids with permittivity and permeability gradients as well as capacitors and varistors within crossed magnetic fields. We also tested a crossed-coil producing helical magnetic field lines as well as interactions between a pair of shielded toroidal coils to look for proposed extensions to Maxwell's equations. No anomalous forces or torques down to the Nanonewton or Nanonewton-Meter range were found providing new limits many orders of magnitude below previous assessments ruling out claims or theories and providing a basis for future research on the topic.</description>

      <title>Quantum number conservation in meson interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07962v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum number descriptions of spin-zero mesons are obtained from their quark/anti-quark structures, extending the application of the already established seven quantum number conservation in fermion interactions to include mesons. This provides a new tool in the design of experiments and the analysis of results, making it particularly useful for those interactions that involve neutral mesons. One quantum number is parity, conflicting with the evidence for parity non-conservation. The origin of this disagreement is identified as the poor definition of parity in the Standard Model. It is shown that neutral mesons can produce inter-generational interactions, providing an alternative to the see-saw mechanism.</description>
