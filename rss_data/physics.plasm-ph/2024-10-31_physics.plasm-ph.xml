      <title>Resistive tearing: numerical exploration of nonmodal effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23309v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The fluid dynamics community has found success in explaining both the onset and coherent structure formation in wall-bounded turbulence through examining transient growth and pseudoresonance. Whether similar effects are important in plasmas well-described by magnetohydrodynamics is an open question. In nuclear fusion experiments, the onset of turbulence often enhances undesirable heat transport between the core and the edge, and a vast number of studies have attempted to understand these phenomena via linear and nonlinear numerical codes. If there are plasma experiments where instabilities and turbulence onset are dominated by nonmodal effects, the tools of non-modal stability and resolvent analysis could prove to be essential to practitioners. Towards that goal, in this work we provide a detailed derivation of non-modal stability tools and the resolvent operator for incompressible, resistive magnetohydrodynamics (MHD). Concretely, optimal initial conditions that maximize transient growth are computed, along with bounds on linear transient growth, and are numerically verified with a nonlinear solver to show that these linear effects can be reproduced in nonlinear simulations. The potential of such initial conditions to initiate the tearing mode in a spectrally stable system is explored. We found the approach common in nonmodal hydrodynamic stability of using pseudospectral methods to be infeasible for many parameter combinations due to numerical ill-conditioning. Further, transient growth in the Harris current sheet proved to be highly norm-dependent, with the observed differences being of an order of magnitude. Nonlinear simulations showed that transient growth occurs to some extent in all norms, both in the infinitesimal as well as finite limit. No case was observed of transient growth being strong enough to trigger the full plasmoid instability.</description>

      <title>Multi-Physics Mathematical Model for Weakly-Ionized Plasma Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23314v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents a multidisciplinary mathematical model, as a set of coupled governing equations and auxiliary relations describing the fluid-flow, thermal, and electric fields of partially-ionized plasma with low magnetic Reynolds numbers. The model is generic enough to handle three-dimensionality, Hall effect, compressibility, and variability of fluid, thermal, and electric properties of the plasma. The model can be of interest to computational modelers aiming to build a solver that quantitatively assesses direct extraction of electric energy from a plasma flow. Three different approaches are proposed to solve numerically for the electric fields with different levels of tolerance toward possible numerical instability encountered at a large Hall parameter, where the effective conductivity tensor loses diagonal dominance and becomes close to singular. A submodel for calculating the local electric properties of the plasma is presented in detail and is applied to demonstrate the effect of different factors on the electric conductivity, including the fuel's carbon/hydrogen ratio and the alkaline seed element that acts as the ionizing species. An analytical expression for the collision cross-section for argon is developed, such that this noble gas can be included as one of the gaseous species comprising the plasma.</description>

      <title>Dynamical structure factors of Warm Dense Matter from Time-Dependent Orbital-Free and Mixed-Stochastic-Deterministic Density Functional Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first calculations of the inelastic part of the dynamical structure factor (DSF) for warm dense matter (WDM) using Time-Dependent Orbital-Free Density Functional Theory (TD-OF-DFT) and Mixed-Stochastic-Deterministic (mixed) Kohn Sham TD-DFT (KS TD-DFT). WDM is an intermediate phase of matter found in planetary cores and laser-driven experiments, where the accurate calculation of the DSF is critical for interpreting X-ray Thomson scattering (XRTS) measurements. Traditional TD-DFT methods, while highly accurate, are computationally expensive, motivating the exploration of TD-OF-DFT and mixed TD-KS-DFT as more efficient alternatives. We applied these methods to experimentally measured WDM systems, including solid-density aluminum and beryllium, compressed beryllium, and carbon-hydrogen mixtures. Our results show that TD-OF-DFT requires a dynamical kinetic energy potential in order to qualitatively capture the plasmon response. Additionally, it struggles with capturing bound electron contributions and accurately modeling plasmon dynamics without the inclusion of a dynamic kinetic energy potential. In contrast, mixed TD-KS-DFT offers greater accuracy in distinguishing bound and free electron effects, aligning well with experimental data, though at a higher computational cost. This study highlights the trade-offs between computational efficiency and accuracy, demonstrating that TD-OF-DFT remains a valuable tool for rapid scans of parameter space, while mixed TD-KS-DFT should be preferred for high-fidelity simulations. Our findings provide insight into the future development of DFT methods for WDM and suggest potential improvements for TD-OF-DFT.</description>

      <title>Plasma Light As Diagnostic For Wakefields Driven By Developing Self-Modulation Of A Long Particle Bunch</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23817v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We outline plans to use plasma light emitted as atomic lines radiation as a diagnostic for wakefields driven in plasma by a self-modulating, long proton bunch. This diagnostic is built into the design of a new vapor/plasma source that will also allow for imposing a plasma density step of various height at various locations. Such a step of a few percent in relative density placed at a location where the self-modulation process grows is predicted by numerical simulations to make the bunch drive wakefields with GV/m amplitude over hundreds of meters of plasma.</description>

      <title>Piecewise Field-Aligned Finite Element Method for Multi-Mode Nonlinear Particle Simulations in tokamak plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23981v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach for simulating plasma instabilities in tokamak plasmas using the piecewise field-aligned finite element method in combination with the particle-in-cell method. Our method traditionally aligns the computational grid but defines the basis functions in piecewise field-aligned coordinates to avoid grid deformation while naturally representing the field-aligned mode structures. This scheme is formulated and implemented numerically. It also applied to the unstructured triangular meshes in principle. We have conducted linear benchmark tests, which agree well with previous results and traditional schemes. Furthermore, multiple-$n$ simulations are also carried out as a proof of principle, demonstrating the efficiency of this scheme in nonlinear turbulence simulations within the framework of the finite element method.</description>

      <title>Efficient optimization of plasma surface high harmonic generation by an improved Bayesian strategy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.24051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Plasma surface high-order harmonics generation (SHHG) driven by intense laser pulses on plasma targets enables a high-quality extreme ultraviolet source with high pulse energy and outstanding spatiotemporal coherence. Optimizing the performance of SHHG is important for its applications in single-shot imaging and absorption spectroscopy. In this work, we demonstrate the optimization of laser-driven SHHG by an improved Bayesian strategy in conjunction with particle-in-cell simulations. A traditional Bayesian algorithm is first employed to optimize the SHHG intensity in a two-dimensional space of parameter. Then an improved Bayesian strategy, using the Latin hypercube sampling technique and a dynamic acquisition strategy, is developed to overcome the curse of dimensionality and the risk of local optima in a high-dimensional space optimization. The improved Bayesian optimization approach is efficient and robust in three-dimensionally optimizing the harmonic ellipticity, paving the way for the upcoming SHHG experiments with a considerable repetition rate.</description>

      <title>Hall Transport of Charged Particles in Magnetic Disk Array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23930v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The concept of periodic structures has driven the development of advanced materials like photonic and phononic crystals. These metamaterials typically rely on complex repeating units or meta-atoms, limiting their adaptability after fabrication. To overcome this limitation, we introduce the concept of metafields, which are repeating patterns of local magnetic fields instead of material structures. Unlike metamaterials, which consist of atoms arranged in structured patterns, metafields focus on the patterns of fields alone, allowing for dynamic property adjustments through external electric currents. This study explores a specific metafield where the repeating pattern is the magnetic disk (MD), defined by a uniform magnetic field perpendicular to its surface. By arranging multiple MDs, we form a magnetic disk array (MDA) and theoretically investigate the charged particle dynamics within this array. Our analysis highlights Hall transport phenomena, such as Hall diffusivity, conductivity, and thermal Hall effects. Using complex variables, we derive the collision integral and Boltzmann equation for particle distribution, applying perturbation methods and Fourier analysis to calculate transport coefficients. Simulations reveal a one-way preferential diffusion at the interface between MDAs with opposing field directions, where diffusion intensity varies with the particle movement direction. This highlights metafields' potential for dynamic particle control applications.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty Quantification of Surrogate Models using Conformal Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09881v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Data-driven surrogate models have shown immense potential as quick, inexpensive approximations to complex numerical and experimental modelling tasks. However, most surrogate models of physical systems do not quantify their uncertainty, rendering their predictions unreliable, requiring further validation. Though Bayesian approximations offer some solace in estimating the error associated with these models, they cannot provide guarantees, and the quality of their inferences depends on the availability of prior information and good approximations to posteriors for complex problems. This is particularly pertinent to multi-variable or spatio-temporal problems. Our work constructs and formalises a conformal prediction framework that satisfies marginal coverage for spatio-temporal predictions in a model-agnostic manner, requiring near-zero computational costs. We provide an extensive empirical study of the application of the framework to ascertain valid error bars that provide guaranteed coverage across the surrogate model's domain of operation. The application scope of our work extends across a large range of spatio-temporal models, from solving partial differential equations to weather forecasting. Through the applications, the paper looks at providing statistically valid error bars for deterministic models, as well as crafting guarantees to the error bars of probabilistic models. Our conformal prediction formalisation provides guaranteed coverage of the surrogate model, regardless of model architecture, and its training regime and is unbothered by the curse of dimensionality.</description>
