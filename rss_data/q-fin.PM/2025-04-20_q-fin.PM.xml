      <title>Risk-aware black-box portfolio construction using Bayesian optimization with adaptive weighted Lagrangian estimator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13529v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Existing portfolio management approaches are often black-box models due to safety and commercial issues in the industry. However, their performance can vary considerably whenever market conditions or internal trading strategies change. Furthermore, evaluating these non-transparent systems is expensive, where certain budgets limit observations of the systems. Therefore, optimizing performance while controlling the potential risk of these financial systems has become a critical challenge. This work presents a novel Bayesian optimization framework to optimize black-box portfolio management models under limited observations. In conventional Bayesian optimization settings, the objective function is to maximize the expectation of performance metrics. However, simply maximizing performance expectations leads to erratic optimization trajectories, which exacerbate risk accumulation in portfolio management. Meanwhile, this can lead to misalignment between the target distribution and the actual distribution of the black-box model. To mitigate this problem, we propose an adaptive weight Lagrangian estimator considering dual objective, which incorporates maximizing model performance and minimizing variance of model observations. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our approach over five backtest settings with three black-box stock portfolio management models. Ablation studies further verify the effectiveness of the proposed estimator.</description>

      <title>Liquidity Adjustment in Multivariate Volatility Modeling: Evidence from Portfolios of Cryptocurrencies and US Stocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00813v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a liquidity-sensitive multivariate volatility framework to improve the estimation of time-varying covariance structures under market frictions. We introduce two novel portfolio-level liquidity measures, liquidity jump and liquidity diffusion, which capture magnitude and volatility of liquidity fluctuation, respectively, and construct liquidity-adjusted return and volatility that reflect real-time liquidity variability. These liquidity-adjusted inputs are integrated into a VECM-DCC/ADCC-Bayesian model, allowing for conditional and posterior covariance estimation under liquidity stress. Applying this framework to portfolios of cryptocurrencies and US stocks, we find that traditional models misrepresent volatility and co-movement, while liquidity-adjusted models yield more stable and interpretable risk structures, particularly for portfolios of cryptocurrencies. The findings support the use of liquidity-adjusted multivariate models as statistically grounded tools for assessing the propagation of portfolio risk under market frictions, with implications for asset pricing, market microstructure design, and portfolio management.</description>

      <title>Universal portfolios in continuous time: an approach in pathwise It\^o calculus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11881v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide a simple and straightforward approach to a continuous-time version of Cover's universal portfolio strategies within the model-free context of F\"ollmer's pathwise It\^o calculus. We establish the existence of the universal portfolio strategy and prove that its portfolio value process is the average of all values of constant rebalanced strategies. This result relies on a systematic comparison between two alternative descriptions of self-financing trading strategies within pathwise It\^o calculus. We moreover provide a comparison result for the performance and the realized volatility and variance of constant rebalanced portfolio strategies</description>
