      <title>Atomistic Simulation Guided Convolutional Neural Networks for Thermal Modeling of Friction Stir Welding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21344v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate prediction of temperature evolution is essential for understanding thermomechanical behavior in friction stir welding. In this study, molecular dynamics simulations were performed using LAMMPS to model aluminum friction stir welding at the atomic scale, capturing material flow, plastic deformation, and heat generation during tool plunge, traverse, and retraction. Atomic positions and velocities were extracted from simulation trajectories and transformed into physics based two dimensional spatial grids. These grids represent local height variation, velocity components, velocity magnitude, and atomic density, preserving spatial correlations within the weld zone. A two-dimensional convolutional neural network was developed to predict temperature directly from the spatially resolved atomistic data. Hyperparameter optimization was carried out to determine an appropriate network configuration. The trained model demonstrates strong predictive capability, achieving a coefficient of determination R square of 0.9439, a root mean square error of 14.94 K, and a mean absolute error of 11.58 K on unseen test data. Class Activation Map analysis indicates that the model assigns higher importance to regions near the tool material interface, which are associated with intense deformation and heat generation in the molecular dynamics simulations. The results show that spatial learning from atomistic simulation data can accurately reproduce temperature trends in friction stir welding while remaining consistent with physical deformation and flow mechanisms observed at the atomic scale.</description>

      <title>Structure, biomineralization and biodegradation of Ca-Mg oxyfluorosilicates synthesized by inorganic salt coprecipitation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21369v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this research, a novel group of Ca-Mg oxyfluorosilicates containing different levels of fluoride substituting for oxide was synthesized by an inorganic salt coprecipitation process followed by calcination/sintering. The effects of the incorporation of fluoride on the resultant structural characteristics, apatite-forming ability and biodegradability were evaluated by X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, scanning electron microscopy/energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, inductively coupled plasma spectroscopy and pH measurements. According to the results, the samples containing up to 2 mol% F present a single-phase structure of diopside (MgCaSi2O6) doped with F. It was also found that to meet the most biomineralization characteristic, the optimal value of fluoride in the homogeneous samples is 1 mol%. In this regard, on the one hand, the partial incorporation of fluoride into apatite (via forming fluorohydroxyapatite) and, on the other hand, the absence of fluorite (CaF2) as a consumer of Ca in the deposits are responsible for achieving the most apatite-forming ability circumstance controlled by an ion-exchange reaction mechanism. In conclusion, this study reflects the merit of the optimization of fluoride-doping into Ca-Mg silicates for development in biomedicine.</description>

      <title>Hidden layered structures from carbon-analog metastability in metal dichalcogenides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21474v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Carbon exhibits both a layered ground state structure that produces two-dimensional (2D) nanosheets and a non-layered diamond structure created under high pressure conditions. Motivated by this metastability relationship, we revisit the ground state structure of metal dichalcogenides that are known to have non-layered pyrite-type structure. Ultrathin films of pyrite-type ZnSe$_2$ spontaneously transform into a layered phase. This phase is identified as a ground state, and the monolayer exhibits strong elastic anisotropy and a semiconducting bandgap larger than that of the pyrite phase by a factor of two. We demonstrate that a two-valued but directional potential energy surface exists along a Bain-like distortion path, hiding the layered ground state. This work implies that many 2D materials are hidden in non-layered materials and connects 2D materials science with surface and high-pressure science.</description>

      <title>Nonvolatile Electrical Control of Spin via Sliding Fractional Quantum Multiferroics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a fractionally quantized polarization induced by interlayer sliding in bilayer altermagnets, unveiling a previously unrecognized multiferroic phase termed sliding fractional quantum multiferroicity (SFQM). This unconventional magnetic phase uniquely integrates sliding ferroelectricity with fractional quantum ferroelectricity, enabling highly efficient switching and nonvolatile electrical control of spin.~Unlike conventional multiferroics, SFQM simultaneously exhibits lattice-scale atomic displacements, ultralow switching barriers, and spin splitting, giving rise to a large fractionally quantized polarization and strong magnetoelectric coupling. Through symmetry analysis and first-principles calculations, we identify bilayer altermagnet Ca(CoN)$_2$ and its family materials as promising candidates hosting SFQM. In contrast to gate-controlled schemes, the spin-layer coupling in SFQM is intrinsically induced by spontaneous electrical and layer polarization, requiring no sustained gate field and exhibiting nonvolatile character. This mechanism enables nonvolatile electrical control of spin through biaxial sliding, where displacements along the \textit{x}- and \textit{y}-axes generate opposite polarization directions in the layer-dependent electrical polarization. Furthermore, SFQM exhibits a fully switchable anomalous Hall effect and a pronounced magneto-optical response, which can be utilized for its detection and distinction. These findings highlight the promising role of sliding-mediated couplings among unconventional magnetism, fractional quantum ferroelectricity, and stacking order in realizing electrically controllable two-dimensional multiferroics.</description>

      <title>Account of the self-interaction energy correction in the first principles calculation of the fundamental absorption edge spectrum of LiCl</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Within the framework of the local electron density functional theory, an ab-initio method is proposed that takes into account the self-interaction energy correction (SIC) for the crystal potential. The principle of dividing the unit cell into regions remained the same as for the ground-state potential. The expression for the self-consistent muffin-tin-SIC potential satisfies the condition of cell electroneutrality. This scheme was applied to calculate the spectrum of the fundamental absorption edge of LiCl. The obtained interband transition energies were not required for fitting to experimental values. In the calculated spectrum, the shape and position of the peaks above ~2.5 eV from the edge agree fairly well with the measured ones, which allows their intensity in this region to be attributed primarily to interband transitions. Closer to the edge, electron-hole interaction significantly alters the ground state, which must be taken into account when calculating the spectrum shape.</description>

      <title>Symmetry-guided prediction of magnetic-ordered ground states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21672v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given the scarcity of experimentally confirmed magnetic structures, the reliable prediction of magnetic ground states is crucial; however, it remains a long-sought challenge because of the complex magnetic potential energy landscape. Here, we propose a symmetry-guided framework that systematically generates realistic magnetic configurations without requiring any experimental input or prior assumptions such as propagation vectors. Within a hierarchical symmetry-breaking scenario, we integrate the recently developed spin space group formalism and conventional magnetic space group description, respectively capturing symmetry breaking induced by magnetic ordering and spin-orbit coupling. Furthermore, we perform both nonrelativistic and relativistic first-principles calculations to establish the energy ordering of selected magnetic configurations. Exemplified by three recently reported three-dimensional unconventional magnets MnTe, Mn3Sn, and CoNb3S6 and two two-dimensional magnets CrTe2 and NiI2, we demonstrate that only a few dozen first-principles calculations are sufficient to identify the ground-state magnetic configuration along with several low-energy metastable states, which may exhibit exotic physical properties such as p-wave magnetism. Our work provides a general and efficient strategy for large-scale prediction of three-dimensional and two-dimensional magnetic configurations and offers insight into the microscopic origins of magnetic interactions across diverse material systems.</description>

      <title>Defect Engineering for Stabilizing Magnetic and Topological Properties in Mn(Bi1-xSbx)2Te4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21680v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: MnBi2Te4 is a versatile platform for exploring diverse topological quantum states, yet its potential is hampered by intrinsic antisite defects. While Sb substitution has been employed to tune the Fermi level towards the charge neutral point, it exacerbates the formation of Mn-Sb antisite defects. Here, we address this challenge by combining first-principles calculations with strategic synthesis to systematically investigate and control antisite defects in Mn(Bi1-xSbx)2Te4. Our calculations reveal that increasing antisite defect density progressively destroys the field-forced magnetic Weyl state, eventually driving the system into a trivial magnetic insulator. Motivated by these findings, we develop an optimized chemical vapor transport method, yielding high-quality Mn(Bi1-xSbx)2Te4 crystals with significantly reduced antisite defect density. The emergence of strong Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations in the forced ferromagnetic state and a pronounced anomalous Hall effect near charge neutrality, with opposite signs for n- and p-type samples, confirms the type-II Weyl semimetal nature. These findings underscore the critical role of antisite defects in determining the magnetic and topological properties of Mn(Bi1-xSbx)2Te4 and establish defect engineering via optimized synthesis as a crucial strategy for realizing its exotic magnetic topological states.</description>

      <title>Pressure-Tuned Metamagnetism and Emergent Three-Body Interactions in CsFeCl$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21682v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a combined experimental and theoretical study of the triangular-lattice quantum antiferromagnet CsFeCl$_3$ under high magnetic fields and high pressure. Pulsed-field magnetization for the magnetic field along the symmetric $c$ direction at ambient pressure reveals a magnetization process from a nonmagnetic singlet ground state with a nearly linear increase between 3.7 and 10.7 T, a plateau-like region, and then a sharp stepwise metamagnetic transition near 32 T. Wide frequency--field range electron spin resonance indicates that the low-field regime originates from the $J = 1$ manifold, while the high-field metamagnetic transition suggests a level crossing between the $J = 1$ and $J = 2$ lowest states. Pulsed-field magnetic susceptibilities measured with a proximity detector oscillator under high pressure show that the low-field nonmagnetic singlet phase is gradually suppressed, while the high-field metamagnetic transition evolves into an increasingly rich pattern of fractional steps. While the observations at low to intermediate fields can be understood within the established spin-1 description, the high-field regime requires a new perspective, which we provide through a projected spin-1/2 framework built from Zeeman-selected crystal-field states not related by time reversal. This construction naturally allows emergent three-body interactions on triangular plaquettes and explains the asymmetric evolution of the fractional steps in the magnetization. Our findings reveal that high-field effective spin models in quantum magnets with separated yet accessible crystal-field multiplets are not constrained to even-body couplings, but can naturally host odd-body terms, opening a broader avenue for realizing field-asymmetric magnetization processes and exotic phases beyond conventional even-body physics.</description>

      <title>Concentration-Dependent Tungsten Effects on Short-Range Order and Deformation Behavior in Ni-W alloys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21745v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ni-W based medium heavy alloys offer a promising pathway to bridge the density-strength gap between tungsten heavy alloys and ultrahigh-strength steels. In this study, the effects of W concentration on short-range order (SRO), deformation behavior, and grain boundary chemistry of Ni-xW alloys in the range x = 0 to 38 wt% were systematically investigated using a suite of advanced characterization and modeling techniques, including synchrotron X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, atom probe tomography, and first-principles thermodynamic simulations. Our study reveals that strong SRO emerges when W content exceeds about 30 wt%, producing distinct diffuse scattering and significantly enhancing strain-hardening capacity. During deformation, the presence of SRO promotes planar slip and twin formation, leading to strong dislocation interactions and elevated flow stress. Hall-Petch analysis demonstrates an exceptionally high grain boundary strengthening coefficient (ky about 1100 MPa micrometer^(1/2)) in Ni-38W, underscoring the intrinsic strengthening effect associated with SRO. First-principles cluster expansion coupled with Monte Carlo simulations reveals that increasing W content enhances SRO tendency through the stabilization of Ni4W-type local configurations. These findings establish a mechanistic link between W concentration, SRO evolution, and mechanical response, providing new insights for designing high-density, high-strength Ni-W based alloys with optimized performance.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the Thermoelectric Properties of Group III-Nitride Biphenylene Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21784v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: After the synthesis of the carbon biphenylene network (C-BPN), research has increasingly focused on adapting elements from other groups of the periodic table to this lattice structure. In this study, the direction-dependent electronic, thermal, and thermoelectric (TE) properties of semiconducting group-III (group-III = B, Al, Ga, In) nitride biphenylene networks are investigated using the non-equilibrium Green's function formalism in combination with first-principles calculations. Phonon spectra and force field molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were used to asses the dynamically and thermally stable structures. At room temperature, the lowest phonon thermal conductance values are obtained for InN-BPN, with $\kappa_{\mathrm{ph}}$ = 0.12 nW/K/nm and $\kappa_{\mathrm{ph}}$ = 0.21 nW/K/nm along the armchair and zigzag directions, respectively. The nearly dispersionless valence-band region between the $\Gamma$--$X$ symmetry points causes a sharp increase in the $p$-type electronic transmission, which significantly enhances the $p$-type thermoelectric figure of merit, $zT$. Among the investigated group-III nitride BPNs, InN-BPN exhibits the best performance, with a $p$-type $zT$ value of 2.33 in the zigzag direction at 800 K.</description>

      <title>Temperature- and Pressure-Dependent Vibrational Properties and Phase Stability of Pristine and Sb-Doped Vacancy-Ordered Double Perovskite</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21810v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding lattice dynamics and structural transitions in vacancy-ordered double perovskites is crucial for developing lead-free optoelectronic materials, yet the role of dopants in modulating these properties remains poorly understood. We investigate Sb-doped Cs$_2$TiCl$_6$ through temperature-dependent Raman spectroscopy (4 to 273 K), high-pressure studies (0 to 30 GPa), powder XRD, and photoluminescence measurements. Sb doping dramatically improves phase purity, eliminating all impurity-related Raman modes present in pristine and Bi-doped samples while retaining only the three fundamental [TiCl$_6$]$^{2-}$ octahedral vibrations. This enhanced purity reveals a previously unobserved structural phenomenon: Sb-doped samples (2\% doped and 3\%) incorporated) exhibit a sharp anomaly at 100 K marked by the emergence of a new Raman mode M$_1$ at 314--319 cm$^{-1}$ and abrupt changes in the temperature coefficient $\chi$ (factor of 2--8$\times$ change) and anharmonic constant $A$ across this threshold. No such transition occurs in pristine Cs$_2$TiCl$_6$, indicating Sb-dopant-induced order-disorder transformation. The enhanced phonon anharmonicity in Sb-doped samples directly manifests in photoluminescence: self-trapped exciton emission at 448 nm shows 19\% broader FWHM (164.73 nm) compared to Bi-doped samples (138.2 nm), confirming stronger electron-phonon coupling. High-pressure measurements reveal structural robustness to 30 GPa with no phase transitions. These findings establish that strategic Sb doping not only improves material quality but also enables a novel low-temperature structural transition, providing fundamental insights into dopant-mediated phase control in vacancy-ordered perovskites for next-generation optoelectronic devices.</description>

      <title>Toward Generalizable Surrogate Models for Molecular Dynamics via Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21822v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a graph neural network (GNN) based surrogate framework for molecular dynamics simulations that directly predicts atomic displacements and learns the underlying evolution operator of an atomistic system. Unlike conventional molecular dynamics, which relies on repeated force evaluations and numerical time integration, the proposed surrogate model propagates atomic configurations forward in time without explicit force computation. The approach represents atomic environments as graphs and combines message-passing layers with attention mechanisms to capture local coordination and many-body interactions in metallic systems. Trained on classical molecular dynamics trajectories of bulk aluminum, the surrogate achieves sub angstrom level accuracy within the training horizon and exhibits stable behavior during short- to mid-horizon temporal extrapolation. Structural and dynamical fidelity are validated through agreement with reference radial distribution functions and mean squared displacement trends, demonstrating that the model preserves key physical signatures beyond pointwise coordinate accuracy. These results establish GNN-based surrogate integrators as a promising and computationally efficient complement to traditional molecular dynamics for accelerated atomistic simulations within a validated regime.</description>

Abstract: We tackle the challenge of predicting vibrational stability in inorganic semiconductors for high-throughput screening, an essential attribute for evaluating synthesizability alongside thermodynamic stability, frequently missing in prominent materials databases. We create a physics-informed neural network (PINN) that incorporates the Born stability requirements directly into its loss function. This integration is a key learning constraint since it only allows the model to make predictions that do not violate fundamental physics. The model shows consistent and improved performance, having been trained on a dataset of 2112 inorganic materials with validated phonon spectra, and getting an F1-score of 0.83 for both stable and unstable classes. The model shows an AUC-ROC of 0.82 on a benchmark dataset of 1296 materials. Our PINN surpasses the best models in comparative tests, especially when it comes to accurately identifying unstable materials, which is crucial for a stability filter. This work offers a comprehensive screening tool for identifying materials and a methodology for incorporating domain knowledge to enhance predictive accuracy in materials informatics.</description>

      <title>Universal thermodynamic framework for quasi-van der Waals epitaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21833v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: van der Waals (vdW) epitaxy is conventionally regarded as a rotation-free and strain-free growth mode driven by weak, isotropic interactions, yet many interfaces paradoxically exhibit strictly locked orientations that defy standard surface-energy models. We resolve this inconsistency by establishing a unified quantitative framework for 2D-3D systems, in which strong electrostatic and chemical interactions compete with entropic forces. We introduce a two-tier descriptor set-the predictive index (I_pre) and the thermodynamic locking criterion (I_lock)-to quantify the energetic sufficiency for locked epitaxy. Our theory accurately predicted the competitive interactions at the interface within the 2D-3D system, precisely characterized whether the epitaxial layer underwent free growth or was constrained in a locked growth mode, demonstrating robust consistency with diverse experimental observations. This framework unifies orientation selection in 3D-on-2D films and rotational locking in 2D-on-3D layers within a single-phase diagram. Our work provides a generalizable, predictive route to controlling epitaxial orientation across a broad spectrum of layered heterostructure</description>

      <title>Spectroscopic Characterization of Metallocene Single Crystals Grown by Physical Vapor Transport Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21836v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-quality metallocene single crystals with a low density of impurities and high homogeneity were prepared using the physical vapor transport method. These crystals were then characterized using various spectroscopic tools and X-ray diffraction. Laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy confirmed the presence of metal ions in each freshly grown sample despite all these crystals undergoing physical deformation with different lifetimes. X-ray diffraction analysis confirmed that all our metallocene single crystals retained a monoclinic structure at room temperature. The vibrational properties of our metallocene crystals were examined using Raman and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy. The inter- and intra-ring vibrational modes, along with additional modes associated with the crystalline form, were identified as inherent vibrational properties of our metallocene single crystals. Given the increasingly important role of metallocene in organic solar cells, organic light-emitting displays and molecular quantum systems, this research will enhance our understanding of the intrinsic physical properties of cleaner, more crystalline metallocene single crystals.</description>

      <title>Raman Spectroscopic Investigation of Ferroaxial Order in Na2BaNi(PO4)2 Single Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21876v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ferroaxial order is characterized by the breaking of mirror symmetry parallel to the crystallographic principal axis, which often originates from spontaneous rotational distortions of the crystal lattice. Such rotational distortions are, by symmetry, allowed to couple to specific phonon modes. However, Raman-active phonons associated with these rotational distortions have not yet been clearly identified on a symmetry-consistent basis. Here, we perform polarization-resolved Raman spectroscopy on the ferroaxial phase of Na2BaNi(PO4)2 single crystals and combine the measurements with first-principles lattice-dynamics calculations. This symmetry-guided analysis enables a comprehensive assignment of Raman-active modes in the ferroaxial phase. Several low-frequency Ag modes exhibit finite linewidth broadening, suggesting that these phonons may be weakly affected by the underlying rotational distortion. These results establish a symmetry-based spectroscopic framework for analyzing phonons associated with rotational distortions in ferroaxial materials and provide a basis for future studies of ferroaxial order in complex oxides.</description>

      <title>Zeeman-like coupling to valley degree of freedom in Si-based spin qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21930v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Increasing the valley splitting in Si-based heterostructures is critical for improving the performance of semiconductor qubits. This paper demonstrates that the two low-energy conduction band valleys are not independent parabolic bands. Instead, they originate from the X-point of the Brillouin zone, where they are interconnected by a degeneracy protected by the non-symmorphic symmetry of the diamond lattice. This semi-Dirac-node degeneracy gives rise to the $\Delta_1$ and $\Delta_{2'}$ bands, which constitute the valley degrees of freedom. By explicitly computing the two-component Bloch functions $X_1^\pm$, using the wave vector group at the X-point, we determine the transformation properties of the object $(X_1^+,X_1^-)$. We demonstrate that these properties are fundamentally different from those of a spinor. Consequently, we introduce the term "valleyor" to emphasize this fundamental distinction. The transformation properties of valleyors induce corresponding transformations of the Pauli matrices $\tau_1,\tau_2$ and $\tau_3$ in the valley space. Determining these transformations allows us to classify possible external perturbations that couple to each valley Pauli matrix, thereby identifying candidates for valley-magnetic fields, ${\mathsf B}$. These fields are defined by a Zeeman-like coupling ${\mathsf B}\cdot\vec\tau$ to the valley degree of freedom. In this way, we identify scenarios where an applied magnetic field $\vec B$ can leverage other background fields, such as strain, to generate a valley-magnetic field ${\mathsf B}$. This analysis suggests that beyond the well-known mechanism of potential scattering from Ge impurities, there exist additional channels (mediated by combinations of magnetic and strain-induced vector potentials) to control the valley degree of freedom</description>

      <title>Revealing the Partially Coherent Nature of Transport in IGZO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21945v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thin-film transistors based on amorphous oxide semiconductors (AOS) are promising candidates for enabling further DRAM scaling and 3D integration, which are critical for advanced computing. Despite extensive research, the charge transport mechanism in these disordered semiconductors remains poorly understood. In this work, we investigate charge transport in the archetypical AOS material, indium gallium zinc oxide (IGZO), across a range of compositions and temperatures using thin-film transistors and Hall bar structures. Our results show that the electrons involved in transport exhibit partially spatial coherence and non-degenerate conduction. Under these conditions, transport is dominated by electron transfer across insulating gaps between locally coherent regions, rather than by degenerate percolative transport above a mobility edge, or by localized-state hopping, both of which are widely assumed in the literature. While fluctuation-induced tunnelling has previously been invoked to describe low-temperature transport in oxide transistors, we show that such behavior originates from partially coherent electronic states and develop a field-effect-aware fluctuation-induced tunnelling (FEAFIT) framework that explicitly accounts for gate modulation of the tunneling landscape. The FEAFIT model accurately predicts experimental data across all compositions, temperatures, and gate voltages, enabling extraction of fundamental transport parameters. These tunnelling parameters are then correlated with electron coherence dimensions and the degree of energetic disorder obtained from first-principles calculations. Our findings advance the fundamental understanding of charge transport in AOS-based transistors and provide a foundation for further performance improvements</description>

      <title>Tunable Magnetic and Topological Phases in EuMnXBi$_2$ (X=Mn, Fe, Co, Zn) Pnictides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21978v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive density functional theory (DFT) study of the electronic, magnetic, and topological properties of the layered pnictides EuMnXBi2 (X = Mn, Fe, Co, Zn), focusing in particular on the relatively unexplored Bi-based member of the EuMn2X2 family. Unlike the well-studied As-, Sb-, and P--based analogues, we show that EuMn2Bi2 stabilizes in a C-type antiferromagnetic ground state with a narrow-gap semiconducting character. Inclusion of spin-orbit coupling (SOC) drives a transition from this trivial antiferromagnetic semiconductor to a Weyl semimetal hosting four symmetry-related Weyl points and robust Fermi arc states. Systematic substitution of Mn with Fe, Co, and Zn further reveals a tunable sequence of magnetic ground states: Fe and Co induce ferrimagnetism with semimetallic behavior, while Zn stabilizes a ferromagnetic semimetal with a large net moment. These findings establish Bi-based EuMnXBi2 pnictides as a versatile platform where magnetic exchange interactions and band topology can be engineered through SOC and chemical substitution. The complex interplay of magnetic interactions and topological effects in the proposed bulk and doped pnictides opens a promising avenue to explore a wide range of electronic and magnetic phenomena. In particular, this study demonstrates that EuMn2Bi2 hosts tunable magnetic and topological phases driven by electron correlations, chemical substitution, and spin-orbit coupling.</description>

      <title>CO$_2$ Dissociative Sticking on Cu(110)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we investigate the dissociation of CO$_2$ on Cu(110) by performing density functional theory calculations using the vdW-DF2 exchange-correlation functional, with a potential energy surface parameterized using artificial neural networks. We computed quasi-classical trajectory calculations of molecular and dissociative adsorption probabilities as a function of the initial impact energy of the molecules and surface temperature, by comparing our results with available supersonic molecular beam experimental data for normal incidence. Concerning the general dependence of the molecular and dissociative adsorption probabilities on the initial translational energy of the molecules, our theoretical results agree with experiments. Also in agreement with experiments, we have found that dissociative adsorption is not affected by surface temperature between 50 and 400 K, for impact energies for which the dissociation probability is larger than $\sim 10^{-3}$. We have investigated the influence of impact energy and surface temperature on the final state of the dissociation products by extending the time integration of the reactive trajectories up to 10 ps. We have found that above $\sim 2.5$ eV and close to or above room temperature, CO$_2$ dissociation induces strong surface distortions including final structures involving Cu adatoms. The creation of Cu vacancy-adatom pairs is stimulated by the presence of both CO$_{ads}$ and O$_{ads}$ which interact strongly with the Cu adatoms and even give rise to unexpected (O-Cu-CO)$_{ads}$ linear moieties anchored to the surface by the dissociated O atom and involving a Cu adatom almost detached from the surface. These surface distortions produced by dissociation products of high energy CO$_2$ molecules at and above room temperature might explain recent experiments that have found a greater saturation oxygen coverage for high energy molecules.</description>

      <title>Interplay between electronic and phononic energy dissipation channels in the adsorption of CO on Cu(110)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21996v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the relative importance of electronic and phononic energy dissipation during the molecular adsorption of CO on Cu(110). Initial sticking probabilities as a function of impact energy for CO impinging at normal incidence at a surface temperature of 90 K were computed using classical trajectory simulations. To this aim, we use a full-dimensional potential energy surface constructed using an atomistic neural network trained on density functional theory data obtained with the nonlocal vdW-DF2 exchange-correlation functional. Two models are compared: one allowing only energy transfer and dissipation from the molecule to lattice vibrations, and the other also incorporating the effect of molecular energy loss due to the excitation of electron-hole pairs, modeled within the local-density friction approximation. Our results reveal, firstly, that the molecule mainly transfers energy to lattice vibrations, and this channel determines the adsorption probabilities, with electronic friction playing a minor role. Secondly, once the molecule is trapped near the surface (where electronic density is higher), electron-hole pair excitations accelerate energy dissipation, significantly promoting CO thermalization. Still, the faster energy dissipation when electron-hole pair excitations are accounted for accelerates the accommodation of the adsorbed molecules in the chemisorption well but does not significantly alter their lateral displacements over the surface.</description>

      <title>Spin dynamics in the van der Waals ferromagnet CrTe2 engineered by Nb doping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding and controlling spin dynamics in two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals (vdW) ferromagnets is essential for their application in magnonics and hybrid quantum platforms. Here, we investigate the spin dynamics of the vdW ferromagnet 1T-CrTe_{2} and demonstrate their systematic tunability via niobium (Nb) substitution in Cr_{1-x}Nb_{x}Te_{2}(x=0-0.2). Ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) spectroscopy reveals that Nb doping enables wide-band tuning of the resonance frequency from 40 GHz down to the few-GHz regime, accompanied by a moderate increase in the Gilbert damping constant from ~0.066 to ~0.14, while preserving robust room-temperature ferromagnetism. Complementary magnetometry shows a concurrent reduction of the Curie temperature and saturation magnetization with increasing Nb content. Density functional theory calculations attribute the observed spin-dynamic trends to Nb-induced modifications of magnetic anisotropy and magnetic exchange interactions. Furthermore, CrTe_{2} flakes (~100nm thick) exhibit lower resonance frequencies than bulk crystals, consistent with thickness-dependent magnetic anisotropy. These results establish Nb-doped CrTe_{2} as a tunable vdW ferromagnet with controllable spin dynamics, extending its functionality from spintronics to broadband magnonics and quantum magnonics.</description>

      <title>Unlocking klockmannite: formation of colloidal quasi-2D CuSe nanocrystals and photo-physical properties arising from crystal anisotropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Copper selenide is an exceptional quasi-layered monolithic material that exhibits both semiconducting and metallic properties in adjacent visible and near-infrared (NIR) spectral ranges. Here we introduce a thiol-free colloidal synthesis for generating quasi-2D klockmannite copper selenide nanocrystals via hot injection method, achieving shape control by tuning the injection temperature and precursor concentrations without any additional ligands. This approach produces large klockmannite nanosheets with lateral sizes from 200 nm to several micrometres, as well as uniform triangular nanoplatelets with sizes of 12-25 nm that are monocrystalline and display strong NIR plasmonic absorption. The spectral features of the anisotropic klockmannite phase in the NIR have been analysed using complex-scaled discrete dipole approximation (CSDDA) calculations, which reveal pronounced optical anisotropy and the emergence of hyperbolic regime. The combined effect of propagating and evanescent fields is regarded as the underlying reason of such modes in the hyperbolic domain. Finally, the ultrafast photophysical behaviour of the material in klockmannite phase is examined, including hot-hole cooling, trapping, and coherent phonons generation. Our findings emphasize the important role of the intrinsic crystal anisotropy in governing the physical properties of nanoscale klockmannite.</description>

      <title>Keffer-like form of the symmetric Heisenberg exchange integral: Contribution to the Landau--Lifshitz--Gilbert equation and spin wave dispersion dependence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The symmetric Heisenberg exchange interaction and antisymmetric Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction are parts of the tensor potential describing effective spin-spin interaction caused by the superexchange interaction of magnetic ions via nonmagnetic ion. There is the Keffer form of the vector constant of the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, which includes the shift of the nonmagnetic ion (ligand) from the line connecting two magnetic ions. It is suggested, in this paper, that the ligand shift can give contribution in the constant of the symmetric Heisenberg interaction in antiferromagnetic or ferrimagnetic materials. Hence, the constant of the Heisenberg interaction is composed minimum of two terms. One does not depend on the ligand shift an gives standard contribution in the energy density like term with no derivatives of the spin densities or term containing two spatial derivatives of the spin densities. It is demonstrated that additional term gives a term in the energy density containing one spatial derivative of the spin density. Corresponding contribution in the Landau--Lifshitz--Gilbert equation is found. Possibility of the noncollinear equilibrium order of spin under influence of new spin torque is discussed. Modification of the spin wave (normal modes) dispersion dependencies in the antiferromagnetic materials is found for the collinear order and for the cycloidal order of spins. Effective spin current is derived and applied for the spin-current model of the polarization origin in multiferroics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.21575v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chiral magnetic states give rise to rich phenomena, from the anomalous Hall effect and the nonlinear electrical current to multiferroics and magnetochiral dichroism. Most of the studies on electrical transport so far have focused on the cases where the magnetic moments are well approximated by classical local moments. Here, we reveal that the coexistence of quantum fluctuations and chiral spin correlations gives rise to a $\log(T)$ temperature dependence in the electrical magnetochiral effect, a nonreciprocal response. Using the Green's function method and a scattering theory approach, we show that the $\log(T)$ temperature dependence occurs through a scattering process similar to that of the Kondo effect. The electrical magnetochiral effect is sensitive to the sign of vector spin chirality and the magnetic field. The results demonstrate that local spin correlations and quantum fluctuations cooperatively induce nontrivial properties in transport phenomena.</description>

      <title>Nonvolatile photoswitching of a Mott state via reversible stacking rearrangement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21628v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nonvolatile control of the Mott transition is a central goal in correlated-electron physics, offering access to fascinating emergent states and great potential for technological applications. Compared to chemical or mechanical approaches, ultrafast optical excitation further promises a path to create and manipulate novel non-equilibrium phases with ultimate spatiotemporal precision. However, achieving a truly nonvolatile electronic phase transition in laser-excited Mott systems remains an elusive challenge. Here, we present a highly robust and reversible method for optical control of the Mott state in van der Waals systems. Specifically, using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, we observe a nonvolatile Mott-to-metallic transition in the ultrafast laser-excited charge density wave (CDW) material 1T-TaSe2. Complementary theoretical calculations reveal that this transition originates from a rearrangement of the interlayer CDW stacking. This new stacking order, formed following the ultrafast quenching of the CDW, circumvents the need for large-scale atomic sliding. Intriguingly, it introduces a significant in-plane component to the electron hopping and effectively reduces the ratio of on-site Coulomb interaction to bandwidth, thereby suppressing the Mott state and stabilizing a metallic phase.

      <title>The Origin of Organic Magnetoresistance Using Time-Domain Magnetic Spectroscopy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.21629v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Organic Magnetoresistance is defined as the change of resistance in an organic material, such as a conducting polymer, as a function of an imposed magnetic field. We demonstrate this effect in a Polypyrrole/ Polydimethylsiloxane complex by using a novel magnetic pulse system. The frequency spectrum of the current flowing through the sample reveals equally spaced reversed peaks in the current. We show that these peaks happen at the Lamour frequency for the dominant charge carrier of the system, namely polarons. This posits the origin Organic magnetoresistance as simple Rabi Oscillations rather than mechanisms based of bipolaron formation and singlet-triplet conversions. We directly estimate the effective polaronic mass in this complex. A semi classical theoretical approach is suggested to explain this effect as direct spin flipping in a time transient magnetic field. This is the first time that such an experimental approach has been applied in this field and the first time the effective polaronic mass has been measured in a conducting polymer.</description>

      <title>Proximity-Induced Spin-Orbit Torque in Graphene on a Trigonal CrSBr Monolayer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21636v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a first-principles and quantum transport study of proximity-induced spin-orbit torque (SOT) in graphene on a trigonal CrSBr monolayer. Density functional theory combined with nonequilibrium Green's function calculations shows that the CrSBr substrate induces spin polarization and a sizable exchange splitting in the graphene Dirac states. The resulting current-driven spin density in graphene generates a self-SOT on the Dirac electrons. The proximity-induced exchange field breaks time-reversal symmetry and gives rise to a purely odd SOT component, while the even contribution vanishes. The torque magnitude exhibits a strong angular dependence with phase shifts arising from the noncollinearity between the CrSBr magnetization and the induced magnetic moments in graphene. Monte Carlo simulations based on the calculated exchange parameters predict a Curie temperature of approximately 304 K, confirming the robustness of ferromagnetism in the trigonal CrSBr monolayer. These results identify graphene/CrSBr heterostructures as a promising platform for room-temperature two-dimensional spintronics.</description>

      <title>Memory of topologically constrained disorder in Shakti artificial spin ice</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.21767v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Complex behaviors often sit at a critical threshold between order and disorder. But not all disorder is created equal. Disorder can be trivial or constrained, and correlated disorder can even be topological. Crucially, constrained disorder can harbor memory, leading to non-trivial, sequence-dependent responses to external manipulations. And yet the fascinating subject of "memory of disorder" remains poorly explored, as memory is often associated to the retention of metastable order. In recent years artificial frustrated materials -- in particular arrays of frustrated nanomagnets known as artificial spin ices -- have been employed to study complex disorders and its wealth of exotic behaviors, yet their memory properties have received much less attention. Here, we investigate both analytically and numerically the sequence-dependent responses of two somehow opposite yet related artificial spin ices: the Landau-ordered square spin ice and the disordered but topologically-ordered Shakti spin ice. We find that Shakti exhibits a pronounced sequence-dependent response, whereas in the square lattice, such path dependence is absent. Within Shakti, even the minimal periodic supercell demonstrates both deterministic and stochastic forms of sequence memory, depending on the interaction strength. Extending our study to cyclic driving, we find that retracing the same input path leads to enhanced memory retention. These results open new perspectives on how topological constraints and correlated disorder generate robust memory effects in frustrated artificial materials, hitherto examined mainly in terms of their ground-state kinetics and thermodynamics.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Scientific Discovery with Autonomous Goal-evolving Agents</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.21782v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There has been unprecedented interest in developing agents that expand the boundary of scientific discovery, primarily by optimizing quantitative objective functions specified by scientists. However, for grand challenges in science , these objectives are only imperfect proxies. We argue that automating objective function design is a central, yet unmet requirement for scientific discovery agents. In this work, we introduce the Scientific Autonomous Goal-evolving Agent (SAGA) to amend this challenge. SAGA employs a bi-level architecture in which an outer loop of LLM agents analyzes optimization outcomes, proposes new objectives, and converts them into computable scoring functions, while an inner loop performs solution optimization under the current objectives. This bi-level design enables systematic exploration of the space of objectives and their trade-offs, rather than treating them as fixed inputs. We demonstrate the framework through a broad spectrum of applications, including antibiotic design, inorganic materials design, functional DNA sequence design, and chemical process design, showing that automating objective formulation can substantially improve the effectiveness of scientific discovery agents.</description>

      <title>Chirality-selective topological magnon phase transition induced by interplay of anisotropic exchange interactions in honeycomb ferromagnet</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.21850v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A variety of distinct anisotropic exchange interactions commonly exist in one magnetic material due to complex crystal, magnetic and orbital symmetries. Here we investigate the effects of multiple anisotropic exchange interactions on topological magnon in a honeycomb ferromagnet, and find a chirality-selective topological magnon phase transition induced by a complicated interplay of Dzyaloshinsky-Moriya interaction (DMI) and pseudo-dipolar interaction (PDI), accompanied by the bulk gap close and reopen with chiral inversion. Moreover, this novel topological phase transition involves band inversion at high symmetry points $K$ and $K'$, which can be regarded as a pseudo-orbital reversal, i.e. magnon valley degree of freedom, implying a new manipulation corresponding to a sign change of the magnon thermal Hall conductivity. Indeed, it can be realized in 4$d$ or 5$d$ correlated materials with both spin-orbit coupling and orbital localized states, such as iridates and ruthenates, etc. This novel regulation may have potential applications on magnon devices and topological magnonics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.21875v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In metal-insulator transition materials, a small perturbation can shift the delicate balance between competing or coexisting electronic phases, leading to dramatic changes of the material's properties. Using La0.7Sr0.3MnO3, a prototypical metal-insulator transition manganite, we show that local low-dose focused ion beam irradiation increases resistivity by several orders of magnitude, converting the ferromagnetic-metal ground state into a paramagnetic-insulator. Surprisingly, we found that applying electric stimuli to the irradiated material induces a non-thermal insulator-to-metal transition, which results in low-power, repeatable volatile resistive switching. Magnetotransport measurements revealed that this voltage-induced metallic phase in the irradiated material is ferromagnetic, exhibiting clear anisotropic magnetoresistance. This work, thus, reports the discovery of a unique material in which the electrical triggering of the electronic phase transition results in the onset of magnetism, in stark contrast to the magnetic order suppression commonly observed in other metal-insulator transition switching materials. We demonstrate that local focused ion beam irradiation provides new and exciting opportunities to engineer electronic and magnetic functionalities that can find practical applications ranging from spintronics to neuromorphic hardware.</description>

      <title>Topological constraints on the electronic band structure of hexagonal lattice in a magnetic field</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.21966v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The impact of projective lattice symmetry on electronic band structures has attracted significant attention in recent years, particularly in light of growing experimental studies of two-dimensional hexagonal materials in magnetic fields. Yet, most theoretical work to date has focused on the square lattice due to its relative simplicity. In this work, we investigate the role of projective lattice symmetry in a hexagonal lattice with rational magnetic flux, emphasizing the resulting topological constraints on the electronic band structure. We show that, at pi flux, the symmetry in the hexagonal lattice enforces novel Dirac band touchings at E not equal to zero, and for general rational flux it constrains the number of Dirac points at E = 0. We further analyze the symmetry-imposed constraints on the Chern numbers of both isolated gapped bands and band multiplets connected by Dirac-point touchings. Our results demonstrate that these constraints in the hexagonal lattice differ substantially from those in the square lattice.</description>

      <title>Non-reciprocal circular dichroism of ferro-rotational phonons in MnTiO$_{3}$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.22050v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: X-ray circular dichroism (XCD), defined as the difference in absorption or scattering intensity between X-rays of opposite polarizations, arises from the breaking of spatial inversion or time-reversal symmetry and is thus sensitive to chirality, magnetism, and their interplay. Non-reciprocal XCD, in which the dichroic response changes upon reversing the propagation direction of the probe, is generally forbidden in systems with both symmetries. Using resonant inelastic X-ray scattering, we identify circularly polarized phonons in ferro-rotational MnTiO$_3$, which we term ferro-rotational phonons. Their excitations provide a direct demonstration of non-reciprocal XCD in a system that globally preserves inversion and time-reversal symmetries. We propose that a condensate of these phonons, manifested as standing waves, underlies the ferro-rotational order in MnTiO$_3$. The interplay among photon helicity, phonon polarization, and the axial ferro-rotational order gives rise to the observed non-reciprocal circular dichroism.</description>

Abstract: Ionic conduction in solids that exceeds 1 mS/cm is predicted to involve coupled phonon-ion interactions in the crystal lattice. Here, we use theory and experiment to measure the possible contribution of coupled phonon-ion hopping modes which enhance Li+ migration in Li0.5La0.5TiO3 (LLTO). The ab initio calculations predict that the targeted excitation of individual TiO6 rocking modes greatly increases the Li+ jump rate as compared to the excitation of vibrational modes associated with heating. Experimentally, coherently driving TiO6 rocking modes via terahertz (THz) illumination leads to a ten-fold decrease in the differential impedance compared to the excitation of acoustic and optical phonons. Additionally, we differentiate the ultrafast responses of LLTO due to ultrafast heating and THz-range vibrations using laser-driven spectroscopy (LUIS), finding a unique long-lived response for the THz-range excitation. These findings provide new insights into coupled ion migration mechanisms, indicating the important role of THz-range coupled phonon-ion hopping modes in enabling fast ion conduction at room temperature.</description>

Abstract: Laser-induced forward transfer (LIFT) printing is a versatile technique to realize micro/nano-scale additive manufacturing of functional materials, including metals, and semiconductors. However, the crystallization phenomena during LIFT printing have not been well understood. In this work, we attempt to gain a comprehensive understanding of silicon crystallization during LIFT printing. Specifically, molecular dynamics (MD) simulation is used to investigate the size effect on the melting and crystallization of Si nanoparticles during transportation in air. We found with the decrease in nanoparticle size, crystallization becomes rare, even with a low cooling rate. The nucleation location of different particles is also analyzed and almost always starts at a sub-surface location (below 5 {\AA}). The atomic structure evolution during solidification is also monitored to provide guidance for LIFT printing of Si. Our simulation results indicate that nano-confinement can lead to single-crystal structure formation, which may shed light on single-crystal additive manufacturing.</description>

Abstract: Van der Waals (vdW) materials, with their unique combination of electronic, optical, and magnetic properties, are emerging as promising platforms for exploring excitonic phenomena. Thus far, the choice of materials with exceptional excitonic response has been limited to two-dimensional (2D) configurations of vdW materials. At the same time, large interlayer distance and the possibility to create a variety of heterostructures offers an opportunity to control the dielectric screening in van der Waals heterostructures and van der Waals 3D materials, thus engineering the excitonic properties. Here, we reveal that bulk vdW crystal CrCl3 answers this quest with a record exciton binding energy of 1.64 eV owing to a delicate interplay of quasi-2D electronic confinement and local magnetic correlations. We also suggest that the non-local magnetic correlations play an important role in the temperature dependence of photoluminescence intensity. Furthermore, we observe colossal binding energies in vdW crystals NbOCl2 (0.66 eV) and MoCl3 (0.35 eV) and formulate a universal exciton binding energy dependence on bandgap for 2D and 3D vdW materials. Hence, our findings establish a fundamental link between the layered structure of vdW materials and their excitonic properties.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.24011v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The interaction between surface-lying nitrogen-substituted fullerenes (radical azafullerene, C$_{59}$N$^\bullet$) with sub-surface negative nitrogen-vacancy complexes (NV$^-$) in diamond is investigated using first principles calculations. We consider (2$\times$1) reconstructed (001) oriented diamond surfaces with both H- and F-surface termination. The charge stability of NV$^-$, when in close proximity to both the nearby surface and the spin active azafullerene is discussed, in the context of diamond band bending arising from surface-induced changes in electron affinity (EA). In the case of the hydrogenated surface, the system spin is quenched, yielding a negatively charged azafullerene (C$_{59}$N$^-$) and neutrally charged NV$^0$ as the most stable electronic configuration. In contrast, fluorinating the surface favours the negatively charged NV$^-$, and conserves the C$_{59}$N$^\bullet$, neutrality and stabilizes uncompensated free spins. This opposing behaviour is attributed to surface charge doping emerging from different band bending effects associated with the surface EA. This study is consistent with experimentally observed photoluminescence quenching, and shows that surface passivation by fluorination could efficiently tackle the problem of charge transfer between adsorbed molecules and shallow NV centers.</description>

Abstract: The optical selection rules dictate symmetry-allowed/forbidden transitions, playing a decisive role in engineering exciton quantum states and designing optoelectronic devices. While both the real (quantum metric) and imaginary (Berry curvature) parts of quantum geometry contribute to optical transitions, the conventional theory of optical selection rules in solids incorporates only Berry curvature. Here, we propose quantum metric-based optical selection rules. We unveil a universal quantum metric-oscillator strength correspondence for linear polarization of light and establish valley-contrasted optical selection rules that lock orthogonal linear polarizations to distinct valleys. Tight-binding and first-principles calculations confirm our theory in two models (altermagnet and Kane-Mele) and monolayer $d$-wave altermagnet $\mathrm{V_2SeSO}$. This work provides a quantum metric paradigm for valley-based spintronic and optoelectronic applications.</description>

Abstract: The fabrication of large, high-quality single crystals (SCs) of all-inorganic cesium lead bromide (CsPbBr$_3$) via accessible methods remains a significant challenge. This work presents a systematic approach to optimize the antisolvent vapor-assisted crystallization (AVC) method, where the experimental design is guided by a theoretical methods at each step. A synergistic 9:1 (v/v) DMSO/DMF binary solvent was selected to balance solubility and kinetics, a choice rationalized by an analysis of Gutmann's donor numbers. Subsequently, ethanol was selected as a promising antisolvent by evaluating its properties against key criteria of miscibility and diffusion rate using Hansen Solubility Parameters (HSP) and Fick's law expressed in terms of saturated vapor pressure. Within this rationally-defined chemical system, the "growth window" was experimentally mapped, identifying an optimal precursor concentration of 0.35 M and a preliminary titration step to induce a controlled metastable state. The optimized protocol consistently yields phase-pure, orthorhombic CsPbBr$_3$ SCs up to 1 cm in size within one week at room temperature. The resulting crystals exhibit high crystallinity and thermal stability up to \SI{550}{\celsius}</description>

      <title>Tuning Stability of AB3-Type Alloys by Suppressing Magnetism</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.08038v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hydrogen is a promising clean energy carrier, yet effective and reversible storage remains challenging. AB3-type intermetallic alloys are promising for solid-state hydrogen storage due to intermediate thermodynamic stability and rapid hydrogen uptake. Optimizing stability and gravimetric density is hindered by competing thermodynamic and magnetic effects. Here, we analyze AB3 compounds (A = Ca, Y, Mg; B = Co, Ni) and ternary alloys CaxYyMg1-x-yB3 using first-principles calculations and Monte Carlo simulations. We find a direct correlation between formation energy and total magnetic moment that dictates alloy stability, explaining the trade-off in hydrogen storage. In Co-rich systems with large lattice volumes, formation energy rises with magnetization, showing magnetism as the dominant factor. Mg-rich compositions achieve high gravimetric densities, but strong magnetism destabilizes the system, requiring Y substitution to suppress magnetic moments. Replacing Co with Ni weakens magnetism: YNi3 is nonmagnetic, while CaNi3 and MgNi3 are weakly polarized, allowing thermodynamic stability across compositions. Notably, CaMg2Ni9 combines high theoretical capacity (3.32 wt%) with good reversibility. Mg-rich Ni-based alloys are predicted to offer negative formation energies with the highest gravimetric densities (up to 3.40 wt%). These results show that controlling magnetism via transition-metal substitution is key to overcoming the stability-capacity trade-off in AB3 hydrogen storage materials.</description>

      <title>Digital-Alloy Bragg Mirrors in High-Q Microcavities for Polariton Lasing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03203v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an approach to the molecular-beam epitaxy of high-Q planar GaAs-based microcavities in which the AlGaAs high-index layers of the distributed Bragg reflectors (DBRs) are replaced by short-period GaAs/AlAs superlattices (digital alloys) with similar optical properties. This design enables a significant reduction of interface roughness, precise control of the quarter-wavelength optical thickness and the effective Al content, suppression of the propagation of structural defects, and efficient tuning of intrinsic absorption at the polariton emission wavelength via optimization of the superlattice parameters.
  Using this approach, we fabricate a microcavity with a low polariton-lasing threshold of approximately 570 W/cm$^2$ and a high experimental quality factor of about 5.4 x $10^4$. This value exceeds by almost a factor of two the theoretical estimate obtained within an equivalent ternary-alloy model. We demonstrate that accurate modeling of the stop-band characteristics and the Q factor requires incorporating the modified electronic density of states in the superlattice, including quantum-confinement and excitonic effects.</description>

      <title>First principle study of electronic, magnetic and thermoelectric properties of Co$_2$YPb (Y = Tc, Ti, Zr and Hf) full Heusler: Application to embedded automotive systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07471v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, theoretical investigation on structural, electronic, magnetic, elastic and thermoelectric properties of the full Heusler Co$_2$YPb (Y = Tc, Ti, Zr and Hf) alloys have been performed within density functional theory (DFT). The exchange and correlation potential is addressed using two approximations: the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) and the GGA augmented by the Tran--Blaha-modified Becke-Johnson (mBj-GGA) approximation, which provides a more accurate description of the energy band gap. The electronic and magnetic properties reveal that the full-Heusler alloys Co$_2$YPb (with Y = Tc, Ti, Zr, and Hf) display half-metallic ferromagnetic behavior. Furthermore, the elastic properties suggest that Co$_2$YPb are mechanically stable, with ductile characteristics. Full Heusler alloys P-type exhibit positive Seebeck coefficients and high ZT values, indicating good thermoelectric performance in terms of electrical and thermal conductivity. This leads us to the conclusions that these compounds are very interesting in improving the performance of embedded automotive systems and can also be used in spintronic devices.</description>

Abstract: We analyze the equilibrium states of quantum lattice model with local multi-well potentials for Sn$_2$P$_2$S$_6$ ferroelectric crystals using the mean and Gaussian curvatures ($H$, $K$), curvedness ($C$) and shape index ($S$). From the energy gap, pressure and temperature variations of $H$, $K$, $C$ and $S$, we have reported the geometric construction of the free energy surfaces for the ferroelectric and paraelectric phases. Their behaviors are explicitly observed near the ferroelectric-paraelectric phase transitions. It is found that $H$, $C$ and $S$ display a cusp singularity at the criticality while $K$ converges to zero on both sides of the critical and tricritical points.</description>

Abstract: First-principles density functional simulations were employed to investigate the geometries, electrical properties, and hyperfine structures of various beryllium-doped diamond configurations, including interstitial (Be$_i$), substitutional (Be$_s$), and beryllium-nitrogen (Be-N) complexes. The incorporation of Be into the diamond lattice is more favorable as a substitutional dopant than as an interstitial dopant, although both processes are endothermic. Interstitial Be could potentially exhibit motional averaging from planar to axial symmetry with an activation energy of 0.1 eV. The most stable Be$_s$ configuration has $T_{d}$ symmetry with a spin state of $S=1$. Co-doping with nitrogen reduces the formation energy of Be$_s$-N$_{n}$ $(n=1-4)$ complexes, which further decreases as the number of nitrogen atoms increases. This is attributed to the smaller covalent radius of nitrogen compared to carbon, resulting in reduced lattice distortion. Be$_s$-N$_3$ and Be$_s$-N$_4$ co-doping introduces shallow donors, while Be$_s$ exhibits $n$-type semiconductivity, but the deep donor level renders it impractical for room-temperature applications. These findings provide valuable insights into the behavior of beryllium as a dopant in diamond and highlight the potential of beryllium-nitrogen co-doping for achieving $n$-type diamond semiconductors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.14794v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The present study examines the electronic transport characteristics of amorphous semiconductors through TOF measurements and numerical simulations. The primary objective is to determine the DOS in amorphous selenium (a-Se) and to assess the temperature and electric field dependence of the hole mobility. A comprehensive investigation of localized states within the mobility gap is performed using Laplace transform analysis of ToF photocurrent transients, combined with the multiple trapping model. This approach enables accurate reconstruction of the DOS across a wide temperature range, allowing clear identification of shallow and deep trap levels and revealing thermally activated transport mechanisms. Simulated ToF currents are also used to evaluate the hole drift mobility under various thermal and field conditions. Activation energies are extracted from Arrhenius plots of the mobility data. The results support a physically consistent description of the electronic structure in a-Se and validate the applicability of Laplace-based techniques for probing charge transport in disordered semiconductors.</description>

Abstract: The present theoretical study focuses on the structural, electronic and thermoelectric properties of PbTe, PbSe and their ternary alloys PbSe$_{x}$Te$_{1-x}$, using the density functional theory (DFT) by the full potential linearised augmented plane wave (FP-LAPW) method implemented in Wien2k code. Structural properties were performed by using the generalized gradient approximation of Perdew Burke and Ernzenhof (GGA-PBE) scheme. The results show that the calculated lattice parameters are in good agreement with theoretical data previously obtained. For electronic properties, we noticed that for all the compounds of PbSe$_{x}$Te$_{1-x}$, we have a direct band gap in L point. For thermoelectric properties, we used BoltzTraP2 code and Gibbs2 code. Our results show that the PbSe$_{x}$Te$_{1-x}$ compounds have reached a value of 2.55 for the figure of merit, which indicates that our material is a good thermoelectric candidate.</description>

Abstract: This research work introduces the DFT through FP-LAPW+lo technique in WIEN2k software to obtain information about structural, thermoelectric, and optoelectronic characteristics of CaZnC and CaZnSi materials. The structural optimization was performed using PBE-GGA functional, while the rest of the characteristics were obtained with the PBE-GGA + TB-mBJ approach. The thermoelectric parameters were evaluated using BoltzTraP software. The elastic constants and other mechanical parameters were computed by utilizing the ELAST code within the WIEN2k software, while the thermodynamic characteristics were evaluated using the Gibbs2 program. The findings show a correlation between atomic composition and lattice dimensions while finding that CaZnC has a direct ($\Gamma$-$\Gamma$) band gap of $1.186$ eV, whereas CaZnSi has an indirect ($\Gamma$-$X$) band gap of $1.067$ eV. The optical studies of the compounds show potential applications for photovoltaics while the thermoelectric results find optimized power factors and figure of merit values for energy conversion performance. The elastic parameters of CaZnC and CaZnSi demonstrate material stability and brittleness. Lastly, the thermodynamic evaluations provide information about the thermal mechanism and disorder of the materials. As a result, this research work provides significant advancements in the understanding of the fundamentals of these compounds and highlights their promising applications in renewable energy technologies.</description>

      <title>Eliminating the irregular surface layer of anodically-grown Ni-Ti-O nanopore arrays in a two-stage anodization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.17397v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nanopores (NPs) grown by anodizing can be partially hidden beneath a relatively compact surface oxide layer, which limits the volumetric surface area of these nanostructures. In this work, nitinol (NiTi) alloy was anodized in an electrolyte containing ethylene glycol, water, and sodium chloride in static and stirred electrolyte stages with the aim of removing the irregular surface array while achieving a thick NP layer. Electron micrographs showed that anodization in the static electrolyte provides a controlled thickness of NP layers covered by an irregular surface layer. In contrast, anodizing in the stirred electrolyte reduced the thickness and the degree of irregularity, which were controlled by the different kinetics of dissolution at the tops, perimeters and bottoms of NPs. To benefit simultaneously from the thickness and regularity of the oxide layers, two-stage anodizing under static and then stirred electrolyte conditions was found to be effective. Following a 30 min anodization in the static electrolyte, anodizing for 30 min under the stirred conditions provided the highest regularity in the oxide array, resulting in NPs of almost 40 nm and 11 {\mu}m in diameter and layer thickness, respectively. Two-stage anodizing under static then stirred electrolyte conditions is proposed in order to promote NP structures for applications demanding higher surface areas.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.20906v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Emergent behavior, which arises from local interactions between simple elements, is pervasive in nature. It underlies the energy-efficient computing in our brains. However, realizing such dynamics in artificial materials, particularly under low-energy stimuli, remains a fundamental challenge. While dipole-dipole interactions are typically suppressed in magnetic storage, here we harness and amplify them to construct a strongly dipolar-coupled network of SmCo5 macrospins at wafer scale, which can exhibit intrinsic interaction-driven collective dynamics in response to voltage pulses. The network combines three essential ingredients: strong dipolar coupling by large single-domain macrospin, giant voltage control of coercivity over nearly 1000-fold, and disordered network topology with frustrated Ising-like energy landscape. When stimulated by 1 V pulses, the network enters a regime where interaction-driven magnetic behaviors emerge, including spontaneous demagnetization, greatly enhanced magnetization modulation, reversible freeze and resume evolution and stochastic convergence toward low-energy magnetic configurations. All these behaviors are completely absent at the single-nanomagnet level. Furthermore, by constructing micromagnetic models of the strongly dipolar-coupled macrospin networks, we show that the resulting nonlinear, high-dimensional collective dynamics, intrinsic to strongly-interacting systems, can enable accurate chaotic Mackey-Glass prediction and multiclass drone-signal classification. Our work establishes the voltage-responsive strongly-coupled SmCo5 network as a mesoscopic platform for probing emergent magnetic dynamics previously inaccessible under ambient conditions. It also suggests a fundamental distinct route towards scalable, low-voltage computing, one rooted in native physical interaction-driven collective dynamics at the network level.</description>

Abstract: Imaging and hyperspectral data analysis is central to progress across biology, medicine, chemistry, and physics. The core challenge lies in converting high-resolution or high-dimensional datasets into interpretable representations that enable insight into the underlying physical or chemical properties of a system. Traditional analysis relies on expert-designed, multistep workflows, such as denoising, feature extraction, clustering, dimensionality reduction, and physics-based deconvolution, or on machine learning (ML) methods that accelerate individual steps. Both approaches, however, typically demand significant human intervention, including hyperparameter tuning and data labeling. Achieving the next level of autonomy in scientific imaging requires designing effective reward-based workflows that guide algorithms toward best data representation for human or automated decision-making. Here, we discuss recent advances in reward-based workflows for image analysis, which capture key elements of human reasoning and exhibit strong transferability across various tasks. We highlight how reward-driven approaches enable a shift from supervised black-box models toward explainable, unsupervised optimization on the examples of Scanning Probe and Electron Microscopies. Such reward-based frameworks are promising for a broad range of applications, including classification, regression, structure-property mapping, and general hyperspectral data processing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.18272v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Active solids combine internal active driving with elasticity to realize states with nonequilibrium mechanics and autonomous motion. They are often studied in overdamped settings, e.g., in soft materials, and the role of inertia is less explored. We construct a model of a chemically active solid that incorporates mechanochemical feedback and show that, when feedback overwhelms mechanical damping, autonomous inertial dynamics can spontaneously emerge through sustained consumption of chemical fuel. By combining numerical simulations, analysis and dynamical systems approaches, we show how active feedback drives complex nonlinear dynamics on multiple time-scales, including limit cycles and chaos. Our results suggest design principles for creating ultrafast actuators and autonomous machines from soft, chemically-powered solids.</description>

      <title>All-electrically controlled spintronics in altermagnetic heterostructures</title>

Abstract: The recent discovery of altermagnets, which exhibit spin splitting without net magnetization, opens new directions for spintronics beyond the limits of ferromagnets, antiferromagnets, and spin orbit coupled systems. We investigate spin selective quantum transport in heterostructures composed of a normal metal and a two dimensional d-wave altermagnet, and identify a universal mechanism for achieving perfect spin polarization. The mechanism is dictated by Fermi surface geometry: closed Fermi surfaces in weak altermagnets yield partial and oscillatory spin filtering, whereas open Fermi surfaces in strong altermagnets intrinsically enforce fully spin polarized conductance. Exploiting these distinct transport regimes, we propose all electrical spin filter and spin valve architectures, where resonant tunneling produces highly spin polarized conductance tunable by gate voltage and interface transparency. Altermagnets with open Fermi surfaces further support gate reversible perfect spin polarization that remains robust against interface scattering, disorder, and temperature. We also demonstrate an electrically controlled spin valve that reproduces the functionality of magnetic tunnel junctions without magnetic fields or relativistic mechanisms. d-wave altermagnets with open Fermi surfaces thus provide a promising platform for low dissipation, scalable, and magnetic field free spintronic devices with potential for integration into next generation quantum and CMOS compatible technologies.</description>

      <title>Unveiling Nano-scale Crystal Deformation using Coherent X-ray Dynamical Diffraction</title>

Abstract: Visualization of internal deformation fields in crystalline materials helps bridge the gap between theoretical models and practical applications. Applying Bragg coherent diffraction imaging under X-ray dynamical diffraction conditions provides a promising approach to the longstanding challenge of investigating the deformation fields in micron-sized crystals. Here, we present an automatic differentiation-based reconstruction method that integrates dynamical scattering theory to accurately reconstruct deformation fields in large crystals. Using this forward model, our simulated and experimental results demonstrate that three-dimensional local strain information inside a large crystal can be accurately reconstructed under coherent X-ray dynamical diffraction conditions with Bragg coherent X-ray diffraction imaging. These findings open an avenue for extending the investigation of local deformation fields to microscale crystals while maintaining nanoscale resolution, leveraging the enhanced coherence and brightness of advanced X-ray sources.</description>

      <title>Topological two-body interaction obstructing trivial ground states: an indicator of fractional Chern insulators</title>

Abstract: The search for candidate materials for fractional Chern insulators (FCIs) has mainly focused on the topological and geometrical structures of single-particle Chern bands. However, there are inherent limitations in approaches that neglect interaction effects, highlighting the need for complementary methods. In this work, we discuss how the Chern number defined for the effective interaction projected onto a Chern band is related to the stabilization of FCIs. Specifically, by formulating both the effective interaction and the two-particle problem using a common matrix, we establish a connection between the two-particle band structure and the effective interaction. This formulation allows us to characterize the effective interaction through the topology of the two-particle band. To investigate the relationship between topological effective interactions and FCIs, we perform numerical calculations primarily based on exact diagonalization. We find a notable correlation between the fact that the dominant two-particle bands carry a unit Chern number and the realization of a robust FCI at the filling fraction $\nu = 1/3$. This result is consistent with the presumed correspondence between pseudopotentials in the fractional quantum Hall effect and the two-particle band structure. From another perspective, our findings suggest that the topology inherent in the interaction itself can obstruct trivial ground states. We also discuss this in the context of scattering channels. Extending such topological two-body interactions could pave the way for realizing exotic states beyond FCIs.</description>

      <title>Model for charge carrier spectra in topological semimetals of the TaAs family</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02693v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a four-band model describing the electron energy spectra near the Weyl points in the topological semimetals of the TaAs family (TaAs, TaP, NbAs, NbP). This model takes into account the fact that these Weyl points result from the band-contact lines which would exist in the mirror-reflection planes of these materials if the spin-orbit interaction were absent in them. Within this model, we obtain conditions for the existence of the Weyl points, determine their positions in the Brillouin zone, and derive the explicit formula for dispersion of the bands along the straight line connecting the two close Weyl points with opposite topological charges. Using NbP as an example, the values of the parameters defining the model spectrum are found. The obtained results show that for the semimetals of the TaAs family, the charge-carriers spectrum in the vicinity of the two close Weyl points can be analyzed without complex band-structure calculations.</description>

      <title>Microscale selective laser sintering of Cu nanoparticles with a short-wavelength nanosecond laser</title>

Abstract: Microscale additive manufacturing of reflective copper is becoming increasingly important for microelectronics and microcomputers, due to its excellent electrical and thermal conductivity. Yet, it remains challenging for state-of-the-art commercial metal 3D printers to achieve sub-100-micron manufacturing. Two aspects are sub-optimal using commercial laser powder bed fusion systems with infrared (IR) lasers (wavelength of 1060-1070 nm): (1) IR laser has a low absorption rate for Cu, which is energy-inefficient for manufacturing; (2) short wavelength lasers can potentially offer higher resolution processing due to the diffraction-limited processing. On the other hand, laser sintering or melting typically uses continuous wave (CW) lasers, which may reduce the manufacturing resolution due to a large heat-affected zone. Based on these facts, this study investigates the UV (wavelength of 355 nm) nanosecond (ns) laser sintering of Cu nanoparticles. Different laser processing parameters, as well as different nanoparticle packing densities, are studied. Our results show that a short-wavelength laser can reduce the required energy for sintering with decent morphology, and a densified nanoparticle powder bed favors continuous melting. We further show that sub-20 micron printing can be readily achieved with a UV ns laser. These findings provide new insights into short-wavelength laser-metal nanoparticle interactions, which may pave the way to achieve high-resolution micro and nano-scale additive manufacturing.</description>

      <title>Validation of Quantum Computing for Transition Metal Oxide-based Automotive Catalysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19778</link>

Abstract: Quantum computing presents a promising alternative to classical computational methods for modeling strongly correlated materials with partially filled d orbitals. In this study, we perform a comprehensive quantum resource estimation using quantum phase estimation (QPE) and qubitization techniques for transition metal oxide molecules and a Pd zeolite catalyst fragment. Using the binary oxide molecules TiO, MnO, and FeO, we validate our active space selection and benchmarking methodology, employing classical multireference methods such as complete active space self-consistent field (CASSCF) and N-electron valence state perturbation theory (NEVPT2). We then apply these methods to estimate the quantum resources required for a full-scale quantum simulation of a $Z_2Pd$ ($Z=Al_2Si_{22}O_{48}$) fragment taken from the $Pd/2(Al_xSi_{(1-x)})$ catalyst family where x=Si/Al. Our analysis demonstrates that for large Pd zeolite systems, simulations achieving chemical accuracy would require ~$10^6-10^7$ physical qubits, and range that is consistent with the projected capabilities of future fault-tolerant quantum devices. We further explore the impact of active space size, basis set quality, and phase estimation error on the required qubit and gate counts. These findings provide a roadmap for near-term and future quantum simulations of industrially relevant catalytic materials, offering insights into the feasibility and scaling of quantum chemistry applications in materials science.</description>
