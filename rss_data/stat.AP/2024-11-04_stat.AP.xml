      <title>Analysis of ELSA COVID-19 Substudy response rate using machine learning algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00297v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: National Statistical Organisations every year spend time and money to collect information through surveys. Some of these surveys include follow-up studies, and usually, some participants due to factors such as death, immigration, change of employment, health, etc, do not participate in future surveys. In this study, we focus on the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA) COVID-19 Substudy, which was carried out during the COVID-19 pandemic in two waves. In this substudy, some participants from wave 1 did not participate in wave 2. Our purpose is to predict non-responses using Machine Learning (ML) algorithms such as K-nearest neighbours (KNN), random forest (RF), AdaBoost, logistic regression, neural networks (NN), and support vector classifier (SVC). We find that RF outperforms other models in terms of balanced accuracy, KNN in terms of precision and test accuracy, and logistics regressions in terms of the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC), i.e. AUC.</description>

      <title>Forecasting Mortality in the Middle-Aged and Older Population of England: A 1D-CNN Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00317v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are proven to be effective when data are homogeneous such as images, or when there is a relationship between consecutive data such as time series data. Although CNNs are not famous for tabular data, we show that we can use them in longitudinal data, where individuals' information is recorded over a period and therefore there is a relationship between them. This study considers the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA) survey, conducted every two years. We use one-dimensional convolutional neural networks (1D-CNNs) to forecast mortality using socio-demographics, diseases, mobility impairment, Activities of Daily Living (ADLs), Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADLs), and lifestyle factors. As our dataset is highly imbalanced, we try different over and undersampling methods and find that over-representing the small class improves the results. We also try our model with different activation functions. Our results show that swish nonlinearity outperforms other functions.</description>

      <title>Classification problem in liability insurance using machine learning models: a comparative study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Underwriting is one of the important stages in an insurance company. The insurance company uses different factors to classify the policyholders. In this study, we apply several machine learning models such as nearest neighbour and logistic regression to the Actuarial Challenge dataset used by Qazvini (2019) to classify liability insurance policies into two groups: 1 - policies with claims and 2 - policies without claims.</description>

      <title>Change-point detection in functional time series: Applications to age-specific mortality and fertility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00534v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider determining change points in a time series of age-specific mortality and fertility curves observed over time. We propose two detection methods for identifying these change points. The first method uses a functional cumulative sum statistic to pinpoint the change point. The second method computes a univariate time series of integrated squared forecast errors after fitting a functional time-series model before applying a change-point detection method to the errors to determine the change point. Using Australian age-specific fertility and mortality data, we apply these methods to locate the change points and identify the optimal training period to achieve improved forecast accuracy.</description>

      <title>Adding Error Bars to Evals: A Statistical Approach to Language Model Evaluations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00640v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Evaluations are critical for understanding the capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Fundamentally, evaluations are experiments; but the literature on evaluations has largely ignored the literature from other sciences on experiment analysis and planning. This article shows researchers with some training in statistics how to think about and analyze data from language model evaluations. Conceptualizing evaluation questions as having been drawn from an unseen super-population, we present formulas for analyzing evaluation data, measuring differences between two models, and planning an evaluation experiment. We make a number of specific recommendations for running language model evaluations and reporting experiment results in a way that minimizes statistical noise and maximizes informativeness.</description>

      <title>Consumer Segmentation and Participation Drivers in Community-Supported Agriculture: A Choice Experiment and PLS-SEM Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00010v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As the global food system faces increasing challenges from sustainability, climate change, and food security issues, alternative food networks like Community-Supported Agriculture (CSA) play an essential role in fostering stronger connections between consumers and producers. However, understanding consumer engagement with CSA is fragmented, particularly in Japan where CSA participation is still emerging. This study aims to identify potential CSA participants in Japan and validate existing theories on CSA participation through a quantitative analysis of 2,484 Japanese consumers. Using choice experiments, Latent Class Analysis, and Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling, we identified five distinct consumer segments. The "Sustainable Food Seekers" group showed the highest positive utility for CSA, driven primarily by "Food Education and Learning Opportunities" and "Contribution to Environmental and Social Issues." These factors were consistently significant across all segments, suggesting that many Japanese consumers value CSA for its educational and environmental benefits. In contrast, factors related to "Variety of Ingredients" were less influential in determining participation intentions. The findings suggest that promoting CSA in Japan may be most effective by emphasizing its role in environmental and social impact, rather than focusing solely on product attributes like organic certification, which is readily available in supermarkets. This reflects a key distinction between CSA adoption in Japan and in other cultural contexts, where access to organic produce is a primary driver. For "Sustainable Food Seekers," CSA offers a way to contribute to broader societal goals rather than just securing organic products.</description>

      <title>Efficient Model Compression for Bayesian Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00273v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Model Compression has drawn much attention within the deep learning community recently. Compressing a dense neural network offers many advantages including lower computation cost, deployability to devices of limited storage and memories, and resistance to adversarial attacks. This may be achieved via weight pruning or fully discarding certain input features. Here we demonstrate a novel strategy to emulate principles of Bayesian model selection in a deep learning setup. Given a fully connected Bayesian neural network with spike-and-slab priors trained via a variational algorithm, we obtain the posterior inclusion probability for every node that typically gets lost. We employ these probabilities for pruning and feature selection on a host of simulated and real-world benchmark data and find evidence of better generalizability of the pruned model in all our experiments.</description>

      <title>The Sensitivity of Bayesian Kernel Machine Regression (BKMR) to Data Distribution: A Comprehensive Simulation Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00286v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bayesian Kernel Machine Regression (BKMR) has emerged as a powerful tool to detect negative health effects from exposure to complex multi-pollutant mixtures. However, its performance is degraded when data deviate from normality. In this comprehensive simulation analysis, we show that BKMR's power and test size vary under different distributions and covariance matrix structures. Our results demonstrate specifically that BKMR's robustness is influenced by the response's coefficient of variation (CV), resulting in reduced accuracy to detect true effects when data are skewed. Test sizes become uncontrolled (&gt; 0.05) as CV values increase, leading to inflated false detection rates. However, we find that BKMR effectively utilizes off-diagonal covariance information corresponding to predictor interdependencies, increasing statistical power and accuracy. To achieve reliable and accurate results, we advocate for scrutiny of data skewness and covariance before applying BKMR, particularly when used to predict cognitive decline from blood/urine heavy metal concentrations in environmental health contexts.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Forecasts with scoringutils in R</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.07090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.07090v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Evaluating forecasts is essential to understand and improve forecasting and make forecasts useful to decision makers. A variety of R packages provide a broad variety of scoring rules, visualisations and diagnostic tools. One particular challenge, which scoringutils aims to address, is handling the complexity of evaluating and comparing forecasts from several forecasters across multiple dimensions such as time, space, and different types of targets. scoringutils extends the existing landscape by offering a convenient and flexible data.table-based framework for evaluating and comparing probabilistic forecasts (forecasts represented by a full predictive distribution). Notably, scoringutils is the first package to offer extensive support for probabilistic forecasts in the form of predictive quantiles, a format that is currently used by several infectious disease Forecast Hubs. The package is easily extendable, meaning that users can supply their own scoring rules or extend existing classes to handle new types of forecasts. scoringutils provides broad functionality to check the data and diagnose issues, to visualise forecasts and missing data, to transform data before scoring, to handle missing forecasts, to aggregate scores, and to visualise the results of the evaluation. The paper presents the package and its core functionality and illustrates common workflows using example data of forecasts for COVID-19 cases and deaths submitted to the European COVID-19 Forecast Hub.</description>
