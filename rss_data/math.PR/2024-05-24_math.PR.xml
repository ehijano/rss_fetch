      <title>Quantization dimensions of negative order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note, we investigate the possibility of defining meaningful upper and lower quantization dimensions for a compactly supported Borel probability measure of order $r$, also for negative values of $r$. To this end, we utilize the concept of partition functions, which generalizes the idea of the $L^{q}$-spectrum and, in this way, naturally extends the work in [M. Kesseb\"ohmer, A. Niemann, and S. Zhu. Quantization dimensions of probability measures via R\'enyi dimensions. $\textit{Trans. Amer. Math. Soc.}$ 376.7 (2023), 4661$\unicode{x2013}$4678]. In particular, we provide natural fractal geometric bounds as well as easily verifiable necessary conditions for the existence of the quantization dimensions. Exact asymptotics for the absolutely continuous case are also given.</description>

      <title>The Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi Random Graph Conditioned on Every Component Being a Clique</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13454v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider an Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random graph, conditioned on the rare event that all connected components are fully connected. Such graphs can be considered as partitions of vertices into cliques. Hence, this conditional distribution defines a distribution over partitions. Using tools from analytic combinatorics, we prove limit theorems for several graph observables: the number of cliques; the number of edges; and the degree distribution. We consider several regimes of the connection probability $p$ as the number of vertices $n$ diverges. For $p=\frac{1}{2}$, the conditioning yields the uniform distribution over set partitions, which is well-studied, but has not been studied as a graph distribution before. For $p &lt; \frac{1}{2}$, we show that the number of cliques is of the order $n/\sqrt{\log n}$, while for $p &gt; \frac{1}{2}$, we prove that the graph consists of a single clique with high probability. This shows that there is a phase transition at $p=\frac{1}{2}$. We additionally study the near-critical regime $p_n\downarrow\frac{1}{2}$, as well as the sparse regime $p_n\downarrow0$.</description>

      <title>Warning Signs for Boundary Noise and their Application to an Ocean Boussinesq Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13550v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we construct and discuss early-warning signs of the approach of a parameter to a deterministic bifurcation on a stochastic partial differential equation (SPDE) model with Gaussian white-noise on the boundary. We specifically focus on the qualitative behaviour of the time-asymptotic autocovariance and autocorrelation of the solutions of the linearized system. We also discuss the reliability of the tools from an analytic perspective and through various examples. Among those, the application of the early-warning signs for an ocean Boussinesq model is explored through numerical simulations. The analytic results obtained expand on previous work and present valuable early-warning signs for various applications.</description>

      <title>The effect of reducible Markov modulation on tail probabilities in models of random growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13556v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A recent economic literature deals with models of random growth in which the size (say, log-wealth) of an individual economic agent is subject to light-tailed random additive shocks over time. The distribution of these shocks depends on a latent Markov modulator. It has been shown that if Markov modulation is irreducible then the models give rise to a distribution of sizes across agents whose upper tail resembles, in a particular sense, that of an exponential distribution. We show that while this need not be the case under reducible Markov modulation, the upper tail will nevertheless resemble that of an Erlang distribution. A novel extension of the Rothblum index theorem from an affine setting to a holomorphic one allows us to characterize the shape parameter for the relevant Erlang distribution.</description>

Abstract: We discuss two-sided non-asymptotic bounds for the mean spectral norm of nonhomogenous weighted Rademacher matrices. We show that the recently formulated conjecture holds up to $\log \log \log n$ factor for arbitrary $n\times n$ Rademacher matrices and the triple logarithm may be eliminated for matrices with $\{0,1\}$-coefficients.</description>

      <title>Weak uniqueness for singular stochastic equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13780v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We put forward a new method for proving weak uniqueness of stochastic equations with singular drifts driven by a non-Markov or infinite-dimensional noise. We apply our method to study stochastic heat equation (SHE) driven by Gaussian space-time white noise $$ \frac{\partial}{\partial t} u_t(x)=\frac12 \frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2}u_t(x)+b(u_t(x))+\dot{W}_{t}(x), \quad t&gt;0,\, x\in D\subset\mathbb{R}, $$ and multidimensional stochastic differential equation (SDE) driven by fractional Brownian motion with the Hurst index $H\in(0,1/2)$ $$ d X_t=b(X_t) dt +d B_t^H,\quad t&gt;0. $$ In both cases $b$ is a generalized function in the Besov space $\mathcal{B}^\alpha_{\infty,\infty}$, $\alpha&lt;0$. Well-known pathwise uniqueness results for these equations do not cover the entire range of the parameter $\alpha$, for which weak existence holds. What happens in the range where weak existence holds but pathwise uniqueness is unknown has been an open problem. We settle this problem and show that for SHE weak uniqueness holds for $\alpha&gt;-3/2$, and for SDE it holds for $\alpha&gt;1/2-1/(2H)$; thus, in both cases, it holds in the entire desired range of values of $\alpha$. This extends seminal results of Catellier and Gubinelli (2016) and Gy\"ongy and Pardoux (1993) to the weak well-posedness setting. To establish these results, we develop a new strategy, combining ideas from ergodic theory (generalized couplings of Hairer-Mattingly-Kulik-Scheutzow) with stochastic sewing of L\^e.</description>

      <title>Multivariate Tempered Space-Fractional Negative Binomial Process and Risk Models with Shocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13813v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we first define the multivariate tempered space-fractional Poisson process (MTSFPP) by time-changing the multivariate Poisson process with an independent tempered {\alpha}-stable subordinator. Its distributional properties, the mixture tempered time and space variants and their PDEs connections are studied. Then we define the multivariate tempered space-fractional negative binomial process (MTSFNBP) and explore its key features. The L\'evy measure density for the MTSFNBP is also derived. We present a bivariate risk model with a common shock driven by the tempered space-fractional negative binomial process. We demonstrate that the total claim amount process is stochastically equivalent to a univariate generalized Cramer-Lundberg risk model. In addition, some important ruin measures such as ruin probability, joint distribution of time to ruin and deficit at ruin along with governing integro-differential equations are obtained. Finally we show that the underlying risk process exhibits the long range dependence property.</description>

      <title>The stochastic Landau--Lifshitz--Baryakhtar equation: Global solution and invariant measure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Landau--Lifshitz--Baryakhtar (LLBar) equation perturbed by a space-dependent noise is a system of fourth order stochastic PDEs which models the evolution of magnetic spin fields in ferromagnetic materials at elevated temperatures, taking into account longitudinal damping, long-range interactions, and noise-induced phenomena at high temperatures. In this paper, we show the existence of a martingale solution (which is analytically strong) to the stochastic LLBar equation posed in a bounded domain $\mathscr{D}\subset \mathbb{R}^d$, where $d=1,2,3$. We also prove pathwise uniqueness of the solution, which implies the existence of a unique probabilistically strong solution. Finally, we show the Feller property of the Markov semigroup associated with the strong solution, which implies the existence of invariant measures.</description>

      <title>A confined random walk locally looks like tilted random interlacements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14329v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we consider the simple random walk on $\mathbb{Z}^d$, $d \geq 3$, conditioned to stay in a large domain $D_N$ of typical diameter $N$. Considering the range up to time $t_N \geq N^{2+\delta}$ for some $\delta &gt; 0$, we establish a coupling with what Teixeira (2009) and Li &amp; Sznitman (2014) defined as "tilted random interlacements". This tilted interlacement can be described as random interlacements but with trajectories given by random walks on conductances $c_N(x,y) = \phi_N(x) \phi_N(y)$, where $\phi_N$ is the first eigenvector of the discrete Laplace-Beltrami operator on $D_N$. The coupling follows the methodology of the soft local times, introduced by Popov &amp; Teixeira (2015) and used by \v{C}ern\'y &amp; Teixeira (2016) to prove the well-known coupling between the simple random walk on the torus and the random interlacements.</description>

      <title>Skew-symmetric schemes for stochastic differential equations with non-Lipschitz drift: an unadjusted Barker algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a new simple and explicit numerical scheme for time-homogeneous stochastic differential equations. The scheme is based on sampling increments at each time step from a skew-symmetric probability distribution, with the level of skewness determined by the drift and volatility of the underlying process. We show that as the step-size decreases the scheme converges weakly to the diffusion of interest. We then consider the problem of simulating from the limiting distribution of an ergodic diffusion process using the numerical scheme with a fixed step-size. We establish conditions under which the numerical scheme converges to equilibrium at a geometric rate, and quantify the bias between the equilibrium distributions of the scheme and of the true diffusion process. Notably, our results do not require a global Lipschitz assumption on the drift, in contrast to those required for the Euler--Maruyama scheme for long-time simulation at fixed step-sizes. Our weak convergence result relies on an extension of the theory of Milstein \&amp; Tretyakov to stochastic differential equations with non-Lipschitz drift, which could also be of independent interest. We support our theoretical results with numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Invariance of Gaussian RKHSs under Koopman operators of stochastic differential equations with constant matrix coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14429v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the Koopman operator semigroup $(K^t)_{t\ge 0}$ associated with stochastic differential equations of the form $dX_t = AX_t\,dt + B\,dW_t$ with constant matrices $A$ and $B$ and Brownian motion $W_t$. We prove that the reproducing kernel Hilbert space $\bH_C$ generated by a Gaussian kernel with a positive definite covariance matrix $C$ is invariant under each Koopman operator $K^t$ if the matrices $A$, $B$, and $C$ satisfy the following Lyapunov-like matrix inequality: $AC^2 + C^2A^\top\le 2BB^\top$. In this course, we prove a characterization concerning the inclusion $\bH_{C_1}\subset\bH_{C_2}$ of Gaussian RKHSs for two positive definite matrices $C_1$ and $C_2$. The question of whether the sufficient Lyapunov-condition is also necessary is left as an open problem.</description>

      <title>A periodic Kingman model for the balance between mutation and selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a periodic extension of the classical Kingman non-linear model (Kingman, 1978) for the balance between selection and mutation in a large population. In the original model, the fitness distribution of the population is modeled by a probability measure on the unit interval evolving through a simple dynamical system in discrete time: selection acts through size-biasing, and the mutation probability and distribution are kept fixed through time. A natural extension of Kingman model is given by a periodic mutation environment; in this setting, we prove the convergence of the fitness distribution along subsequences and find an explicit criterion in terms of the Perron eigenvalue of an appropriately chosen matrix to decide whether an atom emerges at the largest fitness, a phenomenon usually called condensation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14723v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider three-state cellular automata in two dimensions in which two colored states, blue and red, compete for control of the empty background, starting from low initial densities $p$ and $q$. When the dynamics of both colored types are one-dimensional, the dynamics has three distinct phases, characterized by a power relationship between $p$ and $q$: two in which one of the colors is prevalent, and one when the colored types block each other and leave most of the space forever empty. When one of the colors spread in two dimensions and the other in one dimension, we also establish a power relation between $p$ and $q$ that characterizes which of the two colors eventually controls most of the space.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14819v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $U,H$ be two separable Hilbert spaces and $T&gt;0$. We consider an SDE which evolves in the Hilbert space $H$ of the form \begin{align} dX(t)=AX(t)dt+\widetilde{\mathscr L}B(X(t))dt+GdW(t), \quad t\in[0,T], \quad X(0)=x \in H, \end{align} where $A:D(A)\subseteq H\to H$ is the infinitesimal generator of a strongly continuous semigroup $(e^{tA})_{t\geq0}$, $W=(W(t))_{t\geq0}$ is a $U$-cylindrical Wiener process defined on a normal filtered probability space $(\Omega,\mathcal{F},\{\mathcal{F}_t\}_{t\in [0,T]},\mathbb{P})$, $B:H\to H$ is a bounded and $\theta$-H\"older continuous function, for some suitable $\theta\in(0,1)$, and $\widetilde{\mathscr L}:H\to H$ and $G:U\to H$ are linear bounded operators. We prove that, under suitable assumptions on the coefficients, the weak mild solution to the equation depends on the initial datum in a Lipschitz way. This implies that pathwise uniqueness holds true. Here, the presence of the operator $\Lambda$ plays a crucial role. In particular the conditions assumed on the coefficients cover the stochastic damped wave equation in dimension $1$ and the stochastic damped Euler--Bernoulli Beam equation upto dimension $3$ even in the hyperbolic case.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12988v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, our focus lies on the Merton's jump diffusion model, employing jump processes characterized by the compound Poisson process. Our primary objective is to forecast the drift and volatility of the model using a variety of methodologies. We adopt an approach that involves implementing different drift, volatility, and jump terms within the model through various machine learning techniques, traditional methods, and statistical methods on price-volume data. Additionally, we introduce a path-dependent Monte Carlo simulation to model cryptocurrency prices, taking into account the volatility and unexpected jumps in prices.</description>

      <title>On Convergence of the Alternating Directions SGHMC Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13140v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study convergence rates of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) algorithms with leapfrog integration under mild conditions on stochastic gradient oracle for the target distribution (SGHMC). Our method extends standard HMC by allowing the use of general auxiliary distributions, which is achieved by a novel procedure of Alternating Directions.
  The convergence analysis is based on the investigations of the Dirichlet forms associated with the underlying Markov chain driving the algorithms. For this purpose, we provide a detailed analysis on the error of the leapfrog integrator for Hamiltonian motions with both the kinetic and potential energy functions in general form. We characterize the explicit dependence of the convergence rates on key parameters such as the problem dimension, functional properties of both the target and auxiliary distributions, and the quality of the oracle.</description>

      <title>Gaussian Measures Conditioned on Nonlinear Observations: Consistency, MAP Estimators, and Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13149v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The article presents a systematic study of the problem of conditioning a Gaussian random variable $\xi$ on nonlinear observations of the form $F \circ \phi(\xi)$ where $\phi: \mathcal{X} \to \mathbb{R}^N$ is a bounded linear operator and $F$ is nonlinear. Such problems arise in the context of Bayesian inference and recent machine learning-inspired PDE solvers. We give a representer theorem for the conditioned random variable $\xi \mid F\circ \phi(\xi)$, stating that it decomposes as the sum of an infinite-dimensional Gaussian (which is identified analytically) as well as a finite-dimensional non-Gaussian measure. We also introduce a novel notion of the mode of a conditional measure by taking the limit of the natural relaxation of the problem, to which we can apply the existing notion of maximum a posteriori estimators of posterior measures. Finally, we introduce a variant of the Laplace approximation for the efficient simulation of the aforementioned conditioned Gaussian random variables towards uncertainty quantification.</description>

      <title>Analysis of reconstruction from noisy discrete generalized Radon data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13269v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a wide class of generalized Radon transforms $\mathcal R$, which act in $\mathbb{R}^n$ for any $n\ge 2$ and integrate over submanifolds of any codimension $N$, $1\le N\le n-1$. Also, we allow for a fairly general reconstruction operator $\mathcal A$. The main requirement is that $\mathcal A$ be a Fourier integral operator with a phase function, which is linear in the phase variable. We consider the task of image reconstruction from discrete data $g_{j,k} = (\mathcal R f)_{j,k} + \eta_{j,k}$. We show that the reconstruction error $N_\epsilon^{\text{rec}}=\mathcal A \eta_{j,k}$ satisfies $N^{\text{rec}}(\check x;x_0)=\lim_{\epsilon\to0}N_\epsilon^{\text{rec}}(x_0+\epsilon\check x)$, $\check x\in D$. Here $x_0$ is a fixed point, $D\subset\mathbb{R}^n$ is a bounded domain, and $\eta_{j,k}$ are independent, but not necessarily identically distributed, random variables. $N^{\text{rec}}$ and $N_\epsilon^{\text{rec}}$ are viewed as continuous random functions of the argument $\check x$ (random fields), and the limit is understood in the sense of probability distributions. Under some conditions on the first three moments of $\eta_{j,k}$ (and some other not very restrictive conditions on $x_0$ and $\mathcal A$), we prove that $N^{\text{rec}}$ is a zero mean Gaussian random field and explicitly compute its covariance. We also present a numerical experiment with a cone beam transform in $\mathbb{R}^3$, which shows an excellent match between theoretical predictions and simulated reconstructions.</description>

      <title>Sharp analysis on the joint distribution of the number of descents and inverse descents in a random permutation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13439v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chatteerjee and Diaconis have recently shown the asymptotic normality for the joint distribution of the number of descents and inverse descents in a random permutation. A noteworthy point of their results is that the asymptotic variance of the normal distribution is diagonal, which means that the number of descents and inverse descents are asymptotically uncorrelated.The goal of this paper is to go further in this analysis by proving a large deviation principlefor the joint distribution. We shall show that the rate function of the joint distributionis the sum of the rate functions of the marginal distributions, which also means that the number of descents and inverse descents are asymptotically independent at the large deviation level. However,we are going to prove that they are finely dependent at the sharp large deviation level.</description>

Abstract: On March 16, 2024, Daniel Litt, in an X-post, proposed the following brainteaser: "Flip a fair coin 100 times. It gives a sequence of heads (H) and tails (T). For each HH in the sequence of flips, Alice gets a point; for each HT, Bob does, so e.g. for the sequence THHHT Alice gets 2 points and Bob gets 1 point. Who is most likely to win?" We show the power of symbolic computation, in particular the (continuous) Almkvist-Zeilberger algorithm, to answer this, and far more general, questions of this kind.</description>

      <title>Bounds on the approximation error for deep neural networks applied to dispersive models: Nonlinear waves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13566v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive framework for deriving rigorous and efficient bounds on the approximation error of deep neural networks in PDE models characterized by branching mechanisms, such as waves, Schr\"odinger equations, and other dispersive models. This framework utilizes the probabilistic setting established by Henry-Labord\`ere and Touzi. We illustrate this approach by providing rigorous bounds on the approximation error for both linear and nonlinear waves in physical dimensions $d=1,2,3$, and analyze their respective computational costs starting from time zero. We investigate two key scenarios: one involving a linear perturbative source term, and another focusing on pure nonlinear internal interactions.</description>

      <title>Exact Gradients for Stochastic Spiking Neural Networks Driven by Rough Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13587v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a mathematically rigorous framework based on rough path theory to model stochastic spiking neural networks (SSNNs) as stochastic differential equations with event discontinuities (Event SDEs) and driven by c\`adl\`ag rough paths. Our formalism is general enough to allow for potential jumps to be present both in the solution trajectories as well as in the driving noise. We then identify a set of sufficient conditions ensuring the existence of pathwise gradients of solution trajectories and event times with respect to the network's parameters and show how these gradients satisfy a recursive relation. Furthermore, we introduce a general-purpose loss function defined by means of a new class of signature kernels indexed on c\`adl\`ag rough paths and use it to train SSNNs as generative models. We provide an end-to-end autodifferentiable solver for Event SDEs and make its implementation available as part of the $\texttt{diffrax}$ library. Our framework is, to our knowledge, the first enabling gradient-based training of SSNNs with noise affecting both the spike timing and the network's dynamics.</description>

      <title>Neural Networks-based Random Vortex Methods for Modelling Incompressible Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13691v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we introduce a novel Neural Networks-based approach for approximating solutions to the (2D) incompressible Navier--Stokes equations. Our algorithm uses a Physics-informed Neural Network, that approximates the vorticity based on a loss function that uses a computationally efficient formulation of the Random Vortex dynamics. The neural vorticity estimator is then combined with traditional numerical PDE-solvers for the Poisson equation to compute the velocity field. The main advantage of our method compared to standard Physics-informed Neural Networks is that it strictly enforces physical properties, such as incompressibility or boundary conditions, which might otherwise be hard to guarantee with purely Neural Networks-based approaches.</description>

      <title>Efficient Two-Stage Gaussian Process Regression Via Automatic Kernel Search and Subsampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13785v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) is widely used in statistics and machine learning for prediction tasks requiring uncertainty measures. Its efficacy depends on the appropriate specification of the mean function, covariance kernel function, and associated hyperparameters. Severe misspecifications can lead to inaccurate results and problematic consequences, especially in safety-critical applications. However, a systematic approach to handle these misspecifications is lacking in the literature. In this work, we propose a general framework to address these issues. Firstly, we introduce a flexible two-stage GPR framework that separates mean prediction and uncertainty quantification (UQ) to prevent mean misspecification, which can introduce bias into the model. Secondly, kernel function misspecification is addressed through a novel automatic kernel search algorithm, supported by theoretical analysis, that selects the optimal kernel from a candidate set. Additionally, we propose a subsampling-based warm-start strategy for hyperparameter initialization to improve efficiency and avoid hyperparameter misspecification. With much lower computational cost, our subsampling-based strategy can yield competitive or better performance than training exclusively on the full dataset. Combining all these components, we recommend two GPR methods-exact and scalable-designed to match available computational resources and specific UQ requirements. Extensive evaluation on real-world datasets, including UCI benchmarks and a safety-critical medical case study, demonstrates the robustness and precision of our methods.</description>

      <title>Matrix Denoising with Doubly Heteroscedastic Noise: Fundamental Limits and Optimal Spectral Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13912v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the matrix denoising problem of estimating the singular vectors of a rank-$1$ signal corrupted by noise with both column and row correlations. Existing works are either unable to pinpoint the exact asymptotic estimation error or, when they do so, the resulting approaches (e.g., based on whitening or singular value shrinkage) remain vastly suboptimal. On top of this, most of the literature has focused on the special case of estimating the left singular vector of the signal when the noise only possesses row correlation (one-sided heteroscedasticity). In contrast, our work establishes the information-theoretic and algorithmic limits of matrix denoising with doubly heteroscedastic noise. We characterize the exact asymptotic minimum mean square error, and design a novel spectral estimator with rigorous optimality guarantees: under a technical condition, it attains positive correlation with the signals whenever information-theoretically possible and, for one-sided heteroscedasticity, it also achieves the Bayes-optimal error. Numerical experiments demonstrate the significant advantage of our theoretically principled method with the state of the art. The proofs draw connections with statistical physics and approximate message passing, departing drastically from standard random matrix theory techniques.</description>

      <title>The Chromatic Number of Very Dense Random Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13914v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The chromatic number of a very dense random graph $G(n,p)$, with $p \ge 1 - n^{-c}$ for some constant $c &gt; 0$, was first studied by Surya and Warnke, who conjectured that the typical deviation of $\chi(G(n,p))$ from its mean is of order $\sqrt{\mu_r}$, % fluctuates by about $\Theta(\sqrt{\mu_r})$, where $\mu_r$ is the expected number of independent sets of size $r$, and $r$ is maximal such that $\mu_r &gt; 1$, except when $\mu_r = O(\log n)$. They moreover proved their conjecture in the case $n^{-2} \ll 1 - p = O(n^{-1})$.
  In this paper, we study $\chi(G(n,p))$ in the range $n^{-1}\log n \ll 1 - p \ll n^{-2/3}$, that is, when the largest independent set of $G(n,p)$ is typically of size 3. We prove in this case that $\chi(G(n,p))$ is concentrated on some interval of length $O(\sqrt{\mu_3})$, %$O\big(n^{3/2}(1-p)^{3/2}\big)=O(\sqrt{\mu_3})$ with high probability. Moreover for a big family of $p(n)$, there is and for sufficiently `smooth' functions $p = p(n)$, that there are infinitely many values of $n$ such that $\chi(G(n,p))$ is not concentrated on any interval of size $o(\sqrt{\mu_3})$. We also show that $\chi(G(n,p))$ satisfies a central limit theorem in the range $n^{-1} \log n \ll 1 - p \ll n^{-7/9}$.</description>

      <title>Diffusion models for Gaussian distributions: Exact solutions and Wasserstein errors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14250v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion or score-based models recently showed high performance in image generation. They rely on a forward and a backward stochastic differential equations (SDE). The sampling of a data distribution is achieved by solving numerically the backward SDE or its associated flow ODE. Studying the convergence of these models necessitates to control four different types of error: the initialization error, the truncation error, the discretization and the score approximation. In this paper, we study theoretically the behavior of diffusion models and their numerical implementation when the data distribution is Gaussian. In this restricted framework where the score function is a linear operator, we can derive the analytical solutions of the forward and backward SDEs as well as the associated flow ODE. This provides exact expressions for various Wasserstein errors which enable us to compare the influence of each error type for any sampling scheme, thus allowing to monitor convergence directly in the data space instead of relying on Inception features. Our experiments show that the recommended numerical schemes from the diffusion models literature are also the best sampling schemes for Gaussian distributions.</description>

Abstract: The now classical convergence in distribution theorem for well normalized sums ofstationary martingale increments has been extended to multi-indexed martingaleincrements (see Voln\'{y} (2019) and references in there). In the presentarticle we make progress in the identification of the limit law.In dimension one, as soon as the stationary martingale increments form an ergodic process, the limit law is normal, and it is stillthe case for multi-indexed martingale increments when one of the processes defined by one coordinate of the{\it multidimensional time} is ergodic. In the general case, the limit may be non normal.The dynamical properties of the $\mathbb{Z}^d$-measure preserving action associatedto the stationary random field allows us to give a necessary and sufficient conditionfor the existence of a non-normal limit law, in terms of entropy of some random processes.The identification of a {\it natural} factor on which the $\mathbb{Z}^d$-action is {\it of product type</description>

      <title>Quantifying Multivariate Graph Dependencies: Theory and Estimation for Multiplex Graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14482v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multiplex graphs, characterised by their layered structure, exhibit informative interdependencies within layers that are crucial for understanding complex network dynamics. Quantifying the interaction and shared information among these layers is challenging due to the non-Euclidean structure of graphs. Our paper introduces a comprehensive theory of multivariate information measures for multiplex graphs. We introduce graphon mutual information for pairs of graphs and expand this to graphon interaction information for three or more graphs, including their conditional variants. We then define graphon total correlation and graphon dual total correlation, along with their conditional forms, and introduce graphon $O-$information. We discuss and quantify the concepts of synergy and redundancy in graphs for the first time, introduce consistent nonparametric estimators for these multivariate graphon information--theoretic measures, and provide their convergence rates. We also conduct a simulation study to illustrate our theoretical findings and demonstrate the relationship between the introduced measures, multiplex graph structure, and higher--order interdependecies. Real-world applications further show the utility of our estimators in revealing shared information and dependence structures in real-world multiplex graphs. This work not only answers fundamental questions about information sharing across multiple graphs but also sets the stage for advanced pattern analysis in complex networks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14836v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider limit probabilities of first order properties in random graphs with a given degree sequence. Under mild conditions on the degree sequence, we show that the closure set of limit probabilities is a finite union of closed intervals. Moreover, we characterize the degree sequences for which this closure set is the interval $[0,1]$, a property that is intimately related with the probability that the random graph is acyclic. As a side result, we compile a full description of the cycle distribution of random graphs and study their fragment (disjoint union of unicyclic components) in the subcritical regime. Finally, we amend the proof of the existence of limit probabilities for first order properties in random graphs with a given degree sequence; this result was already claimed by Lynch~[IEEE LICS 2003] but his proof contained some inaccuracies.</description>

Abstract: In this work we establish weak convergence rates for temporal discretisations of stochastic wave equations with multiplicative noise, in particular, for the hyperbolic Anderson model. For this class of stochastic partial differential equations the weak convergence rates we obtain are indeed twice the known strong rates. To the best of our knowledge, our findings are the first in the scientific literature which provide essentially sharp weak convergence rates for temporal discretisations of stochastic wave equations with multiplicative noise. Key ideas of our proof are a sophisticated splitting of the error and applications of the recently introduced mild It\^{o} formula. We complement our analytical findings by means of numerical simulations in Python for the decay of the weak approximation error for SPDEs for four different test functions.</description>

Abstract: Given an $R^d$-valued random field (rf) $Z(t),t\in T$ and an $\alpha$-homogeneous mapping $\kappa$ we define the corresponding equivalent class of rf's (denoted by $K_\alpha$) which include representers of the same tail measure $\nu_Z$. When $T$ is an additive group, tractable equivalent classes of interest are the shift-invariant ones, which contain in particular all independent random shifts of $Z$. This contribution is mainly concerned with the investigation of the probabilistic properties of shift-invariant $K_\alpha$'s. Important objects introduced in our setting are tail and spectral tail rf's. Further, the class of universal maps $U$ acting on elements of $K_\alpha$ turns out to be crucial for properties of functionals of $Z$. Applications of our findings concern max-stable and symmetric $\alpha$-stable rf's, their maximal indices as well as their random shift-representations.</description>

      <title>Optimal local laws and CLT for the circular Riesz gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.05881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2112.05881v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the long-range one-dimensional Riesz gas on the circle, a continuous system of particles interacting through a Riesz kernel. We establish near-optimal rigidity estimates on gaps valid at any scale. Leveraging on these local laws together with Stein's method, we prove a quantitative Central Limit Theorem for linear statistics. The proof is based on a mean-field transport and a fine analysis of the fluctuations of local error terms using various convexity and monotonicity arguments. By using a comparison principle for the Helffer-Sj\"ostrand equation, the method can handle very singular test-functions, including characteristic functions of intervals.</description>

      <title>HMC and underdamped Langevin united in the unadjusted convex smooth case</title>

      <description>arXiv:2202.00977v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a family of unadjusted generalized HMC samplers, which includes standard position HMC samplers and discretizations of the underdamped Langevin process. A detailed analysis and optimization of the parameters is conducted in the Gaussian case, which shows an improvement from $1/\kappa$ to $1/\sqrt{\kappa}$ for the convergence rate in terms of the condition number $\kappa$ by using partial velocity refreshment, with respect to classical full refreshments. A similar effect is observed empirically for two related algorithms, namely Metropolis-adjusted gHMC and kinetic piecewise-deterministic Markov processes. Then, a stochastic gradient version of the samplers is considered, for which dimension-free convergence rates are established for log-concave smooth targets over a large range of parameters, gathering in a unified framework previous results on position HMC and underdamped Langevin and extending them to HMC with inertia.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2208.09922v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Concentration inequalities for the sample mean, like those due to Bernstein and Hoeffding, are valid for any sample size but overly conservative, yielding confidence intervals that are unnecessarily wide. The central limit theorem (CLT) provides asymptotic confidence intervals with optimal width, but these are invalid for all sample sizes. To resolve this tension, we develop new computable concentration inequalities with asymptotically optimal size, finite-sample validity, and sub-Gaussian decay. These bounds enable the construction of efficient confidence intervals with correct coverage for any sample size and efficient empirical Berry-Esseen bounds that require no prior knowledge of the population variance. We derive our inequalities by tightly bounding non-uniform Kolmogorov and Wasserstein distances to a Gaussian using zero-bias couplings and Stein's method of exchangeable pairs.</description>

      <title>Fluid limits for interacting queues in sparse dynamic graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.13054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.13054v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Consider a network of $n$ single-server queues where tasks arrive independently at each of the servers at rate $\lambda_n$. The servers are interconnected by a graph that is resampled at rate $\mu_n$ in a way that is symmetric with respect to the servers, and each task is dispatched to the shortest queue in the graph neighborhood where it appears. The so-called occupancy process describes the empirical distribution of the number of tasks across the servers. This stochastic process evolves on the underlying dynamic graph, and its dynamics depend on the the number of tasks at each individual server and the neighborhood structure of the graph. We prove that this dependency disappears in the limit as $n \to \infty$ when $\lambda_n / n \to \lambda$ and $\mu_n \to \infty$, and establish that the limit of the occupancy process is given by a system of differential equations that depends solely on $\lambda$ and the limiting degree distribution of the graph. We further show that the stationary distribution of the occupancy process converges to an equilibrium point of the differential equations, and derive properties of this equilibrium that reflect the impact of the degree distribution. Our focus is on truly sparse graphs where the maximum degree is uniformly bounded across $n$, making neighboring servers strongly correlated.</description>

      <title>Higher-order propagation of chaos in $L^2$ for interacting diffusions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.09654v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study diffusions with bounded pairwise interaction. We show for the first time propagation of chaos on arbitrary time horizons in a stronger $L^2$-based distance, as opposed to the usual Wasserstein or relative entropy distances. The estimate is based on iterating inequalities derived from the BBGKY hierarchy and does not follow directly from bounds on the full $N$-particle density. This argument gives the optimal rate in $N$, showing the distance between the $j$-particle marginal density and the tensor product of the mean-field limit is $O(N^{-1})$. We use cluster expansions to give perturbative higher-order corrections to the mean-field limit. For an arbitrary order $i$, these provide ``low-dimensional'' approximations to the $j$-particle marginal density with error $O(N^{-(i+1)})$.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Representations of Ordered Exponentials: Vector-Valued Schr\"odinger Semigroups and the Combinatorics of Anderson Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.08564v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide two applications of an elementary (yet seemingly unknown) probabilistic representation of matrix ordered exponentials, which generalizes the Feynman-Kac formula in finite dimensions and the change of measure formula between two continuous-time Markov processes on a finite state space.
  Our first and main application consists of a new Feynman-Kac formula for a class of vector-valued Schr\"odinger operators on the line, which is driven by two sources of randomness: The usual Brownian motion, and a continuous-time Markov process on a finite state space. An important feature of these formulas -- which is at the core of our motivation -- is that they enable the calculation of the joint moments of the semigroup kernels when the matrix potential function contains a continuous Gaussian noise. In particular, our moment formulas shed new light on what the joint moments of the Feynman-Kac kernels of the multivariate stochastic Airy operators of Bloemendal and Vir\'ag (Ann. Probab., 44(4):2726--2769, 2016.) should be; we state a precise conjecture to that effect, which we pursue in a forthcoming paper.
  Our second application consists of Feynman-Kac formulas for the expected square modulus $\mathbf E\big[|\Psi(t,x)|^2\big]$ of the solutions of the Schr\"odinger equation $\partial_t\Psi=-\mathsf i\mathcal H(t)\Psi$ with a time-dependent Hamiltonian $\mathcal H(t)$. Using this, we show that when we take $\mathcal H(t)=-\Delta+q(t,x)$ restricted to a finite box within $\mathbb Z^d$, where $q(t,x)$ is a possibly time-dependent Gaussian process, $\mathbf E\big[|\Psi(t,x)|^2\big]$ can be written as a relatively simple expectation that involves self- and mutual-intersections of random walks. In particular, this formula hints at a unified combinatorial mechanism that explains the occurrence of localization for both time-dependent and time-independent noises.</description>

      <title>Fluctuations of the occupation density for a parking process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.10000v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Consider the following simple parking process on $\Lambda_n := \{-n, \ldots, n\}^d,d\ge1$: at each step, a site $i$ is chosen at random in $\Lambda_n$ and if $i$ and all its nearest neighbor sites are empty, $i$ is occupied. Once occupied, a site remains so forever. The process continues until all sites in $\Lambda_n$ are either occupied or have at least one of their nearest neighbors occupied. The final configuration (occupancy) of $\Lambda_n$ is called the jamming limit and is denoted by $X_{\Lambda_n}$. Ritchie (2006) constructed a stationary random field on $\mathbb Z^d$ obtained as a (thermodynamic) limit of the $X_{\Lambda_n}$'s as $n$ tends to infinity. As a consequence of his construction, he proved a strong law of large numbers for the proportion of occupied sites in the box $\Lambda_n$ for the random field $X$. Here we prove the central limit theorem, the law of iterated logarithm, and a gaussian concentration inequality for the same statistics. A particular attention will be given to the case $d=1$, in which we also obtain new asymptotic properties for the sequence $X_{\Lambda_n},n\ge1$ as well as a new proof to the closed-form formula for the occupation density of the parking process.</description>

      <title>Representation and Characterization of Quasistationary Distributions for Markov Chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.11154v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work provides complete description of Quasistationary Distributions (QSDs) for Markov chains with a unique absorbing state and an irreducible set of non-absorbing states. As is well-known, every QSD has an associated absorption parameter describing the exponential tail of the absorption time under the law of the process with the QSD as the initial distribution. The analysis associated with the existence and representation of QSDs corresponding to a given parameter is according to whether the moment generating function of the absorption time starting from any non-absorbing state evaluated at the parameter is finite or infinite, the finite or infinite moment generating function regimes, respectively. For parameters in the finite regime, it is shown that when exist, all QSDs are in the convex cone of a Martin entry boundary associated with the parameter. The infinite regime corresponds to at most one parameter value and at most one QSD. In this regime, when a QSD exists, it is unique and can be represented by a renewal-type formula. Multiple applications to the findings are presented, including revisiting some of the main classical results in the area.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, a general result on the long time quantitative propagation of chaos in total variation distance for mean field interacting particle system driven by general L\'{e}vy noise is derived. Moreover, by using the method of coupling, the general result is applied to mean field interacting particle system driven by Brownian motion and $\alpha(\alpha&gt;1)$-stable noise respectively, where the non-interacting drift is assumed to be dissipative in long distance and the initial distribution of interacting particle system converges to that of the limit equation in $L^1$-Wasserstein distance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12234v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For the non-gradient exclusion process, we prove the quantitative homogenization in the approximation of the diffusion matrix and the conductivity by local functions. The proof relies on the renormalization approach developed by Armstrong, Kuusi, Mourrat, and Smart, while the new challenge here is the hard core constraint of particle number on every site. Therefore, a coarse-grained method is proposed to lift the configuration to a larger space without exclusion, and a gradient coupling between two systems is applied to capture the spatial cancellation. We then strengthen the convergence rate to be uniform concerning the density and integrate it into the work by Funaki, Uchiyama, and Yau [IMA Vol. Math. Appl., 77 (1996), pp. 1-40.] to yield a quantitative hydrodynamic limit. Our new approach avoids showing the characterization of closed forms and provides stronger results. The extension is discussed for the model in the presence of disorder on the bonds.</description>

Abstract: A L\'evy processes resurrected in the positive half-line is a Markov process obtained by removing successively all jumps that make it negative. A natural question, given this construction, is whether the resulting process is absorbed at 0 or not. We first describe the law of the resurrected process in terms of that of the initial L\'evy process. Then in many important classes of L\'evy processes, we give conditions for absorption and conditions for non absorption bearing on the characteristics of the initial L\'evy process.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2211.02268v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study linear bilevel programming problems whose lower-level objective is given by a random cost vector with known distribution. We consider the case where this distribution is nonatomic, allowing to reformulate the problem of the leader using the Bayesian approach in the sense of Salas and Svensson (2023), with a decision-dependent distribution that concentrates on the vertices of the feasible set of the follower's problem. We call this a vertex-supported belief. We prove that this formulation is piecewise affine over the so-called chamber complex of the feasible set of the high-point relaxation. We propose two algorithmic approaches to solve general problems enjoying this last property. The first one is based on enumerating the vertices of the chamber complex. This approach is not scalable, but we present it as a computational baseline and for its theoretical interest. The second one is a Monte-Carlo approximation scheme based on the fact that randomly drawn points of the domain lie, with probability 1, in the interior of full-dimensional chambers, where the problem (restricted to this chamber) can be reduced to a linear program. Finally, we evaluate these methods through computational experiments showing both approaches' advantages and challenges.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2301.02469v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To model existing or future low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite networks leveraging multiple constellations, we propose a simple analytical approach to represent the clustering of satellites on orbits. More precisely, we develop a variable-altitude Poisson orbit process that effectively captures the geometric fact that satellites are always positioned on orbits, and these orbits may vary in altitude. Conditionally on the orbit process, satellites situated on these orbits are modeled as linear Poisson point processes, thereby forming a Cox point process. For this model, we derive useful statistics, including the distribution of the distance from the typical user to its nearest visible satellite, the outage probability, the Laplace functional of the proposed Cox satellite point process, and the Laplace transform of the interference power from the Cox-distributed satellites under general fading. The derived statistics enable the evaluation of the performance of such LEO satellite communication systems as functions of network parameters.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.01198v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, a series of papers proposed deep learning-based approaches to sample from target distributions using controlled diffusion processes, being trained only on the unnormalized target densities without access to samples. Building on previous work, we identify these approaches as special cases of a generalized Schr\"odinger bridge problem, seeking a stochastic evolution between a given prior distribution and the specified target. We further generalize this framework by introducing a variational formulation based on divergences between path space measures of time-reversed diffusion processes. This abstract perspective leads to practical losses that can be optimized by gradient-based algorithms and includes previous objectives as special cases. At the same time, it allows us to consider divergences other than the reverse Kullback-Leibler divergence that is known to suffer from mode collapse. In particular, we propose the so-called log-variance loss, which exhibits favorable numerical properties and leads to significantly improved performance across all considered approaches.</description>

      <title>Randomized approximation of summable sequences -- adaptive and non-adaptive</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.01705v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove lower bounds for the randomized approximation of the embedding $\ell_1^m \rightarrow \ell_\infty^m$ based on algorithms that use arbitrary linear (hence non-adaptive) information provided by a (randomized) measurement matrix $N \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times m}$. These lower bounds reflect the increasing difficulty of the problem for $m \to \infty$, namely, a term $\sqrt{\log m}$ in the complexity $n$. This result implies that non-compact operators between arbitrary Banach spaces are not approximable using non-adaptive Monte Carlo methods. We also compare these lower bounds for non-adaptive methods with upper bounds based on adaptive, randomized methods for recovery for which the complexity $n$ only exhibits a $(\log\log m)$-dependence. In doing so we give an example of linear problems where the error for adaptive vs. non-adaptive Monte Carlo methods shows a gap of order $n^{1/2} ( \log n)^{-1/2}$.</description>

Abstract: Our work is dedicated to the introduction and investigation of a new asymptotic correlation relation in the field of mean field models and limits. This new notion, order (as opposed to chaos), revolves around a tendency for self organisation in a given system and is expected to be observed in biological and societal models. Beyond the definition of this new notion, our work will show its applicability, and propagation, in the so-called Choose the Leader model.</description>

      <title>Spectral gap bounds for reversible hybrid Gibbs chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.12782v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hybrid Gibbs samplers represent a prominent class of approximated Gibbs algorithms that utilize Markov chains to approximate conditional distributions, with the Metropolis-within-Gibbs algorithm standing out as a well-known example. Despite their widespread use in both statistical and non-statistical applications, very little is known about their convergence properties. This article introduces novel methods for establishing bounds on the convergence rates of hybrid Gibbs samplers. In particular, we examine the convergence characteristics of hybrid random-scan Gibbs and data augmentation algorithms. Our analysis confirms that the absolute spectral gap of a hybrid chain can be bounded based on the absolute spectral gap of the exact Gibbs chain and the absolute spectral gaps of the Markov chains employed for conditional distribution approximations. For application, we study the convergence properties of four practical hybrid Gibbs algorithms: a random-scan Metropolis-within-Gibbs sampler, a hybrid proximal sampler, random-scan Gibbs samplers with block updates, and a hybrid slice sampler.</description>

      <title>Fast Collision Probability Estimation for Automated Driving using Multi-circular Shape Approximations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10765v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many state-of-the-art methods for safety assessment and motion planning for automated driving require estimation of the probability of collision (POC). To estimate the POC, a shape approximation of the colliding actors and probability density functions of the associated uncertain kinematic variables are required. Even with such information available, the derivation of the POC is in general, i.e., for any shape and density, only possible with Monte Carlo sampling (MCS). Random sampling of the POC, however, is challenging as computational resources are limited in real-world applications. We present expressions for the POC in the presence of Gaussian uncertainties, based on multi-circular shape approximations. In addition, we show that the proposed approach is computationally more efficient than MCS. Lastly, we provide a method for upper and lower bounding the estimation error for the POC induced by the used shape approximations.</description>
