      <title>Parameter Training Efficiency Aware Resource Allocation for AIGC in Space-Air-Ground Integrated Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the evolution of artificial intelligence-generated content (AIGC) techniques and the development of space-air-ground integrated networks (SAGIN), there will be a growing opportunity to enhance more users' mobile experience with customized AIGC applications. This is made possible through the use of parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) training alongside mobile edge computing. In this paper, we formulate the optimization problem of maximizing the parameter training efficiency of the SAGIN system over wireless networks under limited resource constraints. We propose the Parameter training efficiency Aware Resource Allocation (PARA) technique to jointly optimize user association, data offloading, and communication and computational resource allocation. Solid proofs are presented to solve this difficult sum of ratios problem based on quadratically constrained quadratic programming (QCQP), semidefinite programming (SDP), graph theory, and fractional programming (FP) techniques. Our proposed PARA technique is effective in finding a stationary point of this non-convex problem. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed PARA method outperforms other baselines.</description>

      <title>Emerging-properties Mapping Using Spatial Embedding Statistics: EMUSES</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14309v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding complex phenomena often requires analyzing high-dimensional data to uncover emergent properties that arise from multifactorial interactions. Here, we present EMUSES (Emerging-properties Mapping Using Spatial Embedding Statistics), an innovative approach employing Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) to create high-dimensional embeddings that reveal latent structures within data. EMUSES facilitates the exploration and prediction of emergent properties by statistically analyzing these latent spaces. Using three distinct datasets--a handwritten digits dataset from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST, E. Alpaydin, 1998), the Chicago Face Database (Ma et al., 2015), and brain disconnection data post-stroke (Talozzi et al., 2023)--we demonstrate EMUSES' effectiveness in detecting and interpreting emergent properties. Our method not only predicts outcomes with high accuracy but also provides clear visualizations and statistical insights into the underlying interactions within the data. By bridging the gap between predictive accuracy and interpretability, EMUSES offers researchers a powerful tool to understand the multifactorial origins of complex phenomena.</description>

      <title>Weighted Sum of Segmented Correlation: An Efficient Method for Spectra Matching in Hyperspectral Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13006v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Matching a target spectrum with known spectra in a spectral library is a common method for material identification in hyperspectral imaging research. Hyperspectral spectra exhibit precise absorption features across different wavelength segments, and the unique shapes and positions of these absorptions create distinct spectral signatures for each material, aiding in their identification. Therefore, only the specific positions can be considered for material identification. This study introduces the Weighted Sum of Segmented Correlation method, which calculates correlation indices between various segments of a library and a test spectrum, and derives a matching index, favoring positive correlations and penalizing negative correlations using assigned weights. The effectiveness of this approach is evaluated for mineral identification in hyperspectral images from both Earth and Martian surfaces.</description>

      <title>Applications of Post-quantum Cryptography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13258v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the constantly advancing capabilities of quantum computers, conventional cryptographic systems relying on complex math problems may encounter unforeseen vulnerabilities. Unlike regular computers, which are often deemed cost-ineffective in cryptographic attacks, quantum computers have a significant advantage in calculation speed. This distinction potentially makes currently used algorithms less secure or even completely vulnerable, compelling the exploration of post-quantum cryptography (PQC) as the most reasonable solution to quantum threats. This review aims to provide current information on applications, benefits, and challenges associated with the PQC. The review employs a systematic scoping review with the scope restricted to the years 2022 and 2023; only articles that were published in scientific journals were used in this paper. The review examined the articles on the applications of quantum computing in various spheres. However, the scope of this paper was restricted to the domain of the PQC because most of the analyzed articles featured this field. Subsequently, the paper is analyzing various PQC algorithms, including lattice-based, hash-based, code-based, multivariate polynomial, and isogeny-based cryptography. Each algorithm is being judged based on its potential applications, robustness, and challenges. All the analyzed algorithms are promising for the post-quantum era in such applications as digital signatures, communication channels, and IoT. Moreover, some of the algorithms are already implemented in the spheres of banking transactions, communication, and intellectual property. Meanwhile, despite their potential, these algorithms face serious challenges since they lack standardization, require vast amounts of storage and computation power, and might have unknown vulnerabilities that can be discovered only with years of cryptanalysis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.13259v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum computing is a cutting-edge field of information technology that harnesses the principles of quantum mechanics to perform computations. It has major implications for the cyber security industry. Existing cyber protection applications are working well, but there are still challenges and vulnerabilities in computer networks. Sometimes data and privacy are also compromised. These complications lead to research questions asking what kind of cyber protection applications of quantum computing are there and what potential methods or techniques can be used for cyber protection? These questions will reveal how much power quantum computing has and to what extent it can outperform the conventional computing systems. This scoping review was conducted by considering 815 papers. It showed the possibilities that can be achievedif quantum technologies are implemented in cyber environments. This scoping review discusses various domains such as algorithms and applications, bioinformatics, cloud and edge computing, the organization of complex systems, application areas focused on security and threats, and the broader quantum computing ecosystem. In each of these areas, there is significant scope for quantum computing to be implemented and to revolutionize the working environment. Numerous quantum computing applications for cyber protection and a number of techniques to protect our data and privacy were identified. The results are not limited to network security but also include data security. This paper also discusses societal aspects, e.g., the applications of quantum computing in the social sciences. This scoping review discusses how to enhance the efficiency and security of quantum computing in various cyber security domains. Additionally, it encourages the reader to think about what kind of techniques and methods can be deployed to secure the cyber world.</description>

      <title>Emergent Dynamics in Heterogeneous Life-Like Cellular Automata</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13383v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Game of Life (GoL), one well known 2D cellular automaton, does not typically ensure interesting long-term phenotypic dynamics. Therefore, while being Turing complete, GoL cannot be said to be open-ended. In this work, we extend GoL with the opportunity for local mutations, thus enabling a heterogeneous life-like cellular automaton guided by an evolutionary inner loop. Additionally, we introduce the concept of cell ageing to ensure that cell aliveness (activated by inheritance with variation, and controlled by ageing) and actual cell computation (governed by life-like rules on local neighborhoods) are kept conceptually separated. We conduct an experimental campaign to identify suitable parameters that produce long-term phenotypic dynamics and favor genotypic innovations.</description>

      <title>Gate Teleportation in Noisy Quantum Networks with the SquidASM Simulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13405v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We implement the gate teleportation algorithm for teleporting arbitrary two-qubit Clifford gates and the Toffoli gate within the context of multi-node quantum networks, utilizing the SquidASM quantum network simulator. We show how a gate teleportation scheme can be used to implement gate cutting, which is an important approach to realize large circuits in distributed quantum computing environments. The correction operations in teleportation are automatically constructed for arbitrary two-qubit Clifford gates. We present simulation results for CNOT, DCNOT, CZ, SWAP, and Toffoli gates. For the Toffoli gate, we apply a similar gate teleportation protocol with the difference that the correction operation becomes more complex since the gate is non-Clifford. We perform the simulations under varying conditions of quantum channel and device noise levels. The simulations provide valuable insights into the robustness and efficacy of the implemented algorithms, and they assist in identifying the critical components within quantum networks where noise primarily affects the execution of applications.</description>

      <title>Demonstration of low power and highly uniform 6-bit operation in SiO2-based memristors embedded with Pt nanoparticles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13505v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, an optimized method was implemented for attaining stable multibit operation with low energy consumption in a two-terminal memory element made from the following layers: Ag/Pt nanoparticles (NPs)/SiO2/TiN in a 1-Transistor-1-Memristor configuration. Compared to the reference sample where no NPs were embedded, an enlarged memory window was recorded in conjunction with reduced variability for both switching states. A comprehensive numerical model was also applied to shed light on this enhanced performance, which was attributed to the spatial confinement effect induced by the presence of the Pt NPs and its impact on the properties of the percolating conducting filaments (CFs). Although 5-bit precision was demonstrated with the application of the incremental-step-pulse-programming (ISPP) algorithm, the reset process was unreliable and the output current increased abnormally when exceeded the value of 150 uA. As a result, the multibit operation was limited. To address this issue, a modified scheme was developed to accurately control the distance between the various resistance levels and achieve highly reliable 6-bit precision. Our work provides valuable insights for the development of energy-efficient memories for applications where a high density of conductance levels is required.</description>

      <title>Measurement of the Crystallization and Phase Transition of Niobium Dioxide Thin-Films for Neuromorphic Computing Applications Using a Tube Furnace Optical Transmission System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13523v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Significant research has focused on low-power stochastic devices built from memristive materials. These devices foster neuromorphic approaches to computational efficiency enhancement in merged biomimetic and CMOS architectures due to their ability to phase transition from a dielectric to a metal at an increased temperature. Niobium dioxide has a volatile memristive phase change that occurs $\sim$800$^\circ$C~that makes it an ideal candidate for future neuromorphic electronics. A straightforward optical system has been developed on a horizontal tube furnace for \emph{in situ} spectral measurements as an as-grown \NbtOf\ film is annealed and ultimately crystallizes as \NbOt. The system measures the changing spectral transmissivity of \NbtOf\ as it undergoes both reduction and crystallization processes. We were also able to measure the transition from metallic-to-non-metallic \NbOt\ during the cooldown phase, which is shown to occur about 100$^\circ$C~ lower on a sapphire substrate than fused silica. After annealing, the material properties of the \NbtOf\ and \NbOt\ were assessed via X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, and 4-point resistivity, confirming that we have made crystalline \NbOt.</description>

Abstract: After more than a hundred years of development, ferroelectric materials have demonstrated their strong potential to people, and more and more ferroelectric materials are being used in the research of ferroelectric transistors (FeFETs). As a new generation of neuromorphic devices, ferroelectric materials have attracted people's attention due to their powerful functions and many characteristics. This article summarizes the development of ferroelectric material systems in recent years and discusses the simulation of artificial synapses. The mainstream ferroelectric materials are divided into traditional perovskite structure, fluorite structure, organic polymer, and new 2D van der Waals ferroelectricity. The principles, research progress, and optimization for brain like computers of each material system are introduced, and the latest application progress is summarized. Finally, the scope of application of different material systems is discussed, with the aim of helping people screen out different material systems based on different needs.</description>

      <title>Leveraging eBPF and AI for Ransomware Nose Out</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14020v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a two-phased approach for real-time detection and deterrence of ransomware. To achieve this, we leverage the capabilities of eBPF (Extended Berkeley Packet Filter) and artificial intelligence to develop both proactive and reactive methods. In the first phase, we utilize signature based detection, where we employ custom eBPF programs to trace the execution of new processes and perform hash-based analysis against a known ransomware dataset. In the second, we employ a behavior-based technique that focuses on monitoring the process activities using a custom eBPF program and the creation of ransom notes, a prominent indicator of ransomware activity through the use of Natural Language Processing (NLP). By leveraging low-level tracing capabilities of eBPF and integrating NLP based machine learning algorithms, our solution achieves an impressive 99.76% accuracy in identifying ransomware incidents within a few seconds on the onset of zero-day attacks.</description>

      <title>Detecting sexually explicit content in the context of the child sexual abuse materials (CSAM): end-to-end classifiers and region-based networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14131v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Child sexual abuse materials (CSAM) pose a significant threat to the safety and well-being of children worldwide. Detecting and preventing the distribution of such materials is a critical task for law enforcement agencies and technology companies. As content moderation is often manual, developing an automated detection system can help reduce human reviewers' exposure to potentially harmful images and accelerate the process of counteracting. This study presents methods for classifying sexually explicit content, which plays a crucial role in the automated CSAM detection system. Several approaches are explored to solve the task: an end-to-end classifier, a classifier with person detection and a private body parts detector. All proposed methods are tested on the images obtained from the online tool for reporting illicit content. Due to legal constraints, access to the data is limited, and all algorithms are executed remotely on the isolated server. The end-to-end classifier yields the most promising results, with an accuracy of 90.17%, after augmenting the training set with the additional neutral samples and adult pornography. While detection-based methods may not achieve higher accuracy rates and cannot serve as a final classifier on their own, their inclusion in the system can be beneficial. Human body-oriented approaches generate results that are easier to interpret, and obtaining more interpretable results is essential when analyzing models that are trained without direct access to data.</description>

      <title>A Survey of Methods for Mitigating Barren Plateaus for Parameterized Quantum Circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14285v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Barren Plateaus are a formidable challenge for hybrid quantum-classical algorithms that lead to flat plateaus in the loss function landscape making it difficult to take advantage of the expressive power of parameterized quantum circuits with gradient-based methods. Like in classical neural network models, parameterized quantum circuits suffer the same vanishing gradient issue due to large parameter spaces with non-convex landscapes. In this review, we present an overview of the different genesis for barren plateaus, mathematical formalisms of common themes around barren plateaus, and dives into gradients. The central objective is to provide a conceptual perspective between classical and quantum interpretations of vanishing gradients as well as dive into techniques involving cost functions, entanglement, and initialization strategies to mitigate barren plateaus. Addressing barren plateaus paves the way towards feasibility of many classically intractable applications for quantum simulation, optimization, chemistry, and quantum machine learning.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14391v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Edge computing processes data near its source, reducing latency and enhancing security compared to traditional cloud computing while providing its benefits. This paper explores edge computing for migrating an existing safety-critical robotics use case from an onboard dedicated hardware solution. We propose an edge robotics architecture based on Linux, Docker containers, Kubernetes, and a local wireless area network based on the TTWiFi protocol. Inspired by previous work on real-time cloud, we complement the architecture with a resource management and orchestration layer to help Linux manage, and Kubernetes orchestrate the system-wide shared resources (e.g., caches, memory bandwidth, and network). Our architecture aims to ensure the fault-tolerant and predictable execution of robotic applications (e.g., path planning) on the edge while upper-bounding the end-to-end latency and ensuring the best possible quality of service without jeopardizing safety and security.</description>

Abstract: Ising machines are next-generation computers expected to efficiently sample near-optimal solutions of combinatorial optimization problems. Combinatorial optimization problems are modeled as quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) problems to apply an Ising machine. However, current state-of-the-art Ising machines still often fail to output near-optimal solutions due to the complicated energy landscape of QUBO problems. Furthermore, the physical implementation of Ising machines severely restricts the size of QUBO problems to be input as a result of limited hardware graph structures. In this study, we take a new approach to these challenges by injecting auxiliary penalties preserving the optimum, which reduces quadratic terms in QUBO objective functions. The process simultaneously simplifies the energy landscape of QUBO problems, allowing the search for near-optimal solutions, and makes QUBO problems sparser, facilitating encoding into Ising machines with restriction on the hardware graph structure. We propose linearization of QUBO problems using variable posets as an outcome of the approach. By applying the proposed method to synthetic QUBO instances and to multi-dimensional knapsack problems, we empirically validate the effects on enhancing minor-embedding of QUBO problems and the performance of Ising machines.</description>

      <title>Task Scheduling Optimization from a Tensor Network Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.10433v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a novel method for task optimization in industrial plants using quantum-inspired tensor network technology. This method allows us to obtain the best possible combination of tasks on a set of machines with a set of constraints without having to evaluate all possible combinations. We simulate a quantum system with all possible combinations, perform an imaginary time evolution and a series of projections to satisfy the constraints. We improve its scalability by means of a compression method, an iterative algorithm, and a genetic algorithm, and show the results obtained on simulated cases.</description>

      <title>Neuromorphic quadratic programming for efficient and scalable model predictive control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.14885v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Applications in robotics or other size-, weight- and power-constrained autonomous systems at the edge often require real-time and low-energy solutions to large optimization problems. Event-based and memory-integrated neuromorphic architectures promise to solve such optimization problems with superior energy efficiency and performance compared to conventional von Neumann architectures. Here, we present a method to solve convex continuous optimization problems with quadratic cost functions and linear constraints on Intel's scalable neuromorphic research chip Loihi 2. When applied to model predictive control (MPC) problems for the quadruped robotic platform ANYmal, this method achieves over two orders of magnitude reduction in combined energy-delay product compared to the state-of-the-art solver, OSQP, on (edge) CPUs and GPUs with solution times under ten milliseconds for various problem sizes. These results demonstrate the benefit of non-von-Neumann architectures for robotic control applications.</description>

      <title>Quantum computing with Qiskit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08810v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We describe Qiskit, a software development kit for quantum information science. We discuss the key design decisions that have shaped its development, and examine the software architecture and its core components. We demonstrate an end-to-end workflow for solving a problem in condensed matter physics on a quantum computer that serves to highlight some of Qiskit's capabilities, for example the representation and optimization of circuits at various abstraction levels, its scalability and retargetability to new gates, and the use of quantum-classical computations via dynamic circuits. Lastly, we discuss some of the ecosystem of tools and plugins that extend Qiskit for various tasks, and the future ahead.</description>
