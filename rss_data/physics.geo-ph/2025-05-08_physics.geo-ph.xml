      <title>Influence of simple and complex non-axisymmetric background magnetic fields on the propagation of QG MC waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04762v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magneto-Coriolis (QG-MC) waves are considered an important part of the rapid dynamics of the Earth's outer core. The detailed characteristics of these waves are however still under scrutiny. In this study we explore the sensibility of the QG-MC waves to the background magnetic field over which they propagate and to the frequency of the perturbation that can generate them in the Earth core. We retrieve QG-MC waves propagating over a realistic background magnetic field by analysing the velocity fields, where they are most easily observed. Concentrations of QG-MC waves in the magnetic field at the core surface in our model are reminiscent of recently observed geomagnetic jerks. The QG-MC waves are weakly sensitive to the details of the background magnetic field during their travel in the bulk and their frequency at the core surface remains close to that of the initial perturbation. This is a potential asset for the prediction of their evolution. Moreover, the waves in the system exhibit a complex relation with the initial perturbation: when the frequency of the initial pulsation is greater than a threshold -- depending on the Alfv\'en speed and the geometric complexity of the medium -- inward QG-Alfv\'en waves are recovered at the core mantle boundary instead of QG-MC waves, and we find a continuum of waves from QG-MC to %inertial waves QG-Alfv\'en waves depending on the input frequency. Thus, gradually increasing the input frequency in the system, we retrieve the dispersion relation for QG-MC waves with an evolution from a k_s^4 slope to a k_s^1 slope, where k_s is the cylindrical radial wavenumber, as waves transition from QG-MC to QG-Alfv\'en waves. Applying our results to the Earth's core, we expect to be able to recover QG-MC waves with confidence in the Earth core with periods between 57y and 2.8y.</description>

      <title>Seismic first-arrival traveltime simulation based on reciprocity-constrained PINN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05061v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simulating seismic first-arrival traveltime plays a crucial role in seismic tomography. First-arrival traveltime simulation relies on solving the eikonal equation. The accuracy of conventional numerical solvers is limited to a finite-difference approximation. In recent years, physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have been applied to achieve this task. However, traditional PINNs encounter challenges in accurately solving the eikonal equation, especially in cases where the model exhibits directional scaling differences. These challenges result in substantial traveltime prediction errors when the traveling distance is long. To improve the accuracy of PINN in traveltime prediction, we incorporate the reciprocity principle as a constraint into the PINN training framework. Based on the reciprocity principle, which states that the traveltime between two points remains invariant when their roles as source and receiver are exchanged, we propose to apply this principle to multiple source-receiver pairs in PINN-based traveltime prediction. Furthermore, a dynamic weighting mechanism is proposed to balance the contributions of the eikonal equation loss and the reciprocity-constrained loss during the training process. This adaptive weighting evolves dynamically with the training epochs, enhancing the convergency of the training process. Experiments conducted on a simple lens velocity model, the Overthrust velocity model, and a 3D velocity model demonstrate that the introduction of the reciprocity-constrained PINN significantly improves the accuracy of traveltime predictions.</description>

      <title>Core-surface kinematic control of polarity reversals in advanced geodynamo simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05221v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The geomagnetic field has undergone hundreds of polarity reversals over Earth's history, at a variable pace. In numerical models of Earth's core dynamics, reversals occur with increasing frequency when the convective forcing is increased past a critical level. This transition has previously been related to the influence of inertia in the force balance. Because this force is subdominant in Earth's core, concerns have been raised regarding the geophysical applicability of this paradigm. Reproducing the reversal rate of the past million years also requires forcing conditions that do not guarantee that the rest of the geomagnetic variation spectrum is reproduced. These issues motivate the search for alternative reversal mechanisms. Using a suite of numerical models where buoyancy is provided at the bottom of the core by inner-core freezing, we show that the magnetic dipole amplitude is controlled by the relative strength of subsurface upwellings and horizontal circulation at the core surface. A relative weakening of upwellings brings the system from a stable to a reversing dipole state. This mechanism is purely kinematic because it operates irrespectively of the interior force balance. It is therefore expected to apply at the physical conditions of Earth's core. Subsurface upwellings may be impeded by stable stratification in the outermost core. We show that with weak stratification levels corresponding to a nearly adiabatic core surface heat flow, a single model reproduces the observed geomagnetic variations ranging from decades to millions of years. \rev{In contrast with} the existing paradigm, reversals caused by this stable top core mechanism become more frequent when the level of stratification increases i.e. when the core heat flow decreases. This suggests that the link between mantle dynamics and magnetic reversal frequency needs to be reexamined.</description>

      <title>GeoFlood (v1.0.0): Computational model for overland flooding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15435v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents GeoFlood, a new open-source software package for solving the shallow-water equations (SWE) on a quadtree hierarchy of mapped, logically Cartesian grids managed by the parallel, adaptive library ForestClaw (Calhoun and Burstedde, 2017). The GeoFlood model is validated using standard benchmark tests from Neelz and Pender (2013) as well as the historical Malpasset dam failure. The benchmark test results are compared against those obtained from GeoClaw (Clawpack Development Team, 2020) and the software package HEC-RAS (Hydraulic Engineering Center River Analysis System, Army Corps of Engineers) (Brunner, 2018). The Malpasset outburst flood results are compared with those presented in George (2011) (obtained from the GeoClaw software), model results from Hervouet and Petitjean (1999), and empirical data. The comparisons validate GeoFlood's capabilities for idealized benchmarks compared to other commonly used models as well as its ability to efficiently simulate highly dynamic floods in complex terrain, consistent with historical field data. Because it is massively parallel and scalable, GeoFlood may be a valuable tool for efficiently computing large-scale flooding problems at very high resolutions.</description>

      <title>Effects of conjugate heat transfer on large-scale flow structures in convection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20907v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The constant temperature and constant heat flux thermal boundary conditions, both developing distinct flow patterns, represent limiting cases of ideally conducting and insulating plates in Rayleigh-B\'enard convection (RBC) flows, respectively. This study bridges the gap in between, using a conjugate heat transfer (CHT) set-up and studying finite thermal diffusivity ratios $\kapparatioIL$ to better represent real-life conditions in experiments. A three-dimensional RBC configuration including two fluid-confining plates is studied via direct numerical simulations given a Prandtl number $\Pr=1$. The fluid layer of height $H$ and horizontal extension $L$ obeys no-slip boundary conditions at the two solid-fluid interfaces and an aspect ratio of $\Gamma=L/H=30$ while the relative thickness of each plate is $\Gs=H_s/H=15$. The entire domain is laterally periodic. Here, different $\kapparatioIL$ are investigated for moderate Rayleigh numbers $\Ra=\left\{ 10^4, 10^5 \right\}$. We observe a gradual shift of the size of the characteristic flow patterns and their induced heat and mass transfer as $\kapparatioIL$ is varied, suggesting a relation between the recently studied turbulent superstructures and supergranules for constant temperature and constant heat flux boundary conditions, respectively. Performing a linear stability analysis for this CHT configuration confirms these observations theoretically while extending previous studies by investigating the impact of a varying solid plate thickness $\Gs$. Moreover, we study the impact of $\kapparatioIL$ on both the thermal and viscous boundary layers. Given the prevalence of finite $\kapparatioIL$ in nature, this work is a starting point to extend our understanding of pattern formation in geo- and astrophysical convection flows.</description>
