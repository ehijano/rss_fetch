      <title>Differentially Private Sequential Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19525v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a differentially private sequential learning setting, agents introduce endogenous noise into their actions to maintain privacy. Applying this to a standard sequential learning model leads to different outcomes for continuous vs. binary signals. For continuous signals with a nonzero privacy budget, we introduce a novel smoothed randomized response mechanism that adapts noise based on distance to a threshold, unlike traditional randomized response, which applies uniform noise. This enables agents' actions to better reflect both private signals and observed history, accelerating asymptotic learning speed to $\Theta_{\epsilon}(\log(n))$, compared to $\Theta(\sqrt{\log(n)})$ in the non-private regime where privacy budget is infinite. Moreover, in the non-private setting, the expected stopping time for the first correct decision and the number of incorrect actions diverge, meaning early agents may make mistakes for an unreasonably long period. In contrast, under a finite privacy budget $\epsilon \in (0,1)$, both remain finite, highlighting a stark contrast between private and non-private learning. Learning with continuous signals in the private regime is more efficient, as smooth randomized response enhances the log-likelihood ratio over time, improving information aggregation. Conversely, for binary signals, differential privacy noise hinders learning, as agents tend to use a constant randomized response strategy before an information cascade forms, reducing action informativeness and hampering the overall process.</description>

      <title>Cued to Queue: Information in Waiting-Line Auctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19553v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the effect of providing information to agents who queue before a scarce good is distributed at a fixed time. When agents have quasi-linear utility in time spent waiting, they choose entry times as they would bids in a descending auction. An information designer can influence their behavior by providing updates about the length of the queue. Many natural information policies release "sudden bad news," which occurs when agents learn that the queue is longer than previously believed. We show that sudden bad news can cause assortative inefficiency by prompting a mass of agents to simultaneously attempt to join the queue. As a result, if the value distribution has an increasing (decreasing) hazard rate, information policies that release sudden bad news increase (decrease) total surplus, relative to releasing no information. When agents face entry costs to join the queue and the value distribution has a decreasing hazard rate, an information designer maximizes total surplus by announcing only when the queue is full.</description>

      <title>Social Influence Distorts Ratings in Online Interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19861v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Theoretical work on sequential choice and large-scale experiments in online ranking and voting systems has demonstrated that social influence can have a drastic impact on social and technological systems. Yet, the effect of social influence on online rating systems remains understudied and the few existing contributions suggest that online ratings would self-correct given enough users. Here, we propose a new framework for studying the effect of social influence on online ratings. We start from the assumption that people are influenced linearly by the observed average rating, but postulate that their propensity to be influenced varies. When the weight people assign to the observed average depends only on their own latent rating, the resulting system is linear, but the long-term rating may substantially deviate from the true mean rating. When the weight people put on the observed average depends on both their own latent rating and the observed average rating, the resulting system is non-linear, and may support multiple equilibria, suggesting that ratings might be path-dependent and deviations dramatic. Our results highlight potential limitations in crowdsourced information aggregation and can inform the design of more robust online rating systems.</description>

      <title>Robust Intervention in Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00235v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In economic settings such as learning, social behavior, and financial contagion, agents interact through interdependent networks. This paper examines how a decision maker (DM) can design an optimal intervention strategy under network uncertainty, modeled as a zero-sum game against an adversarial ``Nature'' that reconfigures the network within an uncertainty set. Using duality, we characterize the DM's unique robust intervention and identify the worst-case network structure, which exhibits a rank-1 property, concentrating risk along the intervention strategy. We analyze the costs of robustness, distinguishing between global and local uncertainty, and examine the role of higher-order uncertainties in shaping intervention outcomes. Our findings highlight key trade-offs between maximizing influence and mitigating uncertainty, offering insights into robust decision-making. This framework has applications in policy design, economic regulation, and strategic interventions in dynamic networks, ensuring their resilience against uncertainty in network structures.</description>

      <title>Incomplete Information Robustness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19075v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Consider an analyst who models a strategic situation using an incomplete information game. The true game may involve correlated, duplicated belief hierarchies, but the analyst lacks knowledge of the correlation structure and can only approximate each belief hierarchy. To make predictions in this setting, the analyst uses belief-invariant Bayes correlated equilibria (BIBCE) and seeks to determine which one is justifiable. We address this question by introducing the notion of robustness: a BIBCE is robust if, for every nearby incomplete information game, there exists a BIBCE close to it. Our main result provides a sufficient condition for robustness using a generalized potential function. In a supermodular potential game, a robust BIBCE is a Bayes Nash equilibrium, whereas this need not hold in other classes of games.</description>
