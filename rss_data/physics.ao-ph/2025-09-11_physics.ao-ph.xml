      <title>A Hybrid Analytical Framework for Asymmetric Pressure and Boundary Layer Wind Simulation in Nor'easters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09556v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nor'easters frequently impact the North American East Coast, bringing hazardous precipitation, winds, and coastal flooding. Accurate simulation of their pressure and wind fields is essential for forecasting, risk assessment, and infrastructure planning, yet remains challenging due to their complex, asymmetric structure. This study introduces a novel hybrid analytical-data-driven model designed to efficiently simulate Nor'easter pressure and boundary layer wind fields. The pressure field is modeled using an adapted Holland-type formulation, with azimuthally varying parameters estimated through Kriging surrogate models informed by sensitivity analysis of reanalysis data. The wind field is then derived analytically from the momentum equations by decomposing the wind flow into gradient and frictional components. Model performance is assessed against ERA-Interim reanalysis data and surface wind observations from a historical event. Results show that the proposed pressure model accurately reproduces elliptical isobars and key asymmetrical patterns, while the wind model captures the fundamental structure and intensity of the boundary layer flow, including the presence of supergradient winds. Owing to its physical basis, computational efficiency, and ability to represent critical storm asymmetries, the model offers a valuable alternative to computationally expensive numerical simulations for hazard assessment and scenario analysis of extreme Nor'easters.</description>

      <title>Arctic Oscillation Modulation of Winter Air-Sea Coupling in the East/Japan Sea: Persistence, Timescales, and Extremes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09628v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The winter climate of the East/Japan Sea (EJS) is strongly affected by the Arctic Oscillation (AO), yet how AO polarity reshapes the memory, coupling patterns, and predictability of sea-surface temperature anomalies (SSTA) remains poorly quantified. Using 30 winters (1993--2022) of daily OISST and ERA5 fields, we combine multivariate Maximum Covariance Analysis (MCA) with an Ornstein--Uhlenbeck (OU)-like integration of atmospheric principal components (PCs). The leading coupled mode explains 87% (+AO) and 75% (-AO) of squared covariance, with SSTA hot spots in East Korea Bay and along the subpolar front. Zero-lag correlations between the SSTA PC and OU-integrated atmospheric PCs reveal characteristic memory timescales ($\tau$) of $\sim$18--25 days for wind-stress curl (CurlTau), $\sim$15--30 days for near-surface air temperature (ATMP) and zonal winds, and $\sim$30--50 days for sea-level pressure (SLP) and meridional winds -- longer under -AO. Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (DFA) shows SSTA persistence $H \approx 1.3$--$1.4$ and that integrated atmospheric responses acquire ocean-like persistence, validating Hasselmann's stochastic framework for winter EJS. AO-phase contrasts align with a curl$\rightarrow$Ekman pumping$\rightarrow$eddy/SSH$\rightarrow$SST pathway: +AO favors anticyclonic/downwelling responses and warmer SSTA, whereas -AO favors cyclonic/upwelling and cooler SSTA. These diagnostics identify phase-specific predictor windows (e.g., 3-week OU-integrated CurlTau/ATMP; 4--7-week SLP/V-wind under -AO) to initialize subseasonal extremes prediction (marine heatwaves and cold-surge-impacted SST). The approach quantifies memory scales and spatial coupling that were not explicitly resolved by previous composite analyses, offering a tractable foundation for probabilistic forecast models.</description>

      <title>MoWE : A Mixture of Weather Experts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09052v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Data-driven weather models have recently achieved state-of-the-art performance, yet progress has plateaued in recent years. This paper introduces a Mixture of Experts (MoWE) approach as a novel paradigm to overcome these limitations, not by creating a new forecaster, but by optimally combining the outputs of existing models. The MoWE model is trained with significantly lower computational resources than the individual experts. Our model employs a Vision Transformer-based gating network that dynamically learns to weight the contributions of multiple "expert" models at each grid point, conditioned on forecast lead time. This approach creates a synthesized deterministic forecast that is more accurate than any individual component in terms of Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of this method, achieving up to a 10% lower RMSE than the best-performing AI weather model on a 2-day forecast horizon, significantly outperforming individual experts as well as a simple average across experts. This work presents a computationally efficient and scalable strategy to push the state of the art in data-driven weather prediction by making the most out of leading high-quality forecast models.</description>

      <title>Conditioning on PDE Parameters to Generalise Deep Learning Emulation of Stochastic and Chaotic Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09599v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a deep learning emulator for stochastic and chaotic spatio-temporal systems, explicitly conditioned on the parameter values of the underlying partial differential equations (PDEs). Our approach involves pre-training the model on a single parameter domain, followed by fine-tuning on a smaller, yet diverse dataset, enabling generalisation across a broad range of parameter values. By incorporating local attention mechanisms, the network is capable of handling varying domain sizes and resolutions. This enables computationally efficient pre-training on smaller domains while requiring only a small additional dataset to learn how to generalise to larger domain sizes. We demonstrate the model's capabilities on the chaotic Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation and stochastically-forced beta-plane turbulence, showcasing its ability to capture phenomena at interpolated parameter values. The emulator provides significant computational speed-ups over conventional numerical integration, facilitating efficient exploration of parameter space, while a probabilistic variant of the emulator provides uncertainty quantification, allowing for the statistical study of rare events.</description>

      <title>A Benchmark Dataset for Satellite-Based Estimation and Detection of Rain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08816v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurately tracking the global distribution and evolution of precipitation is essential for both research and operational meteorology. Satellite observations remain the only means of achieving consistent, global-scale precipitation monitoring. While machine learning has long been applied to satellite-based precipitation retrieval, the absence of a standardized benchmark dataset has hindered fair comparisons between methods and limited progress in algorithm development.
  To address this gap, the International Precipitation Working Group has developed SatRain, the first AI-ready benchmark dataset for satellite-based detection and estimation of rain, snow, graupel, and hail. SatRain includes multi-sensor satellite observations representative of the major platforms currently used in precipitation remote sensing, paired with high-quality reference estimates from ground-based radars corrected using rain gauge measurements. It offers a standardized evaluation protocol to enable robust and reproducible comparisons across machine learning approaches.
  In addition to supporting algorithm evaluation, the diversity of sensors and inclusion of time-resolved geostationary observations make SatRain a valuable foundation for developing next-generation AI models to deliver more accurate, detailed, and globally consistent precipitation estimates.</description>
