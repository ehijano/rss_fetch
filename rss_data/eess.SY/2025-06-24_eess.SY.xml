      <title>A Digital Twin Framework for Generation-IV Reactors with Reinforcement Learning-Enabled Health-Aware Supervisory Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17258v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generation IV (Gen-IV) nuclear power plants are envisioned to replace the current reactor fleet, bringing improvements in performance, safety, reliability, and sustainability. However, large cost investments currently inhibit the deployment of these advanced reactor concepts. Digital twins bridge real-world systems with digital tools to reduce costs, enhance decision-making, and boost operational efficiency. In this work, a digital twin framework is designed to operate the Gen-IV Fluoride-salt-cooled High-temperature Reactor, utilizing data-enhanced methods to optimize operational and maintenance policies while adhering to system constraints. The closed-loop framework integrates surrogate modeling, reinforcement learning, and Bayesian inference to streamline end-to-end communication for online regulation and self-adjustment. Reinforcement learning is used to consider component health and degradation to drive the target power generations, with constraints enforced through a Reference Governor control algorithm that ensures compliance with pump flow rate and temperature limits. These input driving modules benefit from detailed online simulations that are assimilated to measurement data with Bayesian filtering. The digital twin is demonstrated in three case studies: a one-year long-term operational period showcasing maintenance planning capabilities, short-term accuracy refinement with high-frequency measurements, and system shock capturing that demonstrates real-time recalibration capabilities when change in boundary conditions. These demonstrations validate robustness for health-aware and constraint-informed nuclear plant operation, with general applicability to other advanced reactor concepts and complex engineering systems.</description>

      <title>Optimal Operating Strategy for PV-BESS Households: Balancing Self-Consumption and Self-Sufficiency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17268v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High penetration of Photovoltaic (PV) generation and Battery Energy Storage System (BESS) in individual households increases the demand for solutions to determine the optimal PV generation power and the capacity of BESS. Self-consumption and self-sufficiency are essential for optimising the operation of PV-BESS systems in households, aiming to minimise power import from and export to the main grid. However, self-consumption and self-sufficiency are not independent; they share a linear relationship. This paper demonstrates this relationship and proposes an optimal operating strategy that considers power generation and consumption profiles to maximise self-consumption and self-sufficiency in households equipped with a PV-BESS. We classify self-consumption and self-sufficiency patterns into four categories based on the ratio of self-sufficiency to self-consumption for each household and determine the optimal PV generation and BESS capacities using both a mathematical calculation and this ratio. These optimal operation values for each category are then simulated using Model Predictive Control (MPC) and Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based battery charging and discharging scheduling models. The results show that the ratio between self-consumption and self-sufficiency is a useful metric for determining the optimal capacity of PV-BESS systems to maximise the local utilisation of PV-generated power.</description>

      <title>Conformal Safety Shielding for Imperfect-Perception Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of safe control in discrete autonomous agents that use learned components for imperfect perception (or more generally, state estimation) from high-dimensional observations. We propose a shield construction that provides run-time safety guarantees under perception errors by restricting the actions available to an agent, modeled as a Markov decision process, as a function of the state estimates. Our construction uses conformal prediction for the perception component, which guarantees that for each observation, the predicted set of estimates includes the actual state with a user-specified probability. The shield allows an action only if it is allowed for all the estimates in the predicted set, resulting in a local safety guarantee. We also articulate and prove a global safety property of existing shield constructions for perfect-perception agents bounding the probability of reaching unsafe states if the agent always chooses actions prescribed by the shield. We illustrate our approach with a case-study of an experimental autonomous system that guides airplanes on taxiways using high-dimensional perception DNNs.</description>

      <title>Instantaneous Failure, Repair and Mobility Rates for Markov Reliability Systems: A Wind-Farm application</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Rate of Occurrence of Failures (ROCOF) is a widely utilized indicator for assessing a system's performance over time, yet it does not fully disclose the instantaneous behavior of a system. This paper introduces new measures to complement the ROCOF, providing a more comprehensive understanding of system reliability, particularly for Markov systems. We define the Rate of Occurrence of Repairs (ROCOR), which quantifies the system's instantaneous tendency to transition from failure to working states, and the Rate of Inoccurrence (ROI), which measures the propensity to remain within the current subset of states (either working or failure) without transitioning out. Explicit expressions for the computation of these rates are derived for Markov systems. Furthermore, a Total Mobility Rate (TMR) is proposed, integrating these individual rates to capture the overall dynamism of the system. The utility of these new indicators is demonstrated through a significant real-world application to wind farm management. The results from the wind farm study show that ROCOR, ROI, and TMR, when used in conjunction with ROCOF, reveal nuanced operational dynamics and reliability characteristics that are not discernible from static measures like Weibull parameters or ROCOF alone. These indicators can distinguish between sites with similar long-term wind profiles by identifying different "reliability logics," such as persistence-driven versus transition-driven behaviors. This enriched, time-dependent perspective provides valuable information for maintenance scheduling, operational strategies, and risk assessment, ultimately enhancing the ability to manage complex systems effectively.</description>

      <title>Second Order State Hallucinations for Adversarial Attack Mitigation in Formation Control of Multi-Agent Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing deployment of multi-agent systems (MAS) in critical infrastructures such as autonomous transportation, disaster relief, and smart cities demands robust formation control mechanisms resilient to adversarial attacks. Traditional consensus-based controllers, while effective under nominal conditions, are highly vulnerable to data manipulation, sensor spoofing, and communication failures. To address this challenge, we propose Second-Order State Hallucination (SOSH), a novel framework that detects compromised agents through distributed residual monitoring and maintains formation stability by replacing attacked states with predictive second-order approximations. Unlike existing mitigation strategies that require significant restructuring or induce long transients, SOSH offers a lightweight, decentralized correction mechanism based on second-order Taylor expansions, enabling rapid and scalable resilience. We establish rigorous Lyapunov-based stability guarantees, proving that formation errors remain exponentially bounded even under persistent attacks, provided the hallucination parameters satisfy explicit conditions. Comprehensive Monte Carlo experiments on a 5-agent complete graph formation demonstrate that SOSH outperforms established robust control schemes, including W-MSR and Huber-based consensus filters, achieving faster convergence rates, lower steady-state error, and superior transient recovery. Our results confirm that SOSH combines theoretical robustness with practical deployability, offering a promising direction for securing MAS formations against sophisticated adversarial threats.</description>

      <title>A Theoretical Framework for Virtual Power Plant Integration with Gigawatt-Scale AI Data Centers: Multi-Timescale Control and Stability Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17284v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The explosive growth of artificial intelligence has created gigawatt-scale data centers that fundamentally challenge power system operation, exhibiting power fluctuations exceeding 500 MW within seconds and millisecond-scale variations of 50-75% of thermal design power. This paper presents a comprehensive theoretical framework that reconceptualizes Virtual Power Plants (VPPs) to accommodate these extreme dynamics through a four-layer hierarchical control architecture operating across timescales from 100 microseconds to 24 hours.
  We develop control mechanisms and stability criteria specifically tailored to converter-dominated systems with pulsing megawatt-scale loads. We prove that traditional VPP architectures, designed for aggregating distributed resources with response times of seconds to minutes, cannot maintain stability when confronted with AI data center dynamics exhibiting slew rates exceeding 1,000 MW/s at gigawatt scale.
  Our framework introduces: (1) a sub-millisecond control layer that interfaces with data center power electronics to actively dampen power oscillations; (2) new stability criteria incorporating protection system dynamics, demonstrating that critical clearing times reduce from 150 ms to 83 ms for gigawatt-scale pulsing loads; and (3) quantified flexibility characterization showing that workload deferability enables 30% peak reduction while maintaining AI service availability above 99.95%.
  This work establishes the mathematical foundations necessary for the stable integration of AI infrastructure that will constitute 50-70% of data center electricity consumption by 2030.</description>

      <title>Evaluation methodology of Model Predictive Controllers for building's energy systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Climate change poses a serious threat to the Earth's ecosystems, fueled primarily by escalating greenhouse gas emissions. Among the main contributors, the building sector stands out due to its significant energy demand. Addressing this challenge requires innovative techniques in the control of energy systems in buildings. This paper deals with the formulation of a methodology designed to evaluate the performance of these controllers. The evaluation process involves the establishment of a comprehensive test protocol and a diverse set of scenarios to evaluate the controllers. Key performance indicators are used to quantify their effectiveness based on the test results. A practical case study is presented as an application to introduce this methodology, focusing on the integration of Model Predictive Controllers (MPCs) with the Dimosim thermal simulation platform. The digital twin of the Greener building in Grenoble is used as a model for emulation. The paper demonstrates the ability of the proposed methodology to test and rank MPCs in different test scenarios, providing valuable feedback on their performance capabilities. The paper highlights the importance of the developed approach in systematically evaluating and ranking MPCs for optimized building energy management.</description>

      <title>PID Tuning via Desired Step Response Curve Fitting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17655v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a PID tuning method based on step response curve fitting (PID-SRCF) that combines integral absolute error (IAE) minimization with explicit transient response shaping. The proposed approach determines optimal PID parameters by matching the closed-loop response to any desired system response, but practically either a first-order plus time delay model or a second-order system with defined settling time and overshoot requirements. Implemented using constrained nonlinear optimization in MATLAB, the method has open-source implementation. Comparative evaluations show the PID-SRCF method achieves equivalent or better performance over standard tuning approaches, with capability for non-overshooting solution for higher-order systems which also provides low sensitivity. The results demonstrate that this approach can replace known analytical methods like Ziegler Nichols, Lambda Tuning, Pole Placement and Dominant Pole.</description>

      <title>Quantification of Sim2Real Gap via Neural Simulation Gap Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17675v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the notion of neural simulation gap functions, which formally quantifies the gap between the mathematical model and the model in the high-fidelity simulator, which closely resembles reality. Many times, a controller designed for a mathematical model does not work in reality because of the unmodelled gap between the two systems. With the help of this simulation gap function, one can use existing model-based tools to design controllers for the mathematical system and formally guarantee a decent transition from the simulation to the real world. Although in this work, we have quantified this gap using a neural network, which is trained using a finite number of data points, we give formal guarantees on the simulation gap function for the entire state space including the unseen data points. We collect data from high-fidelity simulators leveraging recent advancements in Real-to-Sim transfer to ensure close alignment with reality. We demonstrate our results through two case studies - a Mecanum bot and a Pendulum.</description>

      <title>In silico evaluation of pramlintide dosing algorithms in artificial pancreas systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17790v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pramlintide's capability to delay gastric emptying has motivated its use in artificial pancreas systems, accompanying insulin as a control action. Due to the scarcity of pramlintide simulation models in the literature, in silico testing of insulin-plus-pramlintide strategies is not widely used. This work incorporates a recent pramlintide pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics model into the T1DM UVA/Padova simulator to adjust and validate four insulin-plus-pramlintide control algorithms. The proposals are based on an existing insulin controller and administer pramlintide either as independent boluses or as a ratio of the insulin infusion. The results of the insulin-pramlintide algorithms are compared against their insulin-alone counterparts, showing an improvement in the time in range between 3.00\% and 10.53\%, consistent with results reported in clinical trials in the literature. Future work will focus on individualizing the pramlintide model to the patients' characteristics and evaluating the implemented strategies under more challenging scenarios.</description>

      <title>Safety Certificate against Latent Variables with Partially Unidentifiable Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many systems contain latent variables that make their dynamics partially unidentifiable or cause distribution shifts in the observed statistics between offline and online data. However, existing control techniques often assume access to complete dynamics or perfect simulators with fully observable states, which are necessary to verify whether the system remains within a safe set (forward invariance) or safe actions are consistently feasible at all times. To address this limitation, we propose a technique for designing probabilistic safety certificates for systems with latent variables. A key technical enabler is the formulation of invariance conditions in probability space, which can be constructed using observed statistics in the presence of distribution shifts due to latent variables. We use this invariance condition to construct a safety certificate that can be implemented efficiently in real-time control. The proposed safety certificate can continuously find feasible actions that control long-term risk to stay within tolerance. Stochastic safe control and (causal) reinforcement learning have been studied in isolation until now. To the best of our knowledge, the proposed work is the first to use causal reinforcement learning to quantify long-term risk for the design of safety certificates. This integration enables safety certificates to efficiently ensure long-term safety in the presence of latent variables. The effectiveness of the proposed safety certificate is demonstrated in numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>A Scenario-based Model Predictive Control Scheme for Pandemic Response through Non-pharmaceutical Interventions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17972v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a scenario-based model predictive control (MPC) scheme designed to control an evolving pandemic via non-pharmaceutical intervention (NPIs). The proposed approach combines predictions of possible pandemic evolution to decide on a level of severity of NPIs to be implemented over multiple weeks to maintain hospital pressure below a prescribed threshold, while minimizing their impact on society. Specifically, we first introduce a compartmental model which divides the population into Susceptible, Infected, Detected, Threatened, Healed, and Expired (SIDTHE) subpopulations and describe its positive invariant set. This model is expressive enough to explicitly capture the fraction of hospitalized individuals while preserving parameter identifiability w.r.t. publicly available datasets. Second, we devise a scenario-based MPC scheme with recourse actions that captures potential uncertainty of the model parameters. e.g., due to population behavior or seasonality. Our results show that the scenario-based nature of the proposed controller manages to adequately respond to all scenarios, keeping the hospital pressure at bay also in very challenging situations when conventional MPC methods fail.</description>

      <title>Non-Euclidean Enriched Contraction Theory for Monotone Operators and Monotone Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17990v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We adopt an operator-theoretic perspective to analyze a class of nonlinear fixed-point iterations and discrete-time dynamical systems. Specifically, we study the Krasnoselskij iteration - at the heart of countless algorithmic schemes and underpinning the stability analysis of numerous dynamical models - by focusing on a non-Euclidean vector space equipped with the diagonally weighted supremum norm. By extending the state of the art, we introduce the notion of enriched weak contractivity, which (i) is characterized by a simple, verifiable condition for Lipschitz operators, and (ii) yields explicit bounds on the admissible step size for the Krasnoselskij iteration. Our results relate the notion of weak contractivity with that of monotonicity of operators and dynamical systems and show its generality to design larger step sizes and improved convergence speed for broader classes of dynamical systems. The newly developed theory is illustrated on two applications: the design of zero-finding algorithms for monotone operators and the design of nonlinear consensus dynamics in monotone multi-agent dynamical systems.</description>

      <title>G-SEED: A Spatio-temporal Encoding Framework for Forest and Grassland Data Based on GeoSOT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18094v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, the rapid development of remote sensing, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles, and IoT technologies has led to an explosive growth in spatio-temporal forest and grassland data, which are increasingly multimodal, heterogeneous, and subject to continuous updates. However, existing Geographic Information Systems (GIS)-based systems struggle to integrate and manage of such large-scale and diverse data sources. To address these challenges, this paper proposes G-SEED (GeoSOT-based Scalable Encoding and Extraction for Forest and Grassland Spatio-temporal Data), a unified encoding and management framework based on the hierarchical GeoSOT (Geographical coordinate global Subdivision grid with One dimension integer on 2n tree) grid system. G-SEED integrates spatial, temporal, and type information into a composite code, enabling consistent encoding of both structured and unstructured data, including remote sensing imagery, vector maps, sensor records, documents, and multimedia content. The framework incorporates adaptive grid-level selection, center-cell-based indexing, and full-coverage grid arrays to optimize spatial querying and compression. Through extensive experiments on a real-world dataset from Shennongjia National Park (China), G-SEED demonstrates superior performance in spatial precision control, cross-source consistency, query efficiency, and compression compared to mainstream methods such as Geohash and H3. This study provides a scalable and reusable paradigm for the unified organization of forest and grassland big data, supporting dynamic monitoring and intelligent decision-making in these domains.</description>

      <title>Symbolic Reduction for Formal Synthesis of Global Lyapunov Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18171v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the formal synthesis of global polynomial Lyapunov functions for polynomial vector fields. We establish that a sign-definite polynomial must satisfy specific algebraic constraints, which we leverage to develop a set of straightforward symbolic reduction rules. These rules can be recursively applied to symbolically simplify the Lyapunov candidate, enabling more efficient and robust discovery of Lyapunov functions via optimization or satisfiability modulo theories (SMT) solving. In many cases, without such simplification, finding a valid Lyapunov function is often infeasible. When strict Lyapunov functions are unavailable, we design synthesis procedures for finding weak Lyapunov functions to verify global asymptotic stability using LaSalle's invariance principle. Finally, we encode instability conditions for Lyapunov functions and develop SMT procedures to disprove global asymptotic stability. Through a series of examples, we demonstrate that the proposed symbolic reduction, LaSalle-type conditions, and instability tests allow us to efficiently solve many cases that would otherwise be challenging.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Hybrid Modeling: Incremental Identification and Model Predictive Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18344v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mathematical models are crucial for optimizing and controlling chemical processes, yet they often face significant limitations in terms of computational time, algorithm complexity, and development costs. Hybrid models, which combine mechanistic models with data-driven models (i.e. models derived via the application of machine learning to experimental data), have emerged as a promising solution to these challenges. However, the identification of dynamic hybrid models remains difficult due to the need to integrate data-driven models within mechanistic model structures. We present an incremental identification approach for dynamic hybrid models that decouples the mechanistic and data-driven components to overcome computational and conceptual difficulties. Our methodology comprises four key steps: (1) regularized dynamic parameter estimation to determine optimal time profiles for flux variables, (2) correlation analysis to evaluate relationships between variables, (3) data-driven model identification using advanced machine learning techniques, and (4) hybrid model integration to combine the mechanistic and data-driven components. This approach facilitates early evaluation of model structure suitability, accelerates the development of hybrid models, and allows for independent identification of data-driven components. Three case studies are presented to illustrate the robustness, reliability, and efficiency of our incremental approach in handling complex systems and scenarios with limited data.</description>

      <title>Physics-Informed Neural Networks for Nonlocal Flow Modeling of Connected Automated Vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18357v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Connected automated vehicles (CAVs) cruising control strategies have been extensively studied at the microscopic level. CAV controllers sense and react to traffic both upstream and downstream, yet most macroscopic models still assume locality, where the desired speed only depends on local density. The nonlocal macroscopic traffic flow models that explicitly capture the ``look ahead'' and ``look behind'' nonlocal CAV dynamics remain underexplored. In this paper, we propose a Physics-informed Neural Network framework to directly learn a macroscopic non-local flow model from a generic looking-ahead looking-behind vehicle motion model, which bridges the micro-macro modeling gap. We reconstruct macroscopic traffic states from synthetic CAV trajectories generated by the proposed microscopic control designs, and then learn a non-local traffic flow model that embeds a non-local conservation law to capture the resulting look-ahead look-behind dynamics. To analyze how CAV control parameters affect nonlocal traffic flow, we conduct high-fidelity driving simulator experiments to collect human drivers' trajectory data with varying downstream and upstream visibility, which serves as a baseline for tuning CAV control gains. Our analysis validates that the learned non-local flow model predicts CAV traffic dynamics more accurately than local models, and the fundamental diagram exhibits far less scatter in the speed - density relation. We further show that the looking-ahead/looking-behind control gains mainly reshape the non-local kernels, while the macroscopic speed and non-local density relation mainly depends on the desired speed function choice of the CAV controller. Our results provide a systematic approach for learning non-local macroscopic traffic-flow models directly from generic CAV control designs.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we synthesize two aperiodic-sampled deep neural network (DNN) control schemes, based on the closed-loop tracking stability guarantees. By means of the integral quadratic constraint coping with the input-output behaviour of system uncertainties/nonlinearities and the convex relaxations of nonlinear DNN activations leveraging their local sector-bounded attributes, we establish conditions to design the event- and self-triggered logics and to compute the ellipsoidal inner approximations of region of attraction, respectively. Finally, we perform a numerical example of an inverted pendulum to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed aperiodic-sampled DNN control schemes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.18430v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a recursive solution to the receding or moving horizon estimation (MHE) problem for nonlinear time-variant systems. We provide the conditions under which the recursive MHE is equivalent to the extended Kalman filter (EKF), regardless of the horizon size. Theoretical and empirical evidence is also provided. Moreover, we clarify the connection between MHE and factor graph optimization (FGO). We apply the recursive MHE to GNSS localization and evaluate its performance using publicly available datasets. The paper is based on the deterministic least squares framework.</description>

      <title>Networked pointing system: Bearing-only target localization and pointing control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the paper, we formulate the target-pointing consensus problem where the headings of agents are required to point at a common target. Only a few agents in the network can measure the bearing information of the target. A two-step solution consisting of a bearing-only estimator for target localization and a control law for target pointing is constructed to address this problem. Compared to the strong assumptions of existing works, we only require two agents not collinear with the target to ensure localizability. By introducing the concept of virtual fusion node, we prove that both the estimation error and the tracking error converge asymptotically to the origin. The video demonstration of the verification can be found at https://youtu.be/S9- eyofk1DY.</description>

      <title>Discrete-Time Linear Dynamical System Control Using Sparse Inputs With Time-Varying Support</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18514v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In networked control systems, communication resource constraints often necessitate the use of \emph{sparse} control input vectors. A prototypical problem is how to ensure controllability of a linear dynamical system when only a limited number of actuators (inputs) can be active at each time step. In this work, we first present an algorithm for determining the \emph{sparse actuator schedule}, i.e., the sequence of supports of the input vectors that ensures controllability. Next, we extend the algorithm to minimize the average control energy by simultaneously minimizing the trace of the controllability Gramian, under the sparsity constraints. We derive theoretical guarantees for both algorithms: the first algorithm ensures controllability with a minimal number of control inputs at a given sparsity level; for the second algorithm, we derive an upper bound on the average control energy under the resulting actuator schedule. Finally, we develop a novel sparse controller based on Kalman filtering and sparse signal recovery that drives the system to a desired state in the presence of process and measurement noise. We also derive an upper bound on the steady-state MSE attained by the algorithm. We corroborate our theoretical results using numerical simulations and illustrate that sparse control achieves a control performance comparable to the fully actuated systems.</description>

      <title>A detailed simulation model for fifth generation district heating and cooling networks with seasonal latent storage evaluated on field data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fifth generation district heating and cooling (5GDHC) networks accelerate the use of renewable energies in the heating sector and enable flexible, efficient and future-proof heating and cooling supply via a single network. Due to their low temperature level and high integration of renewables, 5GDHC systems pose new challenges for the modeling of these networks in order to simulate and test operational strategies. A particular feature is the use of uninsulated pipes, which allow energy exchange with the surrounding ground. Accurate modeling of this interaction is essential for reliable simulation and optimization. This paper presents a thermp-physical model of the pip connections, the surrounding soil, a latent heat storage in the form of an ice storage as a seasonal heat storage and the house transfer stations. The model is derived from mass and energy balances leading to ordinary differential equations (ODEs). Validation is performed using field date from the 5GDHC network in Gutach-Bleibach, Germany, which supplies heating and cooling to 30 modern buildings. With an average model deviation of 4.5 % in the normalized mean bias error (NMBE) and 15.9 % in the coefficient of the variation of the root mean square error (CVRMSE), the model's accuracy is validated against the available temperature measurements. The realistic representation of the thermal-hydraulic interactions between soil and pipes, as well as the heat flow within the network, confirms the accuracy of the model and its applicability for the simulation of 5GDHC systems. The model is made openly accessible under an open-source license.</description>

      <title>Frequency Control in Microgrids: An Adaptive Fuzzy-Neural-Network Virtual Synchronous Generator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18611v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The reliance on distributed renewable energy has increased recently. As a result, power electronic-based distributed generators replaced synchronous generators which led to a change in the dynamic characteristics of the microgrid. Most critically, they reduced system inertia and damping. Virtual synchronous generators emulated in power electronics, which mimic the dynamic behaviour of synchronous generators, are meant to fix this problem. However, fixed virtual synchronous generator parameters cannot guarantee a frequency regulation within the acceptable tolerance range. Conversely, a dynamic adjustment of these virtual parameters promises robust solution with stable frequency. This paper proposes a method to adapt the inertia, damping, and droop parameters dynamically through a fuzzy neural network controller. This controller trains itself online to choose appropriate values for these virtual parameters. The proposed method can be applied to a typical AC microgrid by considering the penetration and impact of renewable energy sources. We study the system in a MATLAB/Simulink model and validate it experimentally in real time using hardware-in-the-loop based on an embedded ARM system (SAM3X8E, Cortex-M3). Compared to traditional and fuzzy logic controller methods, the results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly reduces the frequency deviation to less than 0.03 Hz and shortens the stabilizing/recovery time.</description>

      <title>New Power Decoupling Method for Grid Forming Inverter Based on Adaptive Virtual-Synchronous Machine in Weak Grids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18619v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many countries' policies have shifted rapidly towards using renewable energy for climate reasons. As a result, inverter-based resources are beginning to dominate power systems. Key elements for managing the loss of conventional generators are virtual-synchronous-generator-based grid-forming inverters. Despite the unique advantages of this technology, there are still various challenges, most notably the problem of active-reactive power coupling due to a nonzero power angle and high grid impedance ratio R/X. The effect of power coupling means that any change in the inverter's active power will affect the reactive power and vice versa. This challenge results in grid instability, reduces control performance, and restricts the active power delivery capability of the inverter to the grid. This paper presents a new vision to solve this impact in weak grids by a new power-decoupling method based on adaptive virtual synchronous generator parameters. The power coupling will be studied considering the parameters causing this effect. Fuzzy logic will serve to adjust the parameters of power control loops. Hardware-in-the-loop testing on a real-time simulator (OP4610) and a physical microcontroller verified and validated the proposed method. The results showed the proposed method's effectiveness in eliminating static and dynamic power coupling and improving the grid-forming inverter performance under different operating conditions.</description>

      <title>How flexible do we need to be? Using electricity systems models to identify optimal designs for flexible carbon capture storage system for gas-fired power plants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the share of variable renewable energy in power systems grows, enhancing the operational flexibility of combined cycle gas turbines with carbon capture and storage (CCGT-CCS) becomes increasingly valuable. This study integrates techno-economic analysis with capacity expansion modeling to quantify the value of improved CCGT-CCS flexibility-such as lower start-up costs, reduced minimum generation, faster ramping, and shorter up/down times-at both plant and system levels. Using the Texas power system as a case study, we find that increased flexibility raises CCGT-CCS generation profits and installed capacity. Under various policy scenarios, CCGT-CCS benefits most from a CO2 tax (or equivalent emissions cap), more so than from clean energy standards or capture subsidies like the federal 45Q tax credit. However, electricity system cost savings remain modest, reducing total costs by only 0.3-0.5%. Thus, flexibility improvements should be pursued only if they entail limited increases in capital and maintenance costs.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Single-Pulse and Sawyer-Tower Method for Accurate Transistor Loss Separation in High-Frequency High-Efficiency Power Converters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18635v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate measurement of transistor parasitic capacitance and its associated energy losses is critical for evaluating device performance, particularly in high-frequency and high-efficiency power conversion systems. This paper proposes a hybrid single-pulse and Sawyer-Tower test method to analyse switching characteristics of field-effect transistors (FET), which not only eliminates overlap losses but also mitigates the effects of current backflow observed in traditional double-pulse testing. Through a precise loss separation model, it enables an accurate quantification of switching losses and provides a refined understanding of device energy dissipation mechanisms. We validate the hysteresis data and loss separation results through experimental measurements on a 350-W LLC converter, which further offers deeper insights into transistor dynamic behaviour and its dependence on operating conditions. This method is applicable to a wide range of transistors, including emerging SiC and GaN devices, and serves as a valuable tool for device characterization and optimization in power electronics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.18672v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For the next-generation wireless networks and beyond, both the upper mid-band (7 GHz-24 GHz) and terahertz (100 GHz-1 THz) spectra are gaining global attention from service providers, academic research groups, policy makers, and standards organizations. This article provides an in-depth analysis of recent regulatory rulings and spectrum preferences issued by international standard bodies such as the International Telecommunications Union and Federal Communications Commission as they seek to identify feasible bands for future wireless networks. In this paper, we present the promising spectrum allocations earmarked for 6G and beyond. We also provide exemplars that illuminate the passive service protections and spectrum feasibility for coexistence between terrestrial wireless networks and satellites and other non-terrestrial networks (NTN), and discuss key technical constraints that will challenge future spectrum use for the wireless industry. The findings highlight promising frequency bands while addressing regulatory and technological challenges for future wireless service deployment.</description>

      <title>Open Sky, Open Threats: Replay Attacks in Space Launch and Re-entry Phases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17446v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper examines the effects of replay attacks on the integrity of both uplink and downlink communications during critical phases of spacecraft communication. By combining software-defined radios (SDRs) with a real-time channel emulator, we replicate realistic attack conditions on the Orion spacecraft's communication systems in both launch and reentry. Our evaluation shows that, under replay attacks, the attacker's signal can overpower legitimate transmissions, leading to a Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) difference of up to -7.8 dB during reentry and -6.5 dB during launch. To mitigate these threats, we propose a more secure receiver design incorporating a phase-coherency-dependent decision-directed (DD) equalizer with a narrowed phase-locked loop (PLL) bandwidth. This configuration enhances resilience by making synchronization more sensitive to phase distortions caused by replay interference.</description>

      <title>Online Adaptation for Flying Quadrotors in Tight Formations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17488v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The task of flying in tight formations is challenging for teams of quadrotors because the complex aerodynamic wake interactions can destabilize individual team members as well as the team. Furthermore, these aerodynamic effects are highly nonlinear and fast-paced, making them difficult to model and predict. To overcome these challenges, we present L1 KNODE-DW MPC, an adaptive, mixed expert learning based control framework that allows individual quadrotors to accurately track trajectories while adapting to time-varying aerodynamic interactions during formation flights. We evaluate L1 KNODE-DW MPC in two different three-quadrotor formations and show that it outperforms several MPC baselines. Our results show that the proposed framework is capable of enabling the three-quadrotor team to remain vertically aligned in close proximity throughout the flight. These findings show that the L1 adaptive module compensates for unmodeled disturbances most effectively when paired with an accurate dynamics model.

      <title>Location Information Sharing Using Software Defined Radio in Multi-UAV Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17678v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: SDR (Software Defined Radio) provides flexible, reproducible, and longer-lasting radio tools for military and civilian wireless communications infrastructure. SDR is a radio communication system whose components are implemented as software. This study aims to establish multi-channel wireless communication with FANET between two SDRs to share location information and examine it in a realistic test environment. We used multi-channel token circulation as a channel access protocol and GNU Radio platform for SDR software development. The structures of the communication layer, including the protocols, communication systems, and network structures suggested in the studies in the literature, are generally tested in the simulation environment. The simulation environment provides researchers with fast and easy development and testing, but disadvantages exist. These cause a product to be isolated from hardware, software, and cost effects encountered while developing and environmental factors affecting the communication channel while testing. Another contribution of the study is to present the developed block diagrams and codes as clear and reproducible. The developed software and block diagrams are available at github.com/knrl/uav-in-802.11-gnuradio.</description>

      <title>Derandomizing Simultaneous Confidence Regions for Band-Limited Functions by Improved Norm Bounds and Majority-Voting Schemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17764v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Band-limited functions are fundamental objects that are widely used in systems theory and signal processing. In this paper we refine a recent nonparametric, nonasymptotic method for constructing simultaneous confidence regions for band-limited functions from noisy input-output measurements, by working in a Paley-Wiener reproducing kernel Hilbert space. Kernel norm bounds are tightened using a uniformly-randomized Hoeffding's inequality for small samples and an empirical Bernstein bound for larger ones. We derive an approximate threshold, based on the sample size and how informative the inputs are, that governs which bound to deploy. Finally, we apply majority voting to aggregate confidence sets from random subsamples, boosting both stability and region size. We prove that even per-input aggregated intervals retain their simultaneous coverage guarantee. These refinements are also validated through numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Exploration with a New Uncertainty Framework for Active SLAM Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17775v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate reconstruction of the environment is a central goal of Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) systems. However, the agent's trajectory can significantly affect estimation accuracy. This paper presents a new method to model map uncertainty in Active SLAM systems using an Uncertainty Map (UM). The UM uses probability distributions to capture where the map is uncertain, allowing Uncertainty Frontiers (UF) to be defined as key exploration-exploitation objectives and potential stopping criteria. In addition, the method introduces the Signed Relative Entropy (SiREn), based on the Kullback-Leibler divergence, to measure both coverage and uncertainty together. This helps balance exploration and exploitation through an easy-to-understand parameter. Unlike methods that depend on particular SLAM setups, the proposed approach is compatible with different types of sensors, such as cameras, LiDARs, and multi-sensor fusion. It also addresses common problems in exploration planning and stopping conditions. Furthermore, integrating this map modeling approach with a UF-based planning system enables the agent to autonomously explore open spaces, a behavior not previously observed in the Active SLAM literature. Code and implementation details are available as a ROS node, and all generated data are openly available for public use, facilitating broader adoption and validation of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>RoboMonkey: Scaling Test-Time Sampling and Verification for Vision-Language-Action Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17811v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in visuomotor control, yet ensuring their robustness in unstructured real-world environments remains a persistent challenge. In this paper, we investigate test-time scaling through the lens of sampling and verification as means to enhance the robustness and generalization of VLAs. We first demonstrate that the relationship between action error and the number of generated samples follows an exponentiated power law across a range of VLAs, indicating the existence of inference-time scaling laws. Building on these insights, we introduce RoboMonkey, a test-time scaling framework for VLAs. At deployment, RoboMonkey samples a small set of actions from a VLA, applies Gaussian perturbation and majority voting to construct an action proposal distribution, and then uses a Vision Language Model (VLM)-based verifier to select the optimal action. We propose a synthetic data generation pipeline for training such VLM-based action verifiers, and demonstrate that scaling the synthetic dataset consistently improves verification and downstream accuracy. Through extensive simulated and hardware experiments, we show that pairing existing VLAs with RoboMonkey yields significant performance gains, achieving a 25% absolute improvement on out-of-distribution tasks and 8% on in-distribution tasks. Additionally, when adapting to new robot setups, we show that fine-tuning both VLAs and action verifiers yields a 7% performance increase compared to fine-tuning VLAs alone.</description>

Abstract: Exchanging energy below the superconducting gap introduces quasiparticle energy distributions in superconducting quantum circuits, which will be responsible for their decoherence. This study examines the impact of quasiparticle energy on the performance of NbN superconducting microwave coplanar waveguide resonators on silicon chips. We measured the resonance frequency and internal quality factor in response to temperature sweeps to evaluate the effect of quasiparticle dynamics. Moreover, by calculating the complex conductivity of the NbN film, we identified the contribution of quasiparticle density to the experimental results.</description>

      <title>Maximum-likelihood reprojections for reliable Koopman-based predictions and bifurcation analysis of parametric dynamical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17817v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Koopman-based methods leverage a nonlinear lifting to enable linear regression techniques. Consequently, data generation, learning and prediction is performed through the lens of this lifting, giving rise to a nonlinear manifold that is invariant under the Koopman operator. In data-driven approximation such as Extended Dynamic Mode Decomposition, this invariance is typically lost due to the presence of (finite-data) approximation errors. In this work, we show that reprojections are crucial for reliable predictions. We provide an approach via closest-point projections that ensure consistency with this nonlinear manifold, which is strongly related to a Riemannian metric and maximum likelihood estimates. While these results are already novel for autonomous systems, we present our approach for parametric systems, providing the basis for data-driven bifurcation analysis and control applications.</description>

      <title>Leveling the Playing Field: Carefully Comparing Classical and Learned Controllers for Quadrotor Trajectory Tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17832v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Learning-based control approaches like reinforcement learning (RL) have recently produced a slew of impressive results for tasks like quadrotor trajectory tracking and drone racing. Naturally, it is common to demonstrate the advantages of these new controllers against established methods like analytical controllers. We observe, however, that reliably comparing the performance of such very different classes of controllers is more complicated than might appear at first sight. As a case study, we take up the problem of agile tracking of an end-effector for a quadrotor with a fixed arm. We develop a set of best practices for synthesizing the best-in-class RL and geometric controllers (GC) for benchmarking. In the process, we resolve widespread RL-favoring biases in prior studies that provide asymmetric access to: (1) the task definition, in the form of an objective function, (2) representative datasets, for parameter optimization, and (3) feedforward information, describing the desired future trajectory. The resulting findings are the following: our improvements to the experimental protocol for comparing learned and classical controllers are critical, and each of the above asymmetries can yield misleading conclusions. Prior works have claimed that RL outperforms GC, but we find the gaps between the two controller classes are much smaller than previously published when accounting for symmetric comparisons. Geometric control achieves lower steady-state error than RL, while RL has better transient performance, resulting in GC performing better in relatively slow or less agile tasks, but RL performing better when greater agility is required. Finally, we open-source implementations of geometric and RL controllers for these aerial vehicles, implementing best practices for future development.

      <title>Inverse Chance Constrained Optimal Power Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17924v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The chance constrained optimal power flow (CC-OPF) essentially finds the low-cost generation dispatch scheme ensuring operational constraints are met with a specified probability, termed the security level. While the security level is a crucial input parameter, how it shapes the CC-OPF feasibility boundary has not been revealed. Changing the security level from a parameter to a decision variable, this letter proposes the inverse CC-OPF that seeks the highest feasible security level supported by the system. To efficiently solve this problem, we design a Newton-Raphson-like iteration algorithm leveraging the duality-based sensitivity analysis of an associated surrogate problem. Numerical experiments validate the proposed approach, revealing complex feasibility boundaries for security levels that underscore the importance of coordinating security levels across multiple chance constraints.</description>

      <title>ROBBO: An Efficient Method for Pareto Front Estimation with Guaranteed Accuracy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18004v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A new method to estimate the Pareto Front (PF) in bi-objective optimization problems is presented. Assuming a continuous PF, the approach, named ROBBO (RObust and Balanced Bi-objective Optimization), needs to sample at most a finite, pre-computed number of PF points. Upon termination, it guarantees that the worst-case approximation error lies within a desired tolerance range, predefined by the decision maker, for each of the two objective functions. Theoretical results are derived, about the worst-case number of PF samples required to guarantee the wanted accuracy, both in general and for specific sampling methods from the literature. A comparative analysis, both theoretical and numerical, demonstrates the superiority of the proposed method with respect to popular ones. The approach is finally showcased in a constrained path-following problem for a 2-axis positioning system and in a steady-state optimization problem for a Continuous-flow Stirred Tank Reactor. An open demo implementation of ROBBO is made available online.</description>

Abstract: Meta learning aims at learning how to solve tasks, and thus it allows to estimate models that can be quickly adapted to new scenarios. This work explores distributionally robust minimization in meta learning for system identification. Standard meta learning approaches optimize the expected loss, overlooking task variability. We use an alternative approach, adopting a distributionally robust optimization paradigm that prioritizes high-loss tasks, enhancing performance in worst-case scenarios. Evaluated on a meta model trained on a class of synthetic dynamical systems and tested in both in-distribution and out-of-distribution settings, the proposed approach allows to reduce failures in safety-critical applications.</description>

      <title>Wisdom of Crowds Through Myopic Self-Confidence Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18195v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The wisdom of crowds is an umbrella term for phenomena suggesting that the collective judgment or decision of a large group can be more accurate than the individual judgments or decisions of the group members. A well-known example illustrating this concept is the competition at a country fair described by Galton, where the median value of the individual guesses about the weight of an ox resulted in an astonishingly accurate estimate of the actual weight. This phenomenon resembles classical results in probability theory and relies on independent decision-making. The accuracy of the group's final decision can be significantly reduced if the final agents' opinions are driven by a few influential agents.
  In this paper, we consider a group of agents who initially possess uncorrelated and unbiased noisy measurements of a common state of the world. Assume these agents iteratively update their estimates according to a simple non-Bayesian learning rule, commonly known in mathematical sociology as the French-DeGroot dynamics or iterative opinion pooling. As a result of this iterative distributed averaging process, each agent arrives at an asymptotic estimate of the state of the world, with the variance of this estimate determined by the matrix of weights the agents assign to each other. Every agent aims at minimizing the variance of her asymptotic estimate of the state of the world; however, such variance is also influenced by the weights allocated by other agents. To achieve the best possible estimate, the agents must then solve a game-theoretic, multi-objective optimization problem defined by the available sets of influence weights. We characterize both the Pareto frontier and the set of Nash equilibria in the resulting game. Additionally, we examine asynchronous best-response dynamics for the group of agents and prove their convergence to the set of strict Nash equilibria.</description>

      <title>A Computationally Efficient Method for Solving Mixed-Integer AC Optimal Power Flow Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18301v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stepwise controllable devices, such as switched capacitors or stepwise controllable loads and generators, transform the nonconvex AC optimal power flow (AC-OPF) problem into a nonconvex mixed-integer (MI) programming problem which is generally hard to solve optimally. Existing methods for solving MI-AC-OPF problems usually suffer from either limited accuracy or computational intractability, making them impractical for real-world applications. To address these challenges, we propose an efficient iterative deflation approach providing high-quality approximate solutions. In each iteration, a continuously relaxed version of the MI-AC-OPF problem is solved and one candidate integer value is systematically eliminated based on the evaluation of a simple power flow result. The computational complexity of the proposed algorithm grows linearly with the number of integer optimization variables, ensuring scalability. Simulations demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves significant improvements in solution accuracy compared to a state-of-the-art approach. Thus, the proposed method is promising for solving practical MI-AC-OPF problems.</description>

      <title>FICA: Faster Inner Convex Approximation of Chance Constrained Grid Dispatch with Decision-Coupled Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18806v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a Faster Inner Convex Approximation (FICA) method for solving power system dispatch problems with Wasserstein distributionally robust joint chance constraints (WJCC) and incorporating the modelling of the automatic generation control factors. The problem studied belongs to the computationally challenging class of WJCC with left-hand-side uncertainty (LHS-WJCC). By exploiting the special one-dimensional structure (even if only partially present) of the problem, the proposed FICA incorporates a set of strong valid inequalities to accelerate the solution process. We prove that FICA achieves the same optimality as the well-known conditional value-at-risk (CVaR) inner convex approximation method. Our numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed FICA can yield 40x computational speedup compared to CVaR, and can even reach up to 500x speedup when the optimisation horizon exceeds 16 time steps. This speedup is achieved when only 50% of constraints in a WJCC have the one-dimensional structure. The approximation quality is numerically verified to be the same as CVaR, and the quality gap is below 1% when compared to the computationally demanding exact reformulation of the LHS-WJCC in most cases. We also discuss the applications of FICA in optimisation problems from other domains that (partially) exhibit the one-dimensional structure.</description>

      <title>Steering Conceptual Bias via Transformer Latent-Subspace Activation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18887v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work examines whether activating latent subspaces in language models (LLMs) can steer scientific code generation toward a specific programming language. Five causal LLMs were first evaluated on scientific coding prompts to quantify their baseline bias among four programming languages. A static neuron-attribution method, perturbing the highest activated MLP weight for a C++ or CPP token, proved brittle and exhibited limited generalization across prompt styles and model scales. To address these limitations, a gradient-refined adaptive activation steering framework (G-ACT) was developed: per-prompt activation differences are clustered into a small set of steering directions, and lightweight per-layer probes are trained and refined online to select the appropriate steering vector. In LLaMA-3.2 3B, this approach reliably biases generation towards the CPP language by increasing the average probe classification accuracy by 15% and the early layers (0-6) improving the probe classification accuracy by 61.5% compared to the standard ACT framework. For LLaMA-3.3 70B, where attention-head signals become more diffuse, targeted injections at key layers still improve language selection. Although per-layer probing introduces a modest inference overhead, it remains practical by steering only a subset of layers and enables reproducible model behavior. These results demonstrate a scalable, interpretable and efficient mechanism for concept-level control for practical agentic systems.</description>

      <title>IDCAIS: Inter-Defender Collision-Aware Interception Strategy against Multiple Attackers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2112.12098v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the prior literature on multi-agent area defense games, the assignments of the defenders to the attackers are done based on a cost metric associated only with the interception of the attackers. In contrast to that, this paper presents an Inter-Defender Collision-Aware Interception Strategy (IDCAIS) for defenders to intercept attackers in order to defend a protected area, such that the defender-to-attacker assignment protocol not only takes into account an interception-related cost but also takes into account any possible future collisions among the defenders on their optimal interception trajectories. In particular, in this paper, the defenders are assigned to intercept attackers using a mixed-integer quadratic program (MIQP) that: 1) minimizes the sum of times taken by defenders to capture the attackers under time-optimal control, as well as 2) helps eliminate or delay possible future collisions among the defenders on the optimal trajectories. To prevent inevitable collisions on optimal trajectories or collisions arising due to time-sub-optimal behavior by the attackers, a minimally augmented control using exponential control barrier function (ECBF) is also provided. Simulations show the efficacy of the approach.</description>

      <title>A Synthetic Texas Power System with Time-Series Weather-Dependent Spatiotemporal Profiles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.13231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.13231v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We developed a synthetic Texas 123-bus backbone transmission system (TX-123BT) with spatio-temporally correlated grid profiles of solar power, wind power, dynamic line ratings and loads at one-hour resolution for five continuous years, which demonstrates unique advantages compared to conventional test cases that offer single static system profile snapshots. Three weather-dependent models are used to create the hourly wind power productions, solar power productions, and dynamic line ratings respectively. The actual historical weather information is also provided along with this dataset, which is suitable for machine learning models. Security-constrained unit commitment is conducted on TX-123BT daily grid profiles and numerical results are compared with the actual Texas system for validation. The created hourly DLR profiles can cut operating cost from USD 8.09 M to USD 7.95 M (-1.7 %), raises renewable dispatch by 1.3 %, and lowers average LMPs from USD 18.66 to USD 17.98 /MWh (-3.6 %). Two hydrogen options -- a 200 MW dual hub and a 500 MW hydrogen-energy transmission and conversion system -- reduce high-load Q3 daily costs by 13.9 % and 14.1 %, respectively. Sensitivity tests show that suppressing the high-resolution weather-driven profiles can push system cost up by as much as 15 %, demonstrating the economic weight of temporal detail.</description>

      <title>Online energy management system for a fuel cell/battery hybrid system with multiple fuel cell stacks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.13208v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fuel cell (FC)/battery hybrid systems have attracted substantial attention for achieving zero-emissions buses, trucks, ships, and planes. An online energy management system (EMS) is essential for these hybrid systems, it controls energy flow and ensures optimal system performance. Key aspects include fuel efficiency and mitigating FC and battery degradation. This paper proposes a health-aware EMS for FC and battery hybrid systems with multiple FC stacks. The proposed EMS employs mixed integer quadratic programming (MIQP) to control each FC stack in the hybrid system independently, i.e., MIQP-based individual stack control (ISC), with significant fuel cost reductions, FC and battery degradations. The proposed method is compared with classical dynamic programming (DP), with a 2243 times faster computational speed than the DP method while maintaining nearoptimal performance. The case study results show that ISC achieves a 64.68 % total cost reduction compared to CSC in the examined scenario, with substantial reductions across key metrics including battery degradation (4 %), hydrogen fuel consumption (22 %), fuel cell idling loss (99 %), and fuel cell load-change loss (41 %)</description>

      <title>Nonparametric Steady-State Learning for Nonlinear Output Feedback Regulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.16170v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article addresses the nonadaptive and robust output regulation problem of the general nonlinear output feedback system with error output. The global robust output regulation problem for a class of general output feedback nonlinear systems with an uncertain exosystem and high relative degree can be tackled by constructing a linear generic internal model, provided that a continuous nonlinear mapping exists. Leveraging the proposed nonadaptive framework facilitates the conversion of the nonlinear robust output regulation problem into a robust nonadaptive stabilization formulation for the augmented system endowed with Input-to-State Stable dynamics. This approach removes the need for constructing a specific Lyapunov function with positive semi-definite derivatives and avoids the common assumption of linear parameterization of the nonlinear system. The nonadaptive approach is extended by incorporating the nonparametric learning framework to ensure the feasibility of the nonlinear mapping, which can be tackled using a data-driven method. Moreover, the introduced nonparametric learning framework allows the controlled system to learn the dynamics of the steady-state input behaviour from the signal generated from the internal model with the output error as the feedback. As a result, the nonadaptive/nonparametric approach can be advantageous to guarantee the convergence of the estimation and tracking error even when the underlying controlled system dynamics are complex or poorly understood. The effectiveness of the theoretical results is illustrated for a benchmark example: a controlled duffing system and two practical examples: a continuously stirred tank reactor and a continuous bioreactor.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.04655v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Model mismatch and process noise are two frequently occurring phenomena that can drastically affect the performance of model predictive control (MPC) in practical applications. We propose a principled way to tune the cost function and the constraints of linear MPC schemes to improve the closed-loop performance and robust constraint satisfaction on uncertain nonlinear dynamics with additive noise. The tuning is performed using a novel MPC tuning algorithm based on backpropagation developed in our earlier work. Using the scenario approach, we provide probabilistic bounds on the likelihood of closed-loop constraint violation over a finite horizon. We showcase the effectiveness of the proposed method on linear and nonlinear simulation examples.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06975v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a sequential decision-making problem for a profit-maximizing operator of an autonomous mobility-on-demand system. Optimizing a central operator's vehicle-to-request dispatching policy requires efficient and effective fleet control strategies. To this end, we employ a multi-agent Soft Actor-Critic algorithm combined with weighted bipartite matching. We propose a novel vehicle-based algorithm architecture and adapt the critic's loss function to appropriately consider coordinated actions. Furthermore, we extend our algorithm to incorporate rebalancing capabilities. Through numerical experiments, we show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art benchmarks by up to 12.9% for dispatching and up to 38.9% with integrated rebalancing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03633v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies privacy-preserving resilient vector consensus in multi-agent systems against faulty agents, where normal agents can achieve consensus within the convex hull of their initial states while protecting state vectors from being disclosed. Specifically, we consider a modification of an existing algorithm known as Approximate Distributed Robust Convergence Using Centerpoints (ADRC), i.e., Privacy-Preserving ADRC (PP-ADRC). Under PP-ADRC, each normal agent introduces multivariate Gaussian noise to its state during each iteration. We first provide sufficient conditions to ensure that all normal agents' states can achieve mean square convergence under PP-ADRC. Then, we analyze convergence accuracy from two perspectives, i.e., the Mahalanobis distance of the final value from its expectation and the Hausdorff distance-based alteration of the convex hull caused by noise when only partial dimensions are added with noise. Then, we employ concentrated geo-privacy to characterize privacy preservation and conduct a thorough comparison with differential privacy. Finally, numerical simulations demonstrate the theoretical results.</description>

      <title>A Spatial-Domain Coordinated Control Method for CAVs at Unsignalized Intersections Considering Motion Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04290v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Coordinated control of connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) emerges as a promising technology to improve traffic safety, efficiency, and sustainability. Meanwhile, mixed traffic, where CAVs coexist with conventional human-driven vehicles (HDVs), represents an upcoming and necessary stage in the development of intelligent transportation systems. Considering the motion uncertainty of HDVs, this paper proposes a coordinated control method for trajectory planning of CAVs at an unsignalized intersection in mixed traffic. By sampling in distance and using an exact change of variables, the coordinated control problem is formulated in the spatial domain as a nonlinear program, thereby allowing for unified linear collision avoidance constraints to handle vehicle crossing, following, merging, and diverging conflicts. The motion uncertainty of HDVs is decoupled and modeled as path uncertainty and speed uncertainty, whereby the robustness of collision avoidance is ensured in both spatial and temporal dimensions. The prediction deviation for HDVs is compensated by receding horizon optimization, and a real-time iteration (RTI) scheme is developed to improve computational efficiency. Simulation case studies are conducted to validate the efficacy, robustness, and potential for real-time application of the proposed methods. The results show that the proposed control scheme provides collision-free and smooth trajectories with state and control constraints satisfied. Compared with the converged baseline, the RTI scheme reduces the computation time by orders of magnitude, and the solution deviation is less than 2.3%, demonstrating a favorable trade-off between computational effort and optimality.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.10030v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent studies highlight the importance of persistently exciting condition in single signal sequence for model identification and data-driven control methodologies. However, maintaining prolonged excitation in control signals introduces significant challenges, as continuous excitation can reduce the lifetime of mechanical devices. In this paper, we introduce three informativity conditions for various types of multi-signal data, each augmented by weight factors. We explore the interrelations between these conditions and their rank properties in linear time-invariant systems. Furthermore, we introduce open-loop experimental design methods tailored to each of the three conditions, which can synthesize the required excitation conditions either offline or online, even in the presence of limited information within each signal segment. We demonstrate the effectiveness of these informativity conditions in least-squares identification. Additionally, all three conditions can extend Willems' fundamental lemma and are utilized to assess the properties of the system. Illustrative examples confirm that these conditions yield satisfactory outcomes in both least-squares identification and the construction of data-driven controllers.</description>

      <title>Joint Power and Spectrum Orchestration for D2D Semantic Communication Underlying Energy-Efficient Cellular Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18350v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Semantic communication (SemCom) has been recently deemed a promising next-generation wireless technique to enable efficient spectrum savings and information exchanges, thus naturally introducing a novel and practical network paradigm where cellular and device-to-device (D2D) SemCom approaches coexist. Nevertheless, the involved wireless resource management becomes complicated and challenging due to the unique semantic performance measurements and energy-consuming semantic coding mechanism. To this end, this paper jointly investigates power control and spectrum reuse problems for energy-efficient D2D SemCom cellular networks. Concretely, we first model the user preference-aware semantic triplet transmission and leverage a novel metric of semantic value to identify the semantic information importance conveyed in SemCom. Then, we define the additional power consumption from semantic encoding in conjunction with basic power amplifier dissipation to derive the overall system energy efficiency (semantics/Joule). Next, we formulate an energy efficiency maximization problem for joint power and spectrum allocation subject to several SemCom-related and practical constraints. Afterward, we propose an optimal resource management solution by employing the fractional-to-subtractive problem transformation and decomposition while developing a three-stage method with theoretical analysis of its optimality guarantee and computational complexity. Numerical results demonstrate the adequate performance superiority of our proposed solution compared with different benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Rapid Detection of High-impedance Arc Faults in Medium Voltage Electrical Distribution Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.05846v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-impedance arc faults in AC power systems have the potential to lead to catastrophic accidents. However, significant challenges exist in identifying these faults because of the much weaker characteristics and variety when grounded with different surfaces. Previous research has concentrated predominantly on arc fault detection in low-voltage systems, leaving a significant gap in medium-voltage applications. In this work, a novel approach has been developed that enables rapid arc fault detection for medium-voltage distribution lines. In contrast to existing black-box feature-based approaches, the Hankel alternative view of the Koopman (HAVOK) analysis developed from nonlinear dynamics has been applied, which not only offers interpretable features but also opens up new application options in the area of arc fault detection. The method achieves a much faster detection speed in 0.45 ms, 99.36\% enhanced compared to harmonic randomness and waveform distortion method, thus making it suitable for real-time applications. It demonstrates the ability to detect arc faults across various scenarios, including different grounding surfaces and levels of system noise, boosting its practical importance for stakeholders in safety-critical industries.</description>

      <title>The value of hedging against energy storage uncertainties when designing energy parks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15416v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Energy storage is needed to match renewable generation to industrial loads in energy parks. However, the future performance of bulk storage technologies is currently highly uncertain. Due to the urgency of decarbonization targets, energy park projects must be designed and begun now. But, as uncertainty in storage performance reduces, a different technology than identified during initial design may turn out cheaper. Enabling flexibility so that design adaptations can be made as better information becomes available would lower the cost of decarbonizing industry. But having this flexibility is itself costly. This raises the question, "Is it worth it?"
  This study quantifies the benefit of retaining flexibility to adapt energy park designs and optionality over storage technology choice as uncertainty reduces, to determine whether it is economically worthwhile. It applies the Value of Information analysis framework to the sizing of wind, solar, and storage in an illustrative energy park model based on a real-world proposal near Rotterdam, considering uncertainty in storage efficiency, lifetime, and capital cost.
  Updating asset sizings after storage uncertainty reduced is found to reduce total costs by 18% on average. Having the option to switch storage technology choice as well reduces costs by a further 13%, which is substantially greater than the cost of providing storage optionality. Using two storage technologies in the energy park reduces costs by 14%, and in this case storage optionality is not worthwhile. These results are robust to the level of uncertainty reduction in storage performance, and the risk aversion of the system designer.</description>

      <title>Quantum-Enhanced Reinforcement Learning for Power Grid Security Assessment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.14412v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The increasingly challenging task of maintaining power grid security requires innovative solutions. Novel approaches using reinforcement learning (RL) agents have been proposed to help grid operators navigate the massive decision space and nonlinear behavior of these complex networks. However, applying RL to power grid security assessment, specifically for combinatorially troublesome contingency analysis problems, has proven difficult to scale. The integration of quantum computing into these RL frameworks helps scale by improving computational efficiency and boosting agent proficiency by leveraging quantum advantages in action exploration and model-based interdependence. To demonstrate a proof-of-concept use of quantum computing for RL agent training and simulation, we propose a hybrid agent that runs on quantum hardware using IBM's Qiskit Runtime. We also provide detailed insight into the construction of parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs) for generating relevant quantum output. This agent's proficiency at maintaining grid stability is demonstrated relative to a benchmark model without quantum enhancement using N-k contingency analysis. Additionally, we offer a comparative assessment of the training procedures for RL models integrated with a quantum backend.</description>

      <title>Deep reinforcement learning-based joint real-time energy scheduling for green buildings with heterogeneous battery energy storage devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06824v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Green buildings (GBs) with renewable energy and building energy management systems (BEMS) enable efficient energy use and support sustainable development. Electric vehicles (EVs), as flexible storage resources, enhance system flexibility when integrated with stationary energy storage systems (ESS) for real-time scheduling. However, differing degradation and operational characteristics of ESS and EVs complicate scheduling strategies. This paper proposes a model-free deep reinforcement learning (DRL) method for joint real-time scheduling based on a combined battery system (CBS) integrating ESS and EVs. We develop accurate degradation models and cost estimates, prioritize EV travel demands, and enable collaborative ESS-EV operation under varying conditions. A prediction model optimizes energy interaction between CBS and BEMS. To address heterogeneous states, action coupling, and learning efficiency, the DRL algorithm incorporates double networks, a dueling mechanism, and prioritized experience replay. Experiments show a 37.94 percent to 40.01 percent reduction in operating costs compared to a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) approach.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.12554v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Designing controllers for complex industrial electronic systems is challenging due to nonlinearities and parameter uncertainties, and traditional methods are often slow and costly. To address this, we propose a novel autonomous design framework driven by Large Language Models (LLMs). Our approach employs a bi-level optimization strategy: an LLM intelligently explores and iteratively improves the control algorithm's structure, while a Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm efficiently refines the parameters for any given structure. This method achieves end-to-end automated design. Validated through a simulation of a DC-DC Boost converter, our framework successfully evolved a basic controller into a high-performance adaptive version that met all stringent design specifications for fast response, low error, and robustness. This work presents a new paradigm for control design that significantly enhances automation and efficiency.</description>

Abstract: In this technical communique, we develop a graphical design procedure for reset controllers for unstable LTI plants based on recent developments on Scaled Relative Graph analysis, yielding an $L_2$-gain performance bound. The stabilizing controller consists of a second order reset element in parallel with a proportional gain. The proposed method goes beyond existing approaches that are limited to stable systems only, providing a well-applicable approach to design problems in practice where the plant is unstable.</description>

      <title>Multi-Task Lifelong Reinforcement Learning for Wireless Sensor Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.16254v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Enhancing the sustainability and efficiency of wireless sensor networks (WSN) in dynamic and unpredictable environments requires adaptive communication and energy harvesting strategies. We propose a novel adaptive control strategy for WSNs that optimizes data transmission and EH to minimize overall energy consumption while ensuring queue stability and energy storing constraints under dynamic environmental conditions. The notion of adaptability therein is achieved by transferring the known environment-specific knowledge to new conditions resorting to the lifelong reinforcement learning concepts. We evaluate our proposed method against two baseline frameworks: Lyapunov-based optimization, and policy-gradient reinforcement learning (RL). Simulation results demonstrate that our approach rapidly adapts to changing environmental conditions by leveraging transferable knowledge, achieving near-optimal performance approximately $30\%$ faster than the RL method and $60\%$ faster than the Lyapunov-based approach. The implementation is available at our GitHub repository for reproducibility purposes [1].</description>

      <title>A model predictive control framework with robust stability guarantees under large disturbances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.10216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.10216v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To address feasibility issues in model predictive control (MPC), most implementations relax state constraints by using slack variables and adding a penalty to the cost. We propose an alternative strategy: relaxing the initial state constraint with a penalty. Compared to state-of-the-art soft constrained MPC formulations, the proposed formulation has two key features: (i) input-to-state stability and bounds on the cumulative constraint violation for large disturbances; (ii) close-to-optimal performance under nominal operating conditions. The idea is initially presented for open-loop asymptotically stable nonlinear systems by designing the penalty as a Lyapunov function, but we also show how to relax this condition to: i) Lyapunov stable systems; ii) stabilizable systems; and iii) utilizing an implicit characterization of the Lyapunov function. In the special case of linear systems, the proposed MPC formulation reduces to a quadratic program, and the offline design and online computational complexity are only marginally increased compared to a nominal design. Numerical examples demonstrate benefits compared to state-of-the-art soft-constrained MPC formulations.</description>

      <title>Distributed Optimization of Clique-Wise Coupled Problems via Three-Operator Splitting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.18625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.18625v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study explores distributed optimization problems with clique-wise coupling via operator splitting and how we can utilize this framework for performance analysis and enhancement. This framework extends beyond conventional pairwise coupled problems (e.g., consensus optimization) and is applicable to broader examples. To this end, we first introduce a new distributed optimization algorithm by leveraging a clique-based matrix and the Davis-Yin splitting (DYS), a versatile three-operator splitting method. We then demonstrate that this approach sheds new light on conventional algorithms in the following way: (i) Existing algorithms (NIDS, Exact diffusion, diffusion, and our previous work) can be derived from our proposed method; (ii) We present a new mixing matrix based on clique-wise coupling, which surfaces when deriving the NIDS. We prove its preferable distribution of eigenvalues, enabling fast consensus; (iii) These observations yield a new linear convergence rate for the NIDS with non-smooth objective functions. Remarkably our linear rate is first established for the general DYS with a projection for a subspace. This case is not covered by any prior results, to our knowledge. Finally, numerical examples showcase the efficacy of our proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Physics-Informed Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for Distributed Multi-Robot Problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.00212v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The networked nature of multi-robot systems presents challenges in the context of multi-agent reinforcement learning. Centralized control policies do not scale with increasing numbers of robots, whereas independent control policies do not exploit the information provided by other robots, exhibiting poor performance in cooperative-competitive tasks. In this work we propose a physics-informed reinforcement learning approach able to learn distributed multi-robot control policies that are both scalable and make use of all the available information to each robot. Our approach has three key characteristics. First, it imposes a port-Hamiltonian structure on the policy representation, respecting energy conservation properties of physical robot systems and the networked nature of robot team interactions. Second, it uses self-attention to ensure a sparse policy representation able to handle time-varying information at each robot from the interaction graph. Third, we present a soft actor-critic reinforcement learning algorithm parameterized by our self-attention port-Hamiltonian control policy, which accounts for the correlation among robots during training while overcoming the need of value function factorization. Extensive simulations in different multi-robot scenarios demonstrate the success of the proposed approach, surpassing previous multi-robot reinforcement learning solutions in scalability, while achieving similar or superior performance (with averaged cumulative reward up to x2 greater than the state-of-the-art with robot teams x6 larger than the number of robots at training time). We also validate our approach on multiple real robots in the Georgia Tech Robotarium under imperfect communication, demonstrating zero-shot sim-to-real transfer and scalability across number of robots.</description>

      <title>Recursive Gaussian Process State Space Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.14679v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Learning dynamical models from data is not only fundamental but also holds great promise for advancing principle discovery, time-series prediction, and controller design. Among various approaches, Gaussian Process State-Space Models (GPSSMs) have recently gained significant attention due to their combination of flexibility and interpretability. However, for online learning, the field lacks an efficient method suitable for scenarios where prior information regarding data distribution and model function is limited. To address this issue, this paper proposes a recursive GPSSM method with adaptive capabilities for both operating domains and Gaussian process (GP) hyperparameters. Specifically, we first utilize first-order linearization to derive a Bayesian update equation for the joint distribution between the system state and the GP model, enabling closed-form and domain-independent learning. Second, an online selection algorithm for inducing points is developed based on informative criteria to achieve lightweight learning. Third, to support online hyperparameter optimization, we recover historical measurement information from the current filtering distribution. Comprehensive evaluations on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the superior accuracy, computational efficiency, and adaptability of our method compared to state-of-the-art online GPSSM techniques.</description>

      <title>G3Flow: Generative 3D Semantic Flow for Pose-aware and Generalizable Object Manipulation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18369v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in imitation learning for 3D robotic manipulation have shown promising results with diffusion-based policies. However, achieving human-level dexterity requires seamless integration of geometric precision and semantic understanding. We present G3Flow, a novel framework that constructs real-time semantic flow, a dynamic, object-centric 3D semantic representation by leveraging foundation models. Our approach uniquely combines 3D generative models for digital twin creation, vision foundation models for semantic feature extraction, and robust pose tracking for continuous semantic flow updates. This integration enables complete semantic understanding even under occlusions while eliminating manual annotation requirements. By incorporating semantic flow into diffusion policies, we demonstrate significant improvements in both terminal-constrained manipulation and cross-object generalization. Extensive experiments across five simulation tasks show that G3Flow consistently outperforms existing approaches, achieving up to 68.3% and 50.1% average success rates on terminal-constrained manipulation and cross-object generalization tasks respectively. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of G3Flow in enhancing real-time dynamic semantic feature understanding for robotic manipulation policies.</description>

      <title>A Linear Parameter-Varying Framework for the Analysis of Time-Varying Optimization Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07461v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we propose a framework to analyze iterative first-order optimization algorithms for time-varying convex optimization. We assume that the temporal variability is caused by a time-varying parameter entering the objective, which can be measured at the time of decision but whose future values are unknown. We consider the case of strongly convex objective functions with Lipschitz continuous gradients under a convex constraint set. We model the algorithms as discrete-time linear parameter varying (LPV) systems in feedback with monotone operators such as the time-varying gradient. We leverage the approach of analyzing algorithms as uncertain control interconnections with integral quadratic constraints (IQCs) and generalize that framework to the time-varying case. We propose novel IQCs that are capable of capturing the behavior of time-varying nonlinearities and leverage techniques from the LPV literature to establish novel bounds on the tracking error. Quantitative bounds can be computed by solving a semi-definite program and can be interpreted as an input-to-state stability result with respect to a disturbance signal which increases with the temporal variability of the problem. As a departure from results in this research area, our bounds introduce a dependence on different additional measures of temporal variations, such as the function value and gradient rate of change. We exemplify our main results with numerical experiments that showcase how our analysis framework is able to capture convergence rates of different first-order algorithms for time-varying optimization through the choice of IQC and rate bounds.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.04043v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Estimating the state of biological specimens is challenging due to limited observation through microscopic vision. For instance, during mouse skull drilling, the appearance alters little when thinning bone tissue because of its semi-transparent property and the high-magnification microscopic vision. To obtain the object's state, we introduce an object state estimation method for biological specimens through active interaction based on the deflection. The method is integrated to enhance the autonomous drilling system developed in our previous work. The method and integrated system were evaluated through 12 autonomous eggshell drilling experiment trials. The results show that the system achieved a 91.7% successful ratio and 75% detachable ratio, showcasing its potential applicability in more complex surgical procedures such as mouse skull craniotomy. This research paves the way for further development of autonomous robotic systems capable of estimating the object's state through active interaction.</description>

      <title>Reliable Vertical Federated Learning in 5G Core Network Architecture</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.15244v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work proposes a new algorithm to mitigate model generalization loss in Vertical Federated Learning (VFL) operating under client reliability constraints within 5G Core Networks (CNs). Recently studied and endorsed by 3GPP, VFL enables collaborative and load-balanced model training and inference across the CN. However, the performance of VFL significantly degrades when the Network Data Analytics Functions (NWDAFs) - which serve as primary clients for VFL model training and inference - experience reliability issues stemming from resource constraints and operational overhead. Unlike edge environments, CN environments adopt fundamentally different data management strategies, characterized by more centralized data orchestration capabilities. This presents opportunities to implement better distributed solutions that take full advantage of the CN data handling flexibility. Leveraging this flexibility, we propose a method that optimizes the vertical feature split among clients while centrally defining their local models based on reliability metrics. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm, showing improved performance over traditional baseline methods.</description>

      <title>Autocratic strategies in Cournot oligopoly game</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.16038v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An oligopoly is a market in which the price of a goods is controlled by a few firms. Cournot introduced the simplest game-theoretic model of oligopoly, where profit-maximizing behavior of each firm results in market failure. Furthermore, when the Cournot oligopoly game is infinitely repeated, firms can tacitly collude to monopolize the market. Such tacit collusion is realized by the same mechanism as direct reciprocity in the repeated prisoner's dilemma game, where mutual cooperation can be realized whereas defection is favorable for both prisoners in one-shot game. Recently, in the repeated prisoner's dilemma game, a class of strategies called zero-determinant strategies attracts much attention in the context of direct reciprocity. Zero-determinant strategies are autocratic strategies which unilaterally control payoffs of players. There were many attempts to find zero-determinant strategies in other games and to extend them so as to apply them to broader situations. In this paper, first, we show that zero-determinant strategies exist even in the repeated Cournot oligopoly game. Especially, we prove that an averagely unbeatable zero-determinant strategy exists, which is guaranteed to obtain the average payoff of the opponents. Second, we numerically show that the averagely unbeatable zero-determinant strategy can be used to promote collusion when it is used against an adaptively learning player, whereas it cannot promote collusion when it is used against two adaptively learning players. Our findings elucidate some negative impact of zero-determinant strategies in oligopoly market.</description>

      <title>Agile, Autonomous Spacecraft Constellations with Disruption Tolerant Networking to Monitor Precipitation and Urban Floods</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.16537v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fully re-orientable small spacecraft are now supported by commercial technologies, allowing them to point their instruments in any direction and capture images, with short notice. When combined with improved onboard processing, and implemented on a constellation of inter-communicable satellites, this intelligent agility can significantly increase responsiveness to transient or evolving phenomena. We demonstrate a ground-based and onboard algorithmic framework that combines orbital mechanics, attitude control, inter-satellite communication, intelligent prediction and planning to schedule the time-varying, re-orientation of agile, small satellites in a constellation. Planner intelligence is improved by updating the predictive value of future space-time observations based on shared observations of evolving episodic precipitation and urban flood forecasts. Reliable inter-satellite communication within a fast, dynamic constellation topology is modeled in the physical, access control and network layer. We apply the framework on a representative 24-satellite constellation observing 5 global regions. Results show appropriately low latency in information exchange (average within 1/3rd available time for implicit consensus), enabling the onboard scheduler to observe ~7% more flood magnitude than a ground-based implementation. Both onboard and offline versions performed ~98% better than constellations without agility.</description>
