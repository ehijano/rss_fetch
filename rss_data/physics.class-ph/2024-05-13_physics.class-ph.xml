      <title>Acoustic Bound States in the Continuum and Exceptional Points in Coupled Helmholtz Resonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07383v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Resonant states underlie a variety of metastructures that exhibit remarkable capabilities for effective control of acoustic waves at subwavelength scales. The development of metamaterials relies on the rigorous mode engineering providing the implementation of the desired properties. At the same time, the application of metamaterials is still limited as their building blocks are frequently characterized by complicated geometry and can't be tuned easily. In this work, we consider a simple system of coupled Helmholtz resonators and study their properties associated with the tuning of coupling strength and symmetry breaking. We numerically and experimentally demonstrate the excitation of quasi-bound state in the continuum in the resonators placed in a free space and in a rectangular cavity. It is also shown that tuning the intrinsic losses via introducing porous inserts can lead to spectral splitting or merging of quasi-bound states in the continuum and occurrence of exceptional points. The obtained results will open new opportunities for the development of simple and easy-tunable metastructures based on Helmholtz resonances.</description>

      <title>Propagation-invariant strongly longitudinally polarized toroidal pulses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07706v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in optical, terahertz, and microwave systems have unveiled non-transverse optical toroidal pulses characterized by skyrmionic topologies, fractal-like singularities, space-time nonseparability, and anapole-exciting ability. Despite this, the longitudinally polarized fields of canonical toroidal pulses notably lag behind their transverse counterparts in magnitude. Interestingly, although mushroom-cloud-like toroidal vortices with strong longitudinal fields are common in nature, they remain unexplored in the realm of electromagnetics. Here, we present strongly longitudinally polarized toroidal pulses (SLPTPs) which boast a longitudinal component amplitude exceeding that of the transverse component by over tenfold. This unique polarization property endows SLPTPs with robust propagation characteristics, showcasing nondiffracting behavior. The propagation-invariant strongly longitudinally polarized field holds promise for pioneering light-matter interactions, far-field superresolution microscopy, and high-capacity wireless communication utilizing three polarizations.</description>

      <title>Attochaos I: The classically chaotic postcursor of high harmonic generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05804v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Attosecond physics provides unique insights into light-matter interaction on ultrafast time scales. Its core phenomenon, High Harmonic Generation (HHG), is often described by a classical recollision model, the simple-man or three-step model, where the atomic potential is disregarded. Many features are already well explained using this model; however, the simplicity of the model does not allow the possibility of classical chaotic motion. We show that beyond this model, classical chaotic motion does exist albeit on timescales that are generally longer than the first recollision time. Chaos is analyzed using tools from the theory of dynamical systems, such as Lyapunov exponents and stroboscopic maps. The calculations are done for a one-dimensional Coulomb potential subjected to a linearly polarized electric field.</description>

      <title>Finite frequentism explains quantum probability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12954v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: I show that frequentism, as an explanation of probability in classical statistical mechanics, can be extended in a natural way to a decoherent quantum history space, the analogue of a classical phase space. The result is a form of finite frequentism, in which the Gibbs concept of an infinite ensemble of gases is replaced by the quantum state expressed as a superposition of a finite number of decohering microstates. It is a form of finite and actual (as opposed to hypothetical) frequentism insofar as all the microstates exist, even though they may differ macroscopically, in keeping with the decoherence-based Everett interpretation of quantum mechanics.</description>
