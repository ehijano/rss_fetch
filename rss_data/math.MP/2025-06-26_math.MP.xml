      <title>Holography for bulk-boundary local topological order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19969v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In our previous article [arXiv:2307.12552], we introduced local topological order (LTO) axioms for quantum spin systems which allowed us to define a physical boundary manifested by a net of boundary algebras in one dimension lower. This gives a formal setting for topological holography, where the braided tensor category of DHR bimodules of the physical boundary algebra captures the bulk topological order.
  In this article, we extend the LTO axioms to quantum spin systems equipped with a topological boundary, again producing a physical boundary algebra for the bulk-boundary system, whose category of (topological) boundary DHR bimodules recovers the topological boundary order. We perform this analysis in explicit detail for Levin-Wen and Walker-Wang bulk-boundary systems.
  Along the way, we introduce a 2D braided categorical net of algebras built from a unitary braided fusion category (UBFC). Such nets arise as boundary algebras of Walker-Wang models. We consider the canonical state on this braided categorical net corresponding to the standard topological boundary for the Walker-Wang model. Interestingly, in this state, the cone von Neumann algebras are type I with finite dimensional centers, in contrast with the type II and III cone von Neumann algebras from the Levin-Wen models studied in [arXiv:2307.12552]. Their superselection sectors recover the underlying unitary category of our UBFC, and we conjecture the superselection category also captures the fusion and braiding.</description>

      <title>A Family of Berndt-Type Integrals and Associated Barnes Multiple Zeta Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20074v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we focus on calculating a specific class of Berndt integrals, which exclusively involves (hyperbolic) cosine functions. Initially, this integral is transformed into a Ramanujan-type hyperbolic (infinite) sum via contour integration. Subsequently, a function incorporating theta is defined. By employing the residue theorem, the mixed Ramanujan-type hyperbolic (infinite) sum with both hyperbolic cosine and hyperbolic sine in the denominator is converted into a simpler Ramanujan-type hyperbolic (infinite) sum, which contains only hyperbolic cosine or hyperbolic sine in the denominator. The simpler Ramanujan-type hyperbolic (infinite) sum is then evaluated using Jacobi elliptic functions, Fourier series expansions, and Maclaurin series expansions. Ultimately, the result is expressed as a rational polynomial of Gamma and \sqrt{pi}.Additionally, the integral is related to the Barnes multiple zeta function, which provides an alternative method for its calculation.</description>

      <title>Reflections on Rota-Baxter Lie algebras, the classical reflection equation and Poisson homogeneous spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20276v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, first we introduce the notion of reflections on quadratic Rota-Baxter Lie algebras of weight $\lambda$, and show that they give rise to solutions of the classical reflection equation for the corresponding triangular Lie bialgebra ($\lambda=0$) and factorizable Lie bialgebra ($\lambda\neq0$). Then we study reflections on relative Rota-Baxter Lie algebras, and also show that they give rise to solutions of the classical reflection equation for certain Lie bialgebras determined by the relative Rota-Baxter operators. In particular, involutive automorphisms on pre-Lie algebras and post-Lie algebras naturally lead to reflections on the induced relative Rota-Baxter Lie algebras. Finally, we derive Poisson Lie groups and Poisson homogeneous spaces from quadratic Rota-Baxter Lie algebras and relative Rota-Baxter Lie algebras.</description>

      <title>Utilization of SU(2) Symmetry for Efficient Simulation of Quantum Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19879v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work investigates variational compilation methods for simulating quantum systems with internal SU(2) symmetry. The central component of the research is the application of the Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) method to extrapolate trained variational circuit parameters beyond the initial optimization range. An approach is proposed for predicting variationally compiled quantum states with a larger number of Trotter steps using extrapolated parameters, eliminating the need for retraining. The efficiency of the method is validated by comparing it with classical Trotterization and the results of variational training.
  The proposed method demonstrates an effective integration of symmetry-consistent quantum circuit architecture with spectral prediction techniques. The methodology shows promise for scalable modeling of strongly correlated systems, particularly in condensed matter physics problems, such as the Heisenberg model on Kagome lattices.</description>

      <title>Nonabelian ferromagnets with three-body interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19916v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the thermodynamics of nonabelian ferromagnets consisting of atoms in the fundamental representation of $SU(N)$ and interacting with two-body and three-body interactions. An intricate phase structure emerges, depending on the relative strength and sign of the two-body and three-body coupling constants. In the case where two-body interactions are ferromagnetic and three-body ones are antiferromagnetic, we uncover a rich cascade of phase transitions, the appearance of phases with two distinct polarization directions being the most striking novel feature. Our results are relevant to magnetic systems where higher-body interactions cannot be neglected.</description>

      <title>A stochastic approach to time-dependent BEC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20012v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a stochastic description of the dynamics of a Bose-Einstein condensate within the context of Nelson stochastic mechanics. We start from the $N$ interacting conservative diffusions, associated with the $N$ Bose particles, and take an infinite particle limit. We address several aspects of this formulation. First, we consider the problem of extending to a system with self-interaction the variational formulation of Nelson stochastic mechanics due to Guerra and Morato. In this regard we discuss two possible extensions, one based on a doubling procedure and another based on a constraint Eulerian type variational principle. Then we consider the infinite particle limit from the point of view of the $N$-particles Madelung equations. Since conservative diffusions can be identified with proper infinitesimal characteristics pairs $(\rho_N(t), v_N(t))$, a time marginal probability density and a current velocity field, respectively, we consider a finite Madelung hierarchy for the marginals pairs $(\rho_{N,n}(t), v_{N,n}(t))$, obtained by properly conditioning the processes. The infinite Madelung hierarchy arises from the finite one by performing, for each fixed $n$, a mean-field scaling limit in $N$. Finally, we introduce a $n$-particle conditioned diffusions which naturally parallels the quantum mechanical approach and is a new approach within the context of Nelson stochastic mechanics. We then prove the convergence, in the infinite particle limit, of the law of such a conditioned process to the law of a self-interacting diffusion which describes the condensate.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.20092v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a holomorphic version of Weinstein's symplectic category, in which objects are holomorphic symplectic manifolds, and morphisms are holomorphic lagrangian correspondences. We then extend this category to log schemes, and prove that Gromov-Witten invariants of log Calabi-Yau 3-folds are naturally encoded as holomorphic lagrangian correspondences. Gromov-Witten invariants and Donaldson-Thomas invariants are then conjecturally related by a natural unitary lagrangian correspondence.</description>

      <title>Application of Chern-Simons gauge theory to the enclosed volume of constant mean curvature surfaces in the 3-sphere</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.20142v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Building on Hitchin's work of the Wess-Zumino-Witten term for harmonic maps into Lie groups, we derive a formula for the enclosed volume of a compact CMC surface $f$ in $\mathbb S^3$ in terms of a holonomy on the Chern-Simons bundle and the Willmore functional. By construction the enclosed volume only depends on the gauge classes of the associated family of flat connections of $f$. In this paper we show in various examples the effectiveness of this formula, in particular for surfaces of genus $g\geq2.$</description>

      <title>Synchronization of Dirac-Bianconi driven oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20163v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In dynamical systems on networks, one assigns the dynamics to nodes, which are then coupled via links. This approach does not account for group interactions and dynamics on links and other higher dimensional structures. Higher-order network theory addresses this by considering variables defined on nodes, links, triangles, and higher-order simplices, called topological signals (or cochains). Moreover, topological signals of different dimensions can interact through the Dirac-Bianconi operator, which allows coupling between topological signals defined, for example, on nodes and links. Such interactions can induce various dynamical behaviors, for example, periodic oscillations. The oscillating system consists of topological signals on nodes and links whose dynamics are driven by the Dirac-Bianconi coupling, hence, which we call it Dirac-Bianconi driven oscillator. Using the phase reduction method, we obtain a phase description of this system and apply it to the study of synchronization between two such oscillators. This approach offers a way to analyze oscillatory behaviors in higher-order networks beyond the node-based paradigm, while providing a ductile modeling tool for node- and edge-signals.</description>

      <title>Lack-of-fit reduction in the path-integral formalism</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.20242v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a reformulation of the lack-of-fit reduction in non-equilibrium thermodynamics using the path-integral formalism. The reformulation is based on the Onsager-Machlup variational principle, and it allows us to minimize the action while keeping only thermodynamically relevant solutions. The reduced evolution consists of a Hamiltonian vector field and a gradient flow. The reformulation is illustrated on the Kac-Zwanzig model, where we show how irreversibility emerges from purely Hamiltonian evolution by ignoring some degrees of freedom. We also show how to generalize the Fisher information matrix and Kullback-Leibler divergence between two probability distributions to the case when the two distributions are related by the principle of maximum entropy, even in the case when the entropy is not of Boltzmann-Gibbs type (for instance Tsallis-Havrda-Charvat).</description>

      <title>Emergent Lorentzian Geometries from Spin-Foams and Group Field Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20340v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The emergence of Lorentzian geometries in spin-foams and group field theories is investigated. The spectral dimension of periodic Euclidean spin-foam frusta is studied. At large scales, the spectral dimension is generically four. At lower scales, a non-trivial flow of the spectral dimension is observed, sensitive to quantum effects, curvature induced oscillations and the parameters of the theory. The removal of numerical cutoffs and a thermodynamic limit is discussed, suggesting a phase transition from zero to four large-scale dimensions. Lorentzian Regge calculus for (3+1) cosmology, modelled with Lorentzian 4-frusta, coupled to a massless free scalar field is studied. It is shown that causal regularity, solutions to the Regge equations and a continuum limit only exist if the cells connecting neighboring slices are timelike. The dynamics can be expressed relationally only in the small deficit angle limit. Effective (2+1) spin-foam cosmology with a minimally coupled massive scalar field is investigated. The scalar field mass is shown to ensure convergence of the path integral. The classicality of expectation values is shown to be intimately connected to causal regularity and the path integral measure. A causal completion of the Barrett-Crane group field theory model is developed. Its amplitudes are explicitly computed in spin representation using methods from integral geometry. A Landau-Ginzburg analysis is applied to the complete Barrett-Crane (BC) group field theory model. It is shown that mean-field theory is generically self-consistent, and that timelike faces do not contribute to the critical behavior. Employing the complete BC model, a physical Lorentzian reference frame is coupled, and scalar cosmological perturbations are extracted from entangled GFT coherent states. The dynamics of these perturbations are shown to agree with classical results up to quantum corrections.</description>

      <title>The Chern character of the Laughlin vector bundle in the Fractional Quantum Hall Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20363v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We begin by explaining how a physical problem of studying the quantum Hall effect on a closed surface $C$ leads, via Laughlin's approach, to a mathematical question of describing the rank and the first Chern class of a particular vector bundle on the Picard group ${\rm Pic}^g(C)$. Then we formulate and solve the problem mathematically, proving several important conjectures made by physicists, in particular the Wen-Niu topological degeneracy conjecture and the Wen-Zee shift formula.
  Let $C$ be a closed Riemann surface of genus~$g$ and $S^NC$ its $N$th symmetric power. The product $C \times {\rm Pic}^d(C)$ carries a universal line bundle. On the product $C^N \times {\rm Pic}^d(C)$ we consider the product of $N$ pull-backs of this universal line bundle and twist it by a power of the diagonal on $C^N$. The resulting line bundle descends onto $S^NC \times {\rm Pic}^d(C)$. Its push-forward (as a sheaf) to ${\rm Pic}^d(C)$ is a vector bundle that we call Laughlin's vector bundle. We determine all the Chern characters of the Laughlin vector bundle via a Grothendieck-Riemann-Roch calculation.</description>

      <title>Confining kinks. $\zeta$-regularized one-loop kink mass shifts in exotic field theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20440v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By combining stability analysis of scalar field theories with the Darboux transformation technique, we create models featuring kink-like solutions whose quantum perturbations are all bounded. On the one hand, the stability analysis relates scalar theories with Schr\"odinger equations, whose solutions serve as quantum perturbation modes. On the other hand, the Darboux transformation allows for constructing new exotic but solvable Schr\"odinger equations. This framework relates the quantum harmonic oscillator and its rational deformations to exotic scalar theories featuring non-trivial potentials. Depending on the structure of the spectrum of perturbation frequencies, these potentials may have various local maximums, minimums, and inflection points. The stationary solutions take the form of the definite integral over a finite interval of a function times the Gaussian bell distribution, including the Error and the Owen $T$ functions. Such models do not propagate quantum perturbations around the respective vacuums, so zero-point renormalization does not take place. However, Riemann$-\zeta$ function regularization allows us to achieve finite one-loop quantum corrections to the classical mass.</description>

      <title>Quantum Framework for Simulating Linear PDEs with Robin Boundary Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20478v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose an explicit, oracle-free quantum framework for numerically simulating general linear partial differential equations (PDEs) that extends previous work \cite{guseynov2024efficientPDE} to also encompass (a) Robin boundary conditions (which includes Neumann and Dirichlet boundary conditions as special cases), (b) inhomogeneous terms, and (c) variable coefficients in space and time. Our approach begins with a general finite-difference discretization and applies the Schrodingerisation technique to transform the resulting system into one satisfying unitary quantum evolution so quantum simulation can be applied.
  For the Schrodinger equation corresponding to the discretized PDE, we construct an efficient block-encoding of $H$, scaling polylogarithmically with the number of grid points $N$. This object is compatible with quantum signal processing, to create the evolution operator $e^{-iHt}$. The oracle-free nature of our method allows us to count complexity in more fundamental units (C-NOTs and one-qubit rotations), bypassing the inefficiencies of oracle queries. Thus, the overall algorithm scales polynomially with $N$ and linearly with spatial dimension $d$, offering a polynomial speedup in $N$ and an exponential advantage in $d$, alleviating the classical curse of dimensionality. The correctness and efficiency of the proposed approach are further supported by numerical simulations.
  By explicitly defining the quantum operations and their resource requirements, our approach stands as a practical solution for solving PDEs, distinct from others that rely on oracle queries and purely asymptotic scaling methods.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20517v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a method to compute the minimal form factors of diagonal integrable field theories perturbed by generalized $T \bar{T}$ perturbations. Building on existing results by the same authors, these MFFs are constructed in such a way as not to allow for any free parameters, an issue that plagued previous solutions. The MFFs are derived from a generalization of the standard integral representation which has been used since the birth of the form factor bootstrap program. Their asymptotics is characterized by exponential decay at large rapidities. By computing higher particle form factors, we find that any natural higher-particle solutions involve the cancellation of parts of the newly found MFF. We conclude that the assumption that the form factor equations, particularly the kinematic residue equation, remain unchanged in the presence of $T \bar{T}$ perturbations, is too strong. There is a trade-off between having MFFs satisfying desirable analyticity and asymptotic properties and finding analytic solutions to the form factor equations, which is likely solved by nontrivial changes to the form factor equations, especially those where locality or semilocality of fields are essential assumptions.</description>

      <title>Reflection positivity in Euclidean formulations of relativistic quantum mechanics of particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20526v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper discusses the general structure of reflection positive Euclidean covariant distributions that can be used to construct Euclidean representations of relativistic quantum mechanical models of systems of a finite number of degrees of freedom. Because quantum systems of a finite number of degrees of freedom are not local, reflection positivity is not as restrictive as it is in a local field theory. The motivation for the Euclidean approach is that it is straightforward to construct exactly Poincar\'e invariant quantum models of finite number of degrees of freedom systems that satisfy cluster properties and a spectral condition. In addition the quantum mechanical inner product can be computed without requiring an analytic continuation. Whether these distributions can be generated by a dynamical principle remains to be determined, but understanding the general structure of the Euclidean covariant distributions is an important first step.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous symplectic reduction of quadratic forms into normal forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01492v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A fundamental result in symplectic linear algebra states that for a given positive semi-definite quadratic form on a symplectic space there exists a symplectic basis in which the quadratic form reduces to a normal form. The special case of the aforementioned result for positive definite quadratic forms is known as Williamson's theorem. In this work, we establish necessary and sufficient conditions on positive semi-definite quadratic forms on a symplectic space to be simultaneously reduced to their normal forms in a common symplectic basis. In particular, we establish conditions on $2n \times 2n$ real symmetric positive definite matrices to be simultaneously diagonalizable by a symplectic matrix in the sense of Williamson's theorem. We also discuss some applications of the main result in quantum information theory and statistical thermodynamics.</description>

Abstract: From a given Fokker-Planck equation, a multi-parameter deformed partner Fokker-Planck equation is constructed. This is done by first deleting a set of eigenstates of the original FPE by the multi-step Darboux-Crum transformation, and then reinstating the eigen-energy levels by the reverse Darboux-Crum transformation. Extension to fractional Fokker-Planck equation is briefly discussed. A recent study of the one-parameter isospectral FPE applied to black hole in the thermal potential approach is commented.</description>

Abstract: It has been established that solutions to the inviscid Proudman-Johnson equation subject to a homogeneous three-point boundary condition can develop singularities in finite time. In this paper, we consider the possibility of singularity formation in solutions of the generalized, inviscid Proudman-Johnson equation with damping subject to the same homogeneous three-point boundary condition. In particular, we derive conditions the initial data must satisfy in order for solutions to blowup in finite time with either bounded or unbounded smooth damping term.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2207.14025v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inspired by the small sphere-limit for quasi-local energy we study local foliations of surfaces with prescribed mean curvature. Following the strategy used by Ye in 1991 to study local constant mean curvature foliations, we use a Lyapunov Schmidt reduction in an n+1 dimensional manifold equipped with a symmetric 2-tensor to construct the foliations around a point, prove their uniqueness and show their nonexistence conditions. To be specific, we study two foliation conditions. First we consider constant space-time mean curvature surfaces. These foliations were used by Cederbaum and Sakovich to characterize the center of mass in general relativity. Second, we study local foliations of constant expansion surfaces.</description>

      <title>Local foliations by critical surfaces of the Hawking energy and small sphere limit</title>

      <description>arXiv:2209.04904v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Local foliations of area constrained Willmore surfaces on a 3-dimensional Riemannian manifold were constructed by Lamm, Metzger and Schulze, and Ikoma, Machiodi and Mondino, the leaves of these foliations are, in particular, critical surfaces of the Hawking energy in case they are contained in a totally geodesic spacelike hypersurface. We generalize these foliations to the general case of a non-totally geodesic spacelike hypersurface, constructing a unique local foliation of area constrained critical surfaces of the Hawking energy. A discrepancy when evaluating the so called small sphere limit of the Hawking energy was found by Friedrich. He studied concentrations of area constrained critical surfaces of the Hawking energy and obtained a result that apparently differs from the well established small sphere limit of the Hawking energy of Horowitz and Schmidt, this small sphere limit in principle must be satisfied by any quasi local energy. We independently confirm the discrepancy and explain the reasons for it to happen. We also prove that these surfaces are suitable to evaluate the Hawking energy in the sense of Lamm, Metzger and Schulze, and we find an indication that these surfaces may induce an excess in the energy measured.</description>

Abstract: This paper deals with quasi-local isoperimetric versions of the positive mass theorem on $3$-manifolds endowed with continuous complete metrics having nonnegative scalar curvature in a suitable weak sense. As a corollary, we derive existence results for isoperimetric sets in such low regularity setting. Our main tool is a new local version of the weak inverse mean curvature flow enjoying $C^0$-stable quantitative estimates.</description>

      <title>Quantum obesity and steering ellipsoids for fermionic fields in dilaton black hole</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06869v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates quantum obesity (QO), quantum discord (QD), and the quantum steering ellipsoid (QSE) for bipartite Gisin states subjected to Garfinkle-Horowitz-Strominger (GHS) dilation of spacetime on the second qubit. These three quantifiers are introduced to characterize quantum correlations beyond entanglement and can also function as entanglement witnesses. Our results demonstrate a monotonic decrease in the physical accessibility of both QD and QO as the dilation parameter increases within the region-I of the second qubit. Conversely, in the anti-particle region, the accessibility of QD and QO stabilizes at finite values of the dilation parameter owing to the influence of the Pauli exclusion principle and Fermi-Dirac statistics, subsequently increasing gradually. Notably, the QSE in the region-I expands as the Dirac field frequency rises and the dilation parameter diminishes, while the opposite trend is observed in the anti-particle region.</description>

      <title>Quantum tunneling driven by quintessence and the role of GUP</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15711v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we studied quantum tunneling of massless and massive particles pertaining to a Schwarzschild black hole in a quintessence background, and explored the consequences emerging from a generalized uncertainty principle (GUP). For the quintessence scenario, we considered two specific cases of $w$, which is the ratio of the pressure and energy density, namely $w=-1/3$ and $w=-2/3$. For the GUP, we used a modified Schwarzschild metric and employed a unique choice of contour integration to compute the tunneling amplitudes. An analysis and comparative study of the respective temperature profiles has been made. The energy emission rate has also been analysed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19219v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide a detailed decomposition of Wigner's particles, defined as unitary irreducible representations of the Poincar\'e group, in terms of unitary representations of its Lorentz subgroup. As pointed out before us, this decomposition only involves Lorentz representations belonging to the principal continuous series, and further underpins the connection between scattering amplitudes and conformal correlation functions discussed in the context of celestial holography. We provide very explicit formulae for the decomposition of particles of arbitrary mass and (half-)integer spin and for any spacetime dimension. We emphasise that this decomposition is unique and comes with a specific inner product on the corresponding Hilbert space. We also confirm that unitary translations mix Lorentz representations within the principal continuous series only, as required. Implications to the celestial holography program are indicated.</description>

      <title>Characterizing phase transitions and criticality in non-Hermitian extensions of the XY model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13654v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work we study non-Hermitian extensions of the paradigmatic spin-1/2 XY chain in a magnetic field. Using the mapping of the model to free fermion form, we provide analytical insights into the energy spectrum of the non-Hermitian model and establish an intrinsic connection between the quasienergies and topological invariants. We also use exact diagonalization as a supplementary method to examine the performance of biorthogonal-based expectation values. Our results confirm that the theoretical analysis is consistent with the numerical results, with the extended phase diagram determined via the analytical solution and the critical behavior of the fidelity and entanglement. The entanglement transition goes hand in hand with the non-Hermitian topological phase transition. Like the Hermitian case, we analyze the critical behavior using finite-size scaling. Our results show that non-Hermiticity can induce the system into a new universality class with unusual critical exponent. We also emphasize the ability of the Loschmidt echo to characterize potential phase transitions and introduce the average of the Loschmidt echo to describe phase transitions in non-Hermitian systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.12644v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We continue our work [arXiv:2403.07628] on asymptotic expansions at the soft edge for the classical $n$-dimensional Gaussian and Laguerre random matrix ensembles. By revisiting the construction of the associated skew-orthogonal polynomials in terms of wave functions, we obtain concise expressions for the level densities that are well suited for proving asymptotic expansions in powers of a certain parameter $h \asymp n^{-2/3}$. In the unitary case, the expansion for the level density can be used to reconstruct the first correction term in an established asymptotic expansion of the associated generating function. In the orthogonal and symplectic cases, we can even reconstruct the conjectured first and second correction terms.</description>

      <title>A Proof of the Hodge Conjecture for a Special Class of Calabi-Yau 5-Folds via Exceptional Group Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17754v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper provides a complete proof of the (1,1)-type Hodge conjecture for a special class of 5-dimensional Calabi-Yau manifolds ($h^{1,1}=56$), while establishing and implementing a novel methodology based on exceptional group constraints. The core idea of this methodology is to replace the "geometric construction" that traditional methods rely on -- which becomes infeasible in high-dimensional cases -- with the "algebraic rigidity" of Lie algebra representation theory. We prove that by introducing the symmetry of the $E_7$ group, we can generate a "dimension tension" in the Spencer cohomology framework we developed, which forcibly makes the dimension of the Spencer kernel precisely match the Hodge numbers of the manifold, thereby bypassing concrete algebraic geometric calculations. This dimension matching result is a key step in satisfying the "Spencer-Hodge verification criterion" we previously established. Its completion not only solves a non-trivial special case of the Hodge conjecture, but more importantly, provides the first strong evidence for this new paradigm of connecting representation theory with Hodge theory to solve core problems in algebraic geometry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.18338v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Genus 2 Macdonald polynomials $\Psi^{(q,t)}_{j_1,j_2,j_3}$ generalize ordinary Macdonald polynomials in several aspects. First, they provide common eigenfunctions for commuting difference operators that generalize the Macdonald difference operators of type $A_1$. Second, the algebra generated by these difference operators together with multiplication operators admits an action of genus 2 mapping class group (MCG) that generalizes the well-known action of $SL(2,{\mathbb Z})$ for ordinary Macdonald polynomials. In this paper, one more important aspect of Macdonald theory is considered: the Cauchy identities. We construct a genus 2 generalization of Cauchy identities in the particular case when $t=q=1$, i.e. for genus 2 Schur polynomials.</description>

      <title>Universal inverse Radon transforms: Complexity of Radon transforms and the hybrid functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18911v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For the reconstruction problem, the universal representation of inverse Radon transforms may imply the needed complexity of the direct Radon transforms which leads to the additional contributions. Meanwhile, in the standard theory of generalized functions, if the origin function which generates the Radon image is a pure-real function, as a rule the complexity of Radon transform becomes in question. In the letter, we demonstrate that the Fourier method together with the hybrid (Wigner-like) function ensure naturally the corresponding complexity. In its turn, this complexity provides not only the additional contribution to the inverse Radon transforms, but also it makes an essential impact on the reconstruction and optimization procedures within the frame of the incorrect problems. The presented method can be effectively used for the practical tasks of reconstruction problems.</description>
