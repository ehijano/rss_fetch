      <title>On the Complexity of the Conditional Independence Implication Problem With Bounded Cardinalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02550v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the conditional independence (CI) implication problem with bounded cardinalities, which asks whether a given CI implication holds for all discrete random variables with given cardinalities, is co-NEXPTIME-hard. The problem remains co-NEXPTIME-hard if all variables are binary. The reduction goes from a variant of the tiling problem and is based on a prior construction used by Cheuk Ting Li to show the undecidability of a related problem where the cardinality of some variables remains unbounded. The CI implication problem with bounded cardinalities is known to be in EXPSPACE, as its negation can be stated as an existential first-order logic formula over the reals of size exponential with regard to the size of the input.</description>

      <title>Undecidability of Translational Tiling of the 3-dimensional Space with a Set of 6 Polycubes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02196v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper focuses on the undecidability of translational tiling of $n$-dimensional space $\mathbb{Z}^n$ with a set of $k$ tiles. It is known that tiling $\mathbb{Z}^2$ with translated copies with a set of $8$ tiles is undecidable. Greenfeld and Tao gave strong evidence in a series of works that for sufficiently large dimension $n$, the translational tiling problem for $\mathbb{Z}^n$ might be undecidable for just one tile. This paper shows the undecidability of translational tiling of $\mathbb{Z}^3$ with a set of $6$ tiles.</description>

      <title>Backward explanations via redefinition of predicates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02606v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: History eXplanation based on Predicates (HXP), studies the behavior of a Reinforcement Learning (RL) agent in a sequence of agent's interactions with the environment (a history), through the prism of an arbitrary predicate. To this end, an action importance score is computed for each action in the history. The explanation consists in displaying the most important actions to the user. As the calculation of an action's importance is #W[1]-hard, it is necessary for long histories to approximate the scores, at the expense of their quality. We therefore propose a new HXP method, called Backward-HXP, to provide explanations for these histories without having to approximate scores. Experiments show the ability of B-HXP to summarise long histories.</description>

      <title>The Complexity of Resilience Problems via Valued Constraint Satisfaction Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.15654v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Valued constraint satisfaction problems (VCSPs) constitute a large class of computational optimisation problems. It was shown recently that, over finite domains, every VCSP is in P or NP-complete, depending on the admitted cost functions. In this article, we study cost functions over countably infinite domains whose automorphisms form an oligomorphic permutation group. Our results include a hardness condition based on a generalisation of pp-constructability as known from classical CSPs and a polynomial-time tractability condition based on the concept of fractional polymorphisms. We then observe that the resilience problem for unions of conjunctive queries (UCQs) studied in database theory, under bag semantics, may be viewed as a special case of the VCSPs that we consider. We obtain a complexity dichotomy for the case of incidence-acyclic UCQs and exemplarily use our methods to determine the complexity of a query that had remained open in the literature. Further, we conjecture that our hardness and tractability conditions match for resilience problems for UCQs.</description>

      <title>Orbit-blocking words and the average-case complexity of Whitehead's problem in the free group of rank 2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12322v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let F_2 denote the free group of rank 2. Our main technical result of independent interest is: for any element u of F_2, there is g in F_2 such that no cyclically reduced image of u under an automorphism of F_2 contains g as a subword. We then address computational complexity of the following version of the Whitehead automorphism problem: given a fixed u in F_2, decide, on an input v in F_2 of length n, whether or not v is an automorphic image of u. We show that there is an algorithm that solves this problem and has constant (i.e., independent of n) average-case complexity.</description>

      <title>Learnability of Parameter-Bounded Bayes Nets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00927v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bayes nets are extensively used in practice to efficiently represent joint probability distributions over a set of random variables and capture dependency relations. In a seminal paper, Chickering et al. (JMLR 2004) showed that given a distribution $\mathbb{P}$, that is defined as the marginal distribution of a Bayes net, it is $\mathsf{NP}$-hard to decide whether there is a parameter-bounded Bayes net that represents $\mathbb{P}$. They called this problem LEARN. In this work, we extend the $\mathsf{NP}$-hardness result of LEARN and prove the $\mathsf{NP}$-hardness of a promise search variant of LEARN, whereby the Bayes net in question is guaranteed to exist and one is asked to find such a Bayes net. We complement our hardness result with a positive result about the sample complexity that is sufficient to recover a parameter-bounded Bayes net that is close (in TV distance) to a given distribution $\mathbb{P}$, that is represented by some parameter-bounded Bayes net, generalizing a degree-bounded sample complexity result of Brustle et al. (EC 2020).</description>
