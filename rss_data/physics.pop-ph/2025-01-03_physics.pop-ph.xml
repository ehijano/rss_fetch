      <title>Morphogenesis of cheese flowers through scraping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00797v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The "Tete de moine" Swiss cheese is generally served by scraping the surface of a cylindrical loaf with a sharp tool. This produces thin sheets of cheese that are strongly wrinkled at the edge, resembling frilly flowers and enhancing the tasting experience. In this work we unveil the physical mechanisms at play in this scraping-induced morphogenesis. We measure the deformation of the cheese during scraping and show that plastic deformation occurs everywhere, but find a larger plastic contraction in the inner part of the flower, causing its buckling into shape. We show that it surprisingly derives from the lower friction coefficient evidenced on the cheese close to its crust. Our analysis provides the tools for a better control of chip morphogenesis through plasticity in the shaping of other delicacies, but also in metal cutting.</description>

      <title>Science of a coffee cup: a physicist walks into a bar...</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01180v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: ... and annoys everyone with unsolicited experiments. The present paper proposes a short pedagogical review of the various phenomena that can be observed in a coffee cup with little to no equipment. The physical domains spanned include acoustics, optics and, of course, fluid mechanics. The variety of experimental and theoretical techniques introduced throughout the paper makes it suitable for a broad audience. For each topic, we first propose an experimental realization before introducing a minimal model to explain the observations. We end each section by discussing more advanced works existing in the literature as well as related applications. We provide detailed experimental procedures and videos of the experiments that can be freely used for teaching purposes. The phenomena presented here also show remarkable efficiency as icebreakers for morning coffee in laboratories or conferences.</description>

      <title>Two Egyptian Kings, Shepseskaf and Userkaf, and a solar eclipse (2471 BC)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20407v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, arXiv published a work by G. Magli about the eclipse of 1 April 2471 BC and a supposed influence of it on the end of the fourth Egyptian dynasty and the beginning of the fifth one. In Magli's arXiv/2412.13640 paper, the eclipse is defined as the 'Shepseskaf eclipse'. Magli considers that this eclipse happened during the reign of the 'last ruler of the 4th dynasty, Shepseskaf'. Some literature is giving the name of further members of this dynasty. Therefore, here we add some references, besides those given in arXiv. We will show that, in this literature, the same eclipse of 2471 BC is linked to king Userkaf of the fifth dynasty. Some observations about chronological data proposed by Magli are also necessary. Since in arxiv/2412.13640 paper we find mentioned by Magli the pyramid of Cheops (that is Akhet Khufu, a name which is generally translated as the Khufu's horizon) and the symbol of the 'solarized' horizon, N27 of the Gardiner's list, it is necessary to stress that the word Akhet was written with the crested ibis, G25, as clearly shown by the Wadi al-Jarf papyri, which are contemporary to Khufu's reign. Mark Lehner, 2001, recognizing a translation problem, rendered Akhet Khufu as the 'Spirit of Khufu'. The use of the crested ibis, in a locution translated as 'dwellers of the horizon' is attested in a Pepi II letter to his vizier Herkhuf, then three centuries after Khufu.</description>
