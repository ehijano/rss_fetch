      <title>Spin-Orbital-Lattice Coupling and the Phonon Zeeman Effect in the Dirac Honeycomb Magnet CoTiO$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The entanglement of electronic spin and orbital degrees of freedom is often the precursor to emergent behaviors in condensed matter systems. With considerable spin-orbit coupling strength, the cobalt atom on a honeycomb lattice offers a platform that can make accessible the study of novel magnetic ground states. Using temperature-dependent Raman spectroscopy and high-magnetic field Raman and infrared (IR) spectroscopy, we studied the lattice and spin-orbital excitations in CoTiO$_3$, an antiferromagnetic material that exhibits topologically protected magnon Dirac crossings in the Brillouin zone. Under the application of an external magnetic field up to 22 T along the crystal's $c$-axis, we observed the splitting of both the spin-orbital excitations and a phonon nearby in energy. Using density functional theory (DFT), we identify a number of new modes that below the antiferromagnetic (AFM) transition become Raman-active due to the zone-folding of the Brillouin zone caused by the doubling of the magnetic unit cell. We use a model that includes both the spin and orbital degrees of freedom of the Co$^{2+}$ ions to explain the spin-orbital excitation energies and their behavior in an applied field. Our experimental observations along with several deviations from the model behavior point to significant coupling between the spin-orbital and the lattice excitations.</description>

      <title>YbNi$_4$Mg: Superheavy fermion with enhanced Wilson ratio and magnetocaloric effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08043v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A comprehensive study of the low-temperature properties of YbNi$_4$Mg has revealed evidence of a superheavy-fermion state, characterized by a large electronic specific-heat coefficient $\gamma_0$ $\approx$ 5.65 J mol$^{-1}$ K$^{-2}$ and an elevated Wilson ratio $R_W$ = 32.1. No magnetic ordering was observed down to 70 mK; however, a broad maximum appears in the specific heat at $T^*$ = 0.3 K, along with a shoulder in the derivative of susceptibility d$\chi$/d$T$ and resistivity d$\rho$/d$T$. These features indicate a cooperative yet short-ranged magnetism entwined with the superheavy Fermi liquid. The large Wilson ratio, which is also detected in other superheavy-fermion compounds lacking long-range order, might be a signature of residual spin fluctuations. Applying a weak magnetic field of $\sim$0.1 T induces a metamagnetic-like crossover, as demonstrated by the quasi-adiabatic demagnetization measurements showing a broad minimum in the temperature-field trace. Here, an enhanced magnetocaloric cooling effect stemming from the field-sensitive superheavy-fermion state is observed, rivaling that of the well-established insulating magnetic coolants like the rare-earth garnet Gd$_3$Ga$_5$O$_{12}$.</description>

      <title>Persistent Haldane Phase in Carbon Tetris Chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08252v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the concept of "tetris chains", which are linear arrays of 4-site molecules that differ by their intermolecular hopping geometry. We investigate the fermionic symmetry-protected topological Haldane phase in these systems using Hubbard-type models. The topological phase diagrams can be understood via different competing limits and mechanisms: strong-coupling $U\gg t$, weak-coupling $U\ll t$, and the weak intermolecular hopping limit $t'\ll t$. Our particular focus is on two tetris chains that are of experimental relevance. First, we show that a "Y-chain" of coarse-grained nanographene molecules (triangulenes) is robustly in the Haldane phase in the whole $t'-U$ plane due to the cooperative nature of the three limits. Secondly, we study a near-homogeneous "Y$^{\prime}$-chain" that is closely related to the electronic model for poly(p-phenylene vinylene). In the latter case, the above mechanisms compete, but the Haldane phase manifests robustly and is stable when long-ranged Pariser-Parr-Popple interactions are added. The site-edged Hubbard ladder can also be viewed as a tetris chain, which gives a very general perspective on the emergence of its fermionic Haldane phase. Our numerical results are obtained by large-scale, SU(2)-symmetric tensor network calculations. We employ the density-matrix-renormalization group as well as the variational uniform matrix-product state (VUMPS) algorithms for finite and infinite systems, respectively. The numerics are supplemented by analytical calculations of the bandstructure winding number.</description>

      <title>Simplex tensor network renormalization group for boundary theory of 3+1D symTFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Following the construction in arXiv:2210.12127, we develop a symmetry-preserving renormalization group (RG) flow for 3D symmetric theories. These theories are expressed as boundary conditions of a symTFT, which in our case is a 3+1D Dijkgraaf-Witten topological theory in the bulk. The boundary is geometrically organized into tetrahedra and represented as a tensor network, which we refer to as the "simplex tensor network" state. Each simplex tensor is assigned indices corresponding to its vertices, edges, and faces. We propose a numerical algorithm to implement RG flows for these boundary conditions, and explicitly demonstrate its application to a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetric theory. By linearly interpolating between three topological fixed-point boundaries, we map the phase transitions characterized by local and non-local order parameters, which respectively detects the breaking of a 0-form and a 2-form symmetry. This formalism is readily extendable to other discrete symmetry groups and, in principle, can be generalized to describe 3D symmetric topological orders.</description>

      <title>Conformal maps and edge mode attenuation on imperfect boundaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08518v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We developed a conformal map technique to analyze the attenuation of edge modes propagating along imperfect boundaries. In systems where the potential energy exhibits conformal invariance, the conformal transformation can straighten the boundary, simplifying the boundary conditions. Using the example of edge modes in a simple field-theoretical model, we examined scattering into the bulk and identified conditions that ensure the robustness of edge modes against damping. This technique has the potential to be applied to other edge-mode problems in 2+1 dimensions.</description>

      <title>Engineering Majorana Kramers Pairs In Synthetic High Spin Chern Insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High spin-Chern-number topological phases provide a promising low-dimensional platform for realizing double-helical edge states. In this letter, we show how these edge states can host a variety of phases driven by electron interaction effects, including multi-channel helical Luttinger liquid, spin density wave, superconducting phases, and a new type of $\pi$-junction analog of the latter two, where the transitions between the phases can be controlled. The superconducting phase in the interacting system is shown to be adiabatically connected to a time-reversal-symmetric topological superconductor in the non-interacting DIII class. This connection stabilizes Majorana Kramers pairs as domain wall states at the interface between the superconducting and $\pi$-spin-density wave phases, with the latter exhibiting a time-reversal-symmetric spin-density wave phase. We discuss the possibility of realizing our proposed scheme for generating Majorana Kramers pairs in a cold-atom based platform with existing techniques, and how it could offer potential advantages over other approaches.</description>

      <title>Boundary transitions from a single round of measurements on gapless quantum states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07830v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Measurements can qualitatively alter correlations and entanglement emerging in gapless quantum matter. We show how a single round of measurements on gapless quantum systems can, upon rotating the measurement basis, induce non-trivial transitions separating regimes displaying universal characteristics governed by distinct boundary conformal field theories. We develop the theory of such `measurement-induced boundary transitions' by investigating a gapless parent of the one-dimensional cluster state, obtained by appropriately symmetrizing a commuting projector Hamiltonian for the latter. Projective measurements on the cluster state are known to convert the wavefunction, after post-selection or decoding, into a long-range-ordered Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state. Similar measurements applied to the gapless parent (i) generate long-range order coexisting with power-law correlations when post-selecting for uniform outcomes, and (ii) yield power-law correlations distinct from those in the pre-measurement state upon decoding. In the post-selection scenario, rotating the measurement basis preserves long-range order up until a critical tilt angle marking a measurement-induced boundary transition to a power-law-ordered regime. Such a transition -- which does not exist in the descendant cluster state -- establishes new connections between measurement effects on many-body states and non-trivial renormalization-group flows. We extend our analysis to tricritical Ising and three-state Potts critical theories, which also display measurement-induced boundary transitions, and propose general criteria for their existence in other settings.</description>

      <title>Coarse-grained Bootstrap of Quantum Many-body Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.07837v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a new computational framework combining coarse-graining techniques with bootstrap methods to study quantum many-body systems. The method efficiently computes rigorous upper and lower bounds on both zero- and finite-temperature expectation values of any local observables of infinite quantum spin chains. This is achieved by using tensor networks to coarse-grain bootstrap constraints, including positivity, translation invariance, equations of motion, and energy-entropy balance inequalities. Coarse-graining allows access to constraints from significantly larger subsystems than previously possible, yielding substantially tighter bounds compared to earlier methods.</description>

      <title>Numerical evidence for the non-Abelian eigenstate thermalization hypothesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07838v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH) explains how generic quantum many-body systems thermalize internally. It implies that local operators' time-averaged expectation values approximately equal their thermal expectation values, regardless of microscopic details. The ETH's range of applicability therefore impacts theory and experiments. Murthy $\textit{et al.}$ recently showed that non-Abelian symmetries conflict with the ETH. Such symmetries have excited interest in quantum thermodynamics lately, as they are equivalent to conserved quantities that fail to commute with each other and noncommutation is a quintessentially quantum phenomenon. Murthy $\textit{et al.}$ proposed a non-Abelian ETH, which we support numerically. The numerics model a one-dimensional (1D) next-nearest-neighbor Heisenberg chain of up to 18 qubits. We represent local operators with matrices relative to an energy eigenbasis. The matrices bear out seven predictions of the non-Abelian ETH. We also prove analytically that the non-Abelian ETH exhibits a self-consistency property. The proof relies on a thermodynamic-entropy definition different from that in Murthy $\textit{et al.}$ This work initiates the observation and application of the non-Abelian ETH.</description>

Abstract: We present a density matrix renormalization group(DMRG) study of a generalized Hubbard chain describing effective spin S=3/2 fermions in an optical lattice.We determine the full phase diagram for the SU(4) symmetric case, and in the presence of single-ion anisotropy in terms of density and polarization.We investigate the stability and competition between different orders, such as quintet Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov(FFLO) pairing, trion and quartet formation, and spin and atomic density waves.Notably, near half-filling, single-ion anisotropy stabilizes a correlated phase that can be understood in terms of a generalized S=2 bosonic t-J chain.</description>

      <title>Topological columnar nano-SQUID based on a 3D topological insulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07993v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A 3D topological insulator (TI) is wrapped by a metallic surface that is topologically protected. While this surface is promising for generating non-Abelian Majorana zero-modes (MZMs) for topological quantum computing, it is a challenge to gap out the whole surface to get rid of low-energy quasiparticles to realize a well-defined fermion parity. Here we propose a novel TI platform that solves this problem and gives rise to a robust topological phase. It consists of a bulk-insulating rectangular TI nanowire laterally sandwiched by two superconductors. In this structure, the top and bottom surfaces individually work as SNS line junctions, forming a nanometer-scale columnar SQUID in which the nanowire cross-section defines the threading flux $\Phi$. We demonstrate that a TI device of this structure indeed presents SQUID-type oscillations of the critical current $I_c$ as a function of the axial magnetic field with period $\Phi_{0}^s=\frac{h}{2e}$ and can be tuned by a back gate to attain vanishing $I_c$ minima, an indication that the supercurrent is completely surface-dominated. Our theory shows that, when the two junctions are asymmetric, a robust topological phase hosting MZMs occurs periodically for $(n-\frac{1}{2})\Phi_{0}^s &lt; \Phi &lt; (n+\frac{1}{2})\Phi_{0}^s$ with odd-integer $n$.</description>

      <title>Room Temperature Strong Orbital Moments in Perpendicularly Magnetized Magnetic Insulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08448v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The balance between the orbital and spin magnetic moments in a magnetic system is the heart of many intriguing phenomena. Here, we show experimental evidence of a large orbital moment, which competes with its spin counterpart in a ferrimagnetic insulator thulium iron garnet, Tm3Fe5O12. Leveraging element-specific X-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD), we establish that the dominant contribution to the orbital moment originates from 4f orbitals of Tm. Besides the large Tm orbital moment, intriguingly, our results also reveal a smaller but evident non-zero XMCD signal in the O K edge, suggesting additional spin-orbit coupling and exchange interactions with the nearest neighbour Fe atoms. The unquenched orbital moment is primarily responsible for a significant reduction in g-factor, typically 2 in transition metals, as determined independently using ferromagnetic resonance spectroscopy. Our findings reveal a non-linear reduction in the g-factor from 1.7 at 300 K to 1.56 at 200 K in Tm3Fe5O12 thin films. These results provide critical insights into the role of the f orbitals in long-range magnetic order and stimulate further exploration in orbitronics.</description>

      <title>Evidence for multiband gapless superconductivity in the topological superconductor candidate 4Hb-TaS2</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08450v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the ultralow-temperature thermal conductivity measurements on single crystals of transition-metal dichalcogenide material 4Hb-TaS$_{2}$, which has recently been proposed as a topological superconductor candidate. In zero field, a small residual linear term $\kappa_{0}/T$ is observed, indicating the existence of a residual density of states in the superconducting state. The slow field dependence of $\kappa_{0}/T$ at low fields rules out the presence of nodes in the superconducting gap, and the S-shaped field dependence across the full field range suggests multiple superconducting gaps in 4Hb-TaS$_{2}$. Our results provide evidence for multiband gapless superconductivity in 4Hb-TaS$_{2}$, and the residual density of states come from certain gapless Fermi surfaces.</description>

      <title>Smart Holes: Analogue black holes with the right temperature and entropy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08517v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In analogue gravity studies, the goal is to replicate black hole phenomena, such as Hawking radiation, within controlled laboratory settings. In the realm of condensed matter systems, this may happen in 2D tilted Dirac cone materials based on honeycomb lattice. In particular, we compute the entropy of this system, and find it has the same form as black hole Bekenstein-Hawking entropy, if an analogue horizon forms. Hence, these systems can be potential analogues of quantum black holes. We show that this entropy is primarily concentrated in the region where the tilt parameter is close to one, which corresponds to the location of the analogue black hole horizon. Additionally, when nonlinear effects are taken into account, the entropy is peaked in a small pocket of the Fermi sea that forms behind the analogue event horizon, which we call the \textit{Fermi puddle}. We further refer to this new type of analogue black hole as a {\it smart hole}, since, in contrast to dumb holes, it can simulate both the correct temperature {\it and} entropy of general relativistic black holes. These results provide an opportunity to illuminate various quantum facets of black hole physics in a laboratory setting.</description>

Abstract: We investigate a strongly coupled finite-density anisotropic fluid in $2+1$ dimensions dual to an asymptotically AdS black brane that is a solution of Einstein-Maxwell-Axion theory in $3+1$ dimensions. Despite the anisotropy, the fluid thermodynamic properties align with those of a conformal fluid. Moreover, we show that the fluid is stable under the increase of the anisotropy parameter. Additionally, we analyse the DC conductivity of the anisotropic fluid, showing its compatibility with momentum dissipation due to translational symmetry breaking. In the limit of very large anisotropy we find that the DC conductivity vanishes as a consequence of dimensionality reduction.</description>

      <title>Towards a classification of mixed-state topological orders in two dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02390v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The classification and characterization of topological phases of matter is well understood for ground states of gapped Hamiltonians that are well isolated from the environment. However, decoherence due to interactions with the environment is inevitable -- thus motivating the investigation of topological orders in the context of mixed states. Here, we take a step toward classifying mixed-state topological orders in two spatial dimensions by considering their (emergent) generalized symmetries. We argue that their 1-form symmetries and the associated anyon theories lead to a partial classification under two-way connectivity by quasi-local quantum channels. This allows us to establish mixed-state topological orders that are intrinsically mixed, i.e., that have no ground state counterpart. We provide a wide range of examples based on topological subsystem codes, decohering $G$-graded string-net models, and "classically gauging" symmetry-enriched topological orders. One of our main examples is an Ising string-net model under the influence of dephasing noise. We study the resulting space of locally-indistinguishable states and compute the modular transformations within a particular coherent space. Based on our examples, we identify two possible effects of quasi-local quantum channels on anyon theories: (1) anyons can be incoherently proliferated -- thus reducing to a commutant of the proliferated anyons, or (2) the system can be "classically gauged", resulting in the symmetrization of anyons and an extension by transparent bosons. Given these two mechanisms, we conjecture that mixed-state topological orders are classified by premodular anyon theories, i.e., those for which the braiding relations may be degenerate.</description>

      <title>Quadratic dispersion relations in gapless frustration-free systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06414v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent case-by-case studies revealed that the dispersion of low energy excitations in gapless frustration-free Hamiltonians is often quadratic or softer. In this work, we argue that this is actually a general property of such systems. By combining a previous study by Bravyi and Gosset and the min-max principle, we prove this hypothesis for models with local Hilbert spaces of dimension two that contains only nearest-neighbor interactions on cubic lattice. This may be understood as a no-go theorem realizing gapless phases with linearly dispersive excitations in frustration-free Hamiltonians. We also provide examples of frustration-free Hamiltonians in which the plane-wave state of a single spin flip does not constitute low energy excitations.</description>

      <title>Fractal Subsystem Symmetries, Anomalies, Boundaries, and Effective Field Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19275v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work reports an extensive study of three-dimensional topological ordered phases that, in one of the directions behave like usual topological order concerning mobility of excitations, but in the perpendicular plane manifest type-II fracton physics dictated by a fractal subsystem symmetry. We obtain an expression for the ground state degeneracy, which depends intricately on the sizes of the plane, signaling a strong manifestation of ultraviolet/infrared (UV/IR) mixing. The ground state degeneracy can be interpreted in terms of spontaneous/explicit breaking of fractal subsystem symmetries. We also study the boundary physics, which in turn is useful to understand the connection with certain two-dimensional phases. Finally, we derive a low-energy but not long-distance effective field theory, by Higgsing a fractal $U(1)$ symmetry and taking the deep IR limit. This description embodies in a natural way several aspects of the phases, such as the content of generalized global symmetries, the role of fractal symmetries on the mobility of excitations, the anomalies, and the boundary physics.</description>

      <title>DFT+DMFT study of correlated electronic structure in the monolayer-trilayer phase of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08601v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By preforming DFT+DMFT calculations, we systematically investigate the correlated electronic structure in the newly discovered monolayer-trilayer (ML-TL) phase of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ (1313-La327). Our calculated Fermi surfaces are in good agreement with the result of angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy. We find that 1313-La327 is a multiorbital correlated metal. An unstable orbital-selective Mott behavior is found in ML. The ML Ni-3$d_{z^2}$ orbital exhibits a Mott behavior, while the ML Ni-3$d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital is metallic due to self-doping. Quasi-particle peaks appear at the Fermi level due to an interorbital hopping between the localized ML Ni-3$d_{z^2}$ and delocalized Ni-3$d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals. We also find a large static local spin susceptibility of ML Ni, suggesting that there is large spin fluctuation in 1313-La327. The TL Ni-$e_g$ orbitals possess similar electronic correlation to those in La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$. The $e_g$ orbitals of the outer-layer Ni in TL show non-Fermi liquid behaviors. Besides, large weight of high-spin states are found in TL-outer Ni and ML Ni, implying Hundness. Under 16 GPa, a Lifshitz transition is revealed by our calculations and a La-related band crosses the Fermi level. Our work provides a theoretical reference for studying other potential mixed-stacked nickelate superconductors.</description>

      <title>Relevance of Anisotropy in the Kondo Effect: Lessons From the Symplectic Case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12093v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A Kondo model with symplectic symmetry was recently put forward as the effective low-energy theory of a superconducting-island device coupled to multiple leads. This model, which possesses non-Fermi liquid physics and effective anyons, was argued to belong to the class of topological Kondo effects. Here, we clarify the extent of stability of its exotic fixed point using perturbative and numerical renormalization group in conjunction with bosonization and conformal field theory. In contrast to previous claims, we show that asymmetry in the coupling to the leads destabilizes the non-Fermi liquid. Other destabilizing perturbations include asymmetry in the superconducting pairing or internal energy of the individual quantum dots in the island. Nevertheless, these perturbations all generate the same relevant operators. Thus, only a small number of couplings need to be tuned individually, and these can be selected according to experimental convenience. Our results highlight a common misconception that anisotropy in single-channel Kondo couplings is always irrelevant. As demonstrated, relevant terms will emerge whenever the group generators do not span the full space of impurity operators. This calls for a more detailed inspection of models that exhibit this property, such as large-spin impurities and SO(M) Kondo models.</description>

      <title>Magnetic and electronic inhomogeneity in Sm$_{1-x}$Eu$_x$B$_6$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23199v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While SmB$_6$ attracts attention as a possible topological Kondo insulator, EuB$_6$ is known to host magnetic polarons that give rise to large magnetoresistive effects above its ferromagnetic order transition. Here we investigate single crystals of Sm$_{1-x}$Eu$_x$B$_6$ by magnetic and magnetotransport measurements to explore a possible interplay of these two intriguing phenomena, with focus on the Eu-rich substitutions. Sm$_{0.01}$Eu$_{0.99}$B$_6$ exhibits generally similar behavior as EuB$_6$. Interestingly, Sm$_{0.05}$Eu$_{0.95}$B$_6$ combines global antiferromagnetic order with local polaron formation. A pronounced hysteresis is found in the magnetoresistance of Sm$_{0.1}$Eu$_{0.9}$B$_6$ at low temperature ($T=$ 1.9 K) and applied magnetic fields between 2.3 $-$ 3.6 T. The latter is in agreement with a phenomenological model that predicts the stabilization of ferromagnetic polarons with increasing magnetic field within materials with global antiferromagnetic order.</description>

      <title>A supersymmetric SYK model with a curious low energy behavior</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.08818v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider $\mathcal{N}$ = 2, 4 supersymmetric SYK models that have a peculiar low energy behavior, with the entropy going like $S = S_{0} + \text{(constant)}T^{a}$, where $a \neq 1$. The large $N$ equations for these models are a generalization of equations that have been previously studied as an unjustified truncation of the planar diagrams describing the BFSS matrix quantum mechanics or other related matrix models. Here we reanalyze these equations in order to better understand the low energy physics of these models. We find that the scalar fields develop large expectation values which explore the low energy valleys in the potential. The low energy physics is dominated by quadratic fluctuations around these values. These models were previously conjectured to have a spin glass phase. We did not find any evidence for this phase by using the usual diagnostics, such as searching for replica symmetry breaking solutions.</description>

      <title>Quantum Energy Teleportation versus Information Teleportation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13886v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum energy teleportation (QET) is the phenomenon in which locally inaccessible energy is activated as extractable work through collaborative local operations and classical communication (LOCC) with an entangled partner. It closely resembles the more well-known quantum information teleportation (QIT) where quantum information can be sent through an entangled pair with LOCC. It is tempting to ask how QET is related to QIT. Here we report a first study of this connection. Despite the apparent similarity, we show that these two phenomena are not only distinct but moreover are mutually competitive. We show a perturbative trade-off relation between their performance in a thermal entangled chaotic many-body system, in which both QET and QIT are simultaneously implemented through a traversable wormhole in an emergent spacetime. Motivated by this example, we study a generic setup of two entangled qudits and prove a universal non-perturbative trade-off bound. It shows that for any teleportation protocol, the overall performance of QET and QIT together is constrained by the entanglement resource. We discuss some explanations of our results.</description>

      <title>SymTFT for (3+1)d Gapless SPTs and Obstructions to Confinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05585v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study gapless phases in (3+1)d in the presence of 1-form and non-invertible duality symmetries. Using the Symmetry Topological Field Theory (SymTFT) approach, we classify the gapless symmetry-protected (gSPT) phases in these setups, with particular focus on intrinsically gSPTs (igSPTs). These are symmetry protected critical points which cannot be deformed to a trivially gapped phase without spontaneously breaking the symmetry. Although these are by now well-known in (1+1)d, we demonstrate their existence in (3+1)d gauge theories. Here, they have a clear physical interpretation in terms of an obstruction to confinement, even though the full 1-form symmetry does not suffer from 't Hooft anomalies. These igSPT phases provide a new way to realize 1-form symmetries in CFTs, that has no analog for gapped phases. The SymTFT approach allows for a direct generalization from invertible symmetries to non-invertible duality symmetries, for which we study gSPT and igSPT phases as well. We accompany these theoretical results with concrete physical examples realizing such phases and explain how obstruction to confinement is detected at the level of symmetric deformations.</description>
