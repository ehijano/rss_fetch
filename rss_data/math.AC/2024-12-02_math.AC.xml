      <title>On the perturbations of Noetherian local domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study how the properties of being reduced, integral domain, and normal, behave under small perturbations of the defining equations of a noetherian local ring. It is not hard to show that the property of being a local integral domain (reduced, normal ring) is not stable under small perturbations in general. We prove that perturbation stability holds in the following situations: (1) perturbation of being an integral domain for factorial excellent Henselian local rings; (2) perturbation of normality for excellent local complete intersections containing a field of characteristic zero; and (3) perturbation of reducedness for excellent local complete intersections containing a field of characteristic zero, and for factorial Nagata local rings.</description>

      <title>On the Rich Landscape of Complete Intersection Monomial Curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19260v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim of this survey is to explore complete intersection monomial curves from a contemporary perspective. The main goal is to help readers understand the intricate connections within the field and its potential applications. The properties of any monomial curve singularity will be first reviewed, highlighting the interaction between combinatorial and algebraic properties. Next, we will revisit the two main characterizations of complete intersection monomial curves. One is based on deep algebraic properties given by Herzog and Kunz in 1971, while the other is based on a combinatorial approach given by Delorme in 1976. Our aim is to bridge the gap between these perspectives present in the current literature. Then, we will focus on recent advances that show an intriguing connection between numerical semigroups and Alexander polynomials of knots. Finally, we will revisit the deformation theory of these curves and provide an answer to a question posed by Buchweitz and Greuel regarding curve deformations.</description>

      <title>Indivisible Sequences and Descendability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of indivisible sequences and show that to any indivisible sequence $\{S, \Psi: S \to R\}$ we can associate faithfully flat ring maps $R \to R'$ that are not descendable. As a corollary, we obtain the first example of a faithfully flat ring map between $\aleph_{n-1}$-countable rings that has descendability exponent $n$, and indeed a faithfully flat ring map between $\aleph_{\omega}$-countable rings that is not descendable.</description>

      <title>Almost Complete Intersections: Regularity of powers and Rees algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15844v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An almost complete intersection ideal can be seen as a $d$-sequence ideal with the minimal number of generators being one more than its height. In this paper, we give exact formulas for the regularity of powers of graded almost complete intersection ideals satisfying certain conditions. We also present the minimal bigraded free resolutions of Rees algebras associated with linear type ideals having one generator more than their grade and study the properties of Cohen-Macaulayness, Koszulness associated to their diagonals.</description>

      <title>Bernstein--Sato polynomials of locally quasi-homogeneous divisors in $\mathbb{C}^{3}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.08342v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the Bernstein--Sato polynomial of a locally quasi-homogeneous polynomial $f \in R = \mathbb{C}[x_{1}, x_{2}, x_{3}]$. We construct, in the analytic category, a complex of $\mathscr{D}_{X}[s]$-modules that can be used to compute the $\mathscr{D}_{X}[s]$-dual of $\mathscr{D}_{X}[s] f^{s-1}$ as the middle term of a short exact sequence where the outer terms are well understood. This extends a result by Narv\'{a}ez Macarro where a freeness assumption was required.
  We derive many results about the zeroes of the Bernstein--Sato polynomial. First, we prove each nonvanishing degree of the zeroeth local cohomology of the Milnor algebra $H_{\mathfrak{m}}^{0} (R / (\partial f))$ contributes a root to the Bernstein--Sato polynomial, generalizing a result of M. Saito's (where the argument cannot weaken homogeneity to quasi-homogeneity). Second, we prove the zeroes of the Bernstein--Sato polynomial admit a partial symmetry about $-1$, extending a result of Narv\'{a}ez Macarro that again required freeness. We give applications to very small roots, the twisted Logarithmic Comparison Theorem, and more precise statements when $f$ is additionally assumed to be homogeneous.
  Finally, when $f$ defines a hyperplane arrangement in $\mathbb{C}^{3}$ we give a complete formula for the zeroes of the Bernstein--Sato polynomial of $f$. We show all zeroes except the candidate root $-2 + (2 / \text{deg}(f))$ are (easily) combinatorially given; we give many equivalent characterizations of when the only non-combinatorial candidate root $-2 + (2/ \text{deg}(f))$ is in fact a zero of the Bernstein--Sato polynomial. One equivalent condition is the nonvanishing of $H_{\mathfrak{m}}^{0}( R / (\partial f))_{\text{deg}(f) - 1}$.</description>

      <title>$k$-linear Morita theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15895v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove the standard comparison used by mathematicians between the idempotent complete pretriangulated dg-categories, over a unitary and commutative ring $k$, and the idempotent complete $k$-linear stable $\infty$-categories. Our approach is completely included in the $\infty$-categorical theory. To achieve the target we will reinterpret the Morita theory for dg-categories and we set the Morita theory for $k$-linear stable $\infty$-category.</description>
