      <title>Sampling from exponential distributions in the time domain with superparamagnetic tunnel junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10317v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Though exponential distributions are ubiquitous in statistical physics and related computational models, directly sampling them from device behavior is rarely done. The superparamagnetic tunnel junction (SMTJ), a key device in probabilistic computing, is known to naturally exhibit exponentially distributed temporal switching dynamics. To sample an exponential distribution with an SMTJ, we need to measure it in the time domain, which is challenging with traditional techniques that focus on sampling the instantaneous state of the device. In this work, we leverage a temporal encoding scheme, where information is encoded in the time at which the device switches between its resistance states. We then develop a circuit element known as a probabilistic delay cell that applies an electrical current step to an SMTJ and a temporal measurement circuit that measures the timing of the first switching event. Repeated experiments confirm that these times are exponentially distributed. Temporal processing methods then allow us to digitally compute with these exponentially distributed probabilistic delay cells. We describe how to use these circuits in a Metropolis-Hastings stepper and in a weighted random sampler, both of which are computationally intensive applications that benefit from the efficient generation of exponentially distributed random numbers.</description>

      <title>Chatbots im Schulunterricht: Wir testen das Fobizz-Tool zur automatischen Bewertung von Hausaufgaben</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06651v3 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: [Study in German language.] This study examines the AI-powered grading tool "AI Grading Assistant" by the German company Fobizz, designed to support teachers in evaluating and providing feedback on student assignments. Against the societal backdrop of an overburdened education system and rising expectations for artificial intelligence as a solution to these challenges, the investigation evaluates the tool's functional suitability through two test series. The results reveal significant shortcomings: The tool's numerical grades and qualitative feedback are often random and do not improve even when its suggestions are incorporated. The highest ratings are achievable only with texts generated by ChatGPT. False claims and nonsensical submissions frequently go undetected, while the implementation of some grading criteria is unreliable and opaque. Since these deficiencies stem from the inherent limitations of large language models (LLMs), fundamental improvements to this or similar tools are not immediately foreseeable. The study critiques the broader trend of adopting AI as a quick fix for systemic problems in education, concluding that Fobizz's marketing of the tool as an objective and time-saving solution is misleading and irresponsible. Finally, the study calls for systematic evaluation and subject-specific pedagogical scrutiny of the use of AI tools in educational contexts.</description>

      <title>SMEVCA: Stable Matching-based EV Charging Assignment in Subscription-Based Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09948v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid shift from internal combustion engine vehicles to battery-powered electric vehicles (EVs) presents considerable challenges, such as limited charging points (CPs), unpredictable wait times, and difficulty selecting appropriate CPs. To address these challenges, we propose a novel end-to-end framework called Stable Matching EV Charging Assignment (SMEVCA) that efficiently assigns charge-seeking EVs to CPs with assistance from roadside units (RSUs). The proposed framework operates within a subscription-based model, ensuring that the subscribed EVs complete their charging within a predefined time limit enforced by a service level agreement (SLA). The framework SMEVCA employs a stable, fast, and efficient EV-CP assignment formulated as a one-to-many matching game with preferences. The matching process identifies the preferred coalition (a subset of EVs assigned to the CPs) using two strategies: (1) Preferred Coalition Greedy (PCG) that offers an efficient, locally optimal heuristic solution and (2) Preferred Coalition Dynamic (PCD) that is more computation-intensive but delivers a globally optimal coalition. Extensive simulations reveal that PCG and PCD achieve a gain of 14.6% and 20.8% over random elimination for in-network charge transferred with only 3% and 0.1% EVs unserved within the RSUs vicinity.</description>

      <title>NetOrchLLM: Mastering Wireless Network Orchestration with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10107v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The transition to 6G networks promises unprecedented advancements in wireless communication, with increased data rates, ultra-low latency, and enhanced capacity. However, the complexity of managing and optimizing these next-generation networks presents significant challenges. The advent of large language models (LLMs) has revolutionized various domains by leveraging their sophisticated natural language understanding capabilities. However, the practical application of LLMs in wireless network orchestration and management remains largely unexplored. Existing literature predominantly offers visionary perspectives without concrete implementations, leaving a significant gap in the field. To address this gap, this paper presents NETORCHLLM, a wireless NETwork ORCHestrator LLM framework that uses LLMs to seamlessly orchestrate diverse wireless-specific models from wireless communication communities using their language understanding and generation capabilities. A comprehensive framework is introduced, demonstrating the practical viability of our approach and showcasing how LLMs can be effectively harnessed to optimize dense network operations, manage dynamic environments, and improve overall network performance. NETORCHLLM bridges the theoretical aspirations of prior research with practical, actionable solutions, paving the way for future advancements in integrating generative AI technologies within the wireless communications sector.</description>
