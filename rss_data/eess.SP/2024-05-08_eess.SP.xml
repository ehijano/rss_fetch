      <title>System Identification of the Upgraded LHPOST6 Reaction Mass at the University of California San Diego</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Upon completing the upgrade from one to six degrees of freedom of the Outdoor Shake Table at UCSD in 2019, forced vibration tests were carried out to identify the dynamic characteristics of the reaction mass and soil system. This report describes the motivation, execution, and results from such tests, which independently excited the reaction mass in four degrees of freedom: longitudinal, transverse, yaw, and vertical. The report discusses the frequency response curves and deformation patterns from which the natural frequencies, damping ratio, mode shapes, and rigid body motion were determined. The first objective of the study was to investigate if the dynamic properties of the system had dramatically changed after the upgrade by comparing the results to those from forced vibration tests performed 20 years ago, during the construction of the facility. In addition, most recent tests also contributed with results from the vertical degree of freedom, which had never been tested. The second objective was to obtain high-quality response data of the system that will be used to develop a high-fidelity computational model of the reaction mass in future research. A comparison of results showed a slight difference of 0.5Hz in the natural frequency of 2 degrees of freedom. Moreover, maximum displacements in the recent tests were overall larger than the previous ones with few exceptions. The report thoroughly discusses the several sources of discrepancy between the past and most recent results. Finally, test results allowed us to estimate the system's response if the shake table actuators were to be used at their maximum nominal capacity. Small displacement and high damping results were consistent with those of previous tests and further validated the design of the reaction mass.</description>

      <title>Bistatic OFDM-based ISAC with Over-the-Air Synchronization: System Concept and Performance Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04962v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) has been defined as one goal for 6G mobile communication systems. In this context, this article introduces a bistatic ISAC system based on orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM). While the bistatic architecture brings advantages such as not demanding full duplex operation with respect to the monostatic one, the need for synchronizing transmitter and receiver is imposed. In this context, this article introuces a bistatic ISAC signal processing framework where an incoming OFDM-based ISAC signal undergoes over-the-air synchronization based on preamble symbols and pilots. Afterwards, bistatic radar processing is performed using either only pilot subcarriers or the full OFDM frame. The latter approach requires estimation of the originally transmitted frame based on communication processing and therefore error-free communication, which can be achieved via appropriate channel coding. The performance and limitations of the introduced system based on both aforementioned approaches are assessed via an analysis of the impact of residual synchronization mismatches and data decoding failures on both communication and radar performances. Finally, the performed analyses are validated by proof-of-concept measurement results.</description>

      <title>Filtering and smoothing estimation algorithms from uncertain nonlinear observations with time-correlated additive noise and random deception attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper discusses the problem of estimating a stochastic signal from nonlinear uncertain observations with time-correlated additive noise described by a first-order Markov process. Random deception attacks are assumed to be launched by an adversary, and both this phenomenon and the uncertainty in the observations are modelled by two sets of Bernoulli random variables. Under the assumption that the evolution model generating the signal to be estimated is unknown and only the mean and covariance functions of the processes involved in the observation equation are available, recursive algorithms based on linear approximations of the real observations are proposed for the least-squares filtering and fixed-point smoothing problems. Finally, the feasibility and effectiveness of the developed estimation algorithms are verified by a numerical simulation example, where the impact of uncertain observation and deception attack probabilities on estimation accuracy is evaluated.</description>

      <title>Performance Bounds for Velocity Estimation with Large Antenna Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Joint communication and sensing (JCS) is envisioned as an enabler of future 6G networks. One of the key features of these networks will be the use of extremely large aperture arrays (ELAAs) and high operating frequencies, which will result in significant near-field propagation effects. This unique property can be harnessed to improve sensing capabilities. In this paper, we focus on velocity sensing, as using ELAAs allows the estimation of not just the radial component but also the transverse component. We derive analytical performance bounds for both velocity components, demonstrating how they are affected by the different system parameters and geometries. These insights offer a foundational understanding of how near-field effects play in velocity sensing differently from the far field and from position estimate.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.04539v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This research paper introduces innovative approaches for multivariate time series forecasting based on different variations of the combined regression strategy. We use specific data preprocessing techniques which makes a radical change in the behaviour of prediction. We compare the performance of the model based on two types of hyper-parameter tuning Bayesian optimisation (BO) and Usual Grid search. Our proposed methodologies outperform all state-of-the-art comparative models. We illustrate the methodologies through eight time series datasets from three categories: cryptocurrency, stock index, and short-term load forecasting.</description>

      <title>Regime Learning for Differentiable Particle Filters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.04865v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Differentiable particle filters are an emerging class of models that combine sequential Monte Carlo techniques with the flexibility of neural networks to perform state space inference. This paper concerns the case where the system may switch between a finite set of state-space models, i.e. regimes. No prior approaches effectively learn both the individual regimes and the switching process simultaneously. In this paper, we propose the neural network based regime learning differentiable particle filter (RLPF) to address this problem. We further design a training procedure for the RLPF and other related algorithms. We demonstrate competitive performance compared to the previous state-of-the-art algorithms on a pair of numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>RF-based Energy Harvesting: Nonlinear Models, Applications and Challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04976v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: So far, various aspects associated with wireless energy harvesting (EH) have been investigated from diverse perspectives, including energy sources and models, usage protocols, energy scheduling and optimization, and EH implementation in different wireless communication systems. However, a comprehensive survey specifically focusing on models of radio frequency (RF)-based EH behaviors has not yet been presented. To address this gap, this article provides an overview of the mainstream mathematical models that capture the nonlinear behavior of practical EH circuits, serving as a valuable handbook of mathematical models for EH application research. Moreover, we summarize the application of each nonlinear EH model, including the associated challenges and precautions. We also analyze the impact and advancements of each EH model on RF-based EH systems in wireless communication, utilizing artificial intelligence (AI) techniques. Additionally, we highlight emerging research directions in the context of nonlinear RF-based EH. This article aims to contribute to the future application of RF-based EH in novel communication research domains to a significant extent.</description>

      <title>Attention-Driven Training-Free Efficiency Enhancement of Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05252v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion Models (DMs) have exhibited superior performance in generating high-quality and diverse images. However, this exceptional performance comes at the cost of expensive architectural design, particularly due to the attention module heavily used in leading models. Existing works mainly adopt a retraining process to enhance DM efficiency. This is computationally expensive and not very scalable. To this end, we introduce the Attention-driven Training-free Efficient Diffusion Model (AT-EDM) framework that leverages attention maps to perform run-time pruning of redundant tokens, without the need for any retraining. Specifically, for single-denoising-step pruning, we develop a novel ranking algorithm, Generalized Weighted Page Rank (G-WPR), to identify redundant tokens, and a similarity-based recovery method to restore tokens for the convolution operation. In addition, we propose a Denoising-Steps-Aware Pruning (DSAP) approach to adjust the pruning budget across different denoising timesteps for better generation quality. Extensive evaluations show that AT-EDM performs favorably against prior art in terms of efficiency (e.g., 38.8% FLOPs saving and up to 1.53x speed-up over Stable Diffusion XL) while maintaining nearly the same FID and CLIP scores as the full model.

      <title>Dynamic Sensor Placement Based on Graph Sampling Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.04019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.04019v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider a sensor placement problem where sensors can move within a network over time. Sensor placement problem aims to select K sensor positions from N candidates where K &lt; N. Most existing methods assume that sensor positions are static, i.e., they do not move, however, many mobile sensors like drones, robots, and vehicles can change their positions over time. Moreover, underlying measurement conditions could also be changed, which are difficult to cover with statically placed sensors. We tackle the problem by allowing the sensors to change their positions in their neighbors on the network. We sequentially learn the dictionary from a pool of observed signals on the network based on graph sampling theory. Using the learned dictionary, we dynamically determine the sensor positions such that the non-observed signals on the network can be best recovered from the observations. In experiments, we validate the effectiveness of the proposed method via the mean squared error (MSE) of the reconstructed signals. The proposed dynamic sensor placement outperforms the existing static ones for both synthetic and real data.</description>

      <title>Joint Delay-Phase Precoding Under True-Time Delay Constraints in Wideband Sub-THz Hybrid Massive MIMO Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.07484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.07484v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In wideband sub-Terahertz (sub-THz) massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communication, the beam squint effect leads to a significant loss of array gain. A hybrid precoding approach based on true-time delay (TTD) and phase shifter (PS) has been proposed to mitigate this effect. Existing methods make the assumption that the TTD precoder can provide arbitrary time delay values and design it by fixing the PS precoder. This work presents a novel joint optimization framework for the TTD and PS precoder design, incorporating realistic time delay constraints for each TTD device. Unlike previous methods, our framework does not rely on the unbounded time delay assumption and optimizes both the TTD and PS values simultaneously to cope with the practical limitations. Moreover, we derive the minimum number of TTD devices required to achieve a given array gain target using our framework. Simulations confirm the proposed approach exhibits performance improvement, guarantees array gain, and achieves computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>Data Augmentation for Generating Synthetic Electrogastrogram Time Series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.02408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.02408v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To address an emerging need for large number of diverse datasets for rigor evaluation of signal processing techniques, we developed and evaluated a new method for generating synthetic electrogastrogram time series. We used electrogastrography (EGG) data from an open database to set model parameters and statistical tests to evaluate synthesized data. Additionally, we illustrated method customization for generating artificial EGG time series alterations caused by the simulator sickness. Proposed data augmentation method generates synthetic EGG data with specified duration, sampling frequency, recording state (postprandial or fasting state), overall noise and breathing artifact injection, and pauses in the gastric rhythm (arrhythmia occurrence) with statistically significant difference between postprandial and fasting states in &gt; 70% cases while not accounting for individual differences. Features obtained from the synthetic EGG signal resembling simulator sickness occurrence displayed expected trends. The code for generation of synthetic EGG time series is not only freely available and can be further customized to assess signal processing algorithms but also may be used to increase data diversity for training artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms. The proposed approach is customized for EGG data synthesis but can be easily utilized for other biosignals with similar nature such as electroencephalogram.</description>

      <title>FR2 5G Networks for Industrial Scenarios: Experimental Characterization and Beam Management Procedures in Operational Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.08946v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Industrial environments constitute a challenge in terms of radio propagation due to the presence of machinery and the mobility of the different agents, especially at mmWave bands. This paper presents an experimental evaluation of a FR2 5G network deployed in an operational factory scenario at 26 GHz. The experimental characterization, performed with autonomous mobile robots that self-navigate the industrial lab, leads to the analysis of the received power along the factory and the evaluation of reference path gain models. The proposed assessment deeply analyzes the physical layer of the communication network under operational conditions. Thus, two different network configurations are assessed by measuring the power received in the entire factory, providing a comparison between deployments. Additionally, beam management procedures, such as beam recovery, beam sweeping or beam switching, are analyzed since they are crucial in environments where mobile agents are involved. They aim for a zero interruption approach based on reliable communications. The results analysis shows that beam recovery procedures can perform a beam switching to an alternative serving beam with power losses of less than 1.6 dB on average. Beam sweeping analysis demonstrates the prevalence of the direct component in Line-of-Sight conditions despite the strong scattering component and large-scale fading in the environment.</description>

      <title>Channel State Information-Free Location-Privacy Enhancement: Delay-Angle Information Spoofing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.14465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.14465v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, a delay-angle information spoofing (DAIS) strategy is proposed for location-privacy enhancement. By shifting the location-relevant delays and angles without the aid of channel state information (CSI) at the transmitter, the eavesdropper is obfuscated by a physical location that is distinct from the true one. A precoder is designed to preserve location-privacy while the legitimate localizer can remove the obfuscation with the securely shared information. Then, a lower bound on the localization error is derived via the analysis of the geometric mismatch caused by DAIS, validating the enhanced location-privacy. The statistical hardness for the estimation of the shared information is also investigated to assess the robustness to the potential leakage of the designed precoder structure. Numerical comparisons show that the proposed DAIS scheme results in more than 15 dB performance degradation for the illegitimate localizer at high signal-to-noise ratios, which is comparable to a recently proposed CSI-free location-privacy enhancement strategy and is less sensitive to the precoder structure leakage than the prior approach.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty-Aware Bayes' Rule and Its Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.05532v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bayes' rule has enabled innumerable powerful algorithms of statistical signal processing and statistical machine learning. However, when there exist model misspecifications in prior distributions and/or data distributions, the direct application of Bayes' rule is questionable. Philosophically, the key is to balance the relative importance of prior and data distributions when calculating posterior distributions: if prior (resp. data) distributions are overly conservative, we should upweight the prior belief (resp. data evidence); if prior (resp. data) distributions are overly opportunistic, we should downweight the prior belief (resp. data evidence). This paper derives a generalized Bayes' rule, called uncertainty-aware Bayes' rule, to technically realize the above philosophy, i.e., to combat the model uncertainties in prior distributions and/or data distributions. Simulated and real-world experiments on classification and estimation showcase the superiority of the presented uncertainty-aware Bayes' rule over the conventional Bayes' rule: In particular, the uncertainty-aware Bayes classifier, the uncertainty-aware Kalman filter, the uncertainty-aware particle filter, and the uncertainty-aware interactive-multiple-model filter are suggested and validated.</description>

      <title>Optimized Parameter Design for Channel State Information-Free Location Spoofing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.00329v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, an augmented analysis of a delay-angle information spoofing (DAIS) is provided for location-privacy preservation, where the location-relevant delays and angles are artificially shifted to obfuscate the eavesdropper with an incorrect physical location. A simplified misspecified Cramer-Rao bound (MCRB) is derived, which clearly manifests that not only estimation error, but also the geometric mismatch introduced by DAIS can lead to a significant increase in localization error for an eavesdropper. Given an assumption of the orthogonality among wireless paths, the simplified MCRB can be further expressed as a function of delay-angle shifts in a closed-form, which enables the more straightforward optimization of these design parameters for location-privacy enhancement. Numerical results are provided, validating the theoretical analysis and showing that the root-mean-square error for eavesdropper's localization can be more than 150 m with the optimized delay-angle shifts for DAIS.</description>

      <title>Antenna Array Design for Mono-Static ISAC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.11983v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mono-static sensing operations in ISAC perform joint beamforming between transmitter and receiver. However, in contrast to pure radar systems, ISAC requires to fulfill communications tasks and to retain the corresponding design constraints for at least one half-duplex antenna array. This shifts the available degrees of freedom to the design of the second half-duplex array, that completes the mono-static sensing setup of the 6G ISAC system. Consequently, although it is still possible to achieve the gains foreseen by the radar sparse array literature, it is necessary to adapt these considerations to the new ISAC paradigm.
  In this work, we propose a model to evaluate the angular capabilities of a mono-static setup, constrained to the shape of the communications array and its topology requirements in wireless networks. Accordingly, we enhance the joint angular capabilities by utilizing a sparse element topology of the sensing array with the same number of elements. Our analysis is validated by simulation experiments, confirming the value of our model in providing system designers with a tool to drastically improve the trade-off between angular capabilities for sensing and the cost of the deployed hardware.</description>

Abstract: Generative Diffusion Models (GDMs) have emerged as a transformative force in the realm of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI), demonstrating their versatility and efficacy across various applications. The ability to model complex data distributions and generate high-quality samples has made GDMs particularly effective in tasks such as image generation and reinforcement learning. Furthermore, their iterative nature, which involves a series of noise addition and denoising steps, is a powerful and unique approach to learning and generating data. This paper serves as a comprehensive tutorial on applying GDMs in network optimization tasks. We delve into the strengths of GDMs, emphasizing their wide applicability across various domains, such as vision, text, and audio generation. We detail how GDMs can be effectively harnessed to solve complex optimization problems inherent in networks. The paper first provides a basic background of GDMs and their applications in network optimization. This is followed by a series of case studies, showcasing the integration of GDMs with Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), incentive mechanism design, Semantic Communications (SemCom), Internet of Vehicles (IoV) networks, etc. These case studies underscore the practicality and efficacy of GDMs in real-world scenarios, offering insights into network design. We conclude with a discussion on potential future directions for GDM research and applications, providing major insights into how they can continue to shape the future of network optimization.</description>
