      <title>Interplay between Hund's rule and Kondo effect in a quantum dot</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21675v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interaction between localized spins on a quantum dot and free electrons in the reservoirs forms a many-particle entangled system giving rise to the Kondo effect. Here, we investigate electron transport in the third shell of a gate-defined GaAs quantum dot. The addition energy shows a maximum at half-filling of the shell which can be described analytically with Hund's rule exchange interaction. For 7 to 11 electrons occupying the quantum dot Zero-bias anomalies characteristic for the Kondo effect are observed, but with unexpected widths. Here the quantum dot has to be described as a multi-orbital Kondo impurity with Hund's interaction. In this way this quantum dot can be seen as a model system for a Hund's coupled mixed-valence quantum impurity as appearing in Hund's metals where local ferromagnetic interactions between orbitals lead to the emergence of complex electronic states.</description>

      <title>Magnetic $2\pi$ domain walls for tunable Majorana devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Identifying realistic platforms capable of controlled operations with Majorana bound states is a key challenge in the study of topological superconductivity. Among the most promising proposals are magnet-superconductor hybrid devices, which employ magnetic textures to engineer regions of non-trivial topology. Here, we consider the remarkably simple case of $2\pi$ domain walls in a magnetic ribbon placed on a superconducting substrate. We show that for properly chosen parameters, such domain walls generate topological quasi-one dimensional superconducting wires and give rise to localized Majorana bound states at the ribbon edges. Magnetic $2\pi$ domain walls are easily created and controlled with existing experimental techniques, thus providing a versatile platform for Majorana manipulations.</description>

      <title>Fractional Quantum Hall Anyons via the Algebraic Topology of Exotic Flux Quanta</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22144v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fractional quantum Hall systems (FQH), due to their experimentally observed anyonic topological order, are a main contender for future hardware-implementation of error-protected quantum registers ("topological qbits") subject to error-protected quantum operations ("topological quantum gates"), both plausibly necessary for future quantum computing at useful scale, but both remaining insufficiently understood.
  Here we present a novel non-Lagrangian effective description of FQH anyons, based on previously elusive proper global quantization of effective topological flux in extraordinary non-abelian cohomology theories. This directly translates the system's quantum-observables, -states, -symmetries, and -measurement channels into purely algebro-topological analysis of local systems of Hilbert spaces over the quantized flux moduli spaces.
  Under the hypothesis -- for which we provide a fair bit of evidence -- that the appropriate effective flux quantization of FQH systems is in 2-Cohomotopy theory (a cousin of Hypothesis H in high-energy physics), the results here are rigorously derived and as such might usefully inform laboratory searches for novel anyonic phenomena in FQH systems and hence for topological quantum hardware.</description>

      <title>Anomalous Hall Effect in Thick Co$_3$Sn$_2$S$_2$ Weyl Semimetal Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ferromagnetic Weyl semimetals with Kagome lattice structures exhibit a strong coupling between magnetism and topological band features. Co3Sn2S2 is a prime example, showing a giant anomalous Hall effect (AHE) driven by Berry curvature from the Weyl nodes. We investigated the temperature and angular dependence of Hall conductivity in thick Co3Sn2S2 crystals, aiming to distinguish between topological and conventional magnetic contributions. Our measurements reveal a robust Hall response even at low magnetic fields and temperatures above 77 K, suggesting a dominant topological origin and weak sensitivity to external conditions.</description>

      <title>Engineering Ge profiles in Si/SiGe heterostructures for increased valley splitting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22295v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electron spin qubits in Si/SiGe quantum wells are limited by the small and variable energy separation of the conduction band valleys. While sharp quantum well interfaces are pursued to increase the valley splitting energy deterministically, here we explore an alternative approach to enhance the valley splitting on average. We grow increasingly thinner quantum wells with broad interfaces to controllably increase the overlap of the electron wave function with Ge atoms. In these quantum wells, comprehensive quantum Hall measurements of two-dimensional electron gases reveal a linear correlation between valley splitting and disorder. Benchmarked against quantum wells with sharp interfaces, we demonstrate enhanced valley splitting while maintaining a low-disorder potential environment. Simulations using the experimental Ge concentration profiles predict an average valley splitting in quantum dots that matches the enhancement observed in two-dimensional systems. Our results motivate the experimental realization of quantum dot spin qubits in these heterostructures.</description>

      <title>Anti-bosonic current in thermal spin pumping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22315v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate thermal spin pumping in gadolinium iron garnet, focusing on dynamics of antiferromagnetic magnon and its impact on spin and heat transport. Antiferromagnet has right-handed and left-handed magnon modes. Using a two-magnetic-lattice model, we derive temperature-dependent spin-wave spectra and thermal spin pumping constants, revealing distinct transport regimes governed by competing contribution of magnon modes. We show that competition of both modes induces a compensation temperature in thermally generated spin current. This theoretical framework deepens the understanding of spin-caloritronic effects in ferrimagnets, offering new perspectives for spintronic device optimization.</description>

      <title>Magnon thermal Hall effect in insulating antiferromagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22317v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we theoretically discuss thermal Hall effect of magnons in insulating N\'{e}el ordered antiferromagnets at zero external magnetic field. We show that non-zero thermal Hall effect requires absence of any symmetry between the two sublattices. The thermal Hall effect of magnons will be non-zero by a virtue of the spin-momentum splitting of the magnon spectrum due to the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction as well as anisotropic second-nearest exchange interaction different in the two sublattices, both corresponding to the broken symmetry. We construct a theoretical model in which an external electric field may change the symmetry of the antiferromagnetic system thus altering the thermal Hall effect of magnons.</description>

      <title>Observation of resistive switching and diode effect in the conductivity of TiTe2 point contacts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22328v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We measured the I(V) and dV/dI(V) characteristics of TiTe2-based point contacts (PCs) from room to helium temperatures. Features indicating the emergence of a charge density wave (CDW) were detected. They represent symmetrical relatively V=0 maxima in dV/dI(V) around 150 mV at liquid helium temperatures, which disappear above 150 K, similar to the case of sister CDW compound TiSe2. Applying higher voltages above 200 mV, we observed resistive switching in TiTe2 PCs from a metallic-like low-resistance state to non-metallic type high-resistance state with a change of resistance by an order of magnitude. A unique diode-like effect was registered in "soft" TiTe2 PCs with hysteretic I(V) at negative voltage on TiTe2. Discovering the resistive switching and diode effect adds TiTe2 to the transition-metal dichalcogenides, which could be useful in developing non-volatile ReRAM and other upcoming nanotechnologies.</description>

      <title>Enantiosensitive locking of photoelectron spin and cation orientation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22433v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When electrons pass through chiral molecules, their transmission is strongly influenced by the orientation of their spin: molecules with opposite handedness preferentially transmit electrons with oppositely aligned spins. The underlying nature of this striking phenomenon, known as chirality-induced spin selectivity (CISS), remains controversial: its observed strength far surpasses predictions based on the typically weak spin-orbit interaction. A significant fraction of CISS phenomena are driven by light, and thus could be controlled at the ultrafast scale, and impact chemical change following photoionization or photoexcitation. To date, most studies of spin-selective enantio-sensitive photodynamics have concentrated on the influence of the magnetic field component of light. Here, we establish dynamical and geometric mechanisms of spin-selective photo-induced dynamics that arise purely from electric dipole interactions. Using one-photon ionization as an example, we report a new effect: enantio-sensitive locking of molecular cation orientation to the spins of the photoelectron and the hole in the parent molecule. One-photon ionization is an ubiquitous process, where CISS has already been found in oriented samples. Remarkably, the new effect that we report here emerges upon photoionization of randomly oriented chiral molecules, establishing CISS in amorphous chiral media.</description>

      <title>Quantum transport phenomena induced by time-dependent fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22472v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an overview of time-dependent transport phenomena in quantum systems, with a particular emphasis on steady-state regimes. We present the ideas after the main theoretical frameworks to study open-quantum systems out of equilibrium, that are useful to study quantum transport under time-dependent driving. We discuss the fundamentals of the key mechanisms such as dissipation, quantum pumping, noise, and energy conversion that are associated to the problem of quantum transport.
  Our primary focus is on electronic systems, where decades of research have established a rich theoretical foundation and a wealth of experimental realizations. Topics of interest include quantum optics with electrons, high-precision electron spectroscopy, quantum electrical metrology, and the critical role of quantum fluctuations in transport and thermodynamics. We also extend the discussion to atomic, molecular, and optical systems, as well as nanomechanical platforms, which offer complementary perspectives and are currently experiencing rapid experimental development. Finally, we examine the intersection of time-dependent transport and topological matter, a domain of active investigation.
  This review aims to gather the diverse approaches and emerging trends that define the current landscape of quantum transport research under time-dependent conditions, bridging theoretical insights with experimental advances across multiple physical platforms.</description>

      <title>Family of Multilayer Graphene Superconductors with Tunable Chirality: Momentum-Space Vortices Forged in the Berry-Ring of Fire</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21616v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent experiments in rhombohedrally-stacked multilayer graphene heterostructures have reported signatures of chiral superconductivity, emerging from a spin and valley-polarized normal state with broken time-reversal symmetry and an associated anomalous Hall effect. These findings bring into focus the role of the electronic Bloch wavefunction and the quantum geometric tensor in determining the superconducting pairing channel. In this work, we examine superconducting instabilities of a model of $N$-layer rhombohedral graphene that possesses an enhanced Berry curvature distribution on an extended ring in momentum space $-$ that we dub the 'Berry-ring of fire' $-$ in the presence of an isotropic attractive interaction with a parametrically controlled spatial range. We determine that local interactions favor a $N$-fold winding in the order parameter phase for odd-$N$ layered systems, with even-$N$ layers requiring a spatially extended attraction range to achieve pairing. For generic interaction lengths, we discover a family of chiral superconductors and, remarkably, momentum-space vortices nucleated on the Berry-ring of fire. The existence of these vortices can be traced to a momentum-space flux quantization condition involving the Berry curvature, with the phase winding dictated by a combination of the Berry flux and a 'statistical flux' to enforce Fermi-Dirac statistics. Such an order parameter structure allows for the possibility of in-situ tuning between various chiral superconducting phases through changes in the electron density or the displacement field. We discuss ways in which these predictions can be experimentally tested and potentially exploited in future devices.</description>

      <title>Robust and Symmetric Magnetic Field Dependency of Superconducting Diode Effect in Asymmetric Dirac Semimetal SQUIDs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21861v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent demonstration of the superconducting diode effect (SDE) has generated renewed interests in superconducting electronics in which devices such as compact superconducting diodes that can perform signal rectification where low-energy operations are needed. In this article, we present our results of robust and symmetric-in-magnetic-field SDE in asymmetric superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDs) realized in high-quality Dirac semimetal Cd3As2 thin film grown by the molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) technique. Consistent with previous work, a zero magnetic field SDE is observed. Furthermore, the difference in switching current is independent of the strength and polarity of an out-plane magnetic field in the range of -10 mT and 10 mT. We speculate that this robust symmetric-in-field SDE in our Dirac semimetal SQUIDs is due to the formation of helical spin texture, theoretically predicted in Dirac semimetals.</description>

      <title>Dissecting Exciton-Polariton Transport in Organic Molecular Crystals: Emerging Conductivity Assisted by Intermolecular Vibrational Coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21888v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we systematically investigate the spectral and transport properties of exciton-polaritons under the explicit influence of intermolecular vibrational coupling, which introduces dynamic disorder. In the context of a one-dimensional molecular chain strongly interacting with a cavity photon, we demonstrate the polaritonic characteristics of the spectral function and its interactions with the electronic band broadened by the coupling disorder. We further dissect the current flux into its bare excitonic contribution and transport via the cavity photon. Our results reveal that the enhancement in the charge carrier mobility and frequency-resolved conductivity stems from the photon-mediated current. More importantly, contrary to the intuition that dynamic disorder hinders transport, intermolecular vibrational coupling can facilitate exciton-polariton transport, offering an additional degree of tunability for material properties.</description>

      <title>Dual-Polarization SHG Interferometry for Imaging Antiparallel Domains and Stacking Angles of 2D Heterocrystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21922v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optical second-harmonic generation (SHG) enables orientational polarimetry for crystallographic analysis and domain imaging of various materials. However, conventional intensity polarimetry, which neglects phase information, fails to resolve antiparallel domains and to describe two-dimensional heterostructures, which represent a new class of van der Waals-bound composite crystals. In this work, we report dual-polarization spectral phase interferometry (DP-SPI) and establish a generalized SHG superposition model that incorporates the observables of DP-SPI. Antiparallel domains of monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) were successfully imaged with distinction, validating the interferometric polarimetry. From DP interferograms of TMD heterobilayers, the orientation of each layer could be determined, enabling layer-resolved probing. By employing the superposition model, we also demonstrate the photonic design and fabrication of ternary TMD heterostructures for circularly polarized SHG. These methods, providing comprehensive SHG measurements and theoretical description, can be extended to heterostructures consisting of more than two constituent layers and are not limited to TMDs or 2D materials.</description>

      <title>Modified Transfer Matrix Method for the Extraction of Material Properties via Terahertz Time-Domain Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21924v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Terahertz Time-Domain Spectroscopy is a powerful technique for extracting the low-frequency optical properties of materials. However, the optical constants are difficult to determine directly from the experimental transfer function, such that various numerical approximations must be implemented to describe specific conditions. Here, we introduce a modified Transfer Matrix Method that uses a genetic algorithm for optimization to determine the refractive index of materials in the THz regime. We show that this approach is generally applicable across a wide range of refractive indices, structures, and frequency ranges. Our method is intuitive and yields accurate results compared to leading methods across a wide spectral range (1-15 THz).</description>

      <title>Simulation of single hole spin qubit in strained triangular FinFET quantum devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22267v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using an in-house Schroedinger-Poisson (SP) solver, we investigate the creation of a single hole spin qubit inside a triple-gate triangular silicon fin field effect transistor (Si FinFET) quantum device similar to experimental structures. The gate induced formation of the required quantum dot (QD) is monitored based on the Luttinger-Kohn 6x6 kp method accounting for magnetic fields and strain to determine the qubit ground state. Strain arises from the inhomogeneous contraction of the different FinFET components when they are cooled down to cryogenic temperatures. It leads to a renormalization of the qubit energy levels, thus impacting both the heavy-hole (HH) and light-hole (LH) populations as well as their mixing. The dot length, band mixing, g-factor, and Larmor/Rabi frequencies of the considered device are extracted. In particular, we show that these metrics exhibit strong strain-dependent variations of their magnitude, thus underlying the importance of including realistic thermal contraction scenarios when modeling hole spin qubits.</description>

      <title>Dimensionality-Driven Anomalous Metallic State with Zero-field Nonreciprocal Transport in Layered Ising Superconductors</title>

Abstract: The anomalous metal state (AMS), observed in failed superconductors, provides insights into superconductivity and quantum criticality, with studies revealing unconventional quantum phases like the Bose metal. Recently, layered transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) superconductors approaching the two-dimensional limit have garnered significant attention for the enhanced phase fluctuations and electronic correlations. Investigating AMS in these systems, particularly in the absence of an external magnetic field, could offer valuable insights into the dimensionality-driven emergence of exotic quantum phenomena, including triplet Cooper pairing, phase fluctuation dynamics, and especially the recently discovered field-free superconducting diode effects. However, the field-free AMS has yet to be observed in TMD superconductors. Here, we report the dimensionality-tunable AMS near the superconducting quantum phase transitions in a layered TMD superconductor 2H-Ta2S3Se. In samples with thicknesses below 10 nm, we demonstrate magnetic field-driven AMS under external magnetic field, characterized by the vanishing of the Hall resistance and the presence of finite longitudinal resistance. Remarkably, an unexpected zero-field AMS emerges as the sample thickness is reduced to 3 nm. This AMS aligns well with the quantum vortex creep model and exhibits non-reciprocal transport behaviors, suggesting the onset of spontaneous time-reversal symmetry breaking accompanied by vortex motion as the system approaches the two-dimensional limit. Our findings open new avenues for exploring dimensionality-driven exotic superconducting quantum critical phases, and pave the way for a deeper understanding of zero-field superconducting diode effects.</description>

      <title>Indirect Magnetoelectric Coupling via Skew Scattering by Orbital Angular Momentum</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.22324v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent experimental observations of exchange bias in the La$_{0.67}$Sr$_{0.33}$MnO$_{3}$/LaAlO$_{3}$/SrTiO$_{3}$ heterostructure, which lacks an intrinsic antiferromagnetic layer, have sparked theoretical investigations into the underlying mechanisms. While traditional theories suggest that exchange bias in spin valve structures is mediated by conduction electrons in metallic spacers, the transport properties of LaAlO$3$ are dominated by its valence electrons, raising new questions about the origin of this phenomenon. In this work, we propose a theoretical model where the electronic band structure of LaAlO$_3$ is treated as a valence band perturbed by skew scattering, which is sensitive to orbital angular momentum. Our analysis reveals a significant magnetoelectric effect at the La$_{0.67}$Sr$_{0.33}$MnO$_3$/LaAlO$_3$ interface, which induces a coupling between the interface magnetization and the electric field from two dimensional electron gas at LaAlO$_{3}$/SrTiO$_{3}$ interface. This magnetoelectric coupling is found to drive the observed exchange bias, highlighting the role of electric polarization in influencing the magnetic properties of the heterostructure.</description>

      <title>Weak valley-layer coupling and valley polarization in centrosymmetric $\mathrm{FeCl_2}$ monolayer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22392v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using the valley degree of freedom as a carrier of information for storage and processing, valley polarization plays a crucial role. A variety of mechanisms for valley polarization have been proposed, among which the valley-layer coupling mechanism involves the induction of valley polarization by an out-of-plane electric field. Here, through first-principles calculations, it is found that the weak valley-layer coupling can exist in centrosymmetric $\mathrm{FeCl_2}$ monolayer. It is crucial to note that valley-layer coupling only occurs with out-of-plane magnetization and vanishes with in-plane magnetization. Compared to monolayers with strong valley-layer coupling, $\mathrm{FeCl_2}$ requires an extremely strong electric field to achieve the same magnitude of valley splitting. Valley polarization switching can be achieved by manipulating the directions of magnetization and electric field. Reversing only one of these directions switches the valley polarization, whereas reversing both simultaneously leaves it unchanged. Moreover, the simply stacked bilayer $\mathrm{FeCl_2}$, as a $PT$-antiferromagnet, can spontaneously achieve valley polarization without an external electric field, highlighting its potential for miniaturization, ultradensity, and ultrafast performance. Our work provides guidelines for identifying materials with weak valley-layer coupling, and further enables the regulation of valley polarization through electric field and stacking engineering.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Sweet and Sour Regions in Bichromatically Driven Floquet Qubits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.22606v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern superconducting and semiconducting quantum hardware use external charge and microwave flux drives to both tune and operate devices. However, each external drive is susceptible to low-frequency (e.g., $1/f$) noise that can drastically reduce the decoherence lifetime of the device unless the drive is placed at specific operating points that minimize the sensitivity to fluctuations. We show that operating a qubit in a driven frame using two periodic drives of distinct commensurate frequencies can have advantages over both monochromatically driven frames and static frames with constant offset drives. Employing Floquet theory, we analyze the spectral and lifetime characteristics of a two-level system under weak and strong bichromatic drives, identifying drive-parameter regions with high coherence (sweet spots) and highlighting regions where coherence is limited by additional sensitivity to noise at the drive frequencies (sour spots). We present analytical expressions for quasienergy gaps and dephasing rates, demonstrating that bichromatic driving can alleviate the trade-off between DC and AC noise robustness observed in monochromatic drives. This approach reveals continuous manifolds of doubly dynamical sweet spots, along which drive parameters can be varied without compromising coherence. Our results motivate further study of bichromatic Floquet engineering as a powerful strategy for maintaining tunability in high-coherence quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Multi higher-order Dirac and nodal line semimetals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.17152v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, there has been a surge of interest in exploring higher-order topology and their semi-metallic counterparts, particularly in the context of Dirac, Weyl, and nodal line semimetals, termed as higher-order Dirac semimetal (HODSM), higher-order Weyl semimetal, and higher-order nodal line semimetal (HONLSM). The HODSM phase exhibits hinge Fermi arcs (FAs) with a quantized higher-order topological invariant. Conversely, the HONLSM phase is a hybrid-order topological phase manifesting both drumhead-like surface states and hinge FAs as a signature of first- and second-order topology, and also possesses both first- and second-order topological invariants. In this work, we investigate a tight binding model for multi-HODSM (mHODSM) hosting multiple hinge FAs having a quantized quadrupolar winding number (QWN) greater than one. Furthermore, we obtain a multi-HONLSM (mHONLSM) phase from the mHODSM by applying an external magnetic field, which breaks the $PT$-symmetry. The mHONLSM phase possesses both the dipolar winding number, non-vanishing only inside the nodal loops, being the representative invariant for first-order topology, and the QWN, featuring both drumhead-like surface states and multiple hinge FAs. We study the spectral properties of the mHODSM and mHONLSM in different geometries. We also investigate the hinge FA-mediated transport in HONLSM employing a two-terminal setup.</description>

Abstract: We study a cylindrical plasmonic waveguide consisting of a magnetic Weyl semimetal embedded in a dielectric medium. We determine the dispersion relation of the surface plasmon polaritons and show how it depends on the plasma frequency, the radius of the semimetal and the separation between the nodes. We show that the band structure, which modifies the electrodynamics in the medium, manifests itself through a pronounced asymmetry in the dispersion curves and a giant splitting in the group velocity, with the orbital angular momentum as a control parameter for the direction of propagation.</description>

      <title>Observation of giant nonlinear Hall conductivity in Bernal bilayer graphene</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11156v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a system of two-dimensional electrons, a combination of broken symmetry, interactions, and nontrivial topology can conspire to give rise to a nonlinear transport regime, where electric current density scales as the square of electric field. This regime has become a venue for exciting discoveries such as the nonlinear Hall effect and diode-like nonreciprocal transport. However, interpretation of experimental data is challenging in the nonlinear regime as DC transport is described by a rank-3 conductivity tensor with 6 free parameters. Here, we resolve this challenge by analytically solving for the nonlinear potential distribution across the disk sample for an arbitrary linear and nonlinear conductivity tensors. This allows us to unambiguously extract all components of the nonlinear tensor from experimental measurement. Using this novel tool, we identify giant nonlinear Hall effect in Bernal bilayer graphene. Our methodology provides the first systematic framework for interpreting nonlinear transport and uncovers a new route towards understanding quasi-2D materials.</description>

      <title>Extended Landauer-B\"{u}ttiker Formula for Current through Open Quantum Systems with Gain or Loss</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.00844v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Landauer-B\"{u}ttiker formula, which characterizes the current flowing through a finite region connected to leads, has significantly advanced our understanding of transport. We extend this formula to describe particle and energy currents with gain or loss in the intermediate region by using the Lindblad-Keldysh formalism. Based on the derived formula, several novel effects induced by gain or loss in the current are discussed: the breaking of inversion symmetry in the gain and loss terms or in the system can lead to current generation; the anomalous phenomenon that disorder can induce current generation; the presence of gain and loss makes the thermal and electrical conductances continuous and ensures they follow the Wiedemann-Franz law even outside the energy band; the effect of bond loss-induced skin effect on current. This work deepens and extends our understanding of transport phenomena in open systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.01307v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the thermoelectrical transport transverse to conventional and topological Josephson junctions with a central quantum dot (QD). For that purpose, we derive an effective resonant tunneling model where the QD is renormalized with an induced superconducting gap. By applying the Keldysh Green's function technique, we compute the local density of states as well as the transmission functions. In the latter case, we observe that the Andreev bound states forming on the QD are inverted if the junction has $p$-wave symmetry, meaning that electron and hole orbitals switch roles. We calculate the thermoelectric transport coefficients both analytically and numerically and show how the induced gaps and the band inversion are reflected in the electrical and heat conductance as well as the Seebeck coefficient, the latter experiencing a sign change in the topological case.</description>

Abstract: A photonic heat amplifier (PHA) designed for cryogenic operations is introduced and analyzed. This device comprises two variable-range-hopping reservoirs connected by lossless lines, which allow them to exchange heat through photonic modes. This configuration enables negative differential thermal conductance (NDTC), which can be harnessed to amplify thermal signals. To achieve this, one reservoir is maintained at a high temperature, serving as the source terminal of a thermal transistor. Concurrently, in the other one, we establish tunnel contacts to metallic reservoirs, which function as the gate and drain terminals. With this arrangement, it is possible to control the heat flux exchange between the source and drain by adjusting the gate temperature. We present two different parameter choices that yield different performances: the first emphasizes modulating the source-drain heat current, while the second focuses on the modulation of the colder temperature variable range hopping reservoir. Lastly, we present a potential design variation in which all electronic reservoirs are thermally connected through only photonic modes, allowing interactions between distant elements. The proposal of the PHA addresses the lack of thermal transistors and amplifiers in the mK range while being compatible with the rich toolbox of circuit quantum electrodynamics. It can be adapted to various applications, including sensing and developing thermal circuits and control devices at sub-Kelvin temperatures, which are relevant to quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Roadmap for Quantum Nanophotonics with Free Electrons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.14678v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Over the past century, continuous advancements in electron microscopy have enabled the synthesis, control, and characterization of high-quality free-electron beams. These probes carry an evanescent electromagnetic field that can drive localized excitations and provide high-resolution information on material structures and their optical responses, currently reaching the sub-{\aa}ngstr\"om and few-meV regime. Moreover, combining free electrons with pulsed light sources in ultrafast electron microscopy adds temporal resolution in the sub-femtosecond range while offering enhanced control of the electron wave function. Beyond their exceptional capabilities for time-resolved spectromicroscopy, free electrons are emerging as powerful tools in quantum nanophotonics, on par with photons in their ability to carry and transfer quantum information, create entanglement within and with a specimen, and reveal previously inaccessible details on nanoscale quantum phenomena. This Roadmap outlines the current state of this rapidly evolving field, highlights key challenges and opportunities, and discusses future directions through a collection of topical sections prepared by leading experts.</description>

      <title>A local quantized marker for topological magnons from circular dichroism</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.17374v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The low-energy excitations of a spin system can display Bloch bands with non-trivial topological properties. While topological magnons can be identified through the detection of chiral propagating modes at the sample's edge, an intriguing approach would be to directly probe their topological nature via localized measurements deep within the bulk. In this work, we introduce a quantized topological marker suitable for topological spin systems, which can be experimentally accessed by combining a local driven-dissipative preparation scheme with a circular-dichroic measurement. Demonstrated on a 2D ferromagnetic Heisenberg spin system incorporating Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions, this method effectively maps a local Chern marker with single-site resolution while inherently accounting for magnon losses. Our work offers a general strategy to access local topological markers in bosonic settings within a driven-dissipative framework.</description>

Abstract: Fluctuations of observables provide unique insights into the nature of physical systems, and their study stands as a cornerstone of both theoretical and experimental science. Generalized fluctuations, or cumulants, provide information beyond the mean and variance of an observable. In this letter, we develop a systematic method to determine the asymptotic behavior of cumulants of local observables as the region becomes large. Our analysis reveals that the expansion is closely tied to the geometric characteristics of the region and its boundary, with coefficients given by convex moments of the connected correlation function: the latter is integrated against intrinsic volumes of convex polytopes built from the coordinates, which can be interpreted as average shadows. A particular application of our method shows that, in two dimensions, the leading behavior of odd cumulants of conserved quantities is topological, specifically depending on the Euler characteristic of the region. We illustrate these results with the paradigmatic strongly-interacting system of two-dimensional quantum Hall state at filling fraction $1/2$, by performing Monte-Carlo calculations of the skewness (third cumulant) of particle number in the Laughlin state.</description>

      <title>Bogolon-mediated electromagnetic wave absorption in multicomponent Bose-Einstein condensates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.05738v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the electromagnetic wave absorption process in a coherently coupled two-component Bose-Einstein condensate model in different dimensionality at zero temperature. As the analogue of phonon in the solid state physics, the elementary excitation of the Bose-Einstein condensate is described by Bogoliubov quasiparticle or bogolon for short. Due to the small magnitude of the sound velocity of the bogolon, the absorption process is prohibited by the conservation of energy and momentum. To surmount this depression, the additional degree of freedom must be considered inside of the simple Bose gas model. In this article, we develop a microscopical theory for electromagnetic wave absorption by a two-component Bose-Einstein condensate and investigate the absorption rate dependence in different dimensions. Our calculation shows the possibility of manipulating the absorption property by tuning the parameters of the condensates.</description>

      <title>Tailoring nuclear spins order with defects: a Quantum Technology CAD study</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.19675v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The full design of relevant systems for quantum applications, ranging from quantum simulation to sensing, is presented using a combination of atomistic methods. A prototypical system features a two-dimensional ordered distribution of spins interacting with out-of-plane spin drivers/probes. It could be realized in wide-bandgap semiconductors through open-volume point defects and functionalized surfaces with low Miller indexes. We study the case of defect electron spins (driver / probe) interacting via hyperfine coupling with $S=1/2$ nuclear spins of H atoms chemisorbed onto \hkl(001) and \hkl(111) 3C-SiC surfaces. We simulate the system fabrication processes with super lattice kinetic Monte Carlo, demonstrating that epitaxial growth under time-dependent conditions is a viable method for achieving controlled abundance or depletion of near-surface point defects. Quantum features are evaluated by means of extensive numerical analysis at a full quantum mechanical level based on calibrated models of interacting spin systems. This analysis includes both stationary (relative stability of ordered states) and time-dependent (protocols) conditions, achieved varying the model parameters (in our case the atomic structure and the external field). We identify a rich scenario of metastable spin-waves in the quantum simulation setting. The interaction between protocols and variable system configurations could hinder the effectiveness of the preparation/measurement phases.</description>

      <title>The Role of Flexoelectric Coupling and Chemical Strains in the Emergence of Polar Chiral Nano-Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14317v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This review examines the conditions that lead to the formation of flexo-sensitive chiral polar structures in thin films and core-shell ferroelectric nanoparticles. It also analyzes possible mechanisms by which the flexoelectric effect impacts the polarization structure in core-shell ferroelectric nanoparticles. Special attention is given to the role of the anisotropic flexoelectric effect in forming a unique type of polarization states with distinct chiral properties, referred to as "flexons". In the first part of the review, we study the influence of the flexoelectric coupling on the polarity, chirality and branching of metastable labyrinthine domain structures in uniaxial ferroelectric core-shell nanoparticles. We reveal that the transition from sinuous branched domain stripes to spiral-like domains occurs gradually as the flexoelectric coupling strength is increased. Our findings indicate that the joint action of flexoelectric effect and chemical strains, termed as "flexo-chemical" coupling, can significantly influence the effective Curie temperature, polarization distribution, domain morphology, and chirality in multiaxial ferroelectric core-shell nanoparticles. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the combination of flexo-chemical coupling and screening effects leads to the appearance and stabilization of a chiral polarization morphology in nanoflakes of van der Waals ferrielectrics. In the second part of the review, we discuss several advanced applications of flexo-sensitive chiral polar structures in core-shell ferroelectric nanoparticles for nanoelectronics elements and cryptography. We underline the possibilities of the flexoelectric control of multiple-degenerated labyrinthine states, which may correspond to a differential negative capacitance (NC) state stabilized in the uniaxial ferroelectric core by the presence of a screening shell.</description>

      <title>Quantum confinement theory of ultra-thin films: electronic, thermal and superconducting properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08696v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The miniaturization of electronic devices has led to the prominence, in technological applications, of ultra-thin films with a thickness ranging from a few tens of nanometers to just about 1-2 nanometers. While these materials are still effectively 3D in many respects, traditional theories as well as ab initio methods struggle to describe their properties as measured in experiments. In particular, standard approaches to quantum confinement rely on hard-wall boundary conditions, which neglect the unavoidable, ubiquitous, atomic-scale irregularities of the interface. Recently, a unified theoretical approach to quantum confinement has been proposed which is able to effectively take the real nature of the interface into account, and can efficiently be implemented in synergy with microscopic theories. Its predictions for the electronic properties such as electrical conductivity of semiconductor thin films or critical temperature of superconducting thin films, have been successfully verified in comparison with experimental data. The same confinement principles lead to new laws for the phonon density of states and for the heat capacity of thin films, again in agreement with the available experimental data.</description>
