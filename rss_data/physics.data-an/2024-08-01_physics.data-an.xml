      <title>Low dimensional fragment-based descriptors for property predictions in inorganic materials with machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21146v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent times, the use of machine learning in materials design and discovery has aided to accelerate the discovery of innovative materials with extraordinary properties, which otherwise would have been driven by a laborious and time-consuming trial-and-error process. In this study, a simple yet powerful fragment-based descriptor, Low Dimensional Fragment Descriptors (LDFD), is proposed to work in conjunction with machine learning models to predict important properties of a wide range of inorganic materials such as perovskite oxides, metal halide perovskites, alloys, semiconductor, and other materials system and can also be extended to work with interfaces. To predict properties, the generation of descriptors requires only the structural formula of the materials and, in presence of identical structure in the dataset, additional system properties as input. And the generation of descriptors involves few steps, encoding the formula in binary space and reduction of dimensionality, allowing easy implementation and prediction. To evaluate descriptor performance, six known datasets with up to eight components were compared. The method was applied to properties such as band gaps of perovskites and semiconductors, lattice constant of magnetic alloys, bulk/shear modulus of superhard alloys, critical temperature of superconductors, formation enthalpy and energy above hull convex of perovskite oxides. An advanced python-based data mining tool matminer was utilized for the collection of data. The prediction accuracies are equivalent to the quality of the training data and show comparable effectiveness as previous studies. This method should be extendable to any inorganic material systems which can be subdivided into layers or crystal structures with more than one atom site, and with the progress of data mining the performance should get better with larger and unbiased datasets.</description>

      <title>TrackSorter: A Transformer-based sorting algorithm for track finding in High Energy Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21290v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Track finding in particle data is a challenging pattern recognition problem in High Energy Physics. It takes as inputs a point cloud of space points and labels them so that space points created by the same particle have the same label. The list of space points with the same label is a track candidate. We argue that this pattern recognition problem can be formulated as a sorting problem, of which the inputs are a list of space points sorted by their distances away from the collision points and the outputs are the space points sorted by their labels. In this paper, we propose the TrackSorter algorithm: a Transformer-based algorithm for pattern recognition in particle data. TrackSorter uses a simple tokenization scheme to convert space points into discrete tokens. It then uses the tokenized space points as inputs and sorts the input tokens into track candidates. TrackSorter is a novel end-to-end track finding algorithm that leverages Transformer-based models to solve pattern recognition problems. It is evaluated on the TrackML dataset and has good track finding performance.</description>

      <title>A new direct method of continuous unwrapping phase from a single interferogram</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21607v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A new method recovers the phase difference of interfering wavefronts from a pattern of interference fringes, avoiding the phase discontinuity problem. The method relies on the numerical solution of one-dimensional first-order ordinary differential equations. The solution of each equation allows to compute a corresponding cross section of the two-dimensional phase, leading to the effective recovery of the phase surface. The unwrapping procedure can be performed in each orthogonal direction.</description>

      <title>Statistical divergences in high-dimensional hypothesis testing and a modern technique for estimating them</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06397v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hypothesis testing in high dimensional data is a notoriously difficult problem without direct access to competing models' likelihood functions. This paper argues that statistical divergences can be used to quantify the difference between the population distributions of observed data and competing models, justifying their use as the basis of a hypothesis test. We go on to point out how modern techniques for functional optimization let us estimate many divergences, without the need for population likelihood functions, using samples from two distributions alone. We use a physics-based example to show how the proposed two-sample test can be implemented in practice, and discuss the necessary steps required to mature the ideas presented into an experimental framework.</description>
