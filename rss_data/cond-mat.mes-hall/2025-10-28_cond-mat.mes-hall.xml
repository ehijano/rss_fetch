      <title>Metallic Electro-Optic Effect in Twisted Double-Bilayer Graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23784v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent theoretical advances have highlighted the role of Bloch state intrinsic properties in enabling unconventional electro-optic (EO) phenomena in bulk metals, offering novel strategies for dynamic optical control in quantum materials. Here, we identify an alternative EO mechanism in bulk metallic systems that arises from the interplay between Berry curvature and the orbital magnetic moment of Bloch electrons. Focusing on twisted double-bilayer graphene (TDBG), we show that the enhanced intrinsic properties of moir\'e Bloch bands give rise to a sizable linear magnetoelectric EO response, a first-order, electric-field-induced non-Hermitian correction to the gyrotropic magnetic susceptibility. This mechanism dominates in $C_{3z}$-symmetric TDBG, where EO contributions originating from the Berry curvature dipole (BCD) are symmetry-forbidden. Our calculations reveal giant, gate-tunable linear and circular dichroism in the terahertz regime, establishing a robust and tunable platform for ultrafast EO modulation in two-dimensional materials beyond the BCD paradigm.</description>

      <title>Ballistic transport in 1D Rashba systems in the context of Majorana nanowires</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23961v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent work on Majorana-bound states in semiconductor-superconductor hybrid structures has elucidated the key role of unintentional (and unknown) disorder (producing low-energy Andreev-bound states) in the system, which is detrimental to the emergence of Majorana-carrying topological superconductivity artificially engineered through the combination of superconductivity, Zeeman spin splitting, and Rashba spin-orbit coupling. In particular, the disorder must be smaller than the superconducting gap for the appearance of Majorana modes, but the disorder-induced appearance of subgap Andreev-bound states suppresses the Majorana modes. We theoretically investigate, as a function of disorder, the normal state ballistic transport properties of nanowires with and without superconductors in order to provide guidance on how to experimentally estimate the level of disorder. Experimentally, the superconductivity is suppressed simply by rotating the magnetic field appropriately, so both physics can be studied in the same set-up. In particular, the presence of spin-orbit coupling and Zeeman splitting produces a helical gap in the 1D electronic band structure, which should have clear signatures in ballistic transport unless these signatures are suppressed by disorder and/or Fabry-P\'erot resonances associated with the finite wire sizes. Our work provides a benchmarking of when and what signatures of the putative helical gap (which is essential for the emergence of Majorana modes by leading to a single Fermi surface) could manifest in realistic nanowires.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Layer Hall Effect and Detection of the Hidden Berry Curvature Dipole in $\mathcal{PT}$-Symmetric Antiferromagnetic Insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23971v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent experimental and theoretical studies have revealed the emergence of a linear layer Hall effect (LHE) induced by hidden Berry curvature in \textrm{MnBi}$_{2}$\textrm{Te}$_{4}$ thin films. This phenomenon underscores the layer degree of freedom as a novel mechanism for generating Hall transport in layered materials, providing a new pathway to probe and manipulate the internal structure of fully compensated topological antiferromagnets (AFMs). In this work, we predict a nonlinear LHE in $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric layered AFMs, which manifests as a detectable nonlinear Hall conductivity even with respect to the AFM order and odd with respect to the vertical electric field, in contrast to the linear LHE. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the nonlinear Hall currents induced by the hidden BCD and quantum metric dipole (QMD) obey distinct symmetries and flow in different directions. Our proposed nonlinear LHE establishes an experimentally advantageous framework for exclusively probing the hidden BCD quantum geometry.</description>

      <title>Spin-dependent photoluminescence in carbon-based quantum dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24062v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ability to modulate the photoluminescence (PL) of nanomaterials via spin-related effects is vital for many emerging quantum technologies, with nanoscale quantum sensing and imaging being particular areas of focus. Carbon-based quantum dots (CQDs) are among the most common forms of luminescent nanomaterials, appealing due to their ease of synthesis, tunability through organic chemistry, high brightness, and natural biocompatibility. However, the observation of room temperature, spin-dependent PL has remained elusive. Here we report on the observation of PL modulation of CQDs by magnetic fields ($\sim 10$ mT) under ambient conditions. We synthesize a series of CQDs using 19 different amino acids, which have a range of PL emission spectra and exhibit a clear magneto-PL effect (up to $\sim 1$% change). Furthermore, an electron spin resonance is detected in the PL with a g-factor of g $\approx$ 2, suggesting a process similar to the radical pair mechanism is responsible. Finally, we show that the magneto-PL contrast decreases in the presence of paramagnetic species, which we attribute to an increase in magnetic noise-induced spin relaxation in the CQDs. Our work brings new functionalities to these commonly used and biocompatible luminescent nanoparticles, opening new opportunities for in situ quantum sensing and imaging of biological samples.</description>

      <title>Identifying geometric third-order nonlinear transport in disordered materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24239v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In third-order nonlinear transport, a voltage can be measured in response to the cube of a driving current as a result of the quantum geometric effects, which has attracted tremendous attention. However, in realistic materials where disorder scattering also contributes to nonlinear transport, identifying the geometric mechanisms remains a challenge. We find a total of 20 mechanisms of third-order nonlinear transport by developing a comprehensive theory that treats the geometric effects and disorder scattering on an equal footing. More importantly, we find that 12 of these mechanisms can be unambiguously identified, by deriving a scaling law that expresses the third-order nonlinear Hall conductivity as a polynomial in the linear longitudinal conductivity. We apply this theory to identify the geometric mechanisms of third-order nonlinear transport in materials both with and without time-reversal symmetry, such as 2D materials, topological materials, and altermagnets. This theory further promotes nonlinear transport as a probe of geometric effects and phase transitions in quantum materials.</description>

      <title>Viscous AC current-driven nanomotors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent discovery that electrons in nano-scale conductors can act like a highly viscous liquid has triggered a surge of research activities investigating consequences of this surprising fact. Here we demonstrate that the electronic viscosity has an enormous influence on the operation of a prototypical AC-current-driven nano-motor. The design of this prototype consists of a diatomic molecule immersed in an otherwise homogeneous electron liquid which carries an AC current. The motion of the diatomic is determined by a subtle balance between the current-induced forces and electronic friction. By ab-initio time-dependent density-functional simulations we demonstrate that the diatomic performs a continuous rotation provided the amplitude and frequency of the imposed AC current lie within certain islands of stability. Outside these islands the nuclear motion is either chaotic or comes to a stand-still. The proposed design of the nano-motor is the conceptually simplest realization of the idea of an molecular waterwheel sandwiched between conducting leads</description>

      <title>Phase-Rotated Altermagnets as Chern Valves for Topological Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24294v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the emerging control of Berry-curvature textures in altermagnets, we explore a two-terminal configuration where a topological-insulator film is interfaced with two altermagnetic electrodes whose crystalline phases can be rotated independently. The proximity coupling imprints each momentum-dependent of the altermagnet spin texture onto the Dirac surface states, giving rise to an angular mass whose sign follows the lattice orientation. Adjusting the phase of one electrode redefines this mass pattern, thereby tuning the number and spatial distribution of chiral edge channels. This results in discrete conductance steps and a reversible inversion of the thermoelectric coefficient-achieved without external magnetic fields or net magnetization. A compact Dirac model captures both the quantized switching and its resilience to moderate disorder. Overall, this symmetry-driven mechanism provides a practical and low-dissipation route to programmable topological transport via lattice rotation.</description>

      <title>Bounds on Lorentz-violating parameters in magnetically confined 2D systems: A phenomenological approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24301v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a unified, SI-consistent framework to constrain minimal SME coefficients $a_\mu$ and $b_\mu$ using magnetically confined two-dimensional electron systems under a uniform magnetic field. Working in the nonrelativistic (Schr\"odinger--Pauli) limit with effective mass, we derive the radial problem for cylindrical geometries and identify how spatial components ($\mathbf a,\mathbf b$) reshape the effective potential, via $1/r$ and $r$ terms or spin-selective offsets, while scalar components ($a_0,b_0$) act through a global energy shift and a spin-momentum coupling. Phenomenological upper bounds follow from requiring LV-induced shifts to lie below typical spectroscopic resolutions: $|a_0|\lesssim\delta E$, $|b_z|\lesssim\delta E/\hbar$, and compact expressions for $|a_\varphi|$ and $|b_0|$ that expose their dependence on device scales ($r_0$, $B_0$, $\mu$, $m$). Dimensional analysis clarifies that, in this regime, spatial $a_i$ carry momentum dimension and $b_i$ carry inverse-time/length dimensions, ensuring gauge-independent, unit-consistent reporting. Finite-difference eigenvalue calculations validate the scaling laws and illustrate spectral signatures across realistic parameter sets. The results show that scalar sectors (notably $a_0$) are tightly constrained by state-of-the-art $\mu$eV-resolution probes, while spatial and axial sectors benefit from spin- and $m$-resolved spectroscopy and geometric leverage, providing a reproducible pathway to test Lorentz symmetry in condensed-matter platforms.</description>

      <title>Density-driven scattering and valley splitting in undoped Si/SiGe two-dimensional electron system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24641v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Undoped Si-SiGe two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) provide an ideal platform for hosting quantum-dot spin-qubits owing enhanced spin dephasing times and compatibility with standard CMOS technology. The strained Si quantum well reduces the valley degeneracy into two closely spaced ones. The existence of a near-degenerate valley state act as a leakage channel and compromises gate fidelity. A robust and uniform valley splitting across the entire chip is crucial for achieving scalability in the architecture and reliability in operation. Imperfections such as broadened interfaces, alloy disorders and atomic steps significantly compromise the valley splitting. The associated scattering mechanisms play detrimental roles in the performance of the qubits. In this manuscript, exploiting low-temperature magnetotransport measurements, we investigate the scattering mechanisms and valley splitting in a high-mobility undoped Si-SiGe 2DEG. At lower carrier densities, transport is limited by remote impurity scattering, whereas at higher densities, background impurity scattering near the quantum well dominates. Both the transport and quantum lifetimes of the charge carriers increase with carrier concentration, due to the enhancement in the impurity screening. Magnetic-field-induced confinement effect also is found to improve the valley splitting. Current-biasing measurements reveals the role of carrier heating in the visibility of valley splitting and reveal a temperature limited valley splitting of approximately 100 micro-eV. These results provide critical insight into scattering-dominated regimes and valley splitting in undoped Si-SiGe, advancing its potential for silicon-based quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Virtual Gates Enabled by Digital Surrogate of Quantum Dot Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24656v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advances in quantum technologies are often limited by slow device characterization, complex tuning require- ments, and scalability challenges. Spin qubits in electrostatically defined quantum dots provide a promising platform but are not exempt from these limitations. Simulations enhance our understanding of such devices, and in many cases, rapid feedback between measurements and simulations can guide the development of op- timal design and control strategies. Here, we introduce a modular, graph-based simulator that acts as a digital surrogate for a semiconductor quantum dot device, where computationally expensive processes are accelerated using deep learning. We demonstrate its potential by estimating crosstalk effects between gate electrodes and applying these estimates to construct virtual gates in a quantum dot device. We validate our approach through comparison with experiments on a double quantum dot defined in a Ge/SiGe heterostructure. We envision that this simulation framework will advance semiconductor-based quantum technologies by enabling more efficient design, characterization, and control of complex devices.</description>

      <title>Bonding Character as a Descriptor for Huang-Rhys Factors in Optically Active Defects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24689v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The electron phonon coupling of a defect characterized by its Huang Rhys (HR) factor is a crucial metric determining its excited-state dynamics, relevant to defect applications as qubits and quantum emitters. However, HR factors remain challenging to calculate from first principles, complicated by convergence issues in excited-state relaxation and time consuming phonon calculations. Even when calculated, HR factors lack a rational design principle. Here we show that an orbital-based descriptor can be used to rationalize and efficiently estimate HR factors. Combining this descriptor with a ground state deformation technique allows circumventing both excited state relaxation and full phonon calculations. Specifically, our descriptor for HR factors is constructed using bonding character differences obtained from ground state density functional theory, measured using crystal orbital Hamilton populations. We demonstrate this descriptor for prototypical hBN defects and the diamond NV center. This orbital-based descriptor can be potentially used in high throughput computational screening to identify ideal candidates of spin qubits and SPEs.</description>

      <title>Topological protection of photon-pair generation in nonlinear waveguide arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23796v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Harnessing topological effects offers a promising route to protect quantum states of light from imperfections, potentially enabling more robust platforms for quantum information processing. This capability is particularly relevant for active photonic circuits that generate quantum light directly on-chip. Here, we explore topological effects on photon-pair generation via spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) in nonlinear waveguide arrays, both theoretically and experimentally. A systematic comparison of homogeneous, trivial, and topological Su-Schrieffer-Heeger arrays reveals that only the topological configuration preserves a stable SPDC resonance spectrum under disorder in the tunnel couplings, with fluctuations in the resonance position reduced by more than one order of magnitude. An analytical model supports our experimental observations by linking this robustness to the band-structure properties of the interacting modes. These findings establish quadratic nonlinear waveguide arrays as a promising platform to explore the interplay of nonlinearity, topology, and disorder in quantum photonic circuits.</description>

      <title>A Scalable Superconducting Circuit Framework for Emulating Physics in Hyperbolic Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23827v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Theoretical studies and experiments in the last six years have revealed the potential for novel behaviours and functionalities in device physics through the synthetic engineering of negatively-curved spaces. For instance, recent developments in hyperbolic band theory have unveiled the emergence of higher-dimensional eigenstates -- features fundamentally absent in conventional Euclidean systems. At the same time, superconducting quantum circuits have emerged as a leading platform for quantum analogue emulations and digital simulations in scalable architectures. Here, we introduce a scalable superconducting circuit framework for the analogue quantum emulation of tight-binding models on hyperbolic and kagome-like lattices. Using this approach, we experimentally realize three distinct lattices, including, for the first time to our knowledge, a hyperbolic lattice whose unit cell resides on a genus-3 Riemann surface. Our method encodes the hyperbolic metric directly into capacitive couplings between high-quality superconducting resonators, enabling tenable reproduction of spectral and localization properties while overcoming major scalability and spectral resolution limitations of previous designs. These results set the stage for large-scale experimental studies of hyperbolic materials in condensed matter physics and lay the groundwork for realizing hyperbolic quantum processors, with potential implications for both fundamental physics and quantum computing</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.24162v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate the possibility of a genuine quantum advantage in the efficiency of quantum batteries by analyzing a model that enables a consistent comparison between quantum and classical regimes. Our system consists of $N$ harmonic oscillator cells coupled to a common thermal reservoir, evolving through Gaussian states. We define the global efficiency as the ratio of extractable work (ergotropy) to stored energy, and derive analytical bounds that distinguish, in order of increasing efficiency, regimes characterized by classical squeezing, quantum squeezing without entanglement, and genuine entanglement. Moreover, numerical simulations support the emergence of a similar hierarchy for the thermodynamic efficiency, defined as the ratio between ergotropy and the total thermodynamic cost of the charging process.</description>

      <title>Ultrastrong Magnon-Photon Coupling in Superconductor/Antiferromagnet/Superconductor Heterostructures at Terahertz Frequencies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24264v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We predict the realization of ultrastrong coupling between magnons of antiferromagnets and photons in superconductor/antiferromagnet/superconductor heterostructures at terahertz frequencies, from both quantum and classical perspectives. The hybridization of the two magnon modes with photons strongly depends on the applied magnetic field: at zero magnetic field, only a single antiferromagnetic mode with a lower frequency couples to the photon, forming a magnon-polariton, while using a magnetic field activates coupling for both antiferromagnetic modes. The coupling between magnon and photon is ultrastrong with the coupling constant $\sim$ 100 GHz exceeding 10% of the antiferromagnetic resonant frequency. The superconductor modulates the spin of the resulting magnon-polaritons and the group velocity, achieving values amounting to several tenths of the speed of light, which promises strong tunability of magnon transport in antiferromagnets by superconductors.</description>

      <title>Accelerated relaxation and Mpemba-like effect for operators in open quantum systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24630v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum Mpemba effect occurs when a quantum system, residing far away from the steady state, relaxes faster than a relatively nearer state. We look for the presence of this highly counterintuitive effect in the relaxation dynamics of the operators within the open quantum system setting. Since the operators evolve under a non-trace preserving map, the trace distance of an operator is not a monotonically decaying function of time, unlike its quantum state counterpart. Consequently, the trace distance can not serve as a reliable measure for detecting the Mpemba effect in operator dynamics. We circumvent this problem by defining a \textit{dressed} distance between operators that decays monotonically with time, enabling a generalized framework to explore the Mpemba-like effect for operators. Applying the formalism to various open quantum system settings, we find that, interestingly, in the single qubit case, only accelerated relaxation of operators is possible, while genuine Mpemba-like effects emerge in higher-dimensional systems such as qutrits and beyond. Furthermore, we demonstrate the existence of Mpemba-like effects in nonlocal, non-equilibrium operators, such as current, in a double-quantum-dot setup. Our results, besides offering fundamental insight about the occurrence of the Mpemba-like effect under non-trace preserving dynamics, open avenues for new experimental studies where quicker relaxation of observables could be of significant interest.</description>

      <title>Flat bands in ultra-wide gap two-dimensional germanium dioxide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24685v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We employ first principles density-functional theory (DFT) and the Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE) in the framework of tight-binding based maximally localized Wannier functions (MLWF-TB) model to investigate the electronic and optical properties of free-standing two-dimensional (2D) germanium dioxide phases. All investigated 2D GeO2 polymorphs exhibit ultra-wide band gaps and strong excitonic effects, with flat O-p-derived valence bands tunable under strain. These features allow the design of flat band materials with ultra large electronic gaps in low-dimensional systems, making these materials promising for devices operation at higher voltages and temperatures than conventional semiconductor materials.</description>

      <title>Perpendicular magnetic anisotropy in thin films enables extraordinary spin-wave phenomena: anti-Larmor precession, negative reflection and refraction, multi-reflection and multi-refraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10085v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a theoretical and numerical investigation of the role of perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA) in shaping spin-wave (SW) dynamics under low magnetic fields in thin and ultrathin magnetic films. PMA introduces an in-plane torque that counteracts exchange, dipolar, and Zeeman contributions, fundamentally modifying SW dispersion and inducing a local minimum that, under specific conditions, becomes the lowest frequency across all geometric configurations. This results in a sombrero-shaped dispersion in ultrathin films and a cowboy-hat-like shape in thicker films, where dipolar interactions dominate. Using isofrequency contour (IFC) analysis, we demonstrate that these PMA-induced dispersion shapes enable nontrivial wave phenomena unprecedented in uniform media: bireflection and negative reflection in ultrathin films, and trireflection in thicker films--where a single incident beam splits into three reflected components, two with negative angles. Most remarkably, we predict and demonstrate tri-refraction, where one incident beam generates three refracted beams with two exhibiting negative refraction angles. We further show anti-Larmor precession of magnetization near the dispersion minimum in thicker films, arising from the interplay between PMA-induced and dipolar torques. Systematic simulations across diverse material systems--metallic films, ferrimagnetic garnets, hybrid structures, and multilayers--confirm the universal nature of these phenomena in any PMA system supporting stripe domain transitions. These results open new opportunities to explore wave phenomena beyond magnonics.</description>

      <title>Tunable hyperbolic Landau-level polaritons in charge-neutral graphene nanoribbon metasurfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.23786v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magnetized charge-neutral graphene supports collective hybrid electronic excitations - polaritons - which have quantum origin. In contrast to polaritons in doped graphene, which arise from intraband electronic transitions, those in charge-neutral graphene originate from interband transitions between Landau levels, enabled by the applied magnetic field. Control of such quantum polaritons and shaping their wavefronts remains totally unexplored. Here we design an artificial two-dimensional quantum material formed by charge-neutral graphene nanoribbons exposed to an external magnetic field. In such metasurface, quantum polaritons acquire a hyperbolic dispersion. We find that the topology of the isofrequency curves of quantum hyperbolic magnetoexciton polaritons excited in this quantum material can change, so that the shape of isofrequency curves transforms from a closed to open one by tuning the external magnetic field strength. At the topological transition, we observe canalization phenomena, consisting of the propagation of all the polaritonic plane waves in the continuum along the same direction when excited by a point source. From a general perspective, our fundamental findings introduce a novel type of actively-tunable quantum polaritons with hyperbolic dispersion and can be further generalized to other types of quantum materials and polaritons in them. In practice, quantum hyperbolic polaritons can be used for applications related to quantum sensing and computing.</description>

      <title>Majorana zero modes in semiconductor-superconductor hybrid structures: Defining topology in short and disordered nanowires through Majorana splitting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00128v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Majorana zero modes (MZMs) are bound midgap topological excitations at the ends of a 1D topological superconductor, which must come in pairs. If the two MZMs in the pair are sufficiently well-separated by a distance much larger than their individual localization lengths, then the MZMs behave as non-Abelian anyons which can be braided to carry out fault-tolerant topological quantum computation. In this `topological' regime of well-separated MZMs, their overlap is exponentially small, leading to exponentially small Majorana splitting, thus enabling the MZMs to be topologically protected by the superconducting gap. In real experimental samples, however, the existence of disorder and the finite length of the 1D wire considerably complicate the situation, leading to ambiguities in defining `topology' since the Majorana splitting between the two end modes may not necessarily be small in disordered wires of short length. We theoretically study this situation by calculating the splitting in experimentally relevant short disordered wires, and explicitly investigating the applicability of the `exponential protection' constraint as a function of disorder, wire length, and other system parameters in realistic models of nanowires currently being used experimentally. We find that the exponential regime is highly constrained, and is suppressed for disorder somewhat less than the topological superconducting gap. We provide detailed results and discuss the implications of our theory for the currently active experimental search for MZMs in superconductor-semiconductor hybrid platforms. A general consequence of our work is that `topology' in finite disordered wires may not be uniquely defined, necessitating a careful analysis which depends on the context.</description>

      <title>Spin-Orbit Coupling-Driven Chirality Switching of Spin Waves in Altermagnets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.18585v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Altermagnets host intrinsically chirality-splitting spin waves, which offer an ideal platform for chirality-based computing with low energy consumption and fast dynamics. However, achieving precise and efficient control over spin-wave chirality remains a challenge. Here, we propose a mechanism to switch the chirality of spin waves in altermagnets via electrically induced Rashba spin-orbit coupling (SOC), which is free of tuning external fields. For in-plane spin polarization, SOC introduces a splitting effect opposite to the altermagnetism, leading to spin inversion in the electronic energy bands and chirality reversal in the spin-wave dispersion. By tuning SOC strength, the chirality splitting of spin waves can be controllably modified, enabling chirality switching at fixed resonance conditions, which results in the reversal of transverse spin susceptibility. We further design an experimental setup based on an altermagnet/antiferromagnet heterostructure to realize this mechanism. Our work establish a pathway toward efficient electrical control of spin-wave chirality in altermagnets, facilitating the development of chirality-based spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Non-equilibrium lifetimes of DNA under electronic current in a molecular junction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.08307v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the non-equilibrium mechanical motion of double-stranded DNA in a molecular junction under electronic current using Keldysh-Langevin molecular dynamics. Non-equilibrium electronic force reshapes the effective potential energy surface, and along with electronic viscosity force and stochastic force, governs voltage-dependent dynamics of DNA's collective mechanical coordinate. We compute mean first-passage times to quantify the non-equilibrium lifetime of the DNA junction. At low voltage biases, electron-mechanical motion coupling destabilises DNA by shifting the potential minimum towards critical displacement and suppressing barriers, shortening lifetimes by several orders of magnitude. Unexpectedly, at higher voltages the trend reverses: the potential minimum shifts away from instability and the barrier re-emerges, producing re-stabilisation of the junction. In addition, we demonstrate the Landauer blowtorch effect in this system: coordinate-dependent fluctuations generate a spatially varying effective temperature, changing current-induced dynamics of mechanical degrees of freedom. Apparent temperatures of DNA mechanical motion increase far above ambient due to current-induced heating, correlating with suppressed electronic current at stronger couplings. Our results reveal a non-equilibrium interplay between current-driven forces, dissipation, and fluctuations in DNA junctions, establishing mechanisms for both destabilisation and recovery of DNA stability under electronic current.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.25330v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate that in an ideal Weyl semimetal, in which the Fermi energy coincides with the band-touching nodes, weak direct inter-nodal scattering is irrelevant and, as a result, the chiral charge is (almost) exactly conserved. This leads to an experimentally-observable effect: in an applied magnetic field, the charge transport along the field becomes purely ballistic, with the conductance given by $e^2/h$ per magnetic flux quantum through the sample cross-section. This is the strongest experimental manifestation of nontrivial topology in Weyl and Dirac semimetals.</description>

      <title>iDART: Interferometric Dual-AC Resonance Tracking nano-electromechanical mapping</title>

Abstract: Piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM) has established itself as a very successful and reliable imaging and spectroscopic tool for measuring a wide variety of nanoscale electromechanical functionalities. Quantitative imaging of nanoscale electromechanical phenomena requires high sensitivity while avoiding artifacts induced by large drive biases. Conventional PFM often relies on high voltages to overcome optical detection noise, leading to various non-ideal effects including electrostatic crosstalk, Joule heating, and tip-induced switching. To mitigate this situation, we introduce interferometrically detected, resonance-enhanced dual AC resonance tracking (iDART), which combines femtometer-scale displacement sensitivity of quadrature phase differential interferometry with contact resonance amplification. Through this combination, iDART achieves 10x or greater signal-to-noise improvement over current state of the art PFM approaches including both single frequency interferometric PFM or conventional, resonance enhanced PFM using optical beam detection. In this work, we demonstrate a &gt;10x improvement of imaging sensitivity on PZT and Y-HfO. Switching spectroscopy shows similar improvements, where further demonstrates reliable hysteresis loops at small biases, mitigating nonlinearities and device failures that can occur at higher excitation amplitudes. These results position iDART as a powerful approach for probing conventional ferroelectrics with extremely high signal to noise down to weak piezoelectric systems, extending functional imaging capabilities to thin films, 2D ferroelectrics, beyond-CMOS technologies and bio-materials.</description>

      <title>Spin-Locked Helical Currents and Pure Spin Pumping in Altermagnetic Nanotubes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.19700v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Altermagnetism has been widely explored in 3D and 2D crystals, but its one-dimensional realization remains largely unexplored. Here we propose an altermagnetic nanotube formed by rolling a 2D altermagnet, which converts momentum-odd spin polarization into spin-chirality locking enforced by the screw axis. Unlike curvature-induced magnetization in bent films, the nanotube is mirror-antisymmetric and produce no net magnetization. Two reciprocal effects emerge: (i) a single-spin injection drives a helical current whose handedness is fixed by the spin, yielding opposite-sign axial magnetic fields; and (ii) a time-varying axial flux generates a circumferential Faraday field that drives equal-magnitude but opposite axial charge currents in the two spin channels, producing a pure spin current under open-circuit conditions. As an implication, spin accumulation programs the tube's handedness and can imprint it onto otherwise achiral coaxial nanotubes in one-dimensional van der Waals assemblies. First-principles results for V2Se2O confirm spin-dependent helical wave functions near both band edges, establishing a nonrelativistic route to spin-programmable chiral nanodevices and compact flux generators/charge-neutral spin injectors without static magnetic bias.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.20678v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate that conductance anomalies can arise in a clean, adiabatic quantum point contact when a channel is partially open. Even for a smooth barrier potential, backscattering induces Friedel oscillations that, via electron interactions, generate a singular correction to the conductance. This correction is maximized when the channel is half-open, resulting in a reduction of conductance. In addition, a magnetic field applied perpendicular to the spin-orbit axis modifies the single-particle spectrum, resulting in conductance oscillations via Fabry-P\'erot-type interference, as well as a non-monotonic field dependence of the anomaly. Our findings reveal a universal mechanism by which interactions modify the conductance of an ideal partially open channel and offer a possible explanation for the anomalous features observed in experiments.</description>

      <title>Engineering 2D square lattice Hubbard models in 90$^\circ$ twisted Ge/SnX (X=S, Se) moir\'e supperlattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05626v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Due to the large-period superlattices emerging in moire two-dimensional (2D) materials, electronic states in such systems exhibit low energy flat bands that can be used to simulate strongly correlated physics in a highly tunable setup. While many investigations have thus far focused on moire flat bands and emergent correlated electron physics in triangular, honeycomb and quasi-one-dimensional lattices, tunable moire realizations of square lattices subject to strong correlations remain elusive. Here we propose a feasible scheme to construct moire square lattice systems by twisting two or more layers of 2D materials in a rectangular lattice by 90 degrees. We demonstrate the concept with twisted GeX/SnX (X=S, Se) moire superlattices and calculate their electronic structures from first principles. We show that the lowest conduction flat band in these systems can be described by a square lattice Hubbard model with parameters which can be controlled by varying the choice of host materials, number of layers, and external electric fields. In particular, twisted double bilayer GeSe realizes a square lattice Hubbard model with strong frustration due to the next nearest neighbour hopping that could host unconventional superconductivity{, in close analogy to the Hubbard model for copper-oxygen planes of cuprate high-temperature superconductors}. The presented scheme uses 90-degree twisted 2D materials with rectangular unit cells as a promising platform for realizing the physical phenomena of square lattice Hubbard models, establishing a new route for studying its rich phase diagram of magnetism, charge order, and unconventional superconductivity in a highly tunable setting.</description>
