      <title>Anomalous statistics in the Langevin equation with fluctuating diffusivity: from Brownian yet non-Gaussian diffusion to anomalous diffusion and ergodicity breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12571v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusive motion is a fundamental transport mechanism in physical and biological systems, governing dynamics across a wide range of scales -- from molecular transport to animal foraging. In many complex systems, however, diffusion deviates from classical Brownian behaviour, exhibiting striking phenomena such as Brownian yet non-Gaussian diffusion (BYNGD) and anomalous diffusion. BYNGD describes a frequently observed statistical feature characterised by the coexistence of linear mean-square displacement (MSD) and non-Gaussian displacement distributions. Anomalous diffusion, in contrast, involves a nonlinear time dependence of the MSD and often reflects mechanisms such as trapping, viscoelasticity, heterogeneity, or active processes. Both phenomena challenge the conventional framework based on constant diffusivity and Gaussian statistics. This review focuses the theoretical modelling of such behaviour via the Langevin equation with fluctuating diffusivity (LEFD) -- a flexible stochastic framework that captures essential features of diffusion in heterogeneous media. LEFD not only accounts for BYNGD but also naturally encompasses a wide range of anomalous transport phenomena, including subdiffusion, ageing, and weak ergodicity breaking. Ergodicity is discussed in terms of the correspondence between time and ensemble averages, as well as the trajectory-to-trajectory variability of time-averaged observables. The review further highlights the empirical relevance of LEFD and related models in explaining diverse experimental observations and underscores their value to uncovering the physical mechanisms governing transport in complex systems.</description>

      <title>Nambu Non-equilibrium Thermodynamics III: Application to specific phenomena</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12641v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We apply Nambu non-equilibrium thermodynamics (NNET)-a dynamics with multiple Hamiltonians coupled to entropy-induced dissipation-to paradigmatic far-from-equilibrium systems. Concretely, we construct NNET realizations for the Belousov-Zhabotinsky (BZ) reaction (oscillatory), the Hindmarsh-Rose neuron model (spiking), and the Lorenz and Chen systems (chaotic), and analyze their dynamical and thermodynamic signatures. Across all cases the velocity field cleanly decomposes into a reversible Nambu part and an irreversible entropygradient part, anchored by a model-independent quasi-conserved quantity. This construction reproduces cycles, spikes, and strange-attractor behavior and clarifies transitions among steady, periodic, and chaotic regimes via cross-model diagnostics. These results demonstrate that NNET provides a unified, quantitatively consistent framework for oscillatory, spiking, and chaotic non-equilibrium systems, offering a systematic description beyond the scope of linear-response theories such as Onsager's relations or GENERIC.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic relation for the systems with inhomogeneous distribution of particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12797v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For the system with inhomogeneous distribution of macroscopic parameters we obtain thermodynamic relation which depends on the spatial point (coordinate). In our approach, to obtain such a relation we use the basic ideas of the method of nonequilibrium statistical operator combined with the Hubbard-Stratonovich transformation. First of all, we define the thermodynamic relation for the system with homogeneous distribution of particles. Possible behavior peculiarities of systems with different character of interaction in nonequilibrium case are predicted. By saddle-point method we find the dominant contributions to the partition function and obtain all thermodynamic parameters of the systems with different character of interaction. The formations of saddle state in all systems of interacting particles at different temperatures and particle distributions have the same physical nature and therefore they can be described in the same way. We consider the systems with attractive and repulsive interactions as well as self-gravitating systems.</description>

      <title>A Self-Organized Model for the Flicker Noise in Interacting Two-Dimensional Electron Gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate self-organized criticality in a two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) by introducing a lattice-based model that incorporates electron-electron interactions through the concept of coherence length. Our numerical simulations demonstrate that in the strongly interacting regime, the system exhibits a distinct set of universal critical exponents, markedly different from those observed in the weakly interacting limit. This dichotomy aligns with experimental findings on the metal-insulator transition in 2DEGs, where high interaction strength (low carrier density) leads to qualitatively different behavior. The analysis includes scaling of the average electron density with temperature, the power spectral density, and the statistics of electronic avalanches - namely their size distributions and autocorrelation functions. In all cases, the extracted exponents differ significantly between the weak and strong interaction regimes, highlighting the emergence of two universality classes governed by interaction strength. These results underscore the critical role of electron correlations in the self-organized behavior of low-dimensional electronic systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.08556v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the quantum dynamical evolution of a fully-connected quantum system subjected to random projective measurements and study the first detection time of an extended subspace of the Hilbert space. Exact analytical expressions are obtained for the mean first detection time and the full first detection probability distribution as functionals of the initial state $\ket{\psi_0}$ and the measurement rate $r$. Exact enumeration agrees perfectly with our analytical predictions.</description>

      <title>Ancilla-train quantum algorithm for simulating non-Markovian open quantum systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12717v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a quantum algorithm for simulating open quantum systems coupled to Gaussian environments valid for any configuration and coupling strength. The algorithm is for instance applicable to problems with strongly coupled, or non-Markovian, environments; problems with multiple environments out of mutual equilibrium; and problems with time-dependent Hamiltonians. We show that the algorithm can reproduce the true dynamics of such problems at arbitrary accuracy and, for a broad range of problems, only adds a minor resource cost relative to Trotterized time evolution; the cost is polynomial in the inverse target accuracy. The algorithm is based on the insight that any Gaussian environment can be represented as a train of ancillary qubits that sequentially interact with the system through a time-local coupling, given by the convolution square root of the bath correlation function; this is a secondary result of our work. Our results open up new applications of quantum computers for efficient simulation of non-equilibrium and open quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Superluminal Liouville walls in 2d String Theory and space-like singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12778v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An interesting class of time dependent backgrounds in $1+1$ dimensional string theory involves worldsheet Liouville walls which move in (target space) time. When a parameter in such a background exceeds a certain critical value, the speed of the Liouville wall exceeds the speed of light, and there is no usual S-Matrix. We examine such backgrounds in the dual $c=1$ matrix model from the point of view of fluctuations of the collective field, and determine the nature of the emergent space-time perceived by these fluctuations. We show that so long as the corresponding Liouville wall remains time-like, the emergent space time is conformal to full Minkowski space with a time-like wall. However, for the cases where the Liouville wall is superluminal, the emergent space-time has a {\em space-like boundary} where the collective field couplings diverge. This appears as a space-like singularity in perturbative collective field theory. We comment on the necessity of incorporating finite $N$, as well as finite (double-scaled) coupling, effects to understand the behavior of the exact theory near this boundary.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.12992v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the impact of conserved charges on the dynamics of spread complexity of quantum states. Building on the notion of symmetry-resolved Krylov complexity [1], we extend the framework to general quantum states and analyze the relation between the total spread complexity and its decomposition into fixed-charge sectors. After exploring a range of analytical examples and using orthogonal polynomial approach, we identify conditions under which spread complexity exhibits equipartition across sectors. Finally, we discuss quantum speed limits that constrain the growth of complexity in the presence of conserved charges.</description>

      <title>Electro-viscoelasticity of polymer melts in continuum theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13146v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electro-viscoelastic theory for polymer melts has been extensively studied experimentally for the past century, primarily for manufacturing purposes. However, the modeling and theory for this have been minimal, leaving many questions on the mechanisms and behavior of an arbitrary flow scheme. To remedy this, previously solved overdamped Langevin equations for the Doi-Rouse model are modified to include charge and electric field potential forces. The charge sequence on the chain is hypothesized to be a cosine sequence along the chain, resembling multiple electric dipoles that conveniently correspond to a Rouse mode of the chain. These are then solved for the shear stress under homogeneous shear rates and electric fields to find directional viscosity increases depending on the shearing and electric field orientation. Using the newly derived shear stress from the Doi-Rouse approach, a continuum model is proposed that resembles a modified upper-convected Maxwell model, including polarization stresses in terms of an electric field dyadic. This new continuum model, named the upper-convected electro-Maxwell model, is verified using Kremer-Grest polymer chains simulated with molecular dynamics for multiple flow schemes and a specified charge sequence along the chain. Furthermore, the MD results verified the difference in the overall and charge sequence relaxation times through the shear and normal stress polarizations, showing the necessity for the upper-convected derivative of the electric field dyadic to correct the viscosity scaling. Finally, the dynamic properties of the polarized polymer melt are examined analytically, finding that the phase shift is unaffected by the electric field contribution.</description>

      <title>The Gamma Expansion of the Level Two Large Deviation Rate Functional for Reversible Diffusion Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13222v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fix a smooth Morse function $U\colon \mathbb{R}^{d}\to\mathbb{R}$ with finitely many critical points, and consider the solution of the stochastic differential equation \begin{equation*} d\bm{x}_{\epsilon}(t)=-\nabla U(\bm{x}_{\epsilon}(t))\,dt \,+\,\sqrt{2\epsilon}\, d\bm{w}_{t}\,, \end{equation*} where $(\bm{w}_{t})_{t\ge0}$ represents a $d$-dimensional Brownian motion, and $\epsilon&gt;0$ a small parameter. Denote by $\mathcal{P}(\mathbb{R}^{d})$ the space of probability measures on $\bb R^d$, and by $\mathcal{I}_{\epsilon} \colon \mathcal{P}(\mathbb{R}^{d})\to[0,\,\infty]$ the Donsker--Varadhan level two large deviations rate functional. We express $\mc I_\epsilon$ as $\mc I_\epsilon = \epsilon^{-1} \mc J^{(-1)} + \mc J^{(0)} + \sum_{1\le p\le \mf q} (1/\theta^{(p)}_\epsilon) \, \mc J^{(p)}$, where $\mc J^{(p)}\colon \mc P(\bb R^d) \to [0,+\infty]$ stand for rate functionals independent of $\epsilon$ and $\theta^{(p)}_\epsilon$ for sequences such that $\theta^{(1)}_\epsilon \to\infty$, $\theta^{(p)}_\epsilon / \theta^{(p+1)}_\epsilon \to 0$ for $1\le p&lt; \mf q$. The speeds $\theta^{(p)}_\epsilon$ correspond to the time-scales at which the diffusion $\bm{x}_{\epsilon}(\cdot)$ exhibits a metastable behaviour, while the functional $\mc J^{(p)}$ represent the level two, large deviations rate functionals of the finite-state, continuous-time Markov chains which describe the evolution of the diffusion $\bm{x}_{\epsilon}(\cdot)$ among the wells in the time-scale $\theta^{(p)}_\epsilon$.</description>

      <title>The transition to collective motion in nonreciprocal active matter: coarse graining agent-based models into fluctuating hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.08251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.08251v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two hallmarks of non-equilibrium systems, from active colloids to animal herds, are agents motility and nonreciprocal interactions. Their interplay creates feedback loops leading to complex spatiotemporal dynamics crucial to understand and control the nonlinear response of active systems. Here, we introduce a minimal model that captures these two features at the microscopic scale, while admitting an exact hydrodynamic theory valid also in the fully-nonlinear regime. Our goal is to account for the fact that animal herds and colloidal swarms are rarely in the thermodynamic limit where particle number fluctuations can be completely ignored. Using statistical mechanics techniques we exactly coarse-grain a nonreciprocal microscopic model into a fluctuating hydrodynamics and use dynamical systems insights to analyze the resulting equations. In the absence of motility, we find two transitions to oscillatory phases occurring via distinct mechanisms: a Hopf bifurcation and a Saddle-Node on Invariant Circle (SNIC) bifurcation. In the presence of motility, this rigorous approach, complemented by numerical simulations, allows us to quantitatively assess the hitherto neglected impact of inter-species nonreciprocity on a paradigmatic transition in active matter: the emergence of collective motion. When nonreciprocity is weak, we show that flocking is accelerated and bands tend to synchronize with a spatial overlap controlled by nonlinearities. When nonreciprocity is strong, flocking is superseded by a Chase &amp; Rest dynamical phase where each species alternates between a chasing state, when they propagate, and a resting state, when they stand still. Finally, we demonstrate how fluctuations in finite systems can be harnessed to characterize microscopic non-reciprocity from macroscopic time-correlation functions, even in phases where nonreciprocal interactions do not affect the thermodynamic steady-state.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.22315v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the statistics of branching polymers with excluded-volume interactions, by modeling them as single self-avoiding trees on a generic regular periodic lattice with coordination number $q$. Each lattice site can be occupied at most by one tree node, and the fraction of occupied sites can vary from dilute to dense conditions. By adopting the statistics of rooted-directed trees as a proxy for that of undirected trees without internal loops and by an exact mapping of the model into a field theory, we compute the entropy and the mean number of branch-nodes within a mean field approximation and in the thermodynamic limit. In particular, we find that the mean number of branch-nodes is independent of both the lattice details and the lattice occupation, depending only on the associated chemical potential. Monte Carlo simulations in $d=2,3,4$ provide evidence of the remarkable accuracy of the mean field theory, more accurate for higher dimensions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.20915v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide a comprehensive analysis of the positional dynamics and average thermodynamics of an overdamped Brownian particle subject to both, harmonic confinement and annealed disorder due to a temporarily fluctuating trap stiffness. We model this stiffness via a stationary Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) process whose correlation time can be tuned from white noise to a quenched limit. We analytically calculate the positional distribution in these limits and provide exact expressions for the $n$th positional moments at finite correlation times, revealing important insights regarding stationarity. Further, we analyze the average work performed on the particle and the heat dissipated into the environment at all times, illustrating the nonequilibrium character of the system and its relaxation into a steady state. Our analytical results are validated by numerical Langevin simulations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.04515v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article proposes a self-consistent methodology for determining the work involved in an adiabatic process where the dynamics of a Brownian particle is trapped in an optical tweezers. Instead of varying the frequency of the trap, it is displaced through a defined protocol. Assuming the dynamics follow a modified generalized Langevin equation previously proposed by the author, it is found that the external adiabatic driving is uniquely derived in terms of the system's dynamical properties, and unlike isothermal processes, does not require optimization. There is no need to include other parameters than those characterizing the model.</description>

      <title>Shear-induced diffusivity in supercooled liquids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18412v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Taylor-Aris theory of shear diffusion predicts that the effective diffusivity of a tracer molecule in a sheared liquid is enhanced by a term quadratic in the shear rate. In sheared supercooled liquids, instead, the observed enhancement is linear in the shear rate. This is a fundamental observation for the physics of nonequilibrium liquids. Here, we derive a formula for the effective molecular diffusivity in supercooled liquids under shear flow based on the underlying Smoluchowski equation with shear (Smoluchowski diffusion-convection equation) with an energy barrier due to the crowded energy landscape. The obtained formula recovers the effective diffusivity with a correction term linear in the shear rate, in reasonable agreement with results from numerical simulations of different liquids as well as with earlier experimental results on shear melting of colloidal glass. The theory predictions are compared with molecular simulations of supercooled water and supercooled Lennard-Jones liquids. The comparison suggests that the predicted enhancement of diffusivity is inversely proportional to temperature and directly proportional to the zero shear viscosity.</description>

      <title>Dual Role for Heterogeneity in Dynamic Fracture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02347v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We approach the problem of heterogeneous dynamic fracture by considering spatiotemporal perturbations to planar crack fronts. Front propagation is governed by local energy balance between the elastic energy per unit area available to fracture, G, and the dissipation in creating new surfaces. G is known analytically as a perturbation series in the crack front fluctuation. For dissipation that monotonically increases with the crack speed, we derive an equation of motion for crack fronts that is second-order accurate. In the linear order, heterogeneity does not change the net speed of fracture. In the second order, nonlinear interactions of the front and the heterogeneous landscape populate an intermediate-scale fluctuation spectrum. We find that, when dissipation weakly grows with velocity, nonlinearities globally amplify dissipation and reduce the crack speed. Strong velocity dependence, however, mitigates toughening effects and may facilitate fracture.</description>

      <title>Duality defect in a deformed transverse-field Ising model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.17317v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Physical quantities with long lifetimes have both theoretical significance in the study of quantum many-body systems and practical implications for quantum technologies. In this manuscript, we investigate the roles played by topological defects in the construction of quasi-conserved quantities, using as a prototypical example the Kramers-Wannier duality defect in a deformed 1d quantum transverse field Ising model. We construct the duality defect Hamiltonian in three different ways: half-chain Kramers-Wannier transformation, utilization of techniques in the Ising fusion category, and defect-modified weak integrability breaking deformation. The third method is also applicable for the study of generic integrable defects under weak integrability breaking deformations. We also work out the deformation of defect-modified higher charges in the model and study their slower decay behavior. Furthermore, we consider the corresponding duality defect twisted deformed Floquet transverse field Ising model, and investigate the stability of the isolated zero mode associated with the duality defect in the integrable Floquet Ising model, under such weak integrability breaking deformation.</description>

      <title>Quantum many-body scars through the lens of correlation matrix</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21812v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum many-body scars (QMBS) -- rare eigenstates that evade thermalization -- are typically characterized by their low entanglement entropies compared to surrounding thermal eigenstates. However, due to finite-size effects in systems accessible via exact diagonalization, this measure can be ambiguous. To address this limitation, we propose using the correlation matrix spectrum as an alternative probe to identify QMBS. In cases of exact QMBS that either have known analytic expressions or are captured by various frameworks of QMBS, we find that the dimensionality of the null space of the correlation matrix -- an integer value, and thus immune to finite-size effects -- can qualitatively identify QMBS. Beyond serving as a diagnostic tool, the correlation matrix method enables the manipulation of the QMBS subspace. For approximate QMBS, such as those in the PXP model, we observe that the correlation matrix spectrum features numerous approximate zero eigenvalues, thereby distinguishing these states. We demonstrate the effectiveness and utility of this method with several paradigmatic QMBS examples.</description>

      <title>On Computational Complexity of Unitary and State Design Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23353v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate unitary and state $t$-designs from a computational complexity perspective. First, we address the problems of computing frame potentials that characterize (approximate) $t$-designs. We present a quantum algorithm for computing frame potentials and establish the following: (1) exact computation can be achieved by a single query to a $\# \textsf{P}$-oracle and is $\# \textsf{P}$-hard; (2) for state vectors, deciding whether the frame potential is larger than or smaller than certain values is $\textsf{BQP}$-complete, provided the promise gap between the two values is inverse-polynomial in the number of qubits; and (3) for both state vectors and unitaries, this promise problem is $\textsf{PP}$-complete if the promise gap is exponentially small. Second, we address the promise problem of deciding whether or not a given set is a good approximation to a design. Given a certain promise gap that could be constant, we show that this problem is $\textsf{PP}$-hard, highlighting the inherent computational difficulty of determining properties of unitary and state designs. We further identify the implications of our results across diverse areas, including variational methods for constructing designs, diagnosing quantum chaos through out-of-time-ordered correlators (OTOCs), and exploring emergent designs in Hamiltonian systems.</description>

      <title>Volume-law entanglement fragmentation of quasiparticles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12379v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the entanglement entropy in quantum states featuring repeated sequential excitations of unit patterns in momentum space. In the scaling limit, each unit pattern contributes independently and universally to the entanglement entropy, leading to a characteristic volume-law scaling. Crucially, this universal contribution remains identical for both free and interacting models, enabling decomposition of the total entanglement into pattern-specific components. Numerical verification in fermionic and bosonic chains confirms this volume-law fragmentation phenomenon. For fermionic systems, we derive analytical expressions where many-body entanglement becomes expressible through few-body entanglement components. Notably, this analytical framework extends to spin-1/2 XXZ chains through appropriate identifications.</description>

      <title>Work Statistics via Real-Time Effective Field Theory: Application to Work Extraction from Thermal Bath with Qubit Coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18812v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum thermal states are known to be passive, as required by the second law of thermodynamics. This paper investigates the potential for work extraction by coupling a thermal bath to a qubit of either spin, fermionic, or topological type, which acts as a quantum thermal state at different temperatures. The amount of work extraction is derived from the work statistics under a cyclic nonequilibrium process. Although the work statistics of many-body systems are known to be challenging to calculate explicitly, we propose an effective field theory approach to tackle this problem by assuming the externally driven source couples to a specific quasiparticle operator of the thermal state. We show that the work statistics can be expressed succinctly in terms of this quasiparticle's thermal spectral function. We obtain the non-perturbative work distribution function (WDF) for the pure thermal bath without the qubit coupling. With qubit coupling, we get the second-order WDF, from which the physical regime of work extraction can be pinned down precisely to help devise quantum heat engines or refrigerators. Their efficiency or coefficient of performance (COP) can be inferred from the combination of the fluctuation theorem and the first law, and we find that the spin/topological qubit-bath system generally yields a far better heat engine/refrigerator than the other two alternatives due to the underlying quantum statistics.</description>

      <title>Relativistic Mott transitions and finite-temperature effects of quantum criticality in Dirac semimetals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04911v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gross-Neveu-Yukawa-type models such as the chiral Ising, chiral XY, and chiral Heisenberg models, serve as effective descriptions of two-dimensional Dirac semi-metals undergoing quantum phase transitions into various symmetry-broken ordered states. Their relativistic quantum critical points govern the systems' physical behavior in the vicinity of the transition also at finite temperatures, which is strongly influenced by critical order-parameter and chiral fermion fluctuations. Here, we explore the effect of these fluctuations at zero and finite temperature, both in the Dirac phase and in the Mott phases with spontaneously broken symmetry. To that end, we set up a functional renormalization group approach, which allows us to systematically calculate the quantum phase diagrams and scaling behavior at and near quantum criticality. We explicitly estimate quantum critical exponents, calculate the quasiparticle weight of the chiral Dirac excitations, and determine the extent of the quantum critical fan. Furthermore, we expose a semi-metallic precondensation regime where order-parameter fluctuations destroy order at finite temperature and we show the related manifestation of the Coleman-Hohenberg-Mermin-Wagner theorem. For the chiral XY model, we also expose signatures of Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless physics in a system that includes strong fermion fluctuations. In view of recent experimental developments on correlated phases in highly tunable two-dimensional Dirac materials, our work aims at a more comprehensive theoretical description of relativistic quantum criticality in semi-metals, including non-Dirac-liquid behavior.</description>

      <title>High-performance local decoders for defect matching in 1D</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10162v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Local decoders, also known as cellular-automaton decoders, offer a promising path toward real-time quantum error correction by replacing centralized classical decoding, with inherent hardware constraints, by a natively parallel and streamlined architecture from a simple local transition rule. We propose two new types of local decoders for the quantum repetition code in one dimension. The signal-rule decoders interpret odd parities between neighboring qubits as defects, attracted to each other via the exchange of classical point-like excitations, represented by a few bits of local memory. We prove the existence of a threshold in the code-capacity model and present numerical evidence of exponential logical error suppression under a phenomenological noise model, with data and measurement errors at each error correction cycle. Compared to previously known local decoders that suffer from sub-optimal threshold and scaling, our construction significantly narrows the gap with global decoders for practical system sizes and error rates. Implementation requirements can be further reduced by eliminating the need for local classical memories, with a new rule defined on two rows of qubits. This shearing-rule works well at relevant system sizes making it an appealing short-term solution. When combined with biased-noise qubits, such as cat qubits, these decoders enable a fully local quantum memory in one dimension.</description>
