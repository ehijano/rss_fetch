      <title>Thermodynamic ranking of pathways in reaction networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23496v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chemical Reaction Networks (CRNs) provide a powerful framework for modeling complex systems due to their compositionality, which makes them well-suited for analyzing interactions of subsystems within larger aggregate systems. This work presents a thermodynamic formalism for ranking CRN pathways under fixed throughput currents (fixed velocities of species flowing in and out of the system), where pathways represent subnetworks capable of performing the stipulated chemical conversion. We define a thermodynamic cost function for pathways derived from the large-deviation theory of stochastic CRNs, which decomposes into two components: an ongoing maintenance cost to sustain a non-equilibrium steady state (NESS), and a restriction cost, quantifying the ongoing improbability of neutralizing reactions outside the specified pathway. Applying this formalism to detailed-balanced CRNs in the linear response regime, we prove that the resistance of a CRN decreases as reactions are added that support the throughput current, and that the maintenance cost, the restriction cost, and the thermodynamic cost of nested pathways are bounded below by those of their hosting network. Extending the analysis far from equilibrium, we find that while cost is non-decreasing for progressively more restricted nested pathways near equilibrium, multimolecular CRN examples can be found that assign lower costs to more restricted pathways at far-from-equilibrium NESSs. The possibility to reduce the resistance of a network at fixed throughput, while also simplifying the network, may have implications for enzyme family evolution, in which novel reaction mechanisms may first lead to a proliferation of pathways through non-specific catalysis, but later selection for specificity may benefit both from species retention, and more efficient use of autocatalysts to improve throughput.</description>

      <title>Optimizing information transmission in the canonical Wnt pathway</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22633v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Populations of cells regulate gene expression in response to external signals, but their ability to make reliable collective decisions is limited by both intrinsic noise in molecular signaling and variability between individual cells. In this work, we use optogenetic control of the canonical Wnt pathway as an example to study how reliably information about an external signal is transmitted to a population of cells, and determine an optimal encoding strategy to maximize information transmission from Wnt signals to gene expression. We find that it is possible to reach an information capacity beyond 1 bit only through an appropriate, discrete encoding of signals. By averaging over an increasing number of outputs, we systematically vary the effective noise in the pathway. As the effective noise decreases, the optimal encoding comprises more discrete input signals. These signals do not need to be fine-tuned. The optimal code transitions into a continuous code in the small-noise limit, which can be shown to be consistent with the Jeffreys prior. We visualize the performance of signal encodings using decoding maps. Our results suggest optogenetic Wnt signaling allows for regulatory control beyond a simple binary switch, and provides a framework to apply ideas from information processing to single-cell in vitro experiments.</description>

      <title>Diversity by Design: Addressing Mode Collapse Improves scRNA-seq Perturbation Modeling on Well-Calibrated Metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22641v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent benchmarks reveal that models for single-cell perturbation response are often outperformed by simply predicting the dataset mean. We trace this anomaly to a metric artifact: control-referenced deltas and unweighted error metrics reward mode collapse whenever the control is biased or the biological signal is sparse. Large-scale \textit{in silico} simulations and analysis of two real-world perturbation datasets confirm that shared reference shifts, not genuine biological change, drives high performance in these evaluations. We introduce differentially expressed gene (DEG)-aware metrics, weighted mean-squared error (WMSE) and weighted delta $R^{2}$ ($R^{2}_{w}(\Delta)$) with respect to all perturbations, that measure error in niche signals with high sensitivity. We further introduce negative and positive performance baselines to calibrate these metrics. With these improvements, the mean baseline sinks to null performance while genuine predictors are correctly rewarded. Finally, we show that using WMSE as a loss function reduces mode collapse and improves model performance.</description>

      <title>Landscapes and nonequilibrium fluctuations of eukaryotic gene regulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10067v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the interplay among processes that occur over different timescales is a challenging issue in the physics of systems regulation. In gene regulation, the timescales for changes in chromatin states can differ from those for changes in the concentration of product protein, raising questions about how to understand their coupled dynamics. In this study, we examine the effects of these different timescales on eukaryotic gene regulation using a stochastic model that describes the landscapes and probability currents of nonequilibrium fluctuations.This model shows that slow, nonadiabatic transitions of chromatin states significantly impact gene-regulation dynamics. The simulated circular flow of the probability currents indicates a maximum entropy production when the rates of chromatin-state transitions are low in the intensely nonadiabatic regime. In the mildly nonadiabatic regime, this circular flow fosters hysteresis, suggesting that changes in chromatin states precede changes in transcription activity. Furthermore, calculations using a model of a circuit involving three core genes in mouse embryonic stem cells illustrate how the timescale difference can tune fluctuations in individual genes. These findings highlight the rich effects of nonadiabatic chromatin-state transitions on gene regulation in eukaryotic cells.</description>

      <title>Duplication-divergence growing graph models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15640v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent decades, it has been emphasized that the evolving structure of networks may be shaped by interaction principles that yield sparse graphs with a vertex degree distribution exhibiting an algebraic tail, and other structural traits that are not featured in traditional random graphs. In this respect, through a mean-field approach, this review tackles the statistical physics of graph models based on the interaction principle of duplication-divergence. Additional sophistications extending the duplication-divergence model are also reviewed as well as generalizations of other known models. Possible research gaps and related prior results are then discussed.</description>
