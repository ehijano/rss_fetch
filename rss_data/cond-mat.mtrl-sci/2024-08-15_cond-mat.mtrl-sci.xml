      <title>The surface termination of a Fe (III) spin crossover molecular salt</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: From a comparison of energy dispersive analyses of X-rays (EDAX), the known molecular stoichiometry and X-ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS), it is evident that the Fe(III) spin crossover salt [Fe(qsal)2Ni(dmit)2] has a preferential surface termination with the Ni(dmit)2 moiety. This preferential surface termination leads to a significant surface to bulk core level shift for the Ni 2p X-ray photoemission core level, not seen in the corresponding Fe 2p core level spectra. Inverse photoemission spectroscopy (IPES), thus provides some indication of the density of states resulting from the dmit2 = 1,3-dithiol-2-thione-4,5-dithiolato ligand unoccupied molecular orbitals.</description>

      <title>Kinetomagnetism of chirality and its applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chiral functionalities exhibited by systems lacking any mirror symmetry encompass natural optical activity, magnetochiral effect, diagonal current-induced magnetization, chirality-selective spin-polarized current of charged electrons or neutral neutrons, self-inductance, and chiral phonons. These phenomena are unified under the hypothesis of kinetomagnetism of chirality, which posits that any moving (charged or neutral) object in chiral systems induces magnetization in its direction of motion, consequently imparting chirality to the object due to this induced magnetization. We also found conjugate relationships among the kinetomagnetism of chirality, linear magnetoelectricity, and electric field induced directional nonreciprocity, highlighting their interconnections with magnetic, electric, and toroidal orders. The concept of the kinetomagnetism of chirality will be an essential basis for the theoretical understanding of known chiral phenomena such as natural optical activity or chiral phonons, and also the discovery of unexplored chiral functionalities.</description>

      <title>The effect of mixed termination composition in Sc, Ti, and V-based MXenes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07189v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the effect of mixed surface terminations (F, O, OH) on the properties of M$_{2}$C MXenes (M = Sc, Ti, V). We explore how different compositions and patterns of terminal groups affect the stability and electronic properties of these 2D materials. The bond dissociation energies and cohesion energies show a clear preference for F-terminations in Sc$_{2}$C, while Ti- and V-based MXenes prefer O-terminations. The data indicates that terminal groups on opposite sides of the MXene have little to no influence on each other's electronic structure, allowing for independent chemical environments on each side. Semiconducting forms of studied MXenes (Sc$_{2}$CF$_{2}$, Sc$_{2}$C(OH)$_{2}$ and Ti$_{2}$CO$_{2}$) showed very high sensitivity to conduction-inducing terminations (O, O, and F, respectively) with even minuscule amounts ($\approx$1%) causing the materials to become conductive. This high sensitivity of the band gap to surface terminations may offer an explanation for the challenges in synthesizing semiconducting forms of MXenes.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Magnonics with Localized Spoof Surface Plasmon Polaritons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hybrid magnonic systems have emerged as a promising direction for information propagation with preserved coherence. Due to high tunability of magnons, their interactions with microwave photons can be engineered to probe novel phenomena based on strong photon-magnon coupling. Improving the photon-magnon coupling strength can be done by tuning the structure of microwave resonators to better interact with the magnon counterpart. Planar resonators have been explored due to their potential for on-chip integration, but only common modes from stripline-based resonators have been used. Here, we present a microwave spiral resonator supporting the spoof localized surface plasmons (LSPs) and implement it to the investigation of photon-magnon coupling for hybrid magnonic applications. We showcase strong magnon-LSP photon coupling using a ferrimagnetic yttrium iron garnet sphere. We discuss the dependence of the spiral resonator design to the engineering capacity of the photon mode frequency and spatial field distributions, via both experiment and simulation. By the localized photon mode profiles, the resulting magnetic field concentrates near the surface dielectrics, giving rise to an enhanced magnetic filling factor. The strong coupling and large engineering space render the spoof LSPs an interesting contender in developing novel hybrid magnonic systems and functionalities.</description>

      <title>Experimental tests of the full spin torque conductivity tensor in epitaxial IrO2 thin films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unconventional spin-orbit torques arising from electric-field-generated spin currents in anisotropic materials have promising potential for spintronic applications, including for perpendicular magnetic switching in high-density memory applications. Here we determine all the independent elements of the spin torque conductivity tensor allowed by bulk crystal symmetries for the tetragonal conductor IrO2, via measurements of conventional (in plane) antidamping torques for IrO2 thin films in the high-symmetry (001) and (100) orientations. We then test that rotational transformations of this same tensor can predict both the conventional and unconventional anti-damping torques for IrO2 thin films in the lower-symmetry (101), (110), and (111) orientations, finding good agreement. The results confirm that spin-orbit torques from all these orientations are consistent with the bulk symmetries of IrO2, and show how simple measurements of conventional torques from high-symmetry orientations of anisotropic thin films can provide an accurate prediction of the unconventional torques from lower-symmetry orientations.</description>

      <title>Representation-space diffusion models for generating periodic materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07213v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative models hold the promise of significantly expediting the materials design process when compared to traditional human-guided or rule-based methodologies. However, effectively generating high-quality periodic structures of materials on limited but diverse datasets remains an ongoing challenge. Here we propose a novel approach for periodic structure generation which fully respect the intrinsic symmetries, periodicity, and invariances of the structure space. Namely, we utilize differentiable, physics-based, structural descriptors which can describe periodic systems and satisfy the necessary invariances, in conjunction with a denoising diffusion model which generates new materials within this descriptor or representation space. Reconstruction is then performed on these representations using gradient-based optimization to recover the corresponding Cartesian positions of the crystal structure. This approach differs significantly from current methods by generating materials in the representation space, rather than in the Cartesian space, which is made possible using an efficient reconstruction algorithm. Consequently, known issues with respecting periodic boundaries and translational and rotational invariances during generation can be avoided, and the model training process can be greatly simplified. We show this approach is able to provide competitive performance on established benchmarks compared to current state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>Orientation-dependent surface radiation damage in $\beta$-Ga2O3 explored by multiscale atomic simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultrawide bandgap semiconductor $\beta$-Ga2O3 holds extensive potential for applications in high-radiation environments. One of the primary challenges in its practical application is unveiling the mechanisms of surface irradiation damage under extreme conditions. In this study, we investigate the orientation-dependent mechanisms of radiation damage on four experimentally relevant $\beta$-Ga2O3 surface facets, namely, (100), (010), (001), and (-201), at various temperatures. We employ a multiscale atomic simulation approach, combining machine-learning-driven molecular dynamics (ML-MD) simulations and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The results reveal that Ga vacancies and O interstitials are the predominant defects across all four surfaces, with the formation of many antisite defects Ga_O and few O_Ga observed. Among the two Ga sites and three O sites, the vacancy found in the O2 site is dominant, while the interstitials at the Ga1 and O1 sites are more significant. Interestingly, the (010) surface exhibits the lowest defect density, owing to its more profound channeling effect leading to a broader spread of defects. The influence of temperature on surface irradiation damage of $\beta$-Ga2O3 should be evaluated based on the unique crystal surface characteristics. Moreover, the formation energy and defect concentration calculated by DFT corroborate the results of the MD simulations. Comprehending surface radiation damage at the atomic level is crucial for assessing the radiation tolerance and predicting the performance changes of $\beta$-Ga2O3-based device in high-radiation environments.</description>

      <title>Improving the Electro-Optical Properties of MoS$_2$/rGO Hybrid Nanocomposites Using Liquid Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07310v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hybrid systems of two-dimensional (2D) materials (such as graphene-family materials and 2D transition metal dichalcogenides) are attracting much attention due to their distinctive optoelectronic, thermal, mechanical, and chemical properties. The application perspectives of these materials in various fields further expand when enriching those with liquid crystals (LCs) primarily due to their enhanced tunability and functionality. In this study, we report on the hydrothermal synthesis of hybrid nanocomposites composed of MoS$_2$ and rGO and discuss tuning possibilities of their electro-optical properties by incorporating thermotropic LCs. In particular, we demonstrate that the incorporation of 5CB LC increases the sensitivity and charge storage efficiency of the hybrid nanocomposites. In addition, we also present the responsivity, detectivity, and response time properties of the hybrid nanocomposites of MoS$_2$/rGO, both with and without the inclusion of nematic LCs. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the system exhibits a 5CB-induced photocurrent switching effect. We believe the findings will open new doors for applications of these materials in optoelectronics and photonics.</description>

      <title>First-principles exploration of the pressure dependent physical properties of Sn4Au: a superconducting topological semimetal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07451v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: First-principles investigation within the density functional theory is utilized to explore the physical properties of a superconducting topological semimetal Sn4Au under pressure within the range of 0-5 GPa. According to the computed elastic moduli, the compound under study is classified as ductile and applied pressure enhances the ductility. The compound has very high level of dry lubricity and machinability index. All the anisotropy factors demonstrate an elastically anisotropic nature. The electronic properties are investigated in view of the electronic band structure and density of states. The band structure reveals the topological semimetallic feature of Sn4Au while the density of states at the Fermi level decreases gradually with increasing pressure. Both ionic and covalent bondings are observed in Sn4Au. Optical parameters of Sn4Au are investigated at different pressures. The characteristic peaks in reflectivity, refractive index and photoconductivity exhibit a shift towards higher energy with increasing pressure for all polarizations of the electric field vector. The absorption coefficient and reflectivity spectra designate Sn4Au as a suitable system for optoelectronic applications. Moreover, the pressure dependent shifts in the electronic density of states at the Fermi level, the changes in the Debye temperature, and pressure induced variations in the repulsive Coulomb pseudopotential have been used to explore the effect of pressure on the superconducting transition temperature in this study.</description>

      <title>High Strain Rate Compressive Deformation Behavior of Nickel Microparticles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07462v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the mechanical properties of metals at extreme conditions is essential for the advancement of miniaturized technologies. As dimensions decrease, materials will experience higher strain rates at the same applied velocities. Moreover, the interplay effects of strain rates and temperatures are often overlooked and could have critical effects in applications. In this study, for the first time, the rate-dependent and temperature-dependent mechanical response of nickel microparticles have been investigated. The microparticles were obtained by solid-state dewetting of nickel thin films deposited on c-sapphire. They exhibit self-similar shapes with identical sets of planes, facilitating straightforward comparison between particles. This research represents the first in-depth analysis of the mechanical properties of nickel single crystal dewetted microparticles across six orders of magnitude at room temperature and three orders of magnitude at 128 K. Molecular dynamic simulations (MD) were conducted in parallel on particles with the same faceting. In this work, the gap between experiments and simulations has been reduced to over one order of magnitude in size and 3 orders of magnitude in the strain rates. The thermal activation parameter analysis and MD simulations were employed to ascertain whether homogeneous or heterogeneous dislocation nucleation was the dominant mechanism controlling deformation in the particles.</description>

      <title>Defect recombination origin of low energy excess in semiconductor detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07518v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When the detection threshold in semiconductor detectors is pushed to increasingly low energies, an ``excess" signal of apparent energy release events below a few hundred eV is observed in several different kinds of detectors, hindering their sensitivity for rare event signals in this energy range. Using atomistic simulations with classical thermostat and quantum thermal bath, we show that this kind of signal is consistent with energy release from long-term recombination events of complex defects that can be formed by any kind of nuclear recoil radiation events. The recombination events are shown to have a very similar exponential dependence of energy as that observed in experiments. By detailed analysis of recombination events, we show that crossing a low energy barrier ($\lesssim$ 0.1 eV) can trigger larger energy releases in an avalanche-like effect. This explains why large energy release events can occur even down to cryogenic temperatures.</description>

      <title>Cyclic and helical symmetry-informed machine learned force fields: Application to lattice vibrations in carbon nanotubes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a formalism for developing cyclic and helical symmetry-informed machine learned force fields (MLFFs). In particular, employing the smooth overlap of atomic positions descriptors with the polynomial kernel method, we derive cyclic and helical symmetry-adapted expressions for the energy, atomic forces, and phonons (describe lattice vibration frequencies and modes). We use this formulation to construct a symmetry-informed MLFF for carbon nanotubes (CNTs), where the model is trained through Bayesian linear regression, with the data generated from ab initio density functional theory (DFT) calculations performed during on-the-fly symmetry-informed MLFF molecular dynamics simulations of representative CNTs. We demonstrate the accuracy of the MLFF model by comparisons with DFT calculations for the energies and forces, and density functional perturbation theory calculations for the phonons, while considering CNTs not used in the training. In particular, we obtain a root mean square error of $1.4 \times 10^{-4}$ Ha/atom, $4.7 \times 10^{-4}$ Ha/Bohr, and 4.8 cm$^{-1}$ in the energy, forces, and phonon frequencies, respectively, which are well within the accuracy targeted in ab initio calculations. We apply this framework to study phonons in CNTs of various diameters and chiralities, where we identify the torsional rigid body mode that is unique to cylindrical structures and establish laws for variation of the phonon frequencies associated with the ring modes and radial breathing modes. Overall, the proposed formalism provides an avenue for studying nanostructures with cyclic and helical symmetry at ab initio accuracy, while providing orders-of-magnitude speedup relative to such methods.</description>

      <title>Band-selective simulation of photoelectron intensity and converging Berry phase in trilayer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07557v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Berry phase is one of the key elements to understand quantum-mechanical phenomena such as the Aharonov-Bohm effect and the unconventional Hall effect in graphene. The Berry phase in monolayer and bilayer graphene has been manifested by the anisotropic distribution of photoelectron intensity along a closed loop in the momentum space as well as its rotation by a characteristic angle upon rotating light polarization. Here we report the band-selective simulation of photoelectron intensity of trilayer graphene to understand its Berry phase within the tight-binding formalism. ABC- and ABA-stacked trilayer graphene show characteristic rotational angles of photoelectron intensity distribution, as predicted from their well-known Berry phases. Surprisingly, however, in ABA-stacked trilayer graphene, the rotational angle changes upon approaching toward the band touching point between the conduction and valence bands, which suggest that Berry phase changes as a function of binding energy. The binding energy-dependent Berry phase is attributed to the enhanced hybridization of the two electron bands of ABA-stacked trilayer graphene that converge at the band touching point, resulting in the converging Berry phase. These findings will provide an efficient way of tuning Berry phase and hence exotic phenomena stemming from the Berry phase.</description>

      <title>MatterGPT: A Generative Transformer for Multi-Property Inverse Design of Solid-State Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inverse design of solid-state materials with desired properties represents a formidable challenge in materials science. Although recent generative models have demonstrated potential, their adoption has been hindered by limitations such as inefficiency, architectural constraints and restricted open-source availability. The representation of crystal structures using the SLICES (Simplified Line-Input Crystal-Encoding System) notation as a string of characters enables the use of state-of-the-art natural language processing models, such as Transformers, for crystal design. Drawing inspiration from the success of GPT models in generating coherent text, we trained a generative Transformer on the next-token prediction task to generate solid-state materials with targeted properties. We demonstrate MatterGPT's capability to generate de novo crystal structures with targeted single properties, including both lattice-insensitive (formation energy) and lattice-sensitive (band gap) properties. Furthermore, we extend MatterGPT to simultaneously target multiple properties, addressing the complex challenge of multi-objective inverse design of crystals. Our approach showcases high validity, uniqueness, and novelty in generated structures, as well as the ability to generate materials with properties beyond the training data distribution. This work represents a significant step forward in computational materials discovery, offering a powerful and open tool for designing materials with tailored properties for various applications in energy, electronics, and beyond.</description>

Abstract: Short-term changes in the resonance frequency of silicon nitride (SiN) nanomechanical resonators can be measured very precisely due to low thermomechanical fluctuations resulting from large mechanical quality factors. These properties enable high-performance detection of quasi-instantaneous stimuli, such as sudden exposure to radiation or adsorption of mass. However, practical use of such sensors will eventually raise questions regarding their less-studied longer-term stability, notably for calibration purposes. We characterize aging of an as-fabricated SiN membrane by continuously tracking changes of its resonance frequency over 135 days in a temperature-controlled high vacuum environment. The aging behavior is consistent with previously reported double-logarithmic and drift-reversal aging trends observed in quartz oscillators. The aging magnitude (300 ppm) is also comparable to typical temperature compensated quartz oscillators (TCXO), after normalization to account for the greater importance of interfaces in our thin (90 nm) resonator, compared to several microns thick TCXOs. Possible causes of aging due to surface adsorption are investigated. We review models on how water adsorption and desorption can cause significant frequency changes, predominantly due to chemisorption stress. Chemical species adsorbed on the resonator surface are also identified by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). These measurements show a significant increase in carbon every time the sample is placed under vacuum, while subsequent exposure to air causes an increase in oxidated carbon. Developing models for the contribution of carbon and oxygen to the membrane stress should therefore be an important future direction. Other contaminants, notably alkaline and halide ions, are detected in smaller quantities and briefly discussed.</description>

      <title>Visualizing High Entropy Alloy Spaces: Methods and Best Practices</title>

Abstract: Multi-Principal Element Alloys (MPEAs) have emerged as an exciting area of research in materials science in the 2020s, owing to the vast potential for discovering alloys with unique and tailored properties enabled by the combinations of elements. However, the chemical complexity of MPEAs poses a significant challenge in visualizing composition-property relationships in high-dimensional design spaces. Without effective visualization techniques, designing chemically complex alloys is practically impossible. In this methods/protocols article, we present a `toolbox' of visualization techniques that allow for meaningful and insightful visualizations of MPEA composition spaces and property spaces. Our contribution to this toolbox are UMAP projections of entire alloy spaces. We deploy this visualization tool-kit on the following MPEA case studies: 1) Visualizing literature reviews, 2) constraint-satisfaction alloy design scheme, 3) Bayesian optimization alloy design campaigns. Furthermore, we show how this method can be applied to any barycentric design space. While there is no one-size-fits-all visualization technique, our toolbox offers a range of methods and best practices that can be tailored to specific MPEA research needs. This article is intended for materials scientists interested in performing research on multi-principal element alloys, chemically complex alloys, or high entropy alloys, and is expected to facilitate the discovery of novel and tailored properties in MPEAs.</description>

      <title>Nanostructuring of AlCu alloy NPs obtained by FLASiS{\dag}</title>

Abstract: In the nanometric scale, alloy nanomaterials behave as new materials since they are able to display structures and properties which are different from those of the pure metal nanostructures or bulk alloys. In this work, the compositional characteristics of AlCu alloy nanoparticles obtained by {\dag}Femtosecond Laser Ablation Synthesis in Solution (FLASiS) on solid targets with different percentages of Al and Cu were studied. Morphology, structure, composition and plasmonic behaviour of the nanoparticles were analysed by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM), Energy-Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDS) and Optical Extinction Spectroscopy (OES). From the obtained results, underlying formation mechanism and a configuration model of a host alumina matrix with copper inclusions is proposed. Analysis of the plasmonic resonance spectral region in the extinction spectra of the synthesized colloids using this model show that the nanoparticles have a Cu filling factors of about 0.02 which agrees with those determined independently from TEM images. The amount of Al and Cu components in the nanoparticle depends on their relative percentages in the initial solid target. Here we describe the possible kinetic formation mechanism of these nanostructures.</description>

      <title>Tunable Doping and Mobility Enhancement in 2D Channel Field-Effect Transistors via Damage-Free Atomic Layer Deposition of AlOX Dielectrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07183v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional materials (2DMs) have been widely investigated because of their potential for heterogeneous integration with modern electronics. However, several major challenges remain, such as the deposition of high-quality dielectrics on 2DMs and the tuning of the 2DM doping levels. Here, we report a scalable plasma-enhanced atomic layer deposition (PEALD) process for direct deposition of a nonstoichiometric aluminum oxide (AlOX) dielectric, overcoming the damage issues associated with conventional methods. Furthermore, we control the thickness of the dielectric layer to systematically tune the doping level of 2DMs. The experimental results demonstrate successful deposition without detectable damage, as confirmed by Raman spectroscopy and electrical measurements. Our method enables tuning of the Dirac and threshold voltages of back-gated graphene and MoS${_2}$ field-effect transistors (FETs), respectively, while also increasing the charge carrier mobility in both device types. We further demonstrate the method in top-gated MoS${_2}$ FETs with double-stack dielectric layers (AlOX+Al${_2}$O${_3}$), achieving critical breakdown field strengths of 7 MV/cm and improved mobility compared with the back gate configuration. In summary, we present a PEALD process that offers a scalable and low-damage solution for dielectric deposition on 2DMs, opening new possibilities for precise tuning of device characteristics in heterogeneous electronic circuits.</description>

      <title>Insights into Polymer Electrolyte Stability and Reaction Pathways: A first-principle calculations study</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.07229v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study investigates the electrochemical behavior and decomposition pathways of four monomers, namely PMC, PMC-OH, PeMC-OH, and DEO-EA, which are potential candidates for polymer electrolytes in solid-state batteries. Density functional theory calculations were employed to determine the oxidation and reduction potentials of these monomers near different ions (Li+, TFSI-, and LiTFSI) and their corresponding reorganization energies. The results reveal notable sensitivity of the monomers to reduction in a Li+ rich regime and to oxidation in a TFSI- rich regime. Additionally, the decomposition pathways of the monomers were investigated, focusing on the cleavage of CO bonds. The findings provide insights into the stability and reactivity of these monomers in various electrochemical environments.</description>

      <title>Symmetric n-and p-Type Sub-5-nm 1D Graphene Nanoribbon Transistors for Homogeneous CMOS Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07338v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graphene nanoribbon (GNR) emerges as an exceptionally promising channel candidate due to its tunable sizable bandgap (0-3 eV), ultrahigh carrier mobility (up to 4600 cm^(2) V^(-1) s^(-1)), and excellent device performance (current on-off ratio of 10^(7)). However, the asymmetry of reported n-type and p-type GNR field-effect transistors (FETs) at ultrashort gate length (Lg) has become an obstacle to future complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) integration. Here, we conduct ab initio quantum transport simulations to investigate the transport properties of sub-5-nm Lg 7 armchair-edge GNR (7 AGNR) FETs. The on-state current, delay time, and power dissipation of the n-type and p-type 7 AGNR FETs fulfill the International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors targets for high-performance devices when Lg is reduced to 3 nm. Remarkably, the 7 AGNR FETs exhibit superior n-type and p-type symmetry to the 7-9-7 AGNR FETs due to the more symmetrical electron/hole effective masses. Compared to the monolayer MoS2 and MoTe2 counterparts, the 7 AGNR FETs have better device performance, which could be further improved via gate engineering. Our results shed light on the immense potential of 7 AGNR in advancing CMOS electronics beyond silicon.</description>

      <title>Lateral Mn5Ge3 spin-valve in contact with a high-mobility Ge two-dimensional hole gas</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.07412v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ge two-dimensional hole gases in strained modulation-doped quantum-wells represent a promising material platform for future spintronic applications due to their excellent spin transport properties and the theoretical possibility of efficient spin manipulation. Due to the continuous development of epitaxial growth recipes extreme high hole mobilities and low effective masses can be achieved, promising an efficient spin transport. Furthermore, the Ge two-dimensional hole gas (2DHG) can be integrated in the well-established industrial complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) devices technology. However, efficient electrical spin injection into a Ge 2DHG - a prerequisite for the realization of spintronic devices - has not yet been demonstrated. In this work, we report the fabrication and low-temperature magnetoresistance measurements of a laterally structured Mn5Ge3/Ge 2DHG/ Mn5Ge3 device. The ferromagnetic Mn5Ge3 contacts are grown directly into the Ge quantum well by means of an interdiffusion process with a spacing of approximately 130 nm. We observe a magnetoresistance signal for temperatures below 13 K possibly arising from successful spin injection. The results represent a step forward toward the realization of CMOS compatible spintronic devices based on a 2DHG.</description>

      <title>Ternary superhydrides under pressure of Anderson's theorem: Near-record superconductivity in (La,Sc)H$_{12}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07477v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lanthanum-hydrogen system and its derivatives remain among the most promising for achieving room-temperature superconductivity. In this study, we examined the formation of ternary lanthanum-scandium superhydrides at pressures up to 220 GPa. The primary product of the LaSc alloy's reaction with hydrogen is newly discovered cubic (La,Sc)H$_{12}$, demonstrating clear superconducting transition in all six channels of the van der Pauw scheme below 244-248 K. In this compound with an unusually large unit cell volume, virtually no magnetoresistance was observed in fields up to 68 Tesla. Synthesized samples of (La,Sc)H$_{12}$ demonstrate pronounced superconducting diode and SQUID-like effects at a record high temperature of 226 K. Furthermore, our analysis revealed the formation of lower hexagonal polyhydrides (La,Sc)H$_{6-7}$, which could potentially account for the anomaly in electrical resistance observed near 274 K. This anomalous behavior may be of a superconducting nature, since low-temperature diffraction studies indicate the absence of corresponding structural phase transitions in La-Sc polyhydrides.</description>

Abstract: Analysis of the steady-state Kirchhoff equations within the framework of a new physics-based equivalent circuit provides explicit expressions for the holding voltage and current for the resistive mode in bi-stable CMOS structures. The resulting expressions are functions of the physical parameters (temperature, doping level of the substrate, material band gap), which makes it possible to evaluate the influence of technological factors on the latchup parameters. In particular, an explicit formula was obtained for the critical charge for single event latchup as a function of process parameters and temperature.</description>

      <title>Imaging strain-controlled magnetic reversal in thin CrSBr</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.07657v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional materials are extraordinarily sensitive to external stimuli, making them ideal for studying fundamental properties and for engineering devices with new functionalities. One such stimulus, strain, affects the magnetic properties of the layered magnetic semiconductor CrSBr to such a degree that it can induce a reversible antiferromagnetic-to-ferromagnetic phase transition. Given the pervasiveness of non-uniform strain in exfoliated two-dimensional magnets, it is crucial to understand its impact on their magnetic behavior. Using scanning SQUID-on-lever microscopy, we directly image the effects of spatially inhomogeneous strain on the magnetization of layered CrSBr as it is polarized by a field applied along its easy axis. The evolution of this magnetization and the formation of domains is reproduced by a micromagnetic model, which incorporates the spatially varying strain and the corresponding changes in the local interlayer exchange stiffness. The observed sensitivity to small strain gradients along with similar images of a nominally unstrained CrSBr sample suggest that unintentional strain inhomogeneity influences the magnetic behavior of exfoliated samples and must be considered in the design of future devices.</description>

      <title>Enabling two-dimensional electron gas with high room-temperature electron mobility exceeding 100 cm$^2$/Vs at a perovskite oxide interface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07659v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In perovskite oxide heterostructures, bulk functional properties coexist with emergent physical phenomena at epitaxial interfaces. Notably, charge transfer at the interface between two insulating oxide layers can lead to the formation of a two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) with possible applications in, e.g., high-electronmobility transistors and ferroelectric field-effect transistors. So far, the realization of oxide 2DEGs is, however, largely limited to the interface between the single-crystal substrate and epitaxial film, preventing their deliberate placement inside a larger device architecture. Additionally, the substrate-limited quality of perovskite oxide interfaces hampers room-temperature 2DEG performance due to notoriously low electron mobility. In this work, we demonstrate the controlled creation of an interfacial 2DEG at the epitaxial interface between perovskite oxides BaSnO$_3$ and LaInO$_3$ with enhanced room-temperature electron mobilities up to 119 cm$^2$/Vs - the highest room-temperature value reported so far for a perovskite oxide 2DEG. Using a combination of state-of-the-art deposition modes during oxide molecular beam epitaxy, our approach opens up another degree of freedom in optimization and $in$-$situ$ control of the interface between two epitaxial oxide layers away from the substrate interface. We thus expect our approach to apply to the general class of perovskite oxide 2DEG systems and to enable their improved compatibility with novel device concepts and integration across materials platforms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2201.07751v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The construction of Wannier functions from Bloch orbitals offers a unitary freedom that can be exploited to yield Wannier functions with advantageous properties. Minimizing the spatial variance is a well-known choice; another, previously proposed for Wannier functions constructed from the occupied Bloch manifold, minimizes a weighted sum of spatial and energy variance. We show that this compromised dual localization constructs localized and physically reasonable orbitals from both valence and conduction bands at once. Near the Fermi energy, these dually localized Wannier functions recover bonding and antibonding orbitals for bulk silicon and molecular ethylene, as well as d-orbital character for metallic copper. Because they are both localized and retain information about the orbital energy spectrum, dually localized Wannier functions are well suited to orbital-dependent methods that associate Wannier functions with specific energy ranges.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.03690v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Vitrimer is a new, exciting class of sustainable polymers with the ability to heal due to their dynamic covalent adaptive network that can go through associative rearrangement reactions. However, a limited choice of constituent molecules restricts their property space, prohibiting full realization of their potential applications. To overcome this challenge, we couple molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and a novel graph variational autoencoder (VAE) machine learning model for inverse design of vitrimer chemistries with desired glass transition temperature (Tg) and synthesize a novel vitrimer polymer. We build the first vitrimer dataset of one million chemistries and calculate Tg on 8,424 of them by high-throughput MD simulations calibrated by a Gaussian process model. The proposed novel VAE employs dual graph encoders and a latent dimension overlapping scheme which allows for individual representation of multi-component vitrimers. By constructing a continuous latent space containing necessary information of vitrimers, we demonstrate high accuracy and efficiency of our framework in discovering novel vitrimers with desirable Tg beyond the training regime. To validate the effectiveness of our framework in experiments, we generate novel vitrimer chemistries with a target Tg = 323 K. By incorporating chemical intuition, we synthesize a vitrimer with Tg of 311-317 K, and experimentally demonstrate healability and flowability. The proposed framework offers an exciting tool for polymer chemists to design and synthesize novel, sustainable vitrimer polymers for a facet of applications.</description>

      <title>Damage Localisation in Fresh Cement Mortar Observed via In Situ (Timelapse) X-ray {\mu}CT imaging</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.11988v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents the outcome of a study focused on the evolution of internal damage in fresh cement mortar over 25 hours of hardening. In situ timelapse X-ray computed micro-tomography ({\mu}XCT) imaging method was used to detect internal damage and capture its evolution in cement mortar hardening. During {\mu}XCT scans, the temperature released during the cement hydration was measured, which provided insight into the internal damage evolution with a link to a hydration temperature rise. The measured temperature during cement mortar hardening was compared with an analytical model, which showed a relatively good agreement with the experimental data. Using 20 CT scans acquired throughout the observed cement mortar hardening, it was possible to obtain a quantified characterisation of the porous space. Additionally, the use of timelapse {\mu}XCT imaging over 25 hours allowed for studying the crack growth inside the meso-structure including its volume and surface characterisation. The results provide valuable insights into cement mortar shrinkage and serve as a proof-of-concept methodology for future material characterisation.</description>

      <title>Vacancy-mediated transport and segregation tendencies of solutes in FCC nickel under diffusional creep: A density functional theory study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00639v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Nabarro-Herring (N-H) diffusional creep theory postulates the vacancy-mediated transport of atoms under a stress gradient as the creep mechanism under low-stress and high-temperature conditions. In multicomponent alloys, we premise that this stress-assisted flow of vacancies to and from grain boundaries will produce elemental segregation. An observation of such segregation, validated with theoretical predictions, can provide the necessary experimental evidence for the occurrence of N-H creep. Theoretical calculations of the segregation tendencies via analyzing the dominant solute diffusion mechanisms and the difference in diffusivities of the elements are therefore essential. To this end, this study applies density functional theory calculations of migration barriers and solute-vacancy binding energies as input to the self-consistent mean field theory to assess the vacancy-mediated diffusion mechanisms, transport coefficients, and segregation tendencies of Co, Cr, Mo, Re, Ta, and W solutes in face-centered cubic Ni. We find Co, Re, and W to be slow diffusers at high temperatures and Cr, Mo, and Ta to be fast diffusers. Further analysis shows that the slow diffusers tend to always enrich at vacancy sinks over a wide range of temperatures. In contrast, the fast diffusers show a transition from depletion to enrichment as the temperature lowers. Furthermore, our analysis of the segregation tendencies under tensile hydrostatic strains shows that slow diffusers are largely unaffected by the strain and favor enrichment. On the other hand, the fast diffusers exhibit high sensitivity to strain and their segregation tendency can transition from depletion to enrichment at a given temperature. The transport coefficients calculated in this work are expected to serve as input to mesoscale microstructure models to provide a more rigorous assessment of solute segregation under N-H creep conditions.</description>

      <title>Connecting the hexagonal closed packed structure with the cuboidal lattices: A Burgers-Bain type martensitic transformation for a Lennard-Jones solid derived from exact lattice summations</title>

Abstract: The diffusionless martensitic phase transition from a hexagonal close-packed (hcp) arrangement to the face-centered close-packed (fcc) and subsequently the body-centered cubic (bcc) lattice is discussed for a Lennard-Jones solid. The associated lattice vectors to construct the underlying bi-lattice for a Burgers-Bain-type of transformation require a minimum of four parameters $(a,\alpha,\beta,\gamma=c/a)$ describing, beside the change in the base lattice parameters $a$ and $c$, the shear force acting on the hexagonal base plane through the parameter $\alpha$, and the sliding force of the middle layer in the original AB hexagonal packing arrangement through the parameter $\beta$. By optimizing the lattice parameters $a$ and $\beta$ for a $(n,m)$-Lennard-Jones potential, we obtain a simple two-dimensional picture for the complete Burgers-Bain-type hcp$\leftrightarrow$fcc$\leftrightarrow$bcc phase transition. From the generalized lattice vectors we were able to construct the corresponding lattice sums in terms of inverse power potentials applying fast converging Bessel function expansions using a Terras decomposition of the Epstein zeta function combined with a Van der Hoff-Benson expansion for the lattice sums. This allows the cohesive energy to be determined to computer precision for a Lennard-Jones solid. For six different combinations of $(n,m)$-Lennard-Jones potentials the energy $(\alpha,\gamma)$ hypersurface was then mapped out and studied in more detail. We show that for a Lennard-Jones model the minimum energy path is found to be a two-step hcp$\rightarrow$fcc$\rightarrow$bcc transition process. The lowest transition state in each case can be regarded as an upper limit to a hypothetical true minimum energy path out of the many possibilities in a hcp$\leftrightarrow$fcc$\leftrightarrow$bcc phase transition.</description>

      <title>Magnetization nutation in magnetic semiconductors: Effective spin model with anisotropic RKKY exchange interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03098v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate that the magnetization of magnetic semiconductors, when subjected to an external magnetic field, exhibits nutational motion. This motion arises from the anisotropy between spin-up and spin-down conduction bands, which induces anisotropic, distance-dependent exchange coupling.
  To investigate this phenomenon, we examine a general system that includes both charge and spin degrees of freedom, characteristic of a magnetic semiconductor. This system is described by two subsystems: (1) a gas of noninteracting conduction electrons and (2) a ferromagnetic array of localized spins, coupled through the Vonsovskii (\textit{sd}) local interaction. The entire system is subject to external electrical and magnetic disturbances. Through the Feynman-Schwinger formalism, we integrate out the faster (Grassmann) charge degrees of freedom associated with the conduction electrons to obtain the effective Hamiltonian for the localized spins in the form of an XXZ spin model. We then provide general analytical formulas for the corresponding anisotropic exchange couplings, expressed in both Fourier and direct spaces, as functions of the effective field that induces conduction-band splitting.
  As a practical application of this general formalism, we investigate the dynamics of the net magnetic moment within the effective spin model. We demonstrate that the anisotropy of the distance-dependent exchange coupling results in nutational magnetization motion at significantly higher frequencies than the typical precession, which is also modified accordingly....</description>

      <title>Discovery of a metallic room-temperature d-wave altermagnet KV2Se2O</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00320v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Beyond conventional ferromagnetism and antiferromagnetism, altermagnetism is a recently discovered unconventional magnetic phase characterized by time-reversal symmetry breaking and spin-split band structures in materials with zero net magnetization. This distinct magnetic phase not only enriches the understanding of fundamental physical concepts but also has profound impacts on condense-matter physics research and practical device applications. Spin-polarized band structures have been recently observed in semiconductors MnTe and MnTe2 with vanishing net magnetization, confirming the existence of this unconventional magnetic order. Metallic altermagnets have unique advantages for exploring novel physical phenomena related to low-energy quasiparticle excitations and for applications in spintronics as electrical conductivity in metals allows the direct manipulation of spin current through electric field. Here, through comprehensive characterization and analysis of the magnetic and electronic structures of KV2Se2O, we have unambiguously demonstrated a metallic room-temperature altermaget with d-wave spin-momentum locking. The highly anisotropic spin-polarized Fermi surfaces and the spin-density-wave order emerging in the altermagnetic phase make it an extraordinary platform for designing high-performance spintronic devices and studying many-body effects coupled with the unconventional magnetism.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Coexistence of Spin States in [Fe-(tpy-ph)$_2$]$^{2+}$ Complexes on Au(111) using ab initio calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07014v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we systematically study the electronic structure and stability of spin states of the [Fe-(tpy-ph)$_2$]$^{2+}$ molecule in both gas phase and on a Au(111) substrate using density functional theory +U (DFT+U) calculations. We find that the stability of the Fe$^{2+}$ ion's spin states is significantly influenced by the Hubbard U parameter. In the gas phase, the low-spin (LS, S=0) state is found to be energetically favorable for U(Fe) $\leq$ 3 eV, whereas the high-spin (HS, S=2) state is stabilized for U(Fe) &gt; 3 eV. Interaction with the Au(111) substrate is found to elevate the critical U for the spin-state transition to 3.5 eV. Additionally, we perform L-edge X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) calculations based on time-dependent DFT (TD-DFT) for both HS and LS states. The calculated XAS suggests that the HS state more closely aligns with the experimental observations, indicating the potential coexistence of the HS state as the initial state during the X-ray excitation process. These findings enrich our understanding of spin-state dynamics in [Fe-(tpy-ph)$_2$]$^{2+}$.</description>

      <title>Giant Hall Switching by Surface-State-Mediated Spin-Orbit Torque in a Hard Ferromagnetic Topological Insulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.05603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.05603v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Topological insulators (TI) and magnetic topological insulators (MTI) can apply highly efficient spin-orbit torque (SOT) and manipulate the magnetization with their unique topological surface states with ultra-high efficiency. Here, we demonstrate efficient SOT switching of a hard MTI, V-doped (Bi,Sb)2Te3 (VBST) with a large coercive field that can prevent the influence of an external magnetic field. A giant switched anomalous Hall resistance of 9.2 $k\Omega$ is realized, among the largest of all SOT systems, which makes the Hall channel a good readout and eliminates the need to fabricate complicated magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ) structures. The SOT switching current density can be reduced to $2.8\times10^5 A/cm^2$. Moreover, as the Fermi level is moved away from the Dirac point by both gate and composition tuning, VBST exhibits a transition from edge-state-mediated to surface-state-mediated transport, thus enhancing the SOT effective field to $1.56\pm 0.12 T/ (10^6 A/cm^2)$ and the interfacial charge-to-spin conversion efficiency to $3.9\pm 0.3 nm^{-1}$. The findings establish VBST as an extraordinary candidate for energy-efficient magnetic memory devices.</description>

      <title>Dynamical correlations and order in magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.08529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.08529v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In magic angle twisted bilayer graphene, transport, thermodynamic and spectroscopic experiments pinpoint at a competition between distinct low-energy states with and without electronic order. We use Dynamical Mean Field Theory (DMFT) on the topological heavy Fermion (THF) model of twisted bilayer graphene to investigate the emergence of electronic correlations and long-range order in the absence of strain. We contrast moment formation, Kondo screening and ordering on a temperature basis and explain the nature of emergent correlated states based on three central phenomena: (i) the formation of local spin and valley isospin moments around 100K, (ii) the ordering of the local isospin moments around 10K preempting Kondo screening, and (iii) a cascadic redistribution of charge between localized and delocalized electronic states upon doping. At integer fillings, we find that low energy spectral weight is depleted in the symmetric phase, while we find insulating states with gaps enhanced by exchange coupling in the zero-strain ordered phases. Doping away from integer filling results in distinct metallic states: a "bad metal" above the ordering temperature, where scattering off the disordered local moments suppresses electronic coherence, and a "good metal" in the ordered states with coherence of quasiparticles facilitated by isospin order. This finding reveals coherence from order as the microscopic mechanism behind the Pomeranchuk effect observed experimentally. Upon doping, there is a periodic charge reshuffling between localized and delocalized electronic orbitals leading to cascades of doping-induced Lifshitz transitions, local spectral weight redistributions and periodic variations of the electronic compressibility. Our findings provide a unified understanding of the most puzzling aspects of scanning tunneling spectroscopy, transport, and compressibility experiments.</description>

      <title>$^{19}$F NMR and defect spins in vacuum-annealed LaO$_{0.5}$F$_{0.5}$BiS$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06284v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report results of magnetization and $^{19}$F NMR measurements in the normal state of as-grown LaO$_{0.5}$F$_{0.5}$BiS$_2$. The magnetization is dominated by a temperature-independent diamagnetic component and a field- and temperature-dependent paramagnetic contribution $M_\mu(H,T)$ from a $\sim$1000~ppm concentration of local moments, an order of magnitude higher than can be accounted for by measured rare-earth impurity concentrations. $M_\mu(H,T)$ can be fit by the Brillouin function $B_J(x)$ or, perhaps more realistically, a two-level $\tanh(x)$ model for magnetic Bi $6p$ ions in defect crystal fields. Both fits require a phenomenological Curie-Weiss argument $x = \mu_\mathrm{eff}H/(T + T_W)$, $T_W \approx 1.7$ K. There is no evidence for magnetic order down to 2 K, and the origin of $T_W$ is not clear. $^{19}$F frequency shifts, linewidths, and spin-lattice relaxation rates are consistent with purely dipolar $^{19}$F/defect-spin interactions. The defect-spin correlation time $\tau_c(T)$ obtained from $^{19}$F spin-lattice relaxation rates obeys the Korringa relation $\tau_cT = \text{const.}$, indicating the relaxation is dominated by conduction-band fluctuations.</description>
