      <title>Single Molecule Spectral Fluctuation Originates from the Variation in Dipole Orientation Connected to Accessible Vibrational Modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02975v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fluctuation in fluorescence emission of immobilized single molecule is typically ascribed to the chromophore's intrinsic structural conformations and the influence of local environmental factors. Despite extensive research over several decades since its initial observation, a direct connection between these spectral fluctuations and the rearrangement of emission dipole orientations has remained elusive. In this study, we elucidate this fundamental molecular behavior and its underlying mechanisms by employing unique single-molecule multi-dimensional tracking to simultaneously monitor both the emission spectrum and the three-dimensional dipole orientation of individual fluorophore. For the first time, we present compelling evidence demonstrating a correlation between spectral fluctuations and dipolar rearrangements at room temperature. Our observations reveal that variations in the radiative relaxation probabilities among different vibronic emission bands, coupled with the interaction of associated vibrational modes, drive these spectral fluctuations. We identify significant out-of-plane dipole reorientations during pronounced spectral fluctuations - commonly known as spectral jumps - which primarily arise from transitions between dominant vibrational modes. Furthermore, we emphasize the potential for con-structing vibrational spectra and optical nanoscopy with vibrational specificity, leveraging the vibronic emissions from single emitters.</description>

      <title>On Ambient-light-induced intermolecular Coulombic decay in unbound pyridine monomers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02981v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A recent report by Barik et al. [Nature Chemistry 14, 1098, 2022] on ambient-light-induced intermolecular Coulombic decay (ICD) in unbound pyridine monomers proposes the formation of a pyridine cation via intermolecular Coulombic decay following a three-body association/collision, wherein all the three pyridine molecules are in the excited state. The collision-free conditions of the free-jet expansion, an abysmally low probability of finding three independently excited pyridine molecules in the vicinity of each other, and extremely low excited state lifetimes negate the possibility of ICD in unbound pyridine monomers. An alternate mechanism, wherein the pyridine monomer cation originates from the dissociative ionization of pyridine dimers following a three-photon absorption process, based on the translational energy measurements of pyridine cation is proposed.</description>

      <title>A dual-cutoff machine-learned potential for condensed organic systems obtained via uncertainty-guided active learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine-learned potentials (MLPs) trained on ab initio data combine the computational efficiency of classical interatomic potentials with the accuracy and generality of the first-principles method used in the creation of the respective training set. In this work, we implement and train a MLP to obtain an accurate description of the potential energy surface and property predictions for organic compounds, as both single molecules and in the condensed phase. We devise a dual descriptor, based on the atomic cluster expansion (ACE), that couples an information-rich short-range description with a coarser long-range description that captures weak intermolecular interactions. We employ uncertainty-guided active learning for the training set generation, creating a dataset that is comparatively small for the breadth of application and consists of alcohols, alkanes, and an adipate. Utilizing that MLP, we calculate densities of those systems of varying chain lengths as a function of temperature, obtaining a discrepancy of less than 4% compared with experiment. Vibrational frequencies calculated with the MLP have a root mean square error of less than 1 THz compared to DFT. The heat capacities of condensed systems are within 11% of experimental findings, which is strong evidence that the dual descriptor provides an accurate framework for the prediction of both short-range intramolecular and long-range intermolecular interactions.</description>

      <title>Elastic and Inelastic Electron Scattering Cross Sections of Trichlorofluoromethane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03171v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Differential elastic electron scattering cross sections of trichlorofluoromethane $\mathrm{(CCl_3F)}$ were measured for the first time for electron energies between 30 eV and 800 eV in the angular range of 20{\deg} to 150{\deg}. The experimental results were compared with calculations using the IAM-SCAR+I model. Satisfactory agreements between both data sets were found for electron energies above 200 eV within experimental uncertainties, whereas significant deviations of up to 100% were observed at electron energies below 60 eV. In addition to the measurements of differential elastic scattering cross sections, total inelastic scattering cross sections of $\mathrm{(CCl_3F)}$ were calculated using the spherical complex optical potential (SCOP) model. These calculations closely match experimental total ionization cross sections available in the literature for energies below 50 eV. The sum of the experimental total elastic and the theoretical total inelastic scattering cross sections aligns very well with the total electron scattering cross sections of $\mathrm{(CCl_3F)}$ measured by other groups across the entire energy range (30 eV to 800 eV), demonstrating the consistency among these three cross sections.</description>

      <title>Path-integral calculation of the third dielectric virial coefficient of helium based on ab initio three-body polarizability and dipole surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a surface for the electric dipole moment of three interacting helium atoms and use it, together with state-of-the-art potential and polarizability surfaces, to compute the third dielectric virial coefficient, $C_\varepsilon$, for both $^4$He and $^3$He isotopes. Our results agree with previously published data computed using an approximated form for the three-body polarizability, and are extended to the low-temperature regime by including exchange effects. Additionally, the uncertainty of $C_\varepsilon$ is rigorously determined for the first time by propagating the uncertainties of the potential and polarizability surfaces; this uncertainty is much larger than the contribution from the dipole-moment surface to $C_\varepsilon$. Our results compare reasonably well with the limited experimental data. The first-principles values of $C_\epsilon$ computed in this work will enhance the accuracy of primary temperature and pressure metrology based on measurements of the dielectric constant of helium.</description>

      <title>Multiscale modeling framework of a constrained fluid with complex boundaries using twin neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03263v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The properties of constrained fluids have increasingly gained relevance for applications ranging from materials to biology. In this work, we propose a multiscale model using twin neural networks to investigate the properties of a fluid constrained between solid surfaces with complex shapes. The atomic scale model and the mesoscale model are connected by the coarse-grained potential which is represented by the first neural network. Then we train the second neural network model as a surrogate to predict the velocity profile of the constrained fluid with complex boundary conditions at the mesoscale. The effect of complex boundary conditions on the fluid dynamics properties and the accuracy of the neural network model prediction are systematically investigated. We demonstrate that the neural network-enhanced multiscale framework can connect simulations at atomic scale and mesoscale and reproduce the properties of a constrained fluid at mesoscale. This work provides insight into multiscale model development with the aid of machine learning techniques and the developed model can be used for modern nanotechnology applications such as enhanced oil recovery and porous materials design.</description>

      <title>Accurate QM/MM Molecular Dynamics for Periodic Systems in \textsc{GPU4PySCF} with Applications to Enzyme Catalysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03273v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an implementation of the quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) method for periodic systems using GPU accelerated QM methods, a distributed multipole formulation of the electrostatics, and a pseudo-bond treatment of the QM/MM boundary. We demonstrate that our method has well-controlled errors, stable self-consistent QM convergence, and energy-conserving dynamics. We further describe an application to the catalytic kinetics of chorismate mutase. Using an accurate hybrid functional reparametrized to coupled cluster energetics, our QM/MM simulations highlight the sensitivity in the calculated rate to the choice of quantum method, quantum region selection, and local protein conformation. Our work is provided through the open-source \textsc{PySCF} package using acceleration from the \textsc{GPU4PySCF} module.</description>

      <title>Quantum Simulations of Chemistry in First Quantization with any Basis Set</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03145v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum computation of the energy of molecules and materials is one of the most promising applications of fault-tolerant quantum computers. However, practical applications require algorithms with reduced resource requirements. Previous work has mainly represented the Hamiltonian of the system in second quantization. Existing methods in first quantization are limited to grid-based approaches that do not allow for active space calculations. In this work, we present a method to solve the generic ground-state chemistry problem in first quantization on a fault-tolerant quantum computer using any basis set. This allows for calculations in the active space using modern quantum chemistry basis sets. We derive a linear-combination-of-unitaries decomposition for a chemical Hamiltonian in first quantization and then construct an efficient block encoding, exploiting sparsity of the Hamiltonian. For active space calculations using a molecular orbital basis set, we achieve an asymptotic speed up in Toffoli-gate count compared to the equivalent method in second quantization [Berry, et. al. Quantum 3, 208 (2019)]. We also consider the dual plane waves for materials simulations and find that in physically interesting regimes we achieve orders of magnitude improvement in quantum resources compared to the second quantization counterpart. In some instances, our approach provides similar or even lower resources compared to the first quantization plane wave algorithm of Refs.[Babbush, et. al npj Quantum Inf 5(1) 92 (2019), Su et. al PRX Quantum 2(4), 040332 (2021)] that, unlike our approach, avoids loading the classical data from quantum memory. This work opens up possibilities to reduce quantum resources even further using factorization methods of a Hamiltonian or modern pseudopotentials. Furthermore, our approach can be adapted to other applications, such as the vibrational properties of chemical systems.</description>

      <title>Quantum Computation of Electronic Structure with Projector Augmented-Wave Method and Plane Wave Basis Set</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03159v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum simulation of materials is a promising application area of quantum computers. In order to realize this promise, finding ways to reduce quantum resources while maintaining the accuracy of results will be necessary. In electronic structure calculations on classical computer the reduction of resources has been achieved by using the projector augmented-wave method (PAW) and plane wave basis sets. In this work, we present an implementation of the PAW with plane waves for quantum computation of the energy. We first generalize the approach to many-body wavefunctions and develop the unitary version of the PAW which preserves the orthonormality of orbitals. Then, we provide a linear-combination-of-unitaries decomposition which explicitly accounts for the atomic two-body PAW correction and provide the corresponding block encodings of the Hamiltonian used in qubitized quantum phase estimation. We then estimate quantum resources for crystalline solids using down-sampling to estimate the energy within chemical accuracy with respect to the full basis set limit, and also consider a supercell approach which is more suitable for calculations of defect states. We provide the quantum resources for energy estimation of a nitrogen-vacancy defect centre in diamond which is a challenging system for classical algorithms and a quintessential problem in the studies of quantum point defects.</description>

      <title>Phase field simulations of thermal annealing for all-small molecule organic solar cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03190v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Interest in organic solar cells (OSCs) is constantly rising in the field of photovoltaic devices. The device performance relies on the bulk heterojunction (BHJ) nanomorphology, which develops during the drying process and additional post-treatment. This work studies the effect of thermal annealing (TA) on an all-small molecule DRCN5T: PC71 BM blend with phase field simulations. The objective is to determine the physical phenomena driving the evolution of the BHJ morphology for a better understanding of the posttreatment/morphology relationship. Phase-field simulation results are used to investigate the impact on the final BHJ morphology of the DRCN5T crystallization-related mechanisms, including nucleation, growth, crystal stability, impingement, grain coarsening, and Ostwald ripening, of the amorphous-amorphous phase separation (AAPS), and of diffusion limitations. The comparison of simulation results with experimental data shows that the morphological evolution of the BHJ under TA is dominated by dissolution of the smallest, unstable DRCN5T crystals and anisotropic growth of the largest crystals.</description>

      <title>A non-Hermitian quantum mechanics approach for extracting and emulating continuum physics based on bound-state-like calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03309v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work develops a new method for computing a finite quantum system's continuum states and observables by applying a subspace projection (or reduced basis) method used in model order reduction studies to ``discretize'' the system's continuous spectrum. The method extracts the continuum physics from solving Schr\"odinger equations with bound-state-like boundary conditions and emulates this extraction in the space of the input parameters. This parameter emulation can readily be adapted to emulate other continuum calculations as well, e.g., those based on complex energy or Lorentz integral transform methods. Here, I give an overview of the key aspects of the formalism and some informative findings from numerical experimentation with two- and three-body systems, which indicates the non-Hermitian quantum mechanics nature of the method. A potential connection with (near-)optimal rational approximation studied in Math literature is also discussed. Further details are provided in a separate paper.</description>

      <title>Accelerated Development of Multicomponent Alloys in Discrete Design Space Using Bayesian Multi-Objective Optimisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.06106v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bayesian optimization (BO) protocol based on Active Learning (AL) principles has garnered significant attention due to its ability to optimize black-box objective functions efficiently. This capability is a prerequisite for guiding autonomous and high-throughput materials design and discovery processes. However, its application in materials science, particularly for novel alloy designs with multiple targeted properties, remains limited. This limitation is due to the computational complexity and the lack of reliable and robust acquisition functions for multiobjective optimization. In recent years, expected hypervolume-based geometrical acquisition functions have demonstrated superior performance and speed compared to other multiobjective optimization algorithms, such as Thompson Sampling Efficient Multiobjective Optimization (TSEMO), Pareto Efficient Global Optimization (parEGO), etc. This work compares several state-of-the-art multiobjective BO acquisition functions, i.e., parallel expected hypervolume improvement (qEHVI), noisy parallel expected hypervolume improvement (qNEHVI), parallel Pareto efficient global optimization (parEGO), and parallel noisy Pareto efficient global optimization (qNparEGO) for the multiobjective optimization of physical properties in multi-component alloys. We demonstrate the impressive performance of the qEHVI acquisition function in finding the optimum Pareto front in 1-, 2-, and 3-objective Aluminium alloy optimization problems within a limited evaluation budget and reasonable computational cost. In addition, we discuss the role of different surrogate model optimization methods from a computational cost and efficiency perspective.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07143v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an original multi-state projective diabatization scheme based on the Green's function formalism that allows the systematic mapping of many-body ab initio calculations onto effective excitonic models. This method inherits the ability of the Bethe-Salpeter equation to describe Frenkel molecular excitons and intermolecular charge-transfer states equally well, as well as the possibility for an effective description of environmental effects in a QM/MM framework. The latter is found to be a crucial element in order to obtain accurate model parameters for condensed phases and to ensure their transferability to excitonic models for extended systems. The method is presented through a series of examples illustrating its quality, robustness, and internal consistency.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.07835v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a theory for phase-separated liquid coacervates with salt, taking into account spatial heterogeneities and interfacial profiles. We find that charged layers of alternating sign can form around the interface while the bulk phases remain approximately charge-neutral. We show that the salt concentration regulates the number of layers and the amplitude of the layer's charge density and electrostatic potential. Such charged layers can either repel or attract single-charged molecules diffusing across the interface. Our theory could be relevant for artificial systems and biomolecular condensates in cells. Our work suggests that interfaces of biomolecular condensates could mediate charge-specific transport similar to membrane-bound compartments.</description>

      <title>Unveiling Intrinsic Many-Body Complexity by Compressing Single-Body Triviality</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.16841v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The simultaneous treatment of static and dynamical correlations in strongly-correlated electron systems is a critical challenge. In particular, finding a universal scheme for identifying a single-particle orbital basis that minimizes the representational complexity of the many-body wavefunction is a formidable and longstanding problem. As a substantial contribution towards its solution, we show that the total orbital correlation actually reveals and quantifies the intrinsic complexity of the wavefunction,once it is minimized via orbital rotations. To demonstrate the power of this concept in practice, an iterative scheme is proposed to optimize the orbitals by minimizing the total orbital correlation calculated by the tailored coupled cluster singles and doubles (TCCSD) ansatz. The optimized orbitals enable the limited TCCSD ansatz to capture more non-trivial information of the many-body wavefunction, indicated by the improved wavefunction and energy. An initial application of this scheme shows great improvement of TCCSD in predicting the singlet ground state potential energy curves of the strongly correlated C$_{\rm 2}$ and Cr$_{\rm 2}$ molecule.</description>

Abstract: An increasing interest in molecular structures whose long term dynamics resemble those of bistable mechanical systems promotes the search of possible candidates that may operate as two-state switching units. Of particular interest are the systems that are capable to exhibit such bistable effects as spontaneous vibrations, stochastic resonance and spontaneous synchronization. Previously, in all-atom molecular dynamics simulations it has been demonstrated that short pyridine-furan springs show these bistable phenomena. In this article we introduce a coarse-grained model of such springs and investigate the possibility to observe the bistability effects, such as spontaneous vibrations. Our findings allow the studies of short pyridine-furan springs at large time an length scales and open field for further computational research of large bistable systems.</description>

      <title>Neural Network Emulator for Atmospheric Chemical ODE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01829</link>

Abstract: Modeling atmospheric chemistry is complex and computationally intense. Given the recent success of Deep neural networks in digital signal processing, we propose a Neural Network Emulator for fast chemical concentration modeling. We consider atmospheric chemistry as a time-dependent Ordinary Differential Equation. To extract the hidden correlations between initial states and future time evolution, we propose ChemNNE, an Attention based Neural Network Emulator (NNE) that can model the atmospheric chemistry as a neural ODE process. To efficiently simulate the chemical changes, we propose the sinusoidal time embedding to estimate the oscillating tendency over time. More importantly, we use the Fourier neural operator to model the ODE process for efficient computation. We also propose three physical-informed losses to supervise the training optimization. To evaluate our model, we propose a large-scale chemical dataset that can be used for neural network training and evaluation. The extensive experiments show that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in modeling accuracy and computational speed.</description>
