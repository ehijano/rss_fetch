      <title>Extended formulations for the multilinear polytope of acyclic hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04805v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article provides an overview of our joint work on binary polynomial optimization over the past decade. We define the multilinear polytope as the convex hull of the feasible region of a linearized binary polynomial optimization problem. By representing the multilinear polytope with hypergraphs, we investigate the connections between hypergraph acyclicity and the complexity of the facial structure of the multilinear polytope. We characterize the acyclic hypergraphs for which a polynomial-size extended formulation for the multilinear polytope can be constructed in polynomial time.</description>

      <title>Higher-order Delsarte Dual LPs: Lifting, Constructions and Completeness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04854v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A central and longstanding open problem in coding theory is the rate-versus-distance trade-off for binary error-correcting codes. In a seminal work, Delsarte introduced a family of linear programs establishing relaxations on the size of optimum codes. To date, the state-of-the-art upper bounds for binary codes come from dual feasible solutions to these LPs. Still, these bounds are exponentially far from the best-known existential constructions.
  Recently, hierarchies of linear programs extending and strengthening Delsarte's original LPs were introduced for linear codes, which we refer to as higher-order Delsarte LPs. These new hierarchies were shown to provably converge to the actual value of optimum codes, namely, they are complete hierarchies. Therefore, understanding them and their dual formulations becomes a valuable line of investigation. Nonetheless, their higher-order structure poses challenges. In fact, analysis of all known convex programming hierarchies strengthening Delsarte's original LPs has turned out to be exceedingly difficult and essentially nothing is known, stalling progress in the area since the 1970s.
  Our main result is an analysis of the higher-order Delsarte LPs via their dual formulation. Although quantitatively, our current analysis only matches the best-known upper bounds, it shows, for the first time, how to tame the complexity of analyzing a hierarchy strengthening Delsarte's original LPs. In doing so, we reach a better understanding of the structure of the hierarchy, which may serve as the foundation for further quantitative improvements. We provide two additional structural results for this hierarchy. First, we show how to \emph{explicitly} lift any feasible dual solution from level $k$ to a (suitable) larger level $\ell$ while retaining the objective value. Second, we give a novel proof of completeness using the dual formulation.</description>

      <title>On the Boxicity of Line Graphs and of Their Complements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05049v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The boxicity of a graph is the smallest dimension $d$ allowing a representation of it as the intersection graph of a set of $d$-dimensional axis-parallel boxes. We present a simple general approach to determining the boxicity of a graph based on studying its ``interval-order subgraphs.''
  The power of the method is first tested on the boxicity of some popular graphs that have resisted previous attempts: the boxicity of the Petersen graph is $3$, and more generally, that of the Kneser-graphs $K(n,2)$ is $n-2$ if $n\ge 5$, confirming a conjecture of Caoduro and Lichev [Discrete Mathematics, Vol. 346, 5, 2023].
  As every line graph is an induced subgraph of the complement of $K(n,2)$, the developed tools show furthermore that line graphs have only a polynomial number of edge-maximal interval-order subgraphs. This opens the way to polynomial-time algorithms for problems that are in general $NP$-hard: for the existence and optimization of interval-order subgraphs of line graphs, or of interval completions and the boxicity of their complement, if the boxicity is bounded.
  We finally extend our approach to upper and lower bounding the boxicity of line graphs.</description>

      <title>Extending Wormald's Differential Equation Method to One-sided Bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.12358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.12358v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this note, we formulate a "one-sided" version of Wormald's differential equation method. In the standard "two-sided" method, one is given a family of random variables which evolve over time and which satisfy some conditions including a tight estimate of the expected change in each variable over one time step. These estimates for the expected one-step changes suggest that the variables ought to be close to the solution of a certain system of differential equations, and the standard method concludes that this is indeed the case. We give a result for the case where instead of a tight estimate for each variable's expected one-step change, we have only an upper bound. Our proof is very simple, and is flexible enough that if we instead assume tight estimates on the variables, then we recover the conclusion of the standard differential equation method.</description>

      <title>Optimal List Recoloring of Subcubic Graphs and Complete Multipartite Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03748v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For a list-assignment $L$, the reconfiguration graph $C_L(G)$ of a graph $G$ is the graph whose vertices are proper $L$-colorings of $G$ and whose edges link two colorings that differ on only one vertex. If $|L(v)| \ge d(v) + 2$ for every vertex of $G$, it is known that $C_L(G)$ is connected. In this case, Cambie et al. investigated the diameter of $C_L(G)$. They conjectured that $diam(C_L(G)) \le n(G) + \mu(G)$ with $\mu(G)$ the size of a maximum matching of $G$ and proved several results towards this conjecture. We answer to two of their open problems by proving the conjecture for two classes of graphs, namely subcubic graphs and complete multipartite graphs.</description>
