      <title>Regular, beating and dilogarithmic breathers in biased photorefractive crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10445v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The propagation of light beams in photovoltaic pyroelectric photorefractive crystals is modelled by a specific generalization of the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation (GNLSE). We use the variational approximation (VA) to predict the propagation of solitary-wave inputs in the crystal, finding that the VA equations involve the dilogarithm special function. The VA predicts that solitons and breathers exist, and the Vakhitov-Kolokolov criterion predicts that the solitons are stable solutions. Direct simulations of the underlying GNLSE corroborates the existence of such stable modes. The numerical solutions produce both regular breathers and ones featuring beats (long-period modulations of fast oscillations). In the latter case, the Fourier transform of amplitude oscillations reveals a nearly discrete spectrum characterizing the beats dynamics. Numerical solutions of another type demonstrate spontaneous splitting of the input pulse in two or several secondary ones.</description>

      <title>Non-reciprocal breathing solitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10562v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Breathing solitons consist of a fast beating wave within a compact envelope of stable shape and velocity. They manifest themselves in a variety of contexts such as plasmas, optical fibers and cold atoms, but have remained elusive when energy conservation is broken. Here, we report on the observation of breathing, unidirectional, arbitrarily long-lived solitons in non-reciprocal, non-conservative active metamaterials. Combining precision desktop experiments, numerical simulations and perturbation theory on generalizations of the sine-Gordon and nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations, we demonstrate that unidirectional breathers generically emerge in weakly nonlinear non-reciprocal materials, and that their dynamics are governed by an unstable fixed point. Crucially, breathing solitons can persist for arbitrarily long times provided: (i) this fixed point displays a bifurcation upon reachin a delicate balance between energy injection and dissipation; (ii) the initial conditions allow the dynamics to reach this bifurcation point. Our work establishes non-reciprocity as a promising avenue to generate stable nonlinear unidirectional waves, and could be generalized beyond metamaterials to optics, soft matter and superconducting circuits.</description>

      <title>A semiclassical model for charge transfer along ion chains in silicates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.15186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.15186v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It has been observed in fossil tracks and experiments in the layered silicate mica muscovite the transport of charge through the cation layers sandwiched between the layers of tetrahedra-octahedra-tetrahedra. A classical model for the propagation of anharmonic vibrations along the cation chains has been proposed based on first principles and empirical functions. In that model, several propagating entities have been found as kinks or crowdions and breathers, both with or without wings, the latter for specific velocities and energies. Crowdions are equivalent to moving interstitials and transport electric charge if the moving particle is an ion, but they also imply the movement of mass, which was not observed in the experiments. Breathers, being just vibrational entities, do not transport charge. In this work, we present a semiclassical model obtained by adding a quantum particle, electron or hole to the previous model. We present the construction of the model based on the physics of the system. In particular, the strongly nonlinear vibronic interaction between the nuclei and the extra electron or hole is essential to explain the localized charge transport, which is not compatible with the adiabatic approximation. The formation of vibrational localized charge carriers breaks the lattice symmetry group in a similar fashion to the Jahn-Teller Effect, providing a new stable dynamical state. We study the properties and the coherence of the model through numerical simulations from initial conditions obtained by tail analysis and other means. We observe that although the charge spreads from an initial localization in a lattice at equilibrium, it can be confined basically to a single particle when coupled to a chaotic quasiperiodic breather. This is coherent with the observation that experiments imply that a population of charge is formed due to the decay of potassium unstable isotopes.</description>

      <title>Modulational instability in a quasi-one-dimensional Bose-Einstein condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02282v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the modulational instability of plane wave solutions within a modified Gross-Pitaevskii equation framework. The equation features cubic and quartic nonlinearity. It models the behaviour of quasi-one-dimensional Bose-Einstein condensates in symmetric Bose-Bose mixtures of ultra-dilute cold atoms. Our study demonstrates the pivotal role of the competition between mean-field attractions and quantum fluctuation-induced repulsions. This competition significantly affects the emergence and evolution of modulational instability. By employing linear stability analysis, we identify the essential conditions that lead to modulational instability. We find that the stability of plane wave solutions significantly depends on the interaction among system parameters. Further development of the instability leads to the fragmentation of the BEC into a chain of quantum droplets. We calculated the quantity of quantum droplets generated during the nonlinear phase of the instability. Our analytical results are corroborated by numerical simulations of the modified quasi-1D Gross-Pitaevskii equation. These simulations vividly depict the formation, interaction, and coalescence of droplets during the nonlinear phase of modulational instability. The investigation shows that linear stability analysis of the modified Gross-Pitaevskii equation, considering quantum fluctuations, precisely forecasts modulational instability phenomena across different domains of parameter spaces.</description>
