      <title>Impact of Climate transition on Credit portfolio's loss with stochastic collateral</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13266v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose models to quantify the distortion the credit portfolio (expected and unexpected) losses, when the obligor companies as well as their guarantees belong to an economy subject to the climate transition. The economy's productivity is modeled as a multidimensional Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (O.-U.) process while the climate transition is represented by a continuous deterministic carbon price process. We define each loan's loss at default as the difference between Exposure at Default (EAD) and the liquidated collateral, which will help us to define the Loss Given Default (LGD). We consider two types of collateral: financial asset (such as invoices, cash, or investments) or physical asset (such as real estate, business equipment, or inventory). For financial assets, we model them by the continuous time version of the discounted cash flows methodology, where the cash flows SDE is driven by the instantaneous output growth, the instantaneous growth of a carbon price function, and an arithmetic Brownian motion. For physical assets, we focus on property in the housing market. We define, as Sopgoui (2024), their value as the difference between the price of an equivalent efficient building following an exponential O.-U. as well as the actualized renovation costs and the actualized sum of the future additional energy costs due to the inefficiency of the building, before an optimal renovation date which depends on the carbon price process. Finally, we obtain how the loss' risk measures of a credit portfolio are skewed in the context of climate transition through carbon price and/or energy performance of buildings when both the obligors and their guarantees are affected. This work provides a methodology to calculate the (statistics of the) loss of a portfolio of secured loans, starting from a given climate transition scenario described by a carbon price.</description>

      <title>Loss-based Bayesian Sequential Prediction of Value at Risk with a Long-Memory and Non-linear Realized Volatility Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13588v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A long memory and non-linear realized volatility model class is proposed for direct Value at Risk (VaR) forecasting. This model, referred to as RNN-HAR, extends the heterogeneous autoregressive (HAR) model, a framework known for efficiently capturing long memory in realized measures, by integrating a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to handle non-linear dynamics. Loss-based generalized Bayesian inference with Sequential Monte Carlo is employed for model estimation and sequential prediction in RNN HAR. The empirical analysis is conducted using daily closing prices and realized measures from 2000 to 2022 across 31 market indices. The proposed models one step ahead VaR forecasting performance is compared against a basic HAR model and its extensions. The results demonstrate that the proposed RNN-HAR model consistently outperforms all other models considered in the study.</description>

      <title>A novel k-generation propagation model for cyber risk and its application to cyber insurance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The frequent occurrence of cyber risks and their serious economic consequences have created a growth market for cyber insurance. The calculation of aggregate losses, an essential step in insurance pricing, has attracted considerable attention in recent years. This research develops a path-based k-generation risk contagion model in a tree-shaped network structure that incorporates the impact of the origin contagion location and the heterogeneity of security levels on contagion probability and local loss, distinguishing it from most existing models. Furthermore, we discuss the properties of k-generation risk contagion among multi-paths using the concept of d-separation in Bayesian network (BN), and derive explicit expressions for the mean and variance of local loss on a single path. By combining these results, we compute the mean and variance values for aggregate loss across the entire network until time $t$, which is crucial for accurate cyber insurance pricing. Finally, through numerical calculations and relevant probability properties, we have obtained several findings that are valuable to risk managers and insurers.</description>

      <title>The Gerber-Shiu Expected Discounted Penalty Function: An Application to Poverty Trapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.11715v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we consider a risk process to model the capital of a household. Our work focuses on the analysis of the trapping time of such a process, where trapping occurs when a household's capital level falls into the poverty area. A function analogous to the classical Gerber-Shiu function is introduced, which incorporates information on the trapping time, the capital surplus immediately before trapping and the capital deficit at trapping. We derive, under some assumptions, a model belonging to the family of generalised beta (GB) distributions that describes the distribution of the capital deficit at trapping given that trapping occurs. Affinities between the capital deficit at trapping and a class of poverty measures, known as the Foster-Greer-Thorbecke (FGT) index, are presented. The versatility of this model to estimate FGT indices is assessed using household microdata from Burkina Faso's Enqu\^ete Multisectorielle Continue (EMC) 2014.</description>

      <title>Algorithmic Market Making in Spot Precious Metals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15478v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The primary challenge of market making in spot precious metals is navigating the liquidity that is mainly provided by futures contracts. The Exchange for Physical (EFP) spread, which is the price difference between futures and spot, plays a pivotal role and exhibits multiple modes of relaxation corresponding to the diverse trading horizons of market participants. In this paper, we model the EFP spread using a nested Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, in the spirit of the two-factor Hull-White model for interest rates. We demonstrate the suitability of the framework for maximizing the expected P\&amp;L of a market maker while minimizing inventory risk across both spot and futures. Using a computationally efficient technique to approximate the solution of the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation associated with the corresponding stochastic optimal control problem, our methodology facilitates strategy optimization on demand in near real-time, paving the way for advanced algorithmic market making that capitalizes on the co-integration properties intrinsic to the precious metals sector.</description>
