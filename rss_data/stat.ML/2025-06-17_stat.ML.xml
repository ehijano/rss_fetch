      <title>Temporal cross-validation impacts multivariate time series subsequence anomaly detection evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Evaluating anomaly detection in multivariate time series (MTS) requires careful consideration of temporal dependencies, particularly when detecting subsequence anomalies common in fault detection scenarios. While time series cross-validation (TSCV) techniques aim to preserve temporal ordering during model evaluation, their impact on classifier performance remains underexplored. This study systematically investigates the effect of TSCV strategy on the precision-recall characteristics of classifiers trained to detect fault-like anomalies in MTS datasets. We compare walk-forward (WF) and sliding window (SW) methods across a range of validation partition configurations and classifier types, including shallow learners and deep learning (DL) classifiers. Results show that SW consistently yields higher median AUC-PR scores and reduced fold-to-fold performance variance, particularly for deep architectures sensitive to localized temporal continuity. Furthermore, we find that classifier generalization is sensitive to the number and structure of temporal partitions, with overlapping windows preserving fault signatures more effectively at lower fold counts. A classifier-level stratified analysis reveals that certain algorithms, such as random forests (RF), maintain stable performance across validation schemes, whereas others exhibit marked sensitivity. This study demonstrates that TSCV design in benchmarking anomaly detection models on streaming time series and provide guidance for selecting evaluation strategies in temporally structured learning environments.</description>

      <title>Theoretical Tensions in RLHF: Reconciling Empirical Success with Inconsistencies in Social Choice Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite its empirical success, Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has been shown to violate almost all the fundamental axioms in social choice theory -- such as majority consistency, pairwise majority consistency, and Condorcet consistency. This raises a foundational question: why does RLHF perform so well in practice if it fails these seemingly essential properties? In this paper, we resolve this paradox by showing that under mild and empirically plausible assumptions on the preference profile, RLHF does satisfy pairwise majority and Condorcet consistency. These assumptions are frequently satisfied in real-world alignment tasks, offering a theoretical explanation for RLHF's strong practical performance. Furthermore, we show that a slight modification to the reward modeling objective can ensure pairwise majority or Condorcet consistency even under general preference profiles, thereby improving the alignment process. Finally, we go beyond classical axioms in economic and social choice theory and introduce new alignment criteria -- preference matching, preference equivalence, and group preference matching -- that better reflect the goal of learning distributions over responses. We show that while RLHF satisfies the first two properties, it fails to satisfy the third. We conclude by discussing how future alignment methods may be designed to satisfy all three.</description>

      <title>On the existence of consistent adversarial attacks in high-dimensional linear classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12454v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: What fundamentally distinguishes an adversarial attack from a misclassification due to limited model expressivity or finite data? In this work, we investigate this question in the setting of high-dimensional binary classification, where statistical effects due to limited data availability play a central role. We introduce a new error metric that precisely capture this distinction, quantifying model vulnerability to consistent adversarial attacks -- perturbations that preserve the ground-truth labels. Our main technical contribution is an exact and rigorous asymptotic characterization of these metrics in both well-specified models and latent space models, revealing different vulnerability patterns compared to standard robust error measures. The theoretical results demonstrate that as models become more overparameterized, their vulnerability to label-preserving perturbations grows, offering theoretical insight into the mechanisms underlying model sensitivity to adversarial attacks.</description>

      <title>A Transfer Learning Framework for Multilayer Networks via Model Averaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12455v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Link prediction in multilayer networks is a key challenge in applications such as recommendation systems and protein-protein interaction prediction. While many techniques have been developed, most rely on assumptions about shared structures and require access to raw auxiliary data, limiting their practicality. To address these issues, we propose a novel transfer learning framework for multilayer networks using a bi-level model averaging method. A $K$-fold cross-validation criterion based on edges is used to automatically weight inter-layer and intra-layer candidate models. This enables the transfer of information from auxiliary layers while mitigating model uncertainty, even without prior knowledge of shared structures. Theoretically, we prove the optimality and weight convergence of our method under mild conditions. Computationally, our framework is efficient and privacy-preserving, as it avoids raw data sharing and supports parallel processing across multiple servers. Simulations show our method outperforms others in predictive accuracy and robustness. We further demonstrate its practical value through two real-world recommendation system applications.</description>

      <title>Dependent Randomized Rounding for Budget Constrained Experimental Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12677v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Policymakers in resource-constrained settings require experimental designs that satisfy strict budget limits while ensuring precise estimation of treatment effects. We propose a framework that applies a dependent randomized rounding procedure to convert assignment probabilities into binary treatment decisions. Our proposed solution preserves the marginal treatment probabilities while inducing negative correlations among assignments, leading to improved estimator precision through variance reduction. We establish theoretical guarantees for the inverse propensity weighted and general linear estimators, and demonstrate through empirical studies that our approach yields efficient and accurate inference under fixed budget constraints.</description>

      <title>Single Index Bandits: Generalized Linear Contextual Bandits with Unknown Reward Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12751v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generalized linear bandits have been extensively studied due to their broad applicability in real-world online decision-making problems. However, these methods typically assume that the expected reward function is known to the users, an assumption that is often unrealistic in practice. Misspecification of this link function can lead to the failure of all existing algorithms. In this work, we address this critical limitation by introducing a new problem of generalized linear bandits with unknown reward functions, also known as single index bandits. We first consider the case where the unknown reward function is monotonically increasing, and propose two novel and efficient algorithms, STOR and ESTOR, that achieve decent regrets under standard assumptions. Notably, our ESTOR can obtain the nearly optimal regret bound $\tilde{O}_T(\sqrt{T})$ in terms of the time horizon $T$. We then extend our methods to the high-dimensional sparse setting and show that the same regret rate can be attained with the sparsity index. Next, we introduce GSTOR, an algorithm that is agnostic to general reward functions, and establish regret bounds under a Gaussian design assumption. Finally, we validate the efficiency and effectiveness of our algorithms through experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets.</description>

      <title>General and Estimable Learning Bound Unifying Covariate and Concept Shifts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generalization under distribution shift remains a core challenge in modern machine learning, yet existing learning bound theory is limited to narrow, idealized settings and is non-estimable from samples. In this paper, we bridge the gap between theory and practical applications. We first show that existing bounds become loose and non-estimable because their concept shift definition breaks when the source and target supports mismatch. Leveraging entropic optimal transport, we propose new support-agnostic definitions for covariate and concept shifts, and derive a novel unified error bound that applies to broad loss functions, label spaces, and stochastic labeling. We further develop estimators for these shifts with concentration guarantees, and the DataShifts algorithm, which can quantify distribution shifts and estimate the error bound in most applications -- a rigorous and general tool for analyzing learning error under distribution shift.</description>

      <title>Fair Bayesian Model-Based Clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fair clustering has become a socially significant task with the advancement of machine learning technologies and the growing demand for trustworthy AI. Group fairness ensures that the proportions of each sensitive group are similar in all clusters. Most existing group-fair clustering methods are based on the $K$-means clustering and thus require the distance between instances and the number of clusters to be given in advance. To resolve this limitation, we propose a fair Bayesian model-based clustering called Fair Bayesian Clustering (FBC). We develop a specially designed prior which puts its mass only on fair clusters, and implement an efficient MCMC algorithm. Advantages of FBC are that it can infer the number of clusters and can be applied to any data type as long as the likelihood is defined (e.g., categorical data). Experiments on real-world datasets show that FBC (i) reasonably infers the number of clusters, (ii) achieves a competitive utility-fairness trade-off compared to existing fair clustering methods, and (iii) performs well on categorical data.</description>

      <title>Variational Learning Finds Flatter Solutions at the Edge of Stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12903v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Variational Learning (VL) has recently gained popularity for training deep neural networks and is competitive to standard learning methods. Part of its empirical success can be explained by theories such as PAC-Bayes bounds, minimum description length and marginal likelihood, but there are few tools to unravel the implicit regularization in play. Here, we analyze the implicit regularization of VL through the Edge of Stability (EoS) framework. EoS has previously been used to show that gradient descent can find flat solutions and we extend this result to VL to show that it can find even flatter solutions. This is obtained by controlling the posterior covariance and the number of Monte Carlo samples from the posterior. These results are derived in a similar fashion as the standard EoS literature for deep learning, by first deriving a result for a quadratic problem and then extending it to deep neural networks. We empirically validate these findings on a wide variety of large networks, such as ResNet and ViT, to find that the theoretical results closely match the empirical ones. Ours is the first work to analyze the EoS dynamics in VL.</description>

      <title>Random Matrix Theory for Deep Learning: Beyond Eigenvalues of Linear Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) often operate on high-dimensional data and rely on overparameterized models, where classical low-dimensional intuitions break down. In particular, the proportional regime where the data dimension, sample size, and number of model parameters are all large and comparable, gives rise to novel and sometimes counterintuitive behaviors. This paper extends traditional Random Matrix Theory (RMT) beyond eigenvalue-based analysis of linear models to address the challenges posed by nonlinear ML models such as DNNs in this regime. We introduce the concept of High-dimensional Equivalent, which unifies and generalizes both Deterministic Equivalent and Linear Equivalent, to systematically address three technical challenges: high dimensionality, nonlinearity, and the need to analyze generic eigenspectral functionals. Leveraging this framework, we provide precise characterizations of the training and generalization performance of linear models, nonlinear shallow networks, and deep networks. Our results capture rich phenomena, including scaling laws, double descent, and nonlinear learning dynamics, offering a unified perspective on the theoretical understanding of deep learning in high dimensions.</description>

      <title>Experimental Design for Semiparametric Bandits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13390v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study finite-armed semiparametric bandits, where each arm's reward combines a linear component with an unknown, potentially adversarial shift. This model strictly generalizes classical linear bandits and reflects complexities common in practice. We propose the first experimental-design approach that simultaneously offers a sharp regret bound, a PAC bound, and a best-arm identification guarantee. Our method attains the minimax regret $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{dT})$, matching the known lower bound for finite-armed linear bandits, and further achieves logarithmic regret under a positive suboptimality gap condition. These guarantees follow from our refined non-asymptotic analysis of orthogonalized regression that attains the optimal $\sqrt{d}$ rate, paving the way for robust and efficient learning across a broad class of semiparametric bandit problems.</description>

      <title>Variational Inference with Mixtures of Isotropic Gaussians</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.13613v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Variational inference (VI) is a popular approach in Bayesian inference, that looks for the best approximation of the posterior distribution within a parametric family, minimizing a loss that is typically the (reverse) Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence. In this paper, we focus on the following parametric family: mixtures of isotropic Gaussians (i.e., with diagonal covariance matrices proportional to the identity) and uniform weights. We develop a variational framework and provide efficient algorithms suited for this family. In contrast with mixtures of Gaussian with generic covariance matrices, this choice presents a balance between accurate approximations of multimodal Bayesian posteriors, while being memory and computationally efficient. Our algorithms implement gradient descent on the location of the mixture components (the modes of the Gaussians), and either (an entropic) Mirror or Bures descent on their variance parameters. We illustrate the performance of our algorithms on numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Exploiting the Exact Denoising Posterior Score in Training-Free Guidance of Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The success of diffusion models has driven interest in performing conditional sampling via training-free guidance of the denoising process to solve image restoration and other inverse problems. A popular class of methods, based on Diffusion Posterior Sampling (DPS), attempts to approximate the intractable posterior score function directly. In this work, we present a novel expression for the exact posterior score for purely denoising tasks that is tractable in terms of the unconditional score function. We leverage this result to analyze the time-dependent error in the DPS score for denoising tasks and compute step sizes on the fly to minimize the error at each time step. We demonstrate that these step sizes are transferable to related inverse problems such as colorization, random inpainting, and super resolution. Despite its simplicity, this approach is competitive with state-of-the-art techniques and enables sampling with fewer time steps than DPS.</description>

      <title>Adversarial Disentanglement by Backpropagation with Physics-Informed Variational Autoencoder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inference and prediction under partial knowledge of a physical system is challenging, particularly when multiple confounding sources influence the measured response. Explicitly accounting for these influences in physics-based models is often infeasible due to epistemic uncertainty, cost, or time constraints, resulting in models that fail to accurately describe the behavior of the system. On the other hand, data-driven machine learning models such as variational autoencoders are not guaranteed to identify a parsimonious representation. As a result, they can suffer from poor generalization performance and reconstruction accuracy in the regime of limited and noisy data. We propose a physics-informed variational autoencoder architecture that combines the interpretability of physics-based models with the flexibility of data-driven models. To promote disentanglement of the known physics and confounding influences, the latent space is partitioned into physically meaningful variables that parametrize a physics-based model, and data-driven variables that capture variability in the domain and class of the physical system. The encoder is coupled with a decoder that integrates physics-based and data-driven components, and constrained by an adversarial training objective that prevents the data-driven components from overriding the known physics, ensuring that the physics-grounded latent variables remain interpretable. We demonstrate that the model is able to disentangle features of the input signal and separate the known physics from confounding influences using supervision in the form of class and domain observables. The model is evaluated on a series of synthetic case studies relevant to engineering structures, demonstrating the feasibility of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Understanding Learning Invariance in Deep Linear Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13714v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Equivariant and invariant machine learning models exploit symmetries and structural patterns in data to improve sample efficiency. While empirical studies suggest that data-driven methods such as regularization and data augmentation can perform comparably to explicitly invariant models, theoretical insights remain scarce. In this paper, we provide a theoretical comparison of three approaches for achieving invariance: data augmentation, regularization, and hard-wiring. We focus on mean squared error regression with deep linear networks, which parametrize rank-bounded linear maps and can be hard-wired to be invariant to specific group actions. We show that the critical points of the optimization problems for hard-wiring and data augmentation are identical, consisting solely of saddles and the global optimum. By contrast, regularization introduces additional critical points, though they remain saddles except for the global optimum. Moreover, we demonstrate that the regularization path is continuous and converges to the hard-wired solution.</description>

      <title>Generalizing while preserving monotonicity in comparison-based preference learning models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08616v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: If you tell a learning model that you prefer an alternative $a$ over another alternative $b$, then you probably expect the model to be monotone, that is, the valuation of $a$ increases, and that of $b$ decreases. Yet, perhaps surprisingly, many widely deployed comparison-based preference learning models, including large language models, fail to have this guarantee. Until now, the only comparison-based preference learning algorithms that were proved to be monotone are the Generalized Bradley-Terry models. Yet, these models are unable to generalize to uncompared data. In this paper, we advance the understanding of the set of models with generalization ability that are monotone. Namely, we propose a new class of Linear Generalized Bradley-Terry models with Diffusion Priors, and identify sufficient conditions on alternatives' embeddings that guarantee monotonicity. Our experiments show that this monotonicity is far from being a general guarantee, and that our new class of generalizing models improves accuracy, especially when the dataset is limited.</description>

      <title>On Monotonicity in AI Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08998v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Comparison-based preference learning has become central to the alignment of AI models with human preferences. However, these methods may behave counterintuitively. After empirically observing that, when accounting for a preference for response $y$ over $z$, the model may actually decrease the probability (and reward) of generating $y$ (an observation also made by others), this paper investigates the root causes of (non) monotonicity, for a general comparison-based preference learning framework that subsumes Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), Generalized Preference Optimization (GPO) and Generalized Bradley-Terry (GBT). Under mild assumptions, we prove that such methods still satisfy what we call local pairwise monotonicity. We also provide a bouquet of formalizations of monotonicity, and identify sufficient conditions for their guarantee, thereby providing a toolbox to evaluate how prone learning models are to monotonicity violations. These results clarify the limitations of current methods and provide guidance for developing more trustworthy preference learning algorithms.</description>

      <title>Impact, Causation and Prediction of Socio-Academic and Economic Factors in Exam-centric Student Evaluation Measures using Machine Learning and Causal Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12030v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding socio-academic and economic factors influencing students' performance is crucial for effective educational interventions. This study employs several machine learning techniques and causal analysis to predict and elucidate the impacts of these factors on academic performance. We constructed a hypothetical causal graph and collected data from 1,050 student profiles. Following meticulous data cleaning and visualization, we analyze linear relationships through correlation and variable plots, and perform causal analysis on the hypothetical graph. Regression and classification models are applied for prediction, and unsupervised causality analysis using PC, GES, ICA-LiNGAM, and GRASP algorithms is conducted. Our regression analysis shows that Ridge Regression achieve a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 0.12 and a Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 0.024, indicating robustness, while classification models like Random Forest achieve nearly perfect F1-scores. The causal analysis shows significant direct and indirect effects of factors such as class attendance, study hours, and group study on CGPA. These insights are validated through unsupervised causality analysis. By integrating the best regression model into a web application, we are developing a practical tool for students and educators to enhance academic outcomes based on empirical evidence.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.12039v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the Maximal Overlap Discrete Wavelet Scattering Transform (MODWST), whose construction is inspired by the combination of the Maximal Overlap Discrete Wavelet Transform (MODWT) and the Scattering Wavelet Transform (WST). We also discuss the use of MODWST in classification tasks, evaluating its performance in two applications: stationary signal classification and ECG signal classification. The results demonstrate that MODWST achieved good performance in both applications, positioning itself as a viable alternative to popular methods like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), particularly when the training data set is limited.</description>

      <title>CRITS: Convolutional Rectifier for Interpretable Time Series Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12042v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Several interpretability methods for convolutional network-based classifiers exist. Most of these methods focus on extracting saliency maps for a given sample, providing a local explanation that highlights the main regions for the classification. However, some of these methods lack detailed explanations in the input space due to upscaling issues or may require random perturbations to extract the explanations. We propose Convolutional Rectifier for Interpretable Time Series Classification, or CRITS, as an interpretable model for time series classification that is designed to intrinsically extract local explanations. The proposed method uses a layer of convolutional kernels, a max-pooling layer and a fully-connected rectifier network (a network with only rectified linear unit activations). The rectified linear unit activation allows the extraction of the feature weights for the given sample, eliminating the need to calculate gradients, use random perturbations and the upscale of the saliency maps to the initial input space. We evaluate CRITS on a set of datasets, and study its classification performance and its explanation alignment, sensitivity and understandability.</description>

      <title>UCD: Unlearning in LLMs via Contrastive Decoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12097v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine unlearning aims to remove specific information, e.g. sensitive or undesirable content, from large language models (LLMs) while preserving overall performance. We propose an inference-time unlearning algorithm that uses contrastive decoding, leveraging two auxiliary smaller models, one trained without the forget set and one trained with it, to guide the outputs of the original model using their difference during inference. Our strategy substantially improves the tradeoff between unlearning effectiveness and model utility. We evaluate our approach on two unlearning benchmarks, TOFU and MUSE. Results show notable gains in both forget quality and retained performance in comparison to prior approaches, suggesting that incorporating contrastive decoding can offer an efficient, practical avenue for unlearning concepts in large-scale models.</description>

      <title>Meta-Learning and Synthetic Data for Automated Pretraining and Finetuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12161v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The growing number of pretrained models in Machine Learning (ML) presents significant challenges for practitioners. Given a new dataset, they need to determine the most suitable deep learning (DL) pipeline, consisting of the pretrained model and the hyperparameters for finetuning to it. Moreover, as models grow in scale, the increasing reliance on real-world data poses a bottleneck for training and requires leveraging data more effectively. Addressing the first challenge often involves manual model selection and hyperparameter tuning. At the same time, as models grow larger and more and more of the available human-generated data is being used for training, data augmentation and synthetic data become critical elements. Automated machine learning offers a path to address these challenges but is traditionally designed for tabular data and classical ML methods. This dissertation adopts meta-learning to extend automated machine learning to the deep learning domain. We propose empirical approaches to automate DL pipeline selection for Computer Vision tasks using prior task knowledge to learn surrogate models for pipeline ranking. Extending these methods to the language domain, we learn to finetune large language models. As a result, we show that our approach can outperform finetuning foundation models. Additionally, we meta-learn data augmentation and synthetic data to enhance performance in up-stream and down-stream tasks. We empirically show the underestimated importance of data augmentation when using Self-Supervised Learning and meta-learn advanced data augmentation strategies. Leveraging synthetic data, we also propose to meta-learn neural synthetic data generators as proxies for Reinforcement Learning (RL) environments. Additionally, we learn a multiple-environment world model in an in-context learning fashion by purely using synthetic, randomly sampled data.</description>

      <title>Fidelity Isn't Accuracy: When Linearly Decodable Functions Fail to Match the Ground Truth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12176v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural networks excel as function approximators, but their complexity often obscures the nature of the functions they learn. In this work, we propose the linearity score $\lambda(f)$, a simple and interpretable diagnostic that quantifies how well a regression network's output can be mimicked by a linear model. Defined as the $R^2$ between the network's predictions and those of a trained linear surrogate, $\lambda(f)$ offers insight into the linear decodability of the learned function. We evaluate this framework on both synthetic ($y = x \sin(x) + \epsilon$) and real-world datasets (Medical Insurance, Concrete, California Housing), using dataset-specific networks and surrogates. Our findings show that while high $\lambda(f)$ scores indicate strong linear alignment, they do not necessarily imply predictive accuracy with respect to the ground truth. This underscores both the promise and the limitations of using linear surrogates to understand nonlinear model behavior, particularly in high-stakes regression tasks.</description>

      <title>Graph Semi-Supervised Learning for Point Classification on Data Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12197v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a graph semi-supervised learning framework for classification tasks on data manifolds. Motivated by the manifold hypothesis, we model data as points sampled from a low-dimensional manifold $\mathcal{M} \subset \mathbb{R}^F$. The manifold is approximated in an unsupervised manner using a variational autoencoder (VAE), where the trained encoder maps data to embeddings that represent their coordinates in $\mathbb{R}^F$. A geometric graph is constructed with Gaussian-weighted edges inversely proportional to distances in the embedding space, transforming the point classification problem into a semi-supervised node classification task on the graph. This task is solved using a graph neural network (GNN). Our main contribution is a theoretical analysis of the statistical generalization properties of this data-to-manifold-to-graph pipeline. We show that, under uniform sampling from $\mathcal{M}$, the generalization gap of the semi-supervised task diminishes with increasing graph size, up to the GNN training error. Leveraging a training procedure which resamples a slightly larger graph at regular intervals during training, we then show that the generalization gap can be reduced even further, vanishing asymptotically. Finally, we validate our findings with numerical experiments on image classification benchmarks, demonstrating the empirical effectiveness of our approach.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.12203v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide an algorithm to privately generate continuous-time data (e.g. marginals from stochastic differential equations), which has applications in highly sensitive domains involving time-series data such as healthcare. We leverage the connections between trajectory inference and continuous-time synthetic data generation, along with a computational method based on mean-field Langevin dynamics. As discretized mean-field Langevin dynamics and noisy particle gradient descent are equivalent, DP results for noisy SGD can be applied to our setting. We provide experiments that generate realistic trajectories on a synthesized variation of hand-drawn MNIST data while maintaining meaningful privacy guarantees. Crucially, our method has strong utility guarantees under the setting where each person contributes data for \emph{only one time point}, while prior methods require each person to contribute their \emph{entire temporal trajectory}--directly improving the privacy characteristics by construction.</description>

      <title>Learning Causality for Modern Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12226v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the past decades, machine learning with Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM) has demonstrated great capability in learning and exploiting the statistical patterns from data, or even surpassing humans. Despite the success, ERM avoids the modeling of causality the way of understanding and handling changes, which is fundamental to human intelligence. When deploying models beyond the training environment, distribution shifts are everywhere. For example, an autopilot system often needs to deal with new weather conditions that have not been seen during training, An Al-aided drug discovery system needs to predict the biochemical properties of molecules with respect to new viruses such as COVID-19. It renders the problem of Out-of-Distribution (OOD) generalization challenging to conventional machine learning.
  In this thesis, we investigate how to incorporate and realize the causality for broader tasks in modern machine learning. In particular, we exploit the invariance implied by the principle of independent causal mechanisms (ICM), that is, the causal mechanisms generating the effects from causes do not inform or influence each other. Therefore, the conditional distribution between the target variable given its causes is invariant under distribution shifts. With the causal invariance principle, we first instantiate it to graphs -- a general data structure ubiquitous in many real-world industry and scientific applications, such as financial networks and molecules. Then, we shall see how learning the causality benefits many of the desirable properties of modern machine learning, in terms of (i) OOD generalization capability; (ii) interpretability; and (iii) robustness to adversarial attacks.
  Realizing the causality in machine learning, on the other hand, raises a dilemma for optimization in conventional machine learning, as it often contradicts the objective of ERM...</description>

      <title>Uncovering Bias Paths with LLM-guided Causal Discovery: An Active Learning and Dynamic Scoring Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12227v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Causal discovery (CD) plays a pivotal role in understanding the mechanisms underlying complex systems. While recent algorithms can detect spurious associations and latent confounding, many struggle to recover fairness-relevant pathways in realistic, noisy settings. Large Language Models (LLMs), with their access to broad semantic knowledge, offer a promising complement to statistical CD approaches, particularly in domains where metadata provides meaningful relational cues. Ensuring fairness in machine learning requires understanding how sensitive attributes causally influence outcomes, yet CD methods often introduce spurious or biased pathways. We propose a hybrid LLM-based framework for CD that extends a breadth-first search (BFS) strategy with active learning and dynamic scoring. Variable pairs are prioritized for LLM-based querying using a composite score based on mutual information, partial correlation, and LLM confidence, improving discovery efficiency and robustness.
  To evaluate fairness sensitivity, we construct a semi-synthetic benchmark from the UCI Adult dataset, embedding a domain-informed causal graph with injected noise, label corruption, and latent confounding. We assess how well CD methods recover both global structure and fairness-critical paths.
  Our results show that LLM-guided methods, including the proposed method, demonstrate competitive or superior performance in recovering such pathways under noisy conditions. We highlight when dynamic scoring and active querying are most beneficial and discuss implications for bias auditing in real-world datasets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.12230v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This textbook provides a systematic treatment of statistical machine learning for astronomical research through the lens of Bayesian inference, developing a unified framework that reveals connections between modern data analysis techniques and traditional statistical methods. We show how these techniques emerge from familiar statistical foundations. The consistently Bayesian perspective prioritizes uncertainty quantification and statistical rigor essential for scientific inference in astronomy. The textbook progresses from probability theory and Bayesian inference through supervised learning including linear regression with measurement uncertainties, logistic regression, and classification. Unsupervised learning topics cover Principal Component Analysis and clustering methods. We then introduce computational techniques through sampling and Markov Chain Monte Carlo, followed by Gaussian Processes as probabilistic nonparametric methods and neural networks within the broader statistical context. Our theory-focused pedagogical approach derives each method from first principles with complete mathematical development, emphasizing statistical insight and complementing with astronomical applications. We prioritize understanding why algorithms work, when they are appropriate, and how they connect to broader statistical principles. The treatment builds toward modern techniques including neural networks through a solid foundation in classical methods and their theoretical underpinnings. This foundation enables thoughtful application of these methods to astronomical research, ensuring proper consideration of assumptions, limitations, and uncertainty propagation essential for advancing astronomical knowledge in the era of large astronomical surveys.</description>

      <title>GrokAlign: Geometric Characterisation and Acceleration of Grokking</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.12284v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A key challenge for the machine learning community is to understand and accelerate the training dynamics of deep networks that lead to delayed generalisation and emergent robustness to input perturbations, also known as grokking. Prior work has associated phenomena like delayed generalisation with the transition of a deep network from a linear to a feature learning regime, and emergent robustness with changes to the network's functional geometry, in particular the arrangement of the so-called linear regions in deep networks employing continuous piecewise affine nonlinearities. Here, we explain how grokking is realised in the Jacobian of a deep network and demonstrate that aligning a network's Jacobians with the training data (in the sense of cosine similarity) ensures grokking under a low-rank Jacobian assumption. Our results provide a strong theoretical motivation for the use of Jacobian regularisation in optimizing deep networks -- a method we introduce as GrokAlign -- which we show empirically to induce grokking much sooner than more conventional regularizers like weight decay. Moreover, we introduce centroid alignment as a tractable and interpretable simplification of Jacobian alignment that effectively identifies and tracks the stages of deep network training dynamics.

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models have revolutionized generative AI, but their sheer size makes on device personalization, and thus effective federated learning (FL), infeasible. We propose Shared Backbone Personal Identity Representation Embeddings (SPIRE), a framework that casts per client diffusion based generation as conditional generation in FL. SPIRE factorizes the network into (i) a high capacity global backbone that learns a population level score function and (ii) lightweight, learnable client embeddings that encode local data statistics. This separation enables parameter efficient finetuning that touches $\leq 0.01\%$ of weights. We provide the first theoretical bridge between conditional diffusion training and maximum likelihood estimation in Gaussian mixture models. For a two component mixture we prove that gradient descent on the DDPM with respect to mixing weights loss recovers the optimal mixing weights and enjoys dimension free error bounds. Our analysis also hints at how client embeddings act as biases that steer a shared score network toward personalized distributions. Empirically, SPIRE matches or surpasses strong baselines during collaborative pretraining, and vastly outperforms them when adapting to unseen clients, reducing Kernel Inception Distance while updating only hundreds of parameters. SPIRE further mitigates catastrophic forgetting and remains robust across finetuning learning rate and epoch choices.</description>

      <title>Conditional Average Treatment Effect Estimation Under Hidden Confounders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12304v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the major challenges in estimating conditional potential outcomes and conditional average treatment effects (CATE) is the presence of hidden confounders. Since testing for hidden confounders cannot be accomplished only with observational data, conditional unconfoundedness is commonly assumed in the literature of CATE estimation. Nevertheless, under this assumption, CATE estimation can be significantly biased due to the effects of unobserved confounders. In this work, we consider the case where in addition to a potentially large observational dataset, a small dataset from a randomized controlled trial (RCT) is available. Notably, we make no assumptions on the existence of any covariate information for the RCT dataset, we only require the outcomes to be observed. We propose a CATE estimation method based on a pseudo-confounder generator and a CATE model that aligns the learned potential outcomes from the observational data with those observed from the RCT. Our method is applicable to many practical scenarios of interest, particularly those where privacy is a concern (e.g., medical applications). Extensive numerical experiments are provided demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach for both synthetic and real-world datasets.</description>

      <title>Efficient Network Automatic Relevance Determination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12352v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose Network Automatic Relevance Determination (NARD), an extension of ARD for linearly probabilistic models, to simultaneously model sparse relationships between inputs $X \in \mathbb R^{d \times N}$ and outputs $Y \in \mathbb R^{m \times N}$, while capturing the correlation structure among the $Y$. NARD employs a matrix normal prior which contains a sparsity-inducing parameter to identify and discard irrelevant features, thereby promoting sparsity in the model. Algorithmically, it iteratively updates both the precision matrix and the relationship between $Y$ and the refined inputs. To mitigate the computational inefficiencies of the $\mathcal O(m^3 + d^3)$ cost per iteration, we introduce Sequential NARD, which evaluates features sequentially, and a Surrogate Function Method, leveraging an efficient approximation of the marginal likelihood and simplifying the calculation of determinant and inverse of an intermediate matrix. Combining the Sequential update with the Surrogate Function method further reduces computational costs. The computational complexity per iteration for these three methods is reduced to $\mathcal O(m^3+p^3)$, $\mathcal O(m^3 + d^2)$, $\mathcal O(m^3+p^2)$, respectively, where $p \ll d$ is the final number of features in the model. Our methods demonstrate significant improvements in computational efficiency with comparable performance on both synthetic and real-world datasets.</description>

      <title>Path-specific effects for pulse-oximetry guided decisions in critical care</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12371v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Identifying and measuring biases associated with sensitive attributes is a crucial consideration in healthcare to prevent treatment disparities. One prominent issue is inaccurate pulse oximeter readings, which tend to overestimate oxygen saturation for dark-skinned patients and misrepresent supplemental oxygen needs. Most existing research has revealed statistical disparities linking device errors to patient outcomes in intensive care units (ICUs) without causal formalization. In contrast, this study causally investigates how racial discrepancies in oximetry measurements affect invasive ventilation in ICU settings. We employ a causal inference-based approach using path-specific effects to isolate the impact of bias by race on clinical decision-making. To estimate these effects, we leverage a doubly robust estimator, propose its self-normalized variant for improved sample efficiency, and provide novel finite-sample guarantees. Our methodology is validated on semi-synthetic data and applied to two large real-world health datasets: MIMIC-IV and eICU. Contrary to prior work, our analysis reveals minimal impact of racial discrepancies on invasive ventilation rates. However, path-specific effects mediated by oxygen saturation disparity are more pronounced on ventilation duration, and the severity differs by dataset. Our work provides a novel and practical pipeline for investigating potential disparities in the ICU and, more crucially, highlights the necessity of causal methods to robustly assess fairness in decision-making.</description>

      <title>Scaling Probabilistic Circuits via Monarch Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12383v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Probabilistic Circuits (PCs) are tractable representations of probability distributions allowing for exact and efficient computation of likelihoods and marginals. Recent advancements have improved the scalability of PCs either by leveraging their sparse properties or through the use of tensorized operations for better hardware utilization. However, no existing method fully exploits both aspects simultaneously. In this paper, we propose a novel sparse and structured parameterization for the sum blocks in PCs. By replacing dense matrices with sparse Monarch matrices, we significantly reduce the memory and computation costs, enabling unprecedented scaling of PCs. From a theory perspective, our construction arises naturally from circuit multiplication; from a practical perspective, compared to previous efforts on scaling up tractable probabilistic models, our approach not only achieves state-of-the-art generative modeling performance on challenging benchmarks like Text8, LM1B and ImageNet, but also demonstrates superior scaling behavior, achieving the same performance with substantially less compute as measured by the number of floating-point operations (FLOPs) during training.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Clustering of Neural Bandits: Selective Reinitialization for Mitigating Loss of Plasticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12389v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Clustering of Bandits (CB) methods enhance sequential decision-making by grouping bandits into clusters based on similarity and incorporating cluster-level contextual information, demonstrating effectiveness and adaptability in applications like personalized streaming recommendations. However, when extending CB algorithms to their neural version (commonly referred to as Clustering of Neural Bandits, or CNB), they suffer from loss of plasticity, where neural network parameters become rigid and less adaptable over time, limiting their ability to adapt to non-stationary environments (e.g., dynamic user preferences in recommendation). To address this challenge, we propose Selective Reinitialization (SeRe), a novel bandit learning framework that dynamically preserves the adaptability of CNB algorithms in evolving environments. SeRe leverages a contribution utility metric to identify and selectively reset underutilized units, mitigating loss of plasticity while maintaining stable knowledge retention. Furthermore, when combining SeRe with CNB algorithms, the adaptive change detection mechanism adjusts the reinitialization frequency according to the degree of non-stationarity, ensuring effective adaptation without unnecessary resets. Theoretically, we prove that SeRe enables sublinear cumulative regret in piecewise-stationary environments, outperforming traditional CNB approaches in long-term performances. Extensive experiments on six real-world recommendation datasets demonstrate that SeRe-enhanced CNB algorithms can effectively mitigate the loss of plasticity with lower regrets, improving adaptability and robustness in dynamic settings.</description>

      <title>PROTOCOL: Partial Optimal Transport-enhanced Contrastive Learning for Imbalanced Multi-view Clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12408v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While contrastive multi-view clustering has achieved remarkable success, it implicitly assumes balanced class distribution. However, real-world multi-view data primarily exhibits class imbalance distribution. Consequently, existing methods suffer performance degradation due to their inability to perceive and model such imbalance. To address this challenge, we present the first systematic study of imbalanced multi-view clustering, focusing on two fundamental problems: i. perceiving class imbalance distribution, and ii. mitigating representation degradation of minority samples. We propose PROTOCOL, a novel PaRtial Optimal TranspOrt-enhanced COntrastive Learning framework for imbalanced multi-view clustering. First, for class imbalance perception, we map multi-view features into a consensus space and reformulate the imbalanced clustering as a partial optimal transport (POT) problem, augmented with progressive mass constraints and weighted KL divergence for class distributions. Second, we develop a POT-enhanced class-rebalanced contrastive learning at both feature and class levels, incorporating logit adjustment and class-sensitive learning to enhance minority sample representations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PROTOCOL significantly improves clustering performance on imbalanced multi-view data, filling a critical research gap in this field.</description>

      <title>Cross-Domain Conditional Diffusion Models for Time Series Imputation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12412v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cross-domain time series imputation is an underexplored data-centric research task that presents significant challenges, particularly when the target domain suffers from high missing rates and domain shifts in temporal dynamics. Existing time series imputation approaches primarily focus on the single-domain setting, which cannot effectively adapt to a new domain with domain shifts. Meanwhile, conventional domain adaptation techniques struggle with data incompleteness, as they typically assume the data from both source and target domains are fully observed to enable adaptation. For the problem of cross-domain time series imputation, missing values introduce high uncertainty that hinders distribution alignment, making existing adaptation strategies ineffective. Specifically, our proposed solution tackles this problem from three perspectives: (i) Data: We introduce a frequency-based time series interpolation strategy that integrates shared spectral components from both domains while retaining domain-specific temporal structures, constructing informative priors for imputation. (ii) Model: We design a diffusion-based imputation model that effectively learns domain-shared representations and captures domain-specific temporal dependencies with dedicated denoising networks. (iii) Algorithm: We further propose a cross-domain consistency alignment strategy that selectively regularizes output-level domain discrepancies, enabling effective knowledge transfer while preserving domain-specific characteristics. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of our proposed approach. Our code implementation is available here.</description>

      <title>Interpretable Causal Representation Learning for Biological Data in the Pathway Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12439v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Predicting the impact of genomic and drug perturbations in cellular function is crucial for understanding gene functions and drug effects, ultimately leading to improved therapies. To this end, Causal Representation Learning (CRL) constitutes one of the most promising approaches, as it aims to identify the latent factors that causally govern biological systems, thus facilitating the prediction of the effect of unseen perturbations. Yet, current CRL methods fail in reconciling their principled latent representations with known biological processes, leading to models that are not interpretable. To address this major issue, we present SENA-discrepancy-VAE, a model based on the recently proposed CRL method discrepancy-VAE, that produces representations where each latent factor can be interpreted as the (linear) combination of the activity of a (learned) set of biological processes. To this extent, we present an encoder, SENA-{\delta}, that efficiently compute and map biological processes' activity levels to the latent causal factors. We show that SENA-discrepancy-VAE achieves predictive performances on unseen combinations of interventions that are comparable with its original, non-interpretable counterpart, while inferring causal latent factors that are biologically meaningful.</description>

      <title>Merlin: Multi-View Representation Learning for Robust Multivariate Time Series Forecasting with Unfixed Missing Rates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12459v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multivariate Time Series Forecasting (MTSF) involves predicting future values of multiple interrelated time series. Recently, deep learning-based MTSF models have gained significant attention for their promising ability to mine semantics (global and local information) within MTS data. However, these models are pervasively susceptible to missing values caused by malfunctioning data collectors. These missing values not only disrupt the semantics of MTS, but their distribution also changes over time. Nevertheless, existing models lack robustness to such issues, leading to suboptimal forecasting performance. To this end, in this paper, we propose Multi-View Representation Learning (Merlin), which can help existing models achieve semantic alignment between incomplete observations with different missing rates and complete observations in MTS. Specifically, Merlin consists of two key modules: offline knowledge distillation and multi-view contrastive learning. The former utilizes a teacher model to guide a student model in mining semantics from incomplete observations, similar to those obtainable from complete observations. The latter improves the student model's robustness by learning from positive/negative data pairs constructed from incomplete observations with different missing rates, ensuring semantic alignment across different missing rates. Therefore, Merlin is capable of effectively enhancing the robustness of existing models against unfixed missing rates while preserving forecasting accuracy. Experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of Merlin.</description>

      <title>Delving into Instance-Dependent Label Noise in Graph Data: A Comprehensive Study and Benchmark</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.12468v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance in node classification tasks but struggle with label noise in real-world data. Existing studies on graph learning with label noise commonly rely on class-dependent label noise, overlooking the complexities of instance-dependent noise and falling short of capturing real-world corruption patterns. We introduce BeGIN (Benchmarking for Graphs with Instance-dependent Noise), a new benchmark that provides realistic graph datasets with various noise types and comprehensively evaluates noise-handling strategies across GNN architectures, noisy label detection, and noise-robust learning. To simulate instance-dependent corruptions, BeGIN introduces algorithmic methods and LLM-based simulations. Our experiments reveal the challenges of instance-dependent noise, particularly LLM-based corruption, and underscore the importance of node-specific parameterization to enhance GNN robustness. By comprehensively evaluating noise-handling strategies, BeGIN provides insights into their effectiveness, efficiency, and key performance factors. We expect that BeGIN will serve as a valuable resource for advancing research on label noise in graphs and fostering the development of robust GNN training methods. The code is available at https://github.com/kimsu55/BeGIN.</description>

      <title>Note on Follow-the-Perturbed-Leader in Combinatorial Semi-Bandit Problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.12490v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper studies the optimality and complexity of Follow-the-Perturbed-Leader (FTPL) policy in size-invariant combinatorial semi-bandit problems. Recently, Honda et al. (2023) and Lee et al. (2024) showed that FTPL achieves Best-of-Both-Worlds (BOBW) optimality in standard multi-armed bandit problems with Fr\'{e}chet-type distributions. However, the optimality of FTPL in combinatorial semi-bandit problems remains unclear. In this paper, we consider the regret bound of FTPL with geometric resampling (GR) in size-invariant semi-bandit setting, showing that FTPL respectively achieves $O\left(\sqrt{m^2 d^\frac{1}{\alpha}T}+\sqrt{mdT}\right)$ regret with Fr\'{e}chet distributions, and the best possible regret bound of $O\left(\sqrt{mdT}\right)$ with Pareto distributions in adversarial setting. Furthermore, we extend the conditional geometric resampling (CGR) to size-invariant semi-bandit setting, which reduces the computational complexity from $O(d^2)$ of original GR to $O\left(md\left(\log(d/m)+1\right)\right)$ without sacrificing the regret performance of FTPL.</description>

      <title>Similarity as Reward Alignment: Robust and Versatile Preference-based Reinforcement Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.12529v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Preference-based Reinforcement Learning (PbRL) entails a variety of approaches for aligning models with human intent to alleviate the burden of reward engineering. However, most previous PbRL work has not investigated the robustness to labeler errors, inevitable with labelers who are non-experts or operate under time constraints. Additionally, PbRL algorithms often target very specific settings (e.g. pairwise ranked preferences or purely offline learning). We introduce Similarity as Reward Alignment (SARA), a simple contrastive framework that is both resilient to noisy labels and adaptable to diverse feedback formats and training paradigms. SARA learns a latent representation of preferred samples and computes rewards as similarities to the learned latent. We demonstrate strong performance compared to baselines on continuous control offline RL benchmarks. We further demonstrate SARA's versatility in applications such as trajectory filtering for downstream tasks, cross-task preference transfer, and reward shaping in online learning.</description>

      <title>PLD: A Choice-Theoretic List-Wise Knowledge Distillation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.12542v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Knowledge distillation is a model compression technique in which a compact "student" network is trained to replicate the predictive behavior of a larger "teacher" network. In logit-based knowledge distillation it has become the de facto approach to augment cross-entropy with a distillation term. Typically this term is either a KL divergence-matching marginal probabilities or a correlation-based loss capturing intra- and inter-class relationships but in every case it sits as an add-on to cross-entropy with its own weight that must be carefully tuned. In this paper we adopt a choice-theoretic perspective and recast knowledge distillation under the Plackett-Luce model by interpreting teacher logits as "worth" scores. We introduce Plackett-Luce Distillation (PLD), a weighted list-wise ranking loss in which the teacher model transfers knowledge of its full ranking of classes, weighting each ranked choice by its own confidence. PLD directly optimizes a single teacher-optimal ranking of the true label first, followed by the remaining classes in descending teacher confidence, yielding a convex, translation-invariant surrogate that subsumes weighted cross-entropy. Empirically on standard image classification benchmarks, PLD improves Top-1 accuracy by an average of +0.42% over DIST (arXiv:2205.10536) and +1.04% over KD (arXiv:1503.02531) in homogeneous settings and by +0.48% and +1.09% over DIST and KD, respectively, in heterogeneous settings.</description>

      <title>Beyond Laplace and Gaussian: Exploring the Generalized Gaussian Mechanism for Private Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12553v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Differential privacy (DP) is obtained by randomizing a data analysis algorithm, which necessarily introduces a tradeoff between its utility and privacy. Many DP mechanisms are built upon one of two underlying tools: Laplace and Gaussian additive noise mechanisms. We expand the search space of algorithms by investigating the Generalized Gaussian mechanism, which samples the additive noise term $x$ with probability proportional to $e^{-\frac{| x |}{\sigma}^{\beta} }$ for some $\beta \geq 1$. The Laplace and Gaussian mechanisms are special cases of GG for $\beta=1$ and $\beta=2$, respectively.
  In this work, we prove that all members of the GG family satisfy differential privacy, and provide an extension of an existing numerical accountant (the PRV accountant) for these mechanisms. We show that privacy accounting for the GG Mechanism and its variants is dimension independent, which substantially improves computational costs of privacy accounting.
  We apply the GG mechanism to two canonical tools for private machine learning, PATE and DP-SGD; we show empirically that $\beta$ has a weak relationship with test-accuracy, and that generally $\beta=2$ (Gaussian) is nearly optimal. This provides justification for the widespread adoption of the Gaussian mechanism in DP learning, and can be interpreted as a negative result, that optimizing over $\beta$ does not lead to meaningful improvements in performance.</description>

      <title>Language Models Enable Data-Augmented Synthesis Planning for Inorganic Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12557v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inorganic synthesis planning currently relies primarily on heuristic approaches or machine-learning models trained on limited datasets, which constrains its generality. We demonstrate that language models, without task-specific fine-tuning, can recall synthesis conditions. Off-the-shelf models, such as GPT-4.1, Gemini 2.0 Flash and Llama 4 Maverick, achieve a Top-1 precursor-prediction accuracy of up to 53.8 % and a Top-5 performance of 66.1 % on a held-out set of 1,000 reactions. They also predict calcination and sintering temperatures with mean absolute errors below 126 {\deg}C, matching specialized regression methods. Ensembling these language models further enhances predictive accuracy and reduces inference cost per prediction by up to 70 %. We subsequently employ language models to generate 28,548 synthetic reaction recipes, which we combine with literature-mined examples to pretrain a transformer-based model, SyntMTE. After fine-tuning on the combined dataset, SyntMTE reduces mean-absolute error in sintering temperature prediction to 73 {\deg}C and in calcination temperature to 98 {\deg}C. This strategy improves models by up to 8.7 % compared with baselines trained exclusively on experimental data. Finally, in a case study on Li7La3Zr2O12 solid-state electrolytes, we demonstrate that SyntMTE reproduces the experimentally observed dopant-dependent sintering trends. Our hybrid workflow enables scalable, data-efficient inorganic synthesis planning.</description>

      <title>RAW-Explainer: Post-hoc Explanations of Graph Neural Networks on Knowledge Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12558v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph neural networks have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance on knowledge graph tasks such as link prediction. However, interpreting GNN predictions remains a challenging open problem. While many GNN explainability methods have been proposed for node or graph-level tasks, approaches for generating explanations for link predictions in heterogeneous settings are limited. In this paper, we propose RAW-Explainer, a novel framework designed to generate connected, concise, and thus interpretable subgraph explanations for link prediction. Our method leverages the heterogeneous information in knowledge graphs to identify connected subgraphs that serve as patterns of factual explanation via a random walk objective. Unlike existing methods tailored to knowledge graphs, our approach employs a neural network to parameterize the explanation generation process, which significantly speeds up the production of collective explanations. Furthermore, RAW-Explainer is designed to overcome the distribution shift issue when evaluating the quality of an explanatory subgraph which is orders of magnitude smaller than the full graph, by proposing a robust evaluator that generalizes to the subgraph distribution. Extensive quantitative results on real-world knowledge graph datasets demonstrate that our approach strikes a balance between explanation quality and computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>Beyond Sin-Squared Error: Linear-Time Entrywise Uncertainty Quantification for Streaming PCA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12655v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel statistical inference framework for streaming principal component analysis (PCA) using Oja's algorithm, enabling the construction of confidence intervals for individual entries of the estimated eigenvector. Most existing works on streaming PCA focus on providing sharp sin-squared error guarantees. Recently, there has been some interest in uncertainty quantification for the sin-squared error. However, uncertainty quantification or sharp error guarantees for entries of the estimated eigenvector in the streaming setting remains largely unexplored. We derive a sharp Bernstein-type concentration bound for elements of the estimated vector matching the optimal error rate up to logarithmic factors. We also establish a Central Limit Theorem for a suitably centered and scaled subset of the entries. To efficiently estimate the coordinate-wise variance, we introduce a provably consistent subsampling algorithm that leverages the median-of-means approach, empirically achieving similar accuracy to multiplier bootstrap methods while being significantly more computationally efficient. Numerical experiments demonstrate its effectiveness in providing reliable uncertainty estimates with a fraction of the computational cost of existing methods.</description>

      <title>Effect Decomposition of Functional-Output Computer Experiments via Orthogonal Additive Gaussian Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12701v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Functional ANOVA (FANOVA) is a widely used variance-based sensitivity analysis tool. However, studies on functional-output FANOVA remain relatively scarce, especially for black-box computer experiments, which often involve complex and nonlinear functional-output relationships with unknown data distribution. Conventional approaches often rely on predefined basis functions or parametric structures that lack the flexibility to capture complex nonlinear relationships. Additionally, strong assumptions about the underlying data distributions further limit their ability to achieve a data-driven orthogonal effect decomposition. To address these challenges, this study proposes a functional-output orthogonal additive Gaussian process (FOAGP) to efficiently perform the data-driven orthogonal effect decomposition. By enforcing a conditional orthogonality constraint on the separable prior process, the proposed functional-output orthogonal additive kernel enables data-driven orthogonality without requiring prior distributional assumptions. The FOAGP framework also provides analytical formulations for local Sobol' indices and expected conditional variance sensitivity indices, enabling comprehensive sensitivity analysis by capturing both global and local effect significance. Validation through two simulation studies and a real case study on fuselage shape control confirms the model's effectiveness in orthogonal effect decomposition and variance decomposition, demonstrating its practical value in engineering applications.</description>

      <title>Strategic Scaling of Test-Time Compute: A Bandit Learning Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12721v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scaling test-time compute has emerged as an effective strategy for improving the performance of large language models. However, existing methods typically allocate compute uniformly across all queries, overlooking variation in query difficulty. To address this inefficiency, we formulate test-time compute allocation as a novel bandit learning problem and propose adaptive algorithms that estimate query difficulty on the fly and allocate compute accordingly. Compared to uniform allocation, our algorithms allocate more compute to challenging queries while maintaining accuracy on easier ones. Among challenging queries, our algorithms further learn to prioritize solvable instances, effectively reducing excessive computing on unsolvable queries. We theoretically prove that our algorithms achieve better compute efficiency than uniform allocation and empirically validate their effectiveness on math and code benchmarks. Specifically, our algorithms achieve up to an 11.10% performance improvement (15.04% relative) on the MATH-500 dataset and up to a 7.41% performance improvement (14.40% relative) on LiveCodeBench.</description>

      <title>On the attainment of the Wasserstein--Cramer--Rao lower bound</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.12732v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, a Wasserstein analogue of the Cramer--Rao inequality has been developed using the Wasserstein information matrix (Otto metric). This inequality provides a lower bound on the Wasserstein variance of an estimator, which quantifies its robustness against additive noise. In this study, we investigate conditions for an estimator to attain the Wasserstein--Cramer--Rao lower bound (asymptotically), which we call the (asymptotic) Wasserstein efficiency. We show a condition under which Wasserstein efficient estimators exist for one-parameter statistical models. This condition corresponds to a recently proposed Wasserstein analogue of one-parameter exponential families (e-geodesics). We also show that the Wasserstein estimator, a Wasserstein analogue of the maximum likelihood estimator based on the Wasserstein score function, is asymptotically Wasserstein efficient in location-scale families.</description>

      <title>A Review of the Long Horizon Forecasting Problem in Time Series Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12809v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The long horizon forecasting (LHF) problem has come up in the time series literature for over the last 35 years or so. This review covers aspects of LHF in this period and how deep learning has incorporated variants of trend, seasonality, fourier and wavelet transforms, misspecification bias reduction and bandpass filters while contributing using convolutions, residual connections, sparsity reduction, strided convolutions, attention masks, SSMs, normalization methods, low-rank approximations and gating mechanisms. We highlight time series decomposition techniques, input data preprocessing and dataset windowing schemes that improve performance. Multi-layer perceptron models, recurrent neural network hybrids, self-attention models that improve and/or address the performances of the LHF problem are described, with an emphasis on the feature space construction. Ablation studies are conducted over the ETTm2 dataset in the multivariate and univariate high useful load (HUFL) forecasting contexts, evaluated over the last 4 months of the dataset. The heatmaps of MSE averages per time step over test set series in the horizon show that there is a steady increase in the error proportionate to its length except with xLSTM and Triformer models and motivate LHF as an error propagation problem. The trained models are available here: https://bit.ly/LHFModelZoo</description>

      <title>Uncovering Social Network Activity Using Joint User and Topic Interaction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.12842v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The emergence of online social platforms, such as social networks and social media, has drastically affected the way people apprehend the information flows to which they are exposed. In such platforms, various information cascades spreading among users is the main force creating complex dynamics of opinion formation, each user being characterized by their own behavior adoption mechanism. Moreover, the spread of multiple pieces of information or beliefs in a networked population is rarely uncorrelated. In this paper, we introduce the Mixture of Interacting Cascades (MIC), a model of marked multidimensional Hawkes processes with the capacity to model jointly non-trivial interaction between cascades and users. We emphasize on the interplay between information cascades and user activity, and use a mixture of temporal point processes to build a coupled user/cascade point process model. Experiments on synthetic and real data highlight the benefits of this approach and demonstrate that MIC achieves superior performance to existing methods in modeling the spread of information cascades. Finally, we demonstrate how MIC can provide, through its learned parameters, insightful bi-layered visualizations of real social network activity data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.12912v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyzes the logit dynamics of softmax policy gradient methods. We derive the exact formula for the L2 norm of the logit update vector: $$ \|\Delta \mathbf{z}\|_2 \propto \sqrt{1-2P_c + C(P)} $$ This equation demonstrates that update magnitudes are determined by the chosen action's probability ($P_c$) and the policy's collision probability ($C(P)$), a measure of concentration inversely related to entropy. Our analysis reveals an inherent self-regulation mechanism where learning vigor is automatically modulated by policy confidence, providing a foundational insight into the stability and convergence of these methods.</description>

      <title>Distributional Training Data Attribution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.12965v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Randomness is an unavoidable part of training deep learning models, yet something that traditional training data attribution algorithms fail to rigorously account for. They ignore the fact that, due to stochasticity in the initialisation and batching, training on the same dataset can yield different models. In this paper, we address this shortcoming through introducing distributional training data attribution (d-TDA), the goal of which is to predict how the distribution of model outputs (over training runs) depends upon the dataset. We demonstrate the practical significance of d-TDA in experiments, e.g. by identifying training examples that drastically change the distribution of some target measurement without necessarily changing the mean. Intriguingly, we also find that influence functions (IFs), a popular but poorly-understood data attribution tool, emerge naturally from our distributional framework as the limit to unrolled differentiation; without requiring restrictive convexity assumptions. This provides a new mathematical motivation for their efficacy in deep learning, and helps to characterise their limitations.</description>

      <title>CoIFNet: A Unified Framework for Multivariate Time Series Forecasting with Missing Values</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13064v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multivariate time series forecasting (MTSF) is a critical task with broad applications in domains such as meteorology, transportation, and economics. Nevertheless, pervasive missing values caused by sensor failures or human errors significantly degrade forecasting accuracy. Prior efforts usually employ an impute-then-forecast paradigm, leading to suboptimal predictions due to error accumulation and misaligned objectives between the two stages. To address this challenge, we propose the Collaborative Imputation-Forecasting Network (CoIFNet), a novel framework that unifies imputation and forecasting to achieve robust MTSF in the presence of missing values. Specifically, CoIFNet takes the observed values, mask matrix and timestamp embeddings as input, processing them sequentially through the Cross-Timestep Fusion (CTF) and Cross-Variate Fusion (CVF) modules to capture temporal dependencies that are robust to missing values. We provide theoretical justifications on how our CoIFNet learning objective improves the performance bound of MTSF with missing values. Through extensive experiments on challenging MSTF benchmarks, we demonstrate the effectiveness and computational efficiency of our proposed approach across diverse missing-data scenarios, e.g., CoIFNet outperforms the state-of-the-art method by $\underline{\textbf{24.40}}$% ($\underline{\textbf{23.81}}$%) at a point (block) missing rate of 0.6, while improving memory and time efficiency by $\underline{\boldsymbol{4.3\times}}$ and $\underline{\boldsymbol{2.1\times}}$, respectively.</description>

      <title>Honesty in Causal Forests: When It Helps and When It Hurts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13107v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Causal forests are increasingly used to personalize decisions based on estimated treatment effects. A distinctive modeling choice in this method is honest estimation: using separate data for splitting and for estimating effects within leaves. This practice is the default in most implementations and is widely seen as desirable for causal inference. But we show that honesty can hurt the accuracy of individual-level effect estimates. The reason is a classic bias-variance trade-off: honesty reduces variance by preventing overfitting, but increases bias by limiting the model's ability to discover and exploit meaningful heterogeneity in treatment effects. This trade-off depends on the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR): honesty helps when effect heterogeneity is hard to detect (low SNR), but hurts when the signal is strong (high SNR). In essence, honesty acts as a form of regularization, and like any regularization choice, it should be guided by out-of-sample performance, not adopted by default.</description>

Abstract: Data scarcity in African agriculture hampers machine learning (ML) model performance, limiting innovations in precision agriculture. The Synthetic Agriculture Data for Africa (SAGDA) library, a Python-based open-source toolkit, addresses this gap by generating, augmenting, and validating synthetic agricultural datasets. We present SAGDA's design and development practices, highlighting its core functions: generate, model, augment, validate, visualize, optimize, and simulate, as well as their roles in applications of ML for agriculture. Two use cases are detailed: yield prediction enhanced via data augmentation, and multi-objective NPK (nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium) fertilizer recommendation. We conclude with future plans for expanding SAGDA's capabilities, underscoring the vital role of open-source, data-driven practices for African agriculture.</description>

      <title>Federated ADMM from Bayesian Duality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13150v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: ADMM is a popular method for federated deep learning which originated in the 1970s and, even though many new variants of it have been proposed since then, its core algorithmic structure has remained unchanged. Here, we take a major departure from the old structure and present a fundamentally new way to derive and extend federated ADMM. We propose to use a structure called Bayesian Duality which exploits a duality of the posterior distributions obtained by solving a variational-Bayesian reformulation of the original problem. We show that this naturally recovers the original ADMM when isotropic Gaussian posteriors are used, and yields non-trivial extensions for other posterior forms. For instance, full-covariance Gaussians lead to Newton-like variants of ADMM, while diagonal covariances result in a cheap Adam-like variant. This is especially useful to handle heterogeneity in federated deep learning, giving up to 7% accuracy improvements over recent baselines. Our work opens a new Bayesian path to improve primal-dual methods.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Active Learning of (small) Quantile Sets through Expected Estimator Modification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13211v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a multivariate function taking deterministic and uncertain inputs, we consider the problem of estimating a quantile set: a set of deterministic inputs for which the probability that the output belongs to a specific region remains below a given threshold. To solve this problem in the context of expensive-to-evaluate black-box functions, we propose a Bayesian active learning strategy based on Gaussian process modeling. The strategy is driven by a novel sampling criterion, which belongs to a broader principle that we refer to as Expected Estimator Modification (EEM). More specifically, the strategy relies on a novel sampling criterion combined with a sequential Monte Carlo framework that enables the construction of batch-sequential designs for the efficient estimation of small quantile sets. The performance of the strategy is illustrated on several synthetic examples and an industrial application case involving the ROTOR37 compressor model.</description>

      <title>No-Regret Learning Under Adversarial Resource Constraints: A Spending Plan Is All You Need!</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13244v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study online decision making problems under resource constraints, where both reward and cost functions are drawn from distributions that may change adversarially over time. We focus on two canonical settings: $(i)$ online resource allocation where rewards and costs are observed before action selection, and $(ii)$ online learning with resource constraints where they are observed after action selection, under full feedback or bandit feedback. It is well known that achieving sublinear regret in these settings is impossible when reward and cost distributions may change arbitrarily over time. To address this challenge, we analyze a framework in which the learner is guided by a spending plan--a sequence prescribing expected resource usage across rounds. We design general (primal-)dual methods that achieve sublinear regret with respect to baselines that follow the spending plan. Crucially, the performance of our algorithms improves when the spending plan ensures a well-balanced distribution of the budget across rounds. We additionally provide a robust variant of our methods to handle worst-case scenarios where the spending plan is highly imbalanced. To conclude, we study the regret of our algorithms when competing against benchmarks that deviate from the prescribed spending plan.</description>

      <title>Vine Copulas as Differentiable Computational Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13318v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vine copulas are sophisticated models for multivariate distributions and are increasingly used in machine learning. To facilitate their integration into modern ML pipelines, we introduce the vine computational graph, a DAG that abstracts the multilevel vine structure and associated computations. On this foundation, we devise new algorithms for conditional sampling, efficient sampling-order scheduling, and constructing vine structures for customized conditioning variables. We implement these ideas in torchvinecopulib, a GPU-accelerated Python library built upon PyTorch, delivering improved scalability for fitting, sampling, and density evaluation. Our experiments illustrate how gradient flowing through the vine can improve Vine Copula Autoencoders and that incorporating vines for uncertainty quantification in deep learning can outperform MC-dropout, deep ensembles, and Bayesian Neural Networks in sharpness, calibration, and runtime. By recasting vine copula models as computational graphs, our work connects classical dependence modeling with modern deep-learning toolchains and facilitates the integration of state-of-the-art copula methods in modern machine learning pipelines.</description>

      <title>Calibrated Predictive Lower Bounds on Time-to-Unsafe-Sampling in LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13593v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a framework to quantify the time-to-unsafe-sampling - the number of large language model (LLM) generations required to trigger an unsafe (e.g., toxic) response. Estimating this quantity is challenging, since unsafe responses are exceedingly rare in well-aligned LLMs, potentially occurring only once in thousands of generations. As a result, directly estimating time-to-unsafe-sampling would require collecting training data with a prohibitively large number of generations per prompt. However, with realistic sampling budgets, we often cannot generate enough responses to observe an unsafe outcome for every prompt, leaving the time-to-unsafe-sampling unobserved in many cases, making the estimation and evaluation tasks particularly challenging. To address this, we frame this estimation problem as one of survival analysis and develop a provably calibrated lower predictive bound (LPB) on the time-to-unsafe-sampling of a given prompt, leveraging recent advances in conformal prediction. Our key innovation is designing an adaptive, per-prompt sampling strategy, formulated as a convex optimization problem. The objective function guiding this optimized sampling allocation is designed to reduce the variance of the estimators used to construct the LPB, leading to improved statistical efficiency over naive methods that use a fixed sampling budget per prompt. Experiments on both synthetic and real data support our theoretical results and demonstrate the practical utility of our method for safety risk assessment in generative AI models.</description>

      <title>Computational lower bounds in latent models: clustering, sparse-clustering, biclustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13647v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In many high-dimensional problems, like sparse-PCA, planted clique, or clustering, the best known algorithms with polynomial time complexity fail to reach the statistical performance provably achievable by algorithms free of computational constraints. This observation has given rise to the conjecture of the existence, for some problems, of gaps -- so called statistical-computational gaps -- between the best possible statistical performance achievable without computational constraints, and the best performance achievable with poly-time algorithms. A powerful approach to assess the best performance achievable in poly-time is to investigate the best performance achievable by polynomials with low-degree. We build on the seminal paper of Schramm and Wein (2022) and propose a new scheme to derive lower bounds on the performance of low-degree polynomials in some latent space models. By better leveraging the latent structures, we obtain new and sharper results, with simplified proofs. We then instantiate our scheme to provide computational lower bounds for the problems of clustering, sparse clustering, and biclustering. We also prove matching upper-bounds and some additional statistical results, in order to provide a comprehensive description of the statistical-computational gaps occurring in these three problems.</description>

      <title>PeakWeather: MeteoSwiss Weather Station Measurements for Spatiotemporal Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13652v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate weather forecasts are essential for supporting a wide range of activities and decision-making processes, as well as mitigating the impacts of adverse weather events. While traditional numerical weather prediction (NWP) remains the cornerstone of operational forecasting, machine learning is emerging as a powerful alternative for fast, flexible, and scalable predictions. We introduce PeakWeather, a high-quality dataset of surface weather observations collected every 10 minutes over more than 8 years from the ground stations of the Federal Office of Meteorology and Climatology MeteoSwiss's measurement network. The dataset includes a diverse set of meteorological variables from 302 station locations distributed across Switzerland's complex topography and is complemented with topographical indices derived from digital height models for context. Ensemble forecasts from the currently operational high-resolution NWP model are provided as a baseline forecast against which to evaluate new approaches. The dataset's richness supports a broad spectrum of spatiotemporal tasks, including time series forecasting at various scales, graph structure learning, imputation, and virtual sensing. As such, PeakWeather serves as a real-world benchmark to advance both foundational machine learning research, meteorology, and sensor-based applications.</description>

      <title>Gradient Boosting for Spatial Regression Models with Autoregressive Disturbances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13682v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Researchers in urban and regional studies increasingly deal with spatial data that reflects geographic location and spatial relationships. As a framework for dealing with the unique nature of spatial data, various spatial regression models have been introduced. In this article, a novel model-based gradient boosting algorithm for spatial regression models with autoregressive disturbances is proposed. Due to the modular nature, the approach provides an alternative estimation procedure which is feasible even in high-dimensional settings where established quasi-maximum likelihood or generalized method of moments estimators do not yield unique solutions. The approach additionally enables data-driven variable and model selection in low- as well as high-dimensional settings. Since the bias-variance trade-off is also controlled in the algorithm, implicit regularization is imposed which improves prediction accuracy on out-of-sample spatial data. Detailed simulation studies regarding the performance of estimation, prediction and variable selection in low- and high-dimensional settings confirm proper functionality of the proposed methodology. To illustrative the functionality of the model-based gradient boosting algorithm, a case study is presented where the life expectancy in German districts is modeled incorporating a potential spatial dependence structure.</description>

      <title>Enforcing tail calibration when training probabilistic forecast models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13687v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Probabilistic forecasts are typically obtained using state-of-the-art statistical and machine learning models, with model parameters estimated by optimizing a proper scoring rule over a set of training data. If the model class is not correctly specified, then the learned model will not necessarily issue forecasts that are calibrated. Calibrated forecasts allow users to appropriately balance risks in decision making, and it is particularly important that forecast models issue calibrated predictions for extreme events, since such outcomes often generate large socio-economic impacts. In this work, we study how the loss function used to train probabilistic forecast models can be adapted to improve the reliability of forecasts made for extreme events. We investigate loss functions based on weighted scoring rules, and additionally propose regularizing loss functions using a measure of tail miscalibration. We apply these approaches to a hierarchy of increasingly flexible forecast models for UK wind speeds, including simple parametric models, distributional regression networks, and conditional generative models. We demonstrate that state-of-the-art models do not issue calibrated forecasts for extreme wind speeds, and that the calibration of forecasts for extreme events can be improved by suitable adaptations to the loss function during model training. This, however, introduces a trade-off between calibrated forecasts for extreme events and calibrated forecasts for more common outcomes.</description>

      <title>What Happens During the Loss Plateau? Understanding Abrupt Learning in Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13688v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Training Transformers on algorithmic tasks frequently demonstrates an intriguing abrupt learning phenomenon: an extended performance plateau followed by a sudden, sharp improvement. This work investigates the underlying mechanisms for such dynamics, primarily in shallow Transformers. We reveal that during the plateau, the model often develops an interpretable partial solution while simultaneously exhibiting a strong repetition bias in their outputs. This output degeneracy is accompanied by internal representation collapse, where hidden states across different tokens become nearly parallel. We further identify the slow learning of optimal attention maps as a key bottleneck. Hidden progress in attention configuration during the plateau precedes the eventual rapid convergence, and directly intervening on attention significantly alters plateau duration and the severity of repetition bias and representational collapse. We validate that these identified phenomena-repetition bias and representation collapse-are not artifacts of toy setups but also manifest in the early pre-training stage of large language models like Pythia and OLMo.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.13712v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a frequency-domain framework for convergence analysis of hyperparameters in game optimization, leveraging High-Resolution Differential Equations (HRDEs) and Laplace transforms. Focusing on the Lookahead algorithm--characterized by gradient steps $k$ and averaging coefficient $\alpha$--we transform the discrete-time oscillatory dynamics of bilinear games into the frequency domain to derive precise convergence criteria. Our higher-precision $O(\gamma^2)$-HRDE models yield tighter criteria, while our first-order $O(\gamma)$-HRDE models offer practical guidance by prioritizing actionable hyperparameter tuning over complex closed-form solutions. Empirical validation in discrete-time settings demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach, which may further extend to locally linear operators, offering a scalable framework for selecting hyperparameters for learning in games.</description>

      <title>Contrastive Self-Supervised Learning As Neural Manifold Packing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13717v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Contrastive self-supervised learning based on point-wise comparisons has been widely studied for vision tasks. In the visual cortex of the brain, neuronal responses to distinct stimulus classes are organized into geometric structures known as neural manifolds. Accurate classification of stimuli can be achieved by effectively separating these manifolds, akin to solving a packing problem. We introduce Contrastive Learning As Manifold Packing (CLAMP), a self-supervised framework that recasts representation learning as a manifold packing problem. CLAMP introduces a loss function inspired by the potential energy of short-range repulsive particle systems, such as those encountered in the physics of simple liquids and jammed packings. In this framework, each class consists of sub-manifolds embedding multiple augmented views of a single image. The sizes and positions of the sub-manifolds are dynamically optimized by following the gradient of a packing loss. This approach yields interpretable dynamics in the embedding space that parallel jamming physics, and introduces geometrically meaningful hyperparameters within the loss function. Under the standard linear evaluation protocol, which freezes the backbone and trains only a linear classifier, CLAMP achieves competitive performance with state-of-the-art self-supervised models. Furthermore, our analysis reveals that neural manifolds corresponding to different categories emerge naturally and are effectively separated in the learned representation space, highlighting the potential of CLAMP to bridge insights from physics, neural science, and machine learning.</description>

      <title>Diagnosing and Improving Diffusion Models by Estimating the Optimal Loss Value</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.13763v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in generative modeling. Despite more stable training, the loss of diffusion models is not indicative of absolute data-fitting quality, since its optimal value is typically not zero but unknown, leading to confusion between large optimal loss and insufficient model capacity. In this work, we advocate the need to estimate the optimal loss value for diagnosing and improving diffusion models. We first derive the optimal loss in closed form under a unified formulation of diffusion models, and develop effective estimators for it, including a stochastic variant scalable to large datasets with proper control of variance and bias. With this tool, we unlock the inherent metric for diagnosing the training quality of mainstream diffusion model variants, and develop a more performant training schedule based on the optimal loss. Moreover, using models with 120M to 1.5B parameters, we find that the power law is better demonstrated after subtracting the optimal loss from the actual training loss, suggesting a more principled setting for investigating the scaling law for diffusion models.</description>

      <title>How Sparse Can We Prune A Deep Network: A Fundamental Limit Viewpoint</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.05857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.05857v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Network pruning is a commonly used measure to alleviate the storage and computational burden of deep neural networks. However, the fundamental limit of network pruning is still lacking. To close the gap, in this work we'll take a first-principles approach, i.e. we'll directly impose the sparsity constraint on the loss function and leverage the framework of statistical dimension in convex geometry, thus enabling us to characterize the sharp phase transition point, which can be regarded as the fundamental limit of the pruning ratio. Through this limit, we're able to identify two key factors that determine the pruning ratio limit, namely, weight magnitude and network sharpness. Generally speaking, the flatter the loss landscape or the smaller the weight magnitude, the smaller pruning ratio. Moreover, we provide efficient countermeasures to address the challenges in the computation of the pruning limit, which mainly involves the accurate spectrum estimation of a large-scale and non-positive Hessian matrix. Moreover, through the lens of the pruning ratio threshold, we can also provide rigorous interpretations on several heuristics in existing pruning algorithms. Extensive experiments are performed which demonstrate that our theoretical pruning ratio threshold coincides very well with the experiments.

      <title>Efficient Numerical Integration in Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces via Leverage Scores Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.13548v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we consider the problem of numerical integration, i.e., approximating integrals with respect to a target probability measure using only pointwise evaluations of the integrand. We focus on the setting in which the target distribution is only accessible through a set of $n$ i.i.d. observations, and the integrand belongs to a reproducing kernel Hilbert space. We propose an efficient procedure which exploits a small i.i.d. random subset of $m&lt;n$ samples drawn either uniformly or using approximate leverage scores from the initial observations. Our main result is an upper bound on the approximation error of this procedure for both sampling strategies. It yields sufficient conditions on the subsample size to recover the standard (optimal) $n^{-1/2}$ rate while reducing drastically the number of functions evaluations, and thus the overall computational cost. Moreover, we obtain rates with respect to the number $m$ of evaluations of the integrand which adapt to its smoothness, and match known optimal rates for instance for Sobolev spaces. We illustrate our theoretical findings with numerical experiments on real datasets, which highlight the attractive efficiency-accuracy tradeoff of our method compared to existing randomized and greedy quadrature methods. We note that, the problem of numerical integration in RKHS amounts to designing a discrete approximation of the kernel mean embedding of the target distribution. As a consequence, direct applications of our results also include the efficient computation of maximum mean discrepancies between distributions and the design of efficient kernel-based tests.</description>

      <title>Feature learning in finite-width Bayesian deep linear networks with multiple outputs and convolutional layers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.03260v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deep linear networks have been extensively studied, as they provide simplified models of deep learning. However, little is known in the case of finite-width architectures with multiple outputs and convolutional layers. In this manuscript, we provide rigorous results for the statistics of functions implemented by the aforementioned class of networks, thus moving closer to a complete characterization of feature learning in the Bayesian setting. Our results include: (i) an exact and elementary non-asymptotic integral representation for the joint prior distribution over the outputs, given in terms of a mixture of Gaussians; (ii) an analytical formula for the posterior distribution in the case of squared error loss function (Gaussian likelihood); (iii) a quantitative description of the feature learning infinite-width regime, using large deviation theory. From a physical perspective, deep architectures with multiple outputs or convolutional layers represent different manifestations of kernel shape renormalization, and our work provides a dictionary that translates this physics intuition and terminology into rigorous Bayesian statistics.</description>

      <title>Forecasting Automotive Supply Chain Shortfalls with Heterogeneous Time Series</title>

Abstract: Operational disruptions can significantly impact companies performance. Ford, with its 37 plants globally, uses 17 billion parts annually to manufacture six million cars and trucks. With up to ten tiers of suppliers between the company and raw materials, any extended disruption in this supply chain can cause substantial financial losses. Therefore, the ability to forecast and identify such disruptions early is crucial for maintaining seamless operations. In this study, we demonstrate how we construct a dataset consisting of many multivariate time series to forecast first-tier supply chain disruptions, utilizing features related to capacity, inventory, utilization, and processing, as outlined in the classical Factory Physics framework. This dataset is technically challenging due to its vast scale of over five hundred thousand time series. Furthermore, these time series, while exhibiting certain similarities, also display heterogeneity within specific subgroups. To address these challenges, we propose a novel methodology that integrates an enhanced Attention Sequence to Sequence Deep Learning architecture, using Neural Network Embeddings to model group effects, with a Survival Analysis model. This model is designed to learn intricate heterogeneous data patterns related to operational disruptions. Our model has demonstrated a strong performance, achieving 0.85 precision and 0.8 recall during the Quality Assurance (QA) phase across Ford's five North American plants. Additionally, to address the common criticism of Machine Learning models as black boxes, we show how the SHAP framework can be used to generate feature importance from the model predictions. It offers valuable insights that can lead to actionable strategies and highlights the potential of advanced machine learning for managing and mitigating supply chain risks in the automotive industry.</description>

      <title>Amortized Bayesian Multilevel Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.13230v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multilevel models (MLMs) are a central building block of the Bayesian workflow. They enable joint, interpretable modeling of data across hierarchical levels and provide a fully probabilistic quantification of uncertainty. Despite their well-recognized advantages, MLMs pose significant computational challenges, often rendering their estimation and evaluation intractable within reasonable time constraints. Recent advances in simulation-based inference offer promising solutions for addressing complex probabilistic models using deep generative networks. However, the utility and reliability of deep learning methods for estimating Bayesian MLMs remains largely unexplored, especially when compared with gold-standard samplers. To this end, we explore a family of neural network architectures that leverage the probabilistic factorization of multilevel models to facilitate efficient neural network training and subsequent near-instant posterior inference on unseen datasets. We test our method on several real-world case studies and provide comprehensive comparisons to Stan's gold standard sampler, where possible. Finally, we provide an open-source implementation of our methods to stimulate further research in the nascent field of amortized Bayesian inference.</description>

Abstract: Non-stationary multi-armed bandits (NS-MABs) model sequential decision-making problems in which the expected rewards of a set of actions, a.k.a.~arms, evolve over time. In this paper, we fill a gap in the literature by providing a novel analysis of Thompson sampling-inspired (TS) algorithms for NS-MABs that both corrects and generalizes existing work. Specifically, we study the cumulative frequentist regret of two algorithms based on sliding-window TS approaches with different priors, namely $\textit{Beta-SWTS}$ and $\textit{$\gamma$-SWGTS}$. We derive a unifying regret upper bound for these algorithms that applies to any arbitrary NS-MAB (with either Bernoulli or subgaussian rewards). Our result introduces new indices that capture the inherent sources of complexity in the learning problem. Then, we specialize our general result to two of the most common NS-MAB settings: the $\textit{abruptly changing}$ and the $\textit{smoothly changing}$ environments, showing that it matches state-of-the-art results. Finally, we evaluate the performance of the analyzed algorithms in simulated environments and compare them with state-of-the-art approaches for NS-MABs.</description>

      <title>Improved Regret of Linear Ensemble Sampling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03932v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we close the fundamental gap of theory and practice by providing an improved regret bound for linear ensemble sampling. We prove that with an ensemble size logarithmic in $T$, linear ensemble sampling can achieve a frequentist regret bound of $\tilde{O}(d^{3/2}\sqrt{T})$, matching state-of-the-art results for randomized linear bandit algorithms, where $d$ and $T$ are the dimension of the parameter and the time horizon respectively. Our approach introduces a general regret analysis framework for linear bandit algorithms. Additionally, we reveal a significant relationship between linear ensemble sampling and Linear Perturbed-History Exploration (LinPHE), showing that LinPHE is a special case of linear ensemble sampling when the ensemble size equals $T$. This insight allows our analysis framework to derive a regret bound of $\tilde{O}(d^{3/2}\sqrt{T})$ for LinPHE, independent of the number of arms. Our techniques advance the theoretical foundation of ensemble sampling, bringing its regret bounds in line with the best known bounds for other randomized exploration algorithms.</description>

      <title>Counterfactual Uncertainty Quantification of Factual Estimand of Efficacy from Before-and-After Treatment Repeated Measures Randomized Controlled Trials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09635v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article quantifies the uncertainty reduction achievable for \textit{counterfactual} estimand, and cautions against potential bias when the estimand uses Digital Twins. Posed by Neyman (1923a) who showed unbiased \textit{point estimation} from designed \textit{factual} experiments is possible, \textit{counterfactual} uncertainty quantification (CUQ) remained an open challenge for about one hundred years. The $Rx: C$ \textit{counterfactual} efficacy we focus on is the ideal estimand for comparing treatment $Rx$ with control $C$, the expected outcome differential if each patient received \textit{both} $Rx$ and $C$. Enabled by our new statistical modeling principle called ETZ, we show CUQ is achievable in Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs) with \textit{Before-and-After} Repeated Measures, common in many therapeutic areas. The CUQ we are able to achieve typically has lower variability than factual UQ.
  We caution against using predictors with measurement error, which violates regression assumptions and can cause \textit{attenuation} bias in estimating treatment effects. For traditional medicine and population-averaged targeted therapy, counterfactual point estimation remains unbiased. However, in both Real Human and Digital Twin approaches, estimating effects in \emph{subgroups} may suffer attenuation bias.</description>

      <title>Algorithms with Calibrated Machine Learning Predictions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.02861v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The field of algorithms with predictions incorporates machine learning advice in the design of online algorithms to improve real-world performance. A central consideration is the extent to which predictions can be trusted -- while existing approaches often require users to specify an aggregate trust level, modern machine learning models can provide estimates of prediction-level uncertainty. In this paper, we propose calibration as a principled and practical tool to bridge this gap, demonstrating the benefits of calibrated advice through two case studies: the ski rental and online job scheduling problems. For ski rental, we design an algorithm that achieves near-optimal prediction-dependent performance and prove that, in high-variance settings, calibrated advice offers more effective guidance than alternative methods for uncertainty quantification. For job scheduling, we demonstrate that using a calibrated predictor leads to significant performance improvements over existing methods. Evaluations on real-world data validate our theoretical findings, highlighting the practical impact of calibration for algorithms with predictions.</description>

      <title>Robust Conformal Outlier Detection under Contaminated Reference Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.04807v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Conformal prediction is a flexible framework for calibrating machine learning predictions, providing distribution-free statistical guarantees. In outlier detection, this calibration relies on a reference set of labeled inlier data to control the type-I error rate. However, obtaining a perfectly labeled inlier reference set is often unrealistic, and a more practical scenario involves access to a contaminated reference set containing a small fraction of outliers. This paper analyzes the impact of such contamination on the validity of conformal methods. We prove that under realistic, non-adversarial settings, calibration on contaminated data yields conservative type-I error control, shedding light on the inherent robustness of conformal methods. This conservativeness, however, typically results in a loss of power. To alleviate this limitation, we propose a novel, active data-cleaning framework that leverages a limited labeling budget and an outlier detection model to selectively annotate data points in the contaminated reference set that are suspected as outliers. By removing only the annotated outliers in this ``suspicious'' subset, we can effectively enhance power while mitigating the risk of inflating the type-I error rate, as supported by our theoretical analysis. Experiments on real datasets validate the conservative behavior of conformal methods under contamination and show that the proposed data-cleaning strategy improves power without sacrificing validity.</description>

      <title>Learning an Optimal Assortment Policy under Observational Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.06777v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the fundamental problem of offline assortment optimization under the Multinomial Logit (MNL) model, where sellers must determine the optimal subset of the products to offer based solely on historical customer choice data. While most existing approaches to learning-based assortment optimization focus on the online learning of the optimal assortment through repeated interactions with customers, such exploration can be costly or even impractical in many real-world settings. In this paper, we consider the offline learning paradigm and investigate the minimal data requirements for efficient offline assortment optimization. To this end, we introduce Pessimistic Rank-Breaking (PRB), an algorithm that combines rank-breaking with pessimistic estimation. We prove that PRB is nearly minimax optimal by establishing the tight suboptimality upper bound and a nearly matching lower bound. This further shows that "optimal item coverage" - where each item in the optimal assortment appears sufficiently often in the historical data - is both sufficient and necessary for efficient offline learning. This significantly relaxes the previous requirement of observing the complete optimal assortment in the data. Our results provide fundamental insights into the data requirements for offline assortment optimization under the MNL model.</description>

      <title>Improved Online Confidence Bounds for Multinomial Logistic Bandits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.10020v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose an improved online confidence bound for multinomial logistic (MNL) models and apply this result to MNL bandits, achieving variance-dependent optimal regret. Recently, Lee &amp; Oh (2024) established an online confidence bound for MNL models and achieved nearly minimax-optimal regret in MNL bandits. However, their results still depend on the norm-boundedness of the unknown parameter $B$ and the maximum size of possible outcomes $K$. To address this, we first derive an online confidence bound of $O\left(\sqrt{d \log t} + B \sqrt{d} \right)$, which is a significant improvement over the previous bound of $O (B \sqrt{d} \log t \log K )$ (Lee &amp; Oh, 2024). This is mainly achieved by establishing tighter self-concordant properties of the MNL loss and applying Ville's inequality to bound the estimation error. Using this new online confidence bound, we propose a constant-time algorithm, OFU-MNL++, which achieves a variance-dependent regret bound of $O \Big( d \log T \sqrt{ \sum_{t=1}^T \sigma_t^2 } \Big) $ for sufficiently large $T$, where $\sigma_t^2$ denotes the variance of the rewards at round $t$, $d$ is the dimension of the contexts, and $T$ is the total number of rounds. Furthermore, we introduce a Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE)-based algorithm, OFU-MN$^2$L, which achieves an anytime poly(B)-free regret of $O \Big( d \log (BT) \sqrt{ \sum_{t=1}^T \sigma_t^2 } \Big) $.</description>

      <title>Batch-Adaptive Annotations for Causal Inference with Complex-Embedded Outcomes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.10605v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Estimating the causal effects of an intervention on outcomes is crucial to policy and decision-making. But often, information about outcomes can be missing or subject to non-standard measurement error. It may be possible to reveal ground-truth outcome information at a cost, for example via data annotation or follow-up; but budget constraints entail that only a fraction of the dataset can be labeled. In this setting, we optimize which data points should be sampled for outcome information and, therefore, efficient average treatment effect estimation with missing data. We do so by allocating data annotation in batches. We extend to settings where outcomes may be recorded in unstructured data that can be annotated at a cost, such as text or images, for example, in healthcare or social services. Our motivating application is a collaboration with a street outreach provider with millions of case notes, where it is possible to expertly label some, but not all, ground-truth outcomes. We demonstrate how expert labels and noisy imputed labels can be combined efficiently and responsibly into a doubly robust causal estimator. We run experiments on simulated data and two real-world datasets, including one on street outreach interventions in homelessness services, to show the versatility of our proposed method.</description>

Abstract: We review the literature on algorithms for estimating the index space in a multi-index model. The primary focus is on computationally efficient (polynomial-time) algorithms in Gaussian space, the assumptions under which consistency is guaranteed by these methods, and their sample complexity. In many cases, a gap is observed between the sample complexity of the best known computationally efficient methods and the information-theoretical minimum. We also review algorithms based on estimating the span of gradients using nonparametric methods, and algorithms based on fitting neural networks using gradient descent</description>

      <title>Uniform convergence of the smooth calibration error and its relationship with functional gradient</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.19396v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Calibration is a critical requirement for reliable probabilistic prediction, especially in high-risk applications. However, the theoretical understanding of which learning algorithms can simultaneously achieve high accuracy and good calibration remains limited, and many existing studies provide empirical validation or a theoretical guarantee in restrictive settings. To address this issue, in this work, we focus on the smooth calibration error (CE) and provide a uniform convergence bound, showing that the smooth CE is bounded by the sum of the smooth CE over the training dataset and a generalization gap. We further prove that the functional gradient of the loss function can effectively control the training smooth CE. Based on this framework, we analyze three representative algorithms: gradient boosting trees, kernel boosting, and two-layer neural networks. For each, we derive conditions under which both classification and calibration performances are simultaneously guaranteed. Our results offer new theoretical insights and practical guidance for designing reliable probabilistic models with provable calibration guarantees.</description>

      <title>Regret Minimization and Convergence to Equilibria in General-sum Markov Games</title>

      <description>arXiv:2207.14211v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An abundance of recent impossibility results establish that regret minimization in Markov games with adversarial opponents is both statistically and computationally intractable. Nevertheless, none of these results preclude the possibility of regret minimization under the assumption that all parties adopt the same learning procedure. In this work, we present the first (to our knowledge) algorithm for learning in general-sum Markov games that provides sublinear regret guarantees when executed by all agents. The bounds we obtain are for swap regret, and thus, along the way, imply convergence to a correlated equilibrium. Our algorithm is decentralized, computationally efficient, and does not require any communication between agents. Our key observation is that online learning via policy optimization in Markov games essentially reduces to a form of weighted regret minimization, with unknown weights determined by the path length of the agents' policy sequence. Consequently, controlling the path length leads to weighted regret objectives for which sufficiently adaptive algorithms provide sublinear regret guarantees.</description>

      <title>Conformal Risk Control</title>

      <description>arXiv:2208.02814v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We extend conformal prediction to control the expected value of any monotone loss function. The algorithm generalizes split conformal prediction together with its coverage guarantee. Like conformal prediction, the conformal risk control procedure is tight up to an $\mathcal{O}(1/n)$ factor. We also introduce extensions of the idea to distribution shift, quantile risk control, multiple and adversarial risk control, and expectations of U-statistics. Worked examples from computer vision and natural language processing demonstrate the usage of our algorithm to bound the false negative rate, graph distance, and token-level F1-score.</description>

      <title>Causal Deep Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.00314v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive a set of causal deep neural networks whose architectures are a consequence of tensor (multilinear) factor analysis, a framework that facilitates causal inference. Forward causal questions are addressed with a neural network architecture composed of causal capsules and a tensor transformer. Causal capsules compute a set of invariant causal factor representations, whose interactions are governed by a tensor transformation. Inverse causal questions are addressed with a neural network that implements the multilinear projection algorithm. The architecture reverses the order of operations of a forward neural network and estimates the causes of effects. As an alternative to aggressive bottleneck dimension reduction or regularized regression that may camouflage an inherently underdetermined inverse problem, we prescribe modeling different aspects of the mechanism of data formation with piecewise tensor models whose multilinear projections produce multiple candidate solutions. Our forward and inverse questions may be addressed with shallow architectures, but for computationally scalable solutions, we derive a set of deep neural networks by taking advantage of block algebra. An interleaved kernel hierarchy results in doubly non-linear tensor factor models. The causal neural networks that are a consequence of tensor factor analysis are data agnostic, but are illustrated with facial images. Sequential, parallel and asynchronous parallel computation strategies are described.</description>

      <title>CATE Estimation With Potential Outcome Imputation From Local Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.03630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.03630v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: One of the most significant challenges in Conditional Average Treatment Effect (CATE) estimation is the statistical discrepancy between distinct treatment groups. To address this issue, we propose a model-agnostic data augmentation method for CATE estimation. First, we derive regret bounds for general data augmentation methods suggesting that a small imputation error may be necessary for accurate CATE estimation. Inspired by this idea, we propose a contrastive learning approach that reliably imputes missing potential outcomes for a selected subset of individuals formed using a similarity measure. We augment the original dataset with these reliable imputations to reduce the discrepancy between different treatment groups while inducing minimal imputation error. The augmented dataset can subsequently be employed to train standard CATE estimation models. We provide both theoretical guarantees and extensive numerical studies demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach in improving the accuracy and robustness of numerous CATE estimation models.</description>

      <title>Mitigating distribution shift in machine learning-augmented hybrid simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.09259v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of distribution shift generally arising in machine-learning augmented hybrid simulation, where parts of simulation algorithms are replaced by data-driven surrogates. We first establish a mathematical framework to understand the structure of machine-learning augmented hybrid simulation problems, and the cause and effect of the associated distribution shift. We show correlations between distribution shift and simulation error both numerically and theoretically. Then, we propose a simple methodology based on tangent-space regularized estimator to control the distribution shift, thereby improving the long-term accuracy of the simulation results. In the linear dynamics case, we provide a thorough theoretical analysis to quantify the effectiveness of the proposed method. Moreover, we conduct several numerical experiments, including simulating a partially known reaction-diffusion equation and solving Navier-Stokes equations using the projection method with a data-driven pressure solver. In all cases, we observe marked improvements in simulation accuracy under the proposed method, especially for systems with high degrees of distribution shift, such as those with relatively strong non-linear reaction mechanisms, or flows at large Reynolds numbers.</description>

      <title>Zeroth-Order primal-dual Alternating Projection Gradient Algorithms for Nonconvex Minimax Problems with Coupled linear Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.03352v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study zeroth-order algorithms for nonconvex minimax problems with coupled linear constraints under the deterministic and stochastic settings, which have attracted wide attention in machine learning, signal processing and many other fields in recent years, e.g., adversarial attacks in resource allocation problems and network flow problems etc. We propose two single-loop algorithms, namely the zeroth-order primal-dual alternating projected gradient (ZO-PDAPG) algorithm and the zeroth-order regularized momentum primal-dual projected gradient algorithm (ZO-RMPDPG), for solving deterministic and stochastic nonconvex-(strongly) concave minimax problems with coupled linear constraints. The iteration complexity of the two proposed algorithms to obtain an $\varepsilon$-stationary point are proved to be $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon ^{-2})$ (resp. $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon ^{-4})$) for solving nonconvex-strongly concave (resp. nonconvex-concave) minimax problems with coupled linear constraints under deterministic settings and $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\varepsilon ^{-3})$ (resp. $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\varepsilon ^{-6.5})$) under stochastic settings respectively. To the best of our knowledge, they are the first two zeroth-order algorithms with iterative complexity guarantees for solving nonconvex-(strongly) concave minimax problems with coupled linear constraints under the deterministic and stochastic settings.</description>

      <title>Simplifying debiased inference via automatic differentiation and probabilistic programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08675v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce an algorithm that simplifies the construction of efficient estimators, making them accessible to a broader audience. 'Dimple' takes as input computer code representing a parameter of interest and outputs an efficient estimator. Unlike standard approaches, it does not require users to derive a functional derivative known as the efficient influence function. Dimple avoids this task by applying automatic differentiation to the statistical functional of interest. Doing so requires expressing this functional as a composition of primitives satisfying a novel differentiability condition. Dimple also uses this composition to determine the nuisances it must estimate. In software, primitives can be implemented independently of one another and reused across different estimation problems. We provide a proof-of-concept Python implementation and showcase through examples how it allows users to go from parameter specification to efficient estimation with just a few lines of code.</description>

      <title>Consistency of Neural Causal Partial Identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15673v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent progress in Neural Causal Models (NCMs) showcased how identification and partial identification of causal effects can be automatically carried out via training of neural generative models that respect the constraints encoded in a given causal graph [Xia et al. 2022, Balazadeh et al. 2022]. However, formal consistency of these methods has only been proven for the case of discrete variables or only for linear causal models. In this work, we prove the consistency of partial identification via NCMs in a general setting with both continuous and categorical variables. Further, our results highlight the impact of the design of the underlying neural network architecture in terms of depth and connectivity as well as the importance of applying Lipschitz regularization in the training phase. In particular, we provide a counterexample showing that without Lipschitz regularization this method may not be asymptotically consistent. Our results are enabled by new results on the approximability of Structural Causal Models (SCMs) via neural generative models, together with an analysis of the sample complexity of the resulting architectures and how that translates into an error in the constrained optimization problem that defines the partial identification bounds.</description>

      <title>Optimistic Q-learning for average reward and episodic reinforcement learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13743v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an optimistic Q-learning algorithm for regret minimization in average reward reinforcement learning under an additional assumption on the underlying MDP that for all policies, the time to visit some frequent state $s_0$ is finite and upper bounded by $H$, either in expectation or with constant probability. Our setting strictly generalizes the episodic setting and is significantly less restrictive than the assumption of bounded hitting time \textit{for all states} made by most previous literature on model-free algorithms in average reward settings. We demonstrate a regret bound of $\tilde{O}(H^5 S\sqrt{AT})$, where $S$ and $A$ are the numbers of states and actions, and $T$ is the horizon. A key technical novelty of our work is the introduction of an $\overline{L}$ operator defined as $\overline{L} v = \frac{1}{H} \sum_{h=1}^H L^h v$ where $L$ denotes the Bellman operator. Under the given assumption, we show that the $\overline{L}$ operator has a strict contraction (in span) even in the average-reward setting where the discount factor is $1$. Our algorithm design uses ideas from episodic Q-learning to estimate and apply this operator iteratively. Thus, we provide a unified view of regret minimization in episodic and non-episodic settings, which may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>TimeInf: Time Series Data Contribution via Influence Functions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15247v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Evaluating the contribution of individual data points to a model's prediction is critical for interpreting model predictions and improving model performance. Existing data contribution methods have been applied to various data types, including tabular data, images, and text; however, their primary focus has been on i.i.d. settings. Despite the pressing need for principled approaches tailored to time series datasets, the problem of estimating data contribution in such settings remains under-explored, possibly due to challenges associated with handling inherent temporal dependencies. This paper introduces TimeInf, a model-agnostic data contribution estimation method for time-series datasets. By leveraging influence scores, TimeInf attributes model predictions to individual time points while preserving temporal structures between the time points. Our empirical results show that TimeInf effectively detects time series anomalies and outperforms existing data attribution techniques as well as state-of-the-art anomaly detection methods. Moreover, TimeInf offers interpretable attributions of data values, allowing us to distinguish diverse anomalous patterns through visualizations. We also showcase a potential application of TimeInf in identifying mislabeled anomalies in the ground truth annotations.</description>

      <title>Optimal Neural Network Approximation for High-Dimensional Continuous Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02363v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, the authors of \cite{SYZ22} developed a neural network with width $36d(2d + 1)$ and depth $11$, which utilizes a special activation function called the elementary universal activation function, to achieve the super approximation property for functions in $C([a,b]^d)$. That is, the constructed network only requires a fixed number of neurons (and thus parameters) to approximate a $d$-variate continuous function on a $d$-dimensional hypercube with arbitrary accuracy. More specifically, only $\mathcal{O}(d^2)$ neurons or parameters are used. One natural question is whether we can reduce the number of these neurons or parameters in such a network. By leveraging a variant of the Kolmogorov Superposition Theorem, \textcolor{black}{we show that there is a composition of networks generated by the elementary universal activation function with at most $10889d + 10887$ nonzero parameters such that this super approximation property is attained. The composed network consists of repeated evaluations of two neural networks: one with width $36(2d+1)$ and the other with width 36, both having 5 layers.} Furthermore, we present a family of continuous functions that requires at least width $d$, and thus at least $d$ neurons or parameters, to achieve arbitrary accuracy in its approximation. This suggests that the number of nonzero parameters is optimal in the sense that it grows linearly with the input dimension $d$, unlike some approximation methods where parameters may grow exponentially with $d$.</description>

      <title>Mind the Gap: a Spectral Analysis of Rank Collapse and Signal Propagation in Attention Layers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07799v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Attention layers are the core component of transformers, the current state-of-the-art neural network architecture. Alternatives to softmax-based attention are being explored due to its tendency to hinder effective information flow. Even at initialisation, it remains poorly understood why the propagation of signals and gradients through these random networks can be pathological, resulting in issues known as (i) vanishing/exploding gradients and (ii) rank collapse $\textit{in depth}$, i.e. when all tokens converge to a single representation along layers. While rank collapse in depth naturally arises from repeated matrix multiplications$\unicode{x2013}$a common pattern across various architectures$\unicode{x2013}$we identify an additional and previously unknown challenge unique to softmax attention layers: (iii) rank collapse $\textit{in width}$, which occurs as the context length increases. Using Random Matrix Theory, we conduct a rigorous analysis that uncovers a spectral gap between the two largest singular values of the attention matrix as the cause of (iii), which in turn exacerbates (i) and (ii). Building on this insight, we propose a novel yet simple practical solution to mitigate rank collapse in width by removing the outlier eigenvalue(s). Our theoretical framework offers a fresh perspective on recent practical studies, such as (Ye et al., 2024; Ali et al., 2023), whose ad hoc solutions can now be interpreted as implicit efforts to address the spectral gap issue. This work provides valuable theoretical support for ongoing large-scale empirical research, bringing theory and practice one step closer in the understanding of transformers.</description>

      <title>On Information-Theoretic Measures of Predictive Uncertainty</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10786v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reliable estimation of predictive uncertainty is crucial for machine learning applications, particularly in high-stakes scenarios where hedging against risks is essential. Despite its significance, there is no universal agreement on how to best quantify predictive uncertainty. In this work, we revisit core concepts to propose a framework for information-theoretic measures of predictive uncertainty. Our proposed framework categorizes predictive uncertainty measures according to two factors: (I) The predicting model (II) The approximation of the true predictive distribution. Examining all possible combinations of these two factors, we derive a set of predictive uncertainty measures that includes both known and newly introduced ones. We extensively evaluate these measures across a broad set of tasks, identifying conditions under which certain measures excel. Our findings show the importance of aligning the choice of uncertainty measure with the predicting model on in-distribution (ID) data, the limitations of epistemic uncertainty measures for out-of-distribution (OOD) data, and that the disentanglement between measures varies substantially between ID and OOD data. Together, these insights provide a more comprehensive understanding of predictive uncertainty measures, revealing their implicit assumptions and relationships.</description>

      <title>Fixing the Loose Brake: Exponential-Tailed Stopping Time in Best Arm Identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01808v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The best arm identification problem requires identifying the best alternative (i.e., arm) in active experimentation using the smallest number of experiments (i.e., arm pulls), which is crucial for cost-efficient and timely decision-making processes. In the fixed confidence setting, an algorithm must stop data-dependently and return the estimated best arm with a correctness guarantee. Since this stopping time is random, we desire its distribution to have light tails. Unfortunately, many existing studies focus on high probability or in expectation bounds on the stopping time, which allow heavy tails and, for high probability bounds, even not stopping at all. We first prove that this never-stopping event can indeed happen for some popular algorithms. Motivated by this, we propose algorithms that provably enjoy an exponential-tailed stopping time, which improves upon the polynomial tail bound reported by Kalyanakrishnan et al. (2012). The first algorithm is based on a fixed budget algorithm called Sequential Halving along with a doubling trick. The second algorithm is a meta algorithm that takes in any fixed confidence algorithm with a high probability stopping guarantee and turns it into one that enjoys an exponential-tailed stopping time. Our results imply that there is much more to be desired for contemporary fixed confidence algorithms.</description>

      <title>Discovering Latent Causal Graphs from Spatiotemporal Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05331v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many important phenomena in scientific fields like climate, neuroscience, and epidemiology are naturally represented as spatiotemporal gridded data with complex interactions. Inferring causal relationships from these data is a challenging problem compounded by the high dimensionality of such data and the correlations between spatially proximate points. We present SPACY (SPAtiotemporal Causal discoverY), a novel framework based on variational inference, designed to model latent time series and their causal relationships from spatiotemporal data. SPACY alleviates the high-dimensional challenge by discovering causal structures in the latent space. To aggregate spatially proximate, correlated grid points, we use spatial factors, parametrized by spatial kernel functions, to map observational time series to latent representations. Theoretically, we generalize the problem to a continuous spatial domain and establish identifiability when the observations arise from a nonlinear, invertible function of the product of latent series and spatial factors. Using this approach, we avoid assumptions that are often unverifiable, including those about instantaneous effects or sufficient variability. Empirically, SPACY outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on synthetic data, even in challenging settings where existing methods struggle, while remaining scalable for large grids. SPACY also identifies key known phenomena from real-world climate data. An implementation of SPACY is available at https://github.com/Rose-STL-Lab/SPACY/</description>

      <title>Gradient Norm Regularization Second-Order Algorithms for Solving Nonconvex-Strongly Concave Minimax Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15769v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study second-order algorithms for solving nonconvex-strongly concave minimax problems, which have attracted much attention in recent years in many fields, especially in machine learning.We propose a gradient norm regularized trust-region (GRTR) algorithm to solve nonconvex-strongly concave minimax problems, where the objective function of the trust-region subproblem in each iteration uses a regularized version of the Hessian matrix, and the regularization coefficient and the radius of the ball constraint are proportional to the square root of the gradient norm. The iteration complexity of the proposed GRTR algorithm to obtain an $O(\epsilon,\sqrt{\epsilon})$-second-order stationary point is proved to be upper bounded by $\tilde{O}(\ell^{1.5}\rho^{0.5}\mu^{-1.5}\epsilon^{-1.5})$, where $\mu$ is the strong concave coefficient, $\ell$ and $\rho$ are the Lipschitz constant of the gradient and Jacobian matrix respectively, which matches the best known iteration complexity of second-order methods for solving nonconvex-strongly concave minimax problems. We further propose a Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm with a gradient norm regularization coefficient and use the negative curvature direction to correct the iteration direction (LMNegCur), which does not need to solve the trust-region subproblem at each iteration. We also prove that the LMNegCur algorithm achieves an $O(\epsilon,\sqrt{\epsilon})$-second-order stationary point within $\tilde{O}(\ell^{1.5}\rho^{0.5}\mu^{-1.5}\epsilon^{-1.5})$ number of iterations.The inexact variants of both algorithms can still obtain $O(\epsilon,\sqrt{\epsilon})$-second-order stationary points with high probability, but only require $\tilde{O}(\ell^{2.25}\rho^{0.25}\mu^{-1.75}\epsilon^{-1.75})$ Hessian-vector products and $\tilde{O}(\ell^{2}\rho^{0.5}\mu^{-2}\epsilon^{-1.5})$ gradient ascent steps.</description>

      <title>Semiparametric Bayesian Difference-in-Differences</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04605v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper studies semiparametric Bayesian inference for the average treatment effect on the treated (ATT) within the difference-in-differences (DiD) research design. We propose two new Bayesian methods with frequentist validity. The first one places a standard Gaussian process prior on the conditional mean function of the control group. The second method is a double robust Bayesian procedure that adjusts the prior distribution of the conditional mean function and subsequently corrects the posterior distribution of the resulting ATT. We prove new semiparametric Bernstein-von Mises (BvM) theorems for both proposals. Monte Carlo simulations and an empirical application demonstrate that the proposed Bayesian DiD methods exhibit strong finite-sample performance compared to existing frequentist methods. We also present extensions of the canonical DiD approach, incorporating both the staggered design and the repeated cross-sectional design.</description>

      <title>The Best Soules Basis for the Estimation of a Spectral Barycentre Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00038v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The main contribution of this work is a fast algorithm to compute the barycentre of a set of networks based on a Laplacian spectral pseudo-distance. The core engine for the reconstruction of the barycentre is an algorithm that explores the large library of Soules bases, and returns a basis that yields a sparse approximation of the sample mean adjacency matrix. We prove that when the networks are random realizations of stochastic block models, then our algorithm reconstructs the population mean adjacency matrix. In addition to the theoretical analysis of the estimator of the barycentre network, we perform Monte Carlo simulations to validate the theoretical properties of the estimator. This work is significant because it opens the door to the design of new spectral-based network synthesis that have theoretical guarantees.</description>

      <title>Deep Linear Network Training Dynamics from Random Initialization: Data, Width, Depth, and Hyperparameter Transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02531v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We theoretically characterize gradient descent dynamics in deep linear networks trained at large width from random initialization and on large quantities of random data. Our theory captures the ``wider is better" effect of mean-field/maximum-update parameterized networks as well as hyperparameter transfer effects, which can be contrasted with the neural-tangent parameterization where optimal learning rates shift with model width. We provide asymptotic descriptions of both non-residual and residual neural networks, the latter of which enables an infinite depth limit when branches are scaled as $1/\sqrt{\text{depth}}$. We also compare training with one-pass stochastic gradient descent to the dynamics when training data are repeated at each iteration. Lastly, we show that this model recovers the accelerated power law training dynamics for power law structured data in the rich regime observed in recent works.</description>

      <title>PoGDiff: Product-of-Gaussians Diffusion Models for Imbalanced Text-to-Image Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08106v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models have made significant advancements in recent years. However, their performance often deteriorates when trained or fine-tuned on imbalanced datasets. This degradation is largely due to the disproportionate representation of majority and minority data in image-text pairs. In this paper, we propose a general fine-tuning approach, dubbed PoGDiff, to address this challenge. Rather than directly minimizing the KL divergence between the predicted and ground-truth distributions, PoGDiff replaces the ground-truth distribution with a Product of Gaussians (PoG), which is constructed by combining the original ground-truth targets with the predicted distribution conditioned on a neighboring text embedding. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our method effectively addresses the imbalance problem in diffusion models, improving both generation accuracy and quality.</description>

      <title>A new and flexible class of sharp asymptotic time-uniform confidence sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10380v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Confidence sequences are anytime-valid analogues of classical confidence intervals that do not suffer from multiplicity issues under optional continuation of the data collection. As in classical statistics, asymptotic confidence sequences are a nonparametric tool showing under which high-level assumptions asymptotic coverage is achieved so that they also give a certain robustness guarantee against distributional deviations. In this paper, we propose a new flexible class of confidence sequences yielding sharp asymptotic time-uniform confidence sequences under mild assumptions. Furthermore, we highlight the connection to corresponding sequential testing problems and detail the underlying limit theorem.</description>

      <title>Structured and sparse partial least squares coherence for multivariate cortico-muscular analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21802v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multivariate cortico-muscular analysis has recently emerged as a promising approach for evaluating the corticospinal neural pathway. However, current multivariate approaches encounter challenges such as high dimensionality and limited sample sizes, thus restricting their further applications. In this paper, we propose a structured and sparse partial least squares coherence algorithm (ssPLSC) to extract shared latent space representations related to cortico-muscular interactions. Our approach leverages an embedded optimization framework by integrating a partial least squares (PLS)-based objective function, a sparsity constraint and a connectivity-based structured constraint, addressing the generalizability, interpretability and spatial structure. To solve the optimization problem, we develop an efficient alternating iterative algorithm within a unified framework and prove its convergence experimentally. Extensive experimental results from one synthetic and several real-world datasets have demonstrated that ssPLSC can achieve competitive or better performance over some representative multivariate cortico-muscular fusion methods, particularly in scenarios characterized by limited sample sizes and high noise levels. This study provides a novel multivariate fusion method for cortico-muscular analysis, offering a transformative tool for the evaluation of corticospinal pathway integrity in neurological disorders.</description>

      <title>ICE-Pruning: An Iterative Cost-Efficient Pruning Pipeline for Deep Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07411v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Pruning is a widely used method for compressing Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), where less relevant parameters are removed from a DNN model to reduce its size. However, removing parameters reduces model accuracy, so pruning is typically combined with fine-tuning, and sometimes other operations such as rewinding weights, to recover accuracy. A common approach is to repeatedly prune and then fine-tune, with increasing amounts of model parameters being removed in each step. While straightforward to implement, pruning pipelines that follow this approach are computationally expensive due to the need for repeated fine-tuning.
  In this paper we propose ICE-Pruning, an iterative pruning pipeline for DNNs that significantly decreases the time required for pruning by reducing the overall cost of fine-tuning, while maintaining a similar accuracy to existing pruning pipelines. ICE-Pruning is based on three main components: i) an automatic mechanism to determine after which pruning steps fine-tuning should be performed; ii) a freezing strategy for faster fine-tuning in each pruning step; and iii) a custom pruning-aware learning rate scheduler to further improve the accuracy of each pruning step and reduce the overall time consumption. We also propose an efficient auto-tuning stage for the hyperparameters (e.g., freezing percentage) introduced by the three components. We evaluate ICE-Pruning on several DNN models and datasets, showing that it can accelerate pruning by up to 9.61x. Code is available at https://github.com/gicLAB/ICE-Pruning</description>

      <title>A Dataless Reinforcement Learning Approach to Rounding Hyperplane Optimization for Max-Cut</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13405v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Maximum Cut (MaxCut) problem is NP-Complete, and obtaining its optimal solution is NP-hard in the worst case. As a result, heuristic-based algorithms are commonly used, though their design often requires significant domain expertise. More recently, learning-based methods trained on large (un)labeled datasets have been proposed; however, these approaches often struggle with generalizability and scalability. A well-known approximation algorithm for MaxCut is the Goemans-Williamson (GW) algorithm, which relaxes the Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) formulation into a semidefinite program (SDP). The GW algorithm then applies hyperplane rounding by uniformly sampling a random hyperplane to convert the SDP solution into binary node assignments. In this paper, we propose a training-data-free approach based on a non-episodic reinforcement learning formulation, in which an agent learns to select improved rounding hyperplanes that yield better cuts than those produced by the GW algorithm. By optimizing over a Markov Decision Process (MDP), our method consistently achieves better cuts across large-scale graphs with varying densities and degree distributions.</description>

      <title>Synthetic-Powered Predictive Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13432v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Conformal prediction is a framework for predictive inference with a distribution-free, finite-sample guarantee. However, it tends to provide uninformative prediction sets when calibration data are scarce. This paper introduces Synthetic-powered predictive inference (SPI), a novel framework that incorporates synthetic data -- e.g., from a generative model -- to improve sample efficiency. At the core of our method is a score transporter: an empirical quantile mapping that aligns nonconformity scores from trusted, real data with those from synthetic data. By carefully integrating the score transporter into the calibration process, SPI provably achieves finite-sample coverage guarantees without making any assumptions about the real and synthetic data distributions. When the score distributions are well aligned, SPI yields substantially tighter and more informative prediction sets than standard conformal prediction. Experiments on image classification -- augmenting data with synthetic diffusion-model generated images -- and on tabular regression demonstrate notable improvements in predictive efficiency in data-scarce settings.</description>

      <title>Learning to Rank Chain-of-Thought: An Energy-Based Approach with Outcome Supervision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14999v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mathematical reasoning presents a significant challenge for Large Language Models (LLMs), often requiring robust multi step logical consistency. While Chain of Thought (CoT) prompting elicits reasoning steps, it doesn't guarantee correctness, and improving reliability via extensive sampling is computationally costly. This paper introduces the Energy Outcome Reward Model (EORM), an effective, lightweight, post hoc verifier. EORM leverages Energy Based Models (EBMs) to simplify the training of reward models by learning to assign a scalar energy score to CoT solutions using only outcome labels, thereby avoiding detailed annotations. It achieves this by interpreting discriminator output logits as negative energies, effectively ranking candidates where lower energy is assigned to solutions leading to correct final outcomes implicitly favoring coherent reasoning. On mathematical benchmarks (GSM8k, MATH), EORM significantly improves final answer accuracy (e.g., with Llama 3 8B, achieving 90.7% on GSM8k and 63.7% on MATH). EORM effectively leverages a given pool of candidate solutions to match or exceed the performance of brute force sampling, thereby enhancing LLM reasoning outcome reliability through its streamlined post hoc verification process.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.01622v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Are world models a necessary ingredient for flexible, goal-directed behaviour, or is model-free learning sufficient? We provide a formal answer to this question, showing that any agent capable of generalizing to multi-step goal-directed tasks must have learned a predictive model of its environment. We show that this model can be extracted from the agent's policy, and that increasing the agents performance or the complexity of the goals it can achieve requires learning increasingly accurate world models. This has a number of consequences: from developing safe and general agents, to bounding agent capabilities in complex environments, and providing new algorithms for eliciting world models from agents.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.05668v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the Radon-Nikodym Estimator (RNE), a flexible, plug-and-play framework for diffusion inference-time density estimation and control, based on the concept of the density ratio between path distributions. RNE connects and unifies a variety of existing density estimation and inference-time control methods under a single and intuitive perspective, stemming from basic variational inference and probabilistic principles therefore offering both theoretical clarity and practical versatility. Experiments demonstrate that RNE delivers strong results in diffusion density estimation, and offers broad applicability to inference-time control tasks -- such as annealing, diffusion model composition, and reward-tilting -- with promising inference-time scaling performance.</description>

      <title>Towards Physics-informed Diffusion for Anomaly Detection in Trajectories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06999v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given trajectory data, a domain-specific study area, and a user-defined threshold, we aim to find anomalous trajectories indicative of possible GPS spoofing (e.g., fake trajectory). The problem is societally important to curb illegal activities in international waters, such as unauthorized fishing and illicit oil transfers. The problem is challenging due to advances in AI generated in deep fakes generation (e.g., additive noise, fake trajectories) and lack of adequate amount of labeled samples for ground-truth verification. Recent literature shows promising results for anomalous trajectory detection using generative models despite data sparsity. However, they do not consider fine-scale spatiotemporal dependencies and prior physical knowledge, resulting in higher false-positive rates. To address these limitations, we propose a physics-informed diffusion model that integrates kinematic constraints to identify trajectories that do not adhere to physical laws. Experimental results on real-world datasets in the maritime and urban domains show that the proposed framework results in higher prediction accuracy and lower estimation error rate for anomaly detection and trajectory generation methods, respectively. Our implementation is available at https://github.com/arunshar/Physics-Informed-Diffusion-Probabilistic-Model.</description>
