      <title>Real-space Hubbard-corrected density functional theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23612v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an accurate and efficient framework for real-space Hubbard-corrected density functional theory. In particular, we obtain expressions for the energy, atomic forces, and stress tensor suitable for real-space finite-difference discretization, and develop a large-scale parallel implementation. We verify the accuracy of the formalism through comparisons with established planewave results. We demonstrate that the implementation is highly efficient and scalable, outperforming established planewave codes by more than an order of magnitude in minimum time to solution, with increasing advantages as the system size and/or number of processors is increased. We apply this framework to examine the impact of exchange-correlation inconsistency in local atomic orbital generation and introduce a scheme for optimizing the Hubbard parameter based on hybrid functionals, both while studying TiO$_2$ polymorphs.</description>

      <title>Deriving effective electrode-ion interactions from free-energy profiles at electrochemical interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23031v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding ion adsorption at electrified metal-electrolyte interfaces is essential for accurate modeling of electrochemical systems. Here, we systematically investigate the free energy profiles of Na$^+$, Cl$^-$, and F$^-$ ions at the Au(111)-water interface using enhanced sampling molecular dynamics with both classical force fields and machine-learned interatomic potentials (MLIPs). Our classical metadynamics results reveal a strong dependence of predicted ion adsorption on the Lennard-Jones parameters, highlighting that --without due care-- standard mixing rules can lead to qualitatively incorrect descriptions of ion-metal interactions. We present a systematic methodology for tuning the cross-term LJ parameters to control adsorption energetics in agreement with more accurate models. As a surrogate for an ab initio model, we employed the recently released Universal Models for Atoms (UMA) MLIP, which validates classical trends and displays strong specific adsorption for chloride, weak adsorption for fluoride, and no specific adsorption for sodium, in agreement with experimental and theoretical expectations. By integrating molecular-level adsorption free energies into continuum models of the electric double layer, we show that specific ion adsorption substantially alters the interfacial ion population, the potential of zero charge, and the differential capacitance of the system. Our results underscore the critical importance of force field parameterization and advanced interatomic potentials for the predictive modeling of ion-specific effects at electrified interfaces and provide a robust framework for bridging molecular simulations and continuum electrochemical models.</description>

      <title>Extensional rheology of dilute suspensions of spheres in polymeric liquids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23114v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The extensional rheology of dilute suspensions of spheres in viscoelastic or polymeric liquids is studied computationally. At low polymer concentration (c) and Deborah number (De), a wake of highly stretched polymers forms downstream of the particles due to larger local velocity gradients than the imposed flow, indicated by a positive deviation in local De. This increases the suspension's extensional viscosity with time and De for De less than 0.5. When De exceeds 0.5 (the coil-stretch transition), the fully stretched polymers from the far field collapse in regions with lower local velocity gradients around the particle's stagnation points, reducing suspension viscosity relative to the polymer-only liquid. The interaction between local flow and polymers intensifies with increasing c. Highly stretched polymers impede local flow, reducing local De, while it increases in regions with collapsed polymers. Initially, increasing c aligns local De and polymer stretch with far-field values, diminishing particle-polymer interaction effects. However, beyond a certain c, a new mechanism emerges. At low c, fluid three particle radii upstream exhibits increased local De, stretching polymers beyond their undisturbed state. As c increases, this deviation becomes negative, collapsing polymers and resulting in increasingly negative stress from particle-polymer interactions at large De and time. At high c, this negative interaction stress scales as c squared, surpassing the linear increase in polymer stress, making dilute sphere suspensions more effective at reducing the viscosity of viscoelastic liquids at larger De and c.</description>

      <title>Physics-Informed PointNets for Modeling Electromagnetic Scattering from All-Dielectric Metasurfaces with Inclined Nanopillars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23119v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Metasurfaces are innovative planar optical structures capable of manipulating incident light properties. Accurate and computationally efficient modeling of such metasurfaces, particularly those with irregular geometries, remains a challenge for conventional solvers. In this work, we present a mesh-free Physics-Informed PointNet (PIPN) to model electromagnetic scattering from all-dielectric metasurfaces that feature spatially varying nanopillars. Our approach uses the PointNet architecture to directly encode spatially varying material properties into the Physics-Informed Machine Learning (PIML) framework. We demonstrate the generalization capability of our PIPN through evaluations on datasets; these datasets are generated with varying refractive indices representing common dielectric materials. Furthermore, the inclination angles are varied within each dataset, which represent expected manufacturing defects. Overall, our method provides a promising, mesh-free framework for accurate and efficient modeling of complex optical structures represented by irregular geometries.</description>

      <title>AI paradigm for solving differential equations: first-principles data generation and scale-dilation operator AI solver</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23141v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many problems are governed by differential equations (DEs). Artificial intelligence (AI) is a new path for solving DEs. However, data is very scarce and existing AI solvers struggle with approximation of high frequency components (AHFC). We propose an AI paradigm for solving diverse DEs, including DE-ruled first-principles data generation methodology and scale-dilation operator (SDO) AI solver. Using either prior knowledge or random fields, we generate solutions and then substitute them into the DEs to derive the sources and initial/boundary conditions through balancing DEs, thus producing arbitrarily vast amount of, first-principles-consistent training datasets at extremely low computational cost. We introduce a reversible SDO that leverages the Fourier transform of the multiscale solutions to fix AHFC, and design a spatiotemporally coupled, attention-based Transformer AI solver of DEs with SDO. An upper bound on the Hessian condition number of the loss function is proven to be proportional to the squared 2-norm of the solution gradient, revealing that SDO yields a smoother loss landscape, consequently fixing AHFC with efficient training. Extensive tests on diverse DEs demonstrate that our AI paradigm achieves consistently superior accuracy over state-of-the-art methods. This work makes AI solver of DEs to be truly usable in broad nature and engineering fields.</description>

      <title>AC/DC spin current in ferromagnet/superconductor/normal metal trilayer systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23262v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spin pumping with superconductors has been extensively studied, particularly in double-layer systems. In this study, we investigate spin pumping in a trilayer system comprising a ferromagnetic insulator (FMI), a superconductor (SC), and a normal metal (NM). We derive the AC and DC spin currents in the NM layer induced by spin motion in the FMI under circularly polarized microwave irradiation. If we treat the spin motion as classical, the AC spin current is expressed. On the other hand, if we treat the spin motion as quantum quasiparticles, the DC spin current is derived. After these derivations, while the computational cost of evaluating the spin current is extremely high, we mitigate this using the Quantics Tensor Cross Interpolation (QTCI) method. We present numerical results showing the dependence of the spin current on temperature, microwave frequency, and superconductor layer thickness. Notably, the temperature dependence of AC and DC spin currents exhibits a coherence peak. Furthermore, we have discovered a transition structure in the dependence of the spin current on the thickness of the superconductor layer, where the dependence changes after a particular frequency.</description>

      <title>Conical diffraction of the synchrotron beam to probe the efficiency and morphology of blazed gratings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23513v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study explores the use of synchrotron measurements as a nanometrology tool for blazed gratings. In grazing incidence geometry, one can measure both the conical diffraction and the diffuse scattering on the grating simultaneously in a single scattering pattern. The sensitivity of scattering patterns to the structure of the blazed gratings is evaluated. The diffraction component of the pattern is shown to be sensitive to the average groove profile of the gratings. Meanwhile, the diffuse scattering depends on the roughness morphology of the reflective surface of blazed gratings. These findings are supported by numerical simulations. The simulations were performed using several rigorous solvers for the Helmholtz equations, and with a perturbation theory. The analysis relies on synchrotron data, as well as data from atomic force microscopy and scanning electron microscopy. The aim of this article is to draw the attention of the optical community to the synchrotron measurements as a nanometrology tool for the modern optical elements.</description>

      <title>On the time integration for phase field modeling of grain growth in additive manufacturing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.13492v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Phase field simulations play a key role in the understanding of microstructure evolution in additive manufacturing. However, they have been found extremely computationally expensive. One of the reasons is the small time step requirement to resolve the complex microstructure evolution during the rapid solidification process. This paper investigates the possibility of using a class of stabilized time integration algorithms to accelerate such phase field simulations by increasing the time steps. The specific time integration formulation and theoretical analysis on energy stability were developed, based on a phase field model dedicated to simulating rapid solidification in additive manufacturing. The numerical results confirmed that the proposed method can ensure the numerical stability and a decreasing energy requirement for the phase field simulations with at least two orders-of-magnitude larger time steps over conventional explicit methods. 2D and 3D phase field simulations have been conducted with relevant physical and kinetic parameters for 316L stainless steels. This work provides a numerical framework for efficient phase field simulations and open numerous opportunities for large scale phase field modeling.</description>

      <title>Tailored Forecasting from Short Time Series via Meta-learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16325v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine learning models can effectively forecast dynamical systems from time-series data, but they typically require large amounts of past data, making forecasting particularly challenging for systems with limited history. To overcome this, we introduce Meta-learning for Tailored Forecasting using Related Time Series (METAFORS), which generalizes knowledge across systems to enable forecasting in data-limited scenarios. By learning from a library of models trained on longer time series from potentially related systems, METAFORS builds and initializes a model tailored to short time-series data from the system of interest. Using a reservoir computing implementation and testing on simulated chaotic systems, we demonstrate that METAFORS can reliably predict both short-term dynamics and long-term statistics without requiring contextual labels. We see this even when test and related systems exhibit substantially different behaviors, highlighting METAFORS' strengths in data-limited scenarios.</description>

      <title>Recovering Hidden Degrees of Freedom Using Gaussian Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18072v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dimensionality reduction represents a crucial step in extracting meaningful insights from Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations. Conventional approaches, including linear methods such as principal component analysis as well as various autoencoder architectures, typically operate under the assumption of independent and identically distributed data, disregarding the sequential nature of MD simulations. Here, we introduce a physics-informed representation learning framework that leverages Gaussian Processes combined with variational autoencoders to exploit the temporal dependencies inherent in MD data. Time-dependent kernel functions--such as the Mat\'ern kernel--directly impose the temporal correlation structure of the input coordinates onto a low-dimensional space, preserving Markovianity in the reduced representation while faithfully capturing the essential dynamics. Using a three-dimensional toy model, we demonstrate that this approach can successfully identify and separate dynamically distinct states that are geometrically indistinguishable due to hidden degrees of freedom. Applying the framework to a $50\,\mu$s-long MD trajectory of T4 lysozyme, we uncover dynamically distinct conformational substates that previous analyses failed to resolve, revealing functional relationships that become apparent only when temporal correlations are taken into account. This time-aware perspective provides a promising framework for understanding complex biomolecular systems, in which conventional collective variables fail to capture the full dynamical picture.</description>

      <title>Data-parallel leading-order event generation in MadGraph5_aMC@NLO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21039v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The CUDACPP plugin for MadGraph5_aMC@NLO aims to accelerate leading order tree-level event generation by providing the MadEvent event generator with data-parallel helicity amplitudes. These amplitudes are written in templated C++ and CUDA, allowing them to be compiled for CPUs supporting SSE4, AVX2, and AVX-512 instruction sets as well as CUDA- and HIP-enabled GPUs. Using SIMD instruction sets, CUDACPP-generated amplitude routines routines are shown to speed up linearly with SIMD register size, and GPU offloading is shown to provide acceleration beyond that of SIMD instructions. Additionally, the resulting speed-up in event generation perfectly aligns with predictions from measured runtime fractions spent in amplitude routines, and proper GPU utilisation can speed up high-multiplicity QCD processes by an order of magnitude when compared to optimal CPU usage in server-grade CPUs.</description>
