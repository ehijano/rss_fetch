      <title>Mean field equilibrium asset pricing model with habit formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02155v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents an asset pricing model in an incomplete market involving a large number of heterogeneous agents based on the mean field game theory. In the model, we incorporate habit formation in consumption preferences, which has been widely used to explain various phenomena in financial economics. In order to characterize the market-clearing equilibrium, we derive a quadratic-growth mean field backward stochastic differential equation (BSDE) and study its well-posedness and asymptotic behavior in the large population limit. Additionally, we introduce an exponential quadratic Gaussian reformulation of the asset pricing model, in which the solution is obtained in a semi-analytic form.</description>

      <title>Deep Limit Order Book Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09267v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We exploit cutting-edge deep learning methodologies to explore the predictability of high-frequency Limit Order Book mid-price changes for a heterogeneous set of stocks traded on the NASDAQ exchange. In so doing, we release `LOBFrame', an open-source code base to efficiently process large-scale Limit Order Book data and quantitatively assess state-of-the-art deep learning models' forecasting capabilities. Our results are twofold. We demonstrate that the stocks' microstructural characteristics influence the efficacy of deep learning methods and that their high forecasting power does not necessarily correspond to actionable trading signals. We argue that traditional machine learning metrics fail to adequately assess the quality of forecasts in the Limit Order Book context. As an alternative, we propose an innovative operational framework that evaluates predictions' practicality by focusing on the probability of accurately forecasting complete transactions. This work offers academics and practitioners an avenue to make informed and robust decisions on the application of deep learning techniques, their scope and limitations, effectively exploiting emergent statistical properties of the Limit Order Book.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Broker Performance Evaluation through Intraday Modeling of Execution Cost</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18936v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Minimizing execution costs for large orders is a fundamental challenge in finance. Firms often depend on brokers to manage their trades due to limited internal resources for optimizing trading strategies. This paper presents a methodology for evaluating the effectiveness of broker execution algorithms using trading data. We focus on two primary cost components: a linear cost that quantifies short-term execution quality and a quadratic cost associated with the price impact of trades. Using a model with transient price impact, we derive analytical formulas for estimating these costs. Furthermore, we enhance estimation accuracy by introducing novel methods such as weighting price changes based on their expected impact content. Our results demonstrate substantial improvements in estimating both linear and impact costs, providing a robust and efficient framework for selecting the most cost-effective brokers.</description>

      <title>HLOB -- Information Persistence and Structure in Limit Order Books</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18938v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a novel large-scale deep learning model for Limit Order Book mid-price changes forecasting, and we name it `HLOB'. This architecture (i) exploits the information encoded by an Information Filtering Network, namely the Triangulated Maximally Filtered Graph, to unveil deeper and non-trivial dependency structures among volume levels; and (ii) guarantees deterministic design choices to handle the complexity of the underlying system by drawing inspiration from the groundbreaking class of Homological Convolutional Neural Networks. We test our model against 9 state-of-the-art deep learning alternatives on 3 real-world Limit Order Book datasets, each including 15 stocks traded on the NASDAQ exchange, and we systematically characterize the scenarios where HLOB outperforms state-of-the-art architectures. Our approach sheds new light on the spatial distribution of information in Limit Order Books and on its degradation over increasing prediction horizons, narrowing the gap between microstructural modeling and deep learning-based forecasting in high-frequency financial markets.</description>
