      <title>Difference-in-Differences using Double Negative Controls and Graph Neural Networks for Unmeasured Network Confounding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00603v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Estimating causal effects from observational network data faces dual challenges of network interference and unmeasured confounding. To address this, we propose a general Difference-in-Differences framework that integrates double negative controls (DNC) and graph neural networks (GNNs). Based on the modified parallel trends assumption and DNC, semiparametric identification of direct and indirect causal effects is established. We then propose doubly robust estimators. Specifically, an approach combining GNNs with the generalized method of moments is developed to estimate the functions of high-dimensional covariates and network structure. Furthermore, we derive the estimator's asymptotic normality under the $\psi$-network dependence and approximate neighborhood interference. Simulations show the finite-sample performance of our estimators. Finally, we apply our method to analyze the impact of China's green credit policy on corporate green innovation.</description>

      <title>Continuous time asymptotic representations for adaptive experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00739v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article develops a continuous-time asymptotic framework for analyzing adaptive experiments -- settings in which data collection and treatment assignment evolve dynamically in response to incoming information. A key challenge in analyzing fully adaptive experiments, where the assignment policy is updated after each observation, is that the sequence of policy rules often lack a well-defined asymptotic limit. To address this, we focus instead on the empirical allocation process, which captures the fraction of observations assigned to each treatment over time. We show that, under general conditions, any adaptive experiment and its associated empirical allocation process can be approximated by a limit experiment defined by Gaussian diffusions with unknown drifts and a corresponding continuous-time allocation process. This limit representation facilitates the analysis of optimal decision rules by reducing the dimensionality of the state-space and leveraging the tractability of Gaussian diffusions. We apply the framework to derive optimal estimators, analyze in-sample regret for adaptive experiments, and construct e-processes for anytime-valid inference. Notably, we introduce the first definition of any-time and any-experiment valid inference for multi-treatment settings.</description>

      <title>The general solution to an autoregressive law of motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.01966v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide a complete description of the set of all solutions to a vector autoregressive law of motion. Every solution is shown to be the sum of three components, each corresponding to a directed flow of time. One component flows forward from the arbitrarily distant past; one flows backward from the arbitrarily distant future; and one flows outward from time zero. The three components are obtained by applying three complementary spectral projections to the solution, these corresponding to a separation of the eigenvalues of the autoregressive coefficient matrix according to whether they are inside, outside or on the unit circle. We establish a one-to-one correspondence between the set of all solutions and a finite-dimensional space of initial conditions.</description>

      <title>General Equilibrium Amplification and Crisis Vulnerability: Cross-Crisis Evidence from Global Banks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24775v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper develops a continuous framework for analyzing financial contagion that incorporates both geographic proximity and interbank network linkages. The framework characterizes stress propagation through a master equation whose solution admits a Feynman-Kac representation as expected cumulative stress along stochastic paths through spatial-network space. From this representation, I derive the General Equilibrium Amplification Factor -- a structural measure of systemic importance that captures the ratio of total system-wide effects to direct effects following a localized shock. The amplification factor decomposes naturally into spatial, network, and interaction components, revealing which transmission channels contribute most to each institution's systemic importance. The framework nests discrete cascade models as a limiting case when jump intensity becomes infinite above default thresholds, clarifying that continuous and discrete approaches describe different regimes of the same phenomenon. Empirical validation using 38 global banks across the 2008 financial crisis and COVID-19 pandemic demonstrates that the amplification factor correctly identifies systemically important institutions (Pearson correlation $\rho = -0.450$, $p = 0.080$ between amplification factor and crisis drawdowns) and predicts crisis outcomes out-of-sample ($\rho = -0.352$ for COVID-19). Robustness analysis using cumulative abnormal returns -- a measure more directly connected to the Feynman-Kac integral -- strengthens these findings ($\rho = -0.512$, $p = 0.042$). Time-series analysis confirms that average pairwise bank correlations track macroeconomic stress indicators ($\rho = 0.265$ with VIX, $p &lt; 0.001$). Comparing the two crises reveals that COVID-19 produced a sharper correlation spike (+93%) despite smaller equity losses, reflecting different contagion dynamics for exogenous versus endogenous shocks.</description>
