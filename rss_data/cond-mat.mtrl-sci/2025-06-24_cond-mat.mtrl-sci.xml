      <title>CLOUD: A Scalable and Physics-Informed Foundation Model for Crystal Representation Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17345v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The prediction of crystal properties is essential for understanding structure-property relationships and accelerating the discovery of functional materials. However, conventional approaches relying on experimental measurements or density functional theory (DFT) calculations are often resource-intensive, limiting their scalability. Machine learning (ML) models offer a promising alternative by learning complex structure-property relationships from data, enabling faster predictions. Yet, existing ML models often rely on labeled data, adopt representations that poorly capture essential structural characteristics, and lack integration with physical principles--factors that limit their generalizability and interpretability. Here, we introduce CLOUD (Crystal Language mOdel for Unified and Differentiable materials modeling), a transformer-based framework trained on a novel Symmetry-Consistent Ordered Parameter Encoding (SCOPE) that encodes crystal symmetry, Wyckoff positions, and composition in a compact, coordinate-free string representation. Pre-trained on over six million crystal structures, CLOUD is fine-tuned on multiple downstream tasks and achieves competitive performance in predicting a wide range of material properties, demonstrating strong scaling performance. Furthermore, as proof of concept of differentiable materials modeling, CLOUD is applied to predict the phonon internal energy and heat capacity, which integrates the Debye model to preserve thermodynamic consistency. The CLOUD-DEBYE framework enforces thermodynamic consistency and enables temperature-dependent property prediction without requiring additional data. These results demonstrate the potential of CLOUD as a scalable and physics-informed foundation model for crystalline materials, unifying symmetry-consistent representations with physically grounded learning for property prediction and materials discovery.</description>

      <title>Electron beam irradiation-induced transport and recombination in p-type Gallium Oxide grown on (001) \b{eta}-Ga2O3 substrate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17398v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates minority electron diffusion length and carrier recombination phenomena within p-type, 300 nm-thick Ga2O3 epitaxial films. Utilizing Electron Beam-Induced Current (EBIC) and Cathodoluminescence (CL) spectroscopy, these characteristics were examined as a function of both temperature and the duration of electron beam excitation. While the electron diffusion length in these p-Ga2O3 films diminish with increasing temperature, a continuous electron beam excitation of a particular location on the surface of a p-Ga2O3 epitaxial layer leads to an elongation of the diffusion length. and decay of cathodoluminescence intensity in that location under beam exposure. These latter two effects are attributed to non-equilibrium electrons, generated by an electron beam, being captured at acceptor-related point defect levels in Gallium Oxide. The activation energies characterizing these processes were obtained from the independent EBIC and CL experiments to garner insight into defect landscape and its influence on transport and recombination dynamics.</description>

      <title>Tunable symmetry breaking in a hexagonal-stacked moir\'e magnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Symmetry plays a central role in defining magnetic phases, making tunable symmetry breaking across magnetic transitions highly desirable for discovering non-trivial magnetism. Magnetic moir\'e superlattices, formed by twisting two-dimensional (2D) magnetic crystals, have been theoretically proposed and experimentally explored as platforms for unconventional magnetic states. However, despite recent advances, tuning symmetry breaking in moir\'e magnetism remains limited, as twisted 2D magnets, such as rhombohedral (R)-stacked twisted CrI_3, largely inherit the magnetic properties and symmetries of their constituent layers. Here, in hexagonal-stacked twisted double bilayer (H-tDB) CrI_3, we demonstrate clear symmetry evolution as the twist angle increases from 180^{\circ} to 190^{\circ}. While the net magnetization remains zero across this twist angle range, the magnetic phase breaks only the three-fold rotational symmetry at 180^{\circ}, but it breaks all of the rotational, mirror, and time-reversal symmetries at intermediate twist angles between 181^{\circ} and 185^{\circ}, and all broken symmetries are recovered at 190^{\circ}. These pronounced symmetry breakings at intermediate twist angles are accompanied by metamagnetic behaviors, evidenced by symmetric double hysteresis loops around zero magnetic field. Together, these results reveal that H-tDB CrI_3 at intermediate twist angles host a distinct moir\'e magnetic phase, featuring periodic in-plane spin textures with broken rotational, mirror, and time-reversal symmetries, which is markedly different from the out-of-plane layered antiferromagnetism in bilayer CrI_3 and the predominantly out-of-plane moir\'e magnetism in R-tDB CrI_3. Our work establishes H-stacked CrI_3 moir\'e magnets as a versatile platform for engineering magnetic properties, including and likely beyond complex spin textures.</description>

      <title>A Morphologically Self-Consistent Phase Field Model for the Computational Study of Memristive Thin Film Current-Voltage Hysteresis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17421v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A multiphysics phase field model is used for the computational study of memristive thin film morphology and current-voltage hysteresis. In contrast to previous computational methods, no requirements are made on conducting filament geometry. Our method correctly predicts conducting filaments evolve on thermodynamic paths that are energetically favored due to stochastic structural and chemical variations naturally occurring at the atomic-level, due to both latent and intentional fabrication effects. These results have significant implications for the computational design of a broad class of memristive thin films, enabling practical wafer-scale mapping, uniformity, and endurance analysis and optimization.</description>

      <title>Single crystalline orthorhombic GdAlGe as a rare earth magnetic Dirac nodal-line metal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17502v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Crystal engineering is a method for discovering new quantum materials and phases, which may be achieved by external pressure or strain. Chemical pressure is unique in that it generates internal pressure perpetually to the lattice. As an example, GdAlSi from the rare-earth ($R$) $R$Al$X$ ($X =$ Si or Ge) family of Weyl semimetals is considered. Replacing Si with the larger isovalent element Ge creates sufficiently large chemical pressure to induce a structural transition from the tetragonal structure of GdAlSi, compatible with a Weyl semimetallic state, to an orthorhombic phase in GdAlGe, resulting in an inversion-symmetry-protected nodal-line metal. We find that GdAlGe hosts an antiferromagnetic ground state with two successive orderings, at $T_\mathrm{N1}$ = 35 K and $T_\mathrm{N2}$ = 30 K. In-plane isothermal magnetization shows a magnetic field induced metamagnetic transition at 6.2 T for 2 K. Furthermore, electron-hole compensation gives rise to a large magnetoresistance of $\sim 100\%$ at 2 K and 14 T. Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy measurements and density functional theory calculations reveal a Dirac-like linear band dispersion over an exceptionally large energy range of $\sim$ 1.5 eV with a high Fermi velocity of $\sim 10^6$ m/s, a rare feature not observed in any magnetic topological materials.</description>

      <title>On the Photoluminescence Theory in Nanocrystalline Silicon: A New Improvement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17515v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Silicon has long been the foundational semiconductor material for a broad range of electronic devices, owing to its numerous advantages: wide natural availability, ease of synthesis in both crystalline and amorphous forms, and relatively low production cost. However, despite these benefits, silicon is inherently limited in the field of optoelectronics due to its indirect bandgap, which results in low quantum efficiency for light emission, typically in the infrared region. One promising strategy to address this limitation is the development of nanocrystalline silicon, which consists of low-dimensional nanostructures such as quantum wires (QWs) and quantum dots (QDs). These structures exhibit enhanced photoluminescence and electroluminescence, primarily due to quantum confinement of excitons within the conduction and valence bands, leading to significantly improved quantum efficiency. Although research into these processes has spanned several decades, a definitive consensus on the mechanisms underlying photoluminescent emission in nanocrystalline silicon remains elusive. This work reviews two leading theoretical models proposed to explain this phenomenon and introduces a new, more comprehensive model that may provide a deeper and more accurate understanding of photoluminescence in nanocrystalline silicon. The new theory is applied in a case study.</description>

      <title>Large volume 'chunk' lift out for 3D tomographic analysis using analytical plasma focussed ion beam -- scanning electron microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17534v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Characterization of the structure and properties of materials in three dimensions, including grains and the residual pattern of deformation, provides necessary information required to guide materials design as well as support materials modelling efforts. In this work, we present an overview of site-specific large volume 'chunk' lift out and 3D serial sectioning of substantive volumes (e.g. 200 x 200 x 400 um3), where sectioning is optimized for 3D electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) based crystallographic analysis, using a plasma (Xe) focussed ion beam scanning electron microscope (plasma FIB-SEM) equipped to perform EBSD using a 'static' configuration (i.e. slicing and EBSD-mapping are performed without moving the sample). This workflow is demonstrated through the 3D plasma FIB-SEM based EBSD analysis of an indent made within a polycrystal of pure magnesium. The lift out approach is suitable for a wide range of materials, and we offer a step-by-step guide within the present work to provide opportunity for others to more easily enter this field and collect valuable data.</description>

      <title>Toward a Circular Nanotechnology for Biofuels: Integrating Sustainable Synthesis, Recovery, and Performance Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This review exhaustively evaluates the role of nanomaterials across synthesis, characterization and application stages of biofuel systems. The common types of nanomaterials that are used for biofuel applications include metal oxides, carbon-based structures, and hybrids are evaluated for their effectiveness in efficient biofuel production. The properties of such nanomaterials are being utilized as an aid to produce biofuels through improved catalysis, enzyme immobilization and thermal stability. Common synthesis methods such as sol-gel, co-precipitation, and green synthesis are compared, alongside characterization tools like TEM, SEM, FTIR, and BET. This study focuses on transesterification, biomass pretreatment, and fermentation processes, where nanomaterials significantly improve yield and reusability. There are several challenges despite the merit of using nanomaterials, the tradeoffs include costs, scalability, and environmental impact, which further expands into evaluating the life cycle of such materials being used. This review outlines the practical potential of the nanomaterials in enabling more efficient and sustainable biofuel production.</description>

      <title>Brightening dark trions in WS2 monolayers via introducing atomic sulfur vacancies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the effects of atomic defects on the optical functionality of two-dimensional (2D) layered materials is critical to develop novel optical and optoelectronic applications of these ultimate materials. Herein, we correlate sulfur vacancies (VS) and luminescence properties of dark trions in monolayer WS2 through introducing VS defects and conducting a systematic optical spectroscopic characterization at cryogenic and room temperatures. It is unraveled that the VS defects can brighten the dark trions via introducing a stronger spin-orbit coupling due to the space inversion symmetry broken by the defects. Furthermore, the wavefunction localization of the dark trions bound at VS defects results in significant enhancement of the phonon scattering from the K2 valley phonons and hence makes the K2 phonon replica dominant in the emission spectrum. Theoretical calculations of the temperature-dependent photoluminescence spectra with quantum mechanics-based multimode Brownian oscillator model show strong support for the above arguments. Brightening the dark excitons not only sheds light on the understanding of the intriguing excitonic properties of 2D semiconductors, but also may open a way for regulating the optoelectronic performance of two-dimensional semiconductors.</description>

      <title>Resolving the Ti-V Phase Diagram Discrepancy with First-Principles Calculations and Bayesian Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17719v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conflicting experiments disagree on whether the titanium-vanadium (Ti-V) binary alloy exhibits a body-centred cubic (BCC) miscibility gap or remains completely soluble. A leading hypothesis attributes the miscibility gap to oxygen contamination during alloy preparation. To resolve this controversy, we use an ab initio + machine-learning workflow that couples an actively-trained Moment Tensor Potential to Bayesian thermodynamic inference. Using this workflow, we obtain Ti-V binary system across the entire composition range, together with confidence intervals in the thermodynamic limit. The resulting diagram reproduces all experimental features, demonstrating the robustness of our approach, and clearly favors the variant with a BCC miscibility gap terminating at T = 980 K and c = 0.67. Because oxygen was excluded from simulations, the gap cannot be attributed to impurity effects, contradicting recent CALPHAD reassessments.</description>

      <title>Atomic layer deposition on particulate materials from 1988 through 2023: A quantitative review of technologies, materials and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17725v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Atomic layer deposition (ALD) is widely studied for numerous applications and is commercially employed in the semiconductor industry, where planar substrates are the norm. However, the inherent ALD feature of coating virtually any surface geometry with atomistic thickness control is equally attractive for coating particulate materials (supports). In this review, we provide a comprehensive overview of the developments in this decades-old field of ALD on particulate materials, drawing on a bottom-up and quantitative analysis of 799 articles from this field. The obtained dataset is the basis for abstractions regarding reactor types (specifically for particles), coating materials, reactants, supports and processing conditions. Furthermore, the dataset enables direct access to specific processing conditions (for a given material, surface functionality, application etc.) and increases accessibility of the respective literature. We also review fundamental concepts of ALD on particles, and discuss the most common applications, i.e., catalysis (thermo-, electro-, photo-), batteries, luminescent phosphors and healthcare. Finally, we identify historical trends, and provide an outlook on prospective developments.</description>

      <title>Room-temperature intrinsic nonlinear planar Hall effect in TaIrTe4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17730v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intrinsic responses are of paramount importance in physics research, as they represent the inherent properties of materials, independent of extrinsic factors that vary from sample to sample, and often reveal the intriguing quantum geometry of the band structure. Here, we report the experimental discovery of a new intrinsic response in charge transport, specifically the intrinsic nonlinear planar Hall effect (NPHE), in the topological semimetal TaIrTe4. This effect is characterized by an induced Hall current that is quadratic in the driving electric field and linear in the in-plane magnetic field. The response coefficient is determined by the susceptibility tensor of Berry-connection polarizability dipole, which is an intrinsic band geometric quantity. Remarkably, the signal persists up to room temperature. Our theoretical calculations show excellent agreement with the experimental results and further elucidate the significance of a previously unknown orbital mechanism in intrinsic NPHE. This finding not only establishes a novel intrinsic material property but also opens a new route toward innovative nonlinear devices capable of operating at room temperature.</description>

      <title>Residual Connection-Enhanced ConvLSTM for Lithium Dendrite Growth Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17756v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growth of lithium dendrites significantly impacts the performance and safety of rechargeable batteries, leading to short circuits and capacity degradation. This study proposes a Residual Connection-Enhanced ConvLSTM model to predict dendrite growth patterns with improved accuracy and computational efficiency. By integrating residual connections into ConvLSTM, the model mitigates the vanishing gradient problem, enhances feature retention across layers, and effectively captures both localized dendrite growth dynamics and macroscopic battery behavior. The dataset was generated using a phase-field model, simulating dendrite evolution under varying conditions. Experimental results show that the proposed model achieves up to 7% higher accuracy and significantly reduces mean squared error (MSE) compared to conventional ConvLSTM across different voltage conditions (0.1V, 0.3V, 0.5V). This highlights the effectiveness of residual connections in deep spatiotemporal networks for electrochemical system modeling. The proposed approach offers a robust tool for battery diagnostics, potentially aiding in real-time monitoring and optimization of lithium battery performance. Future research can extend this framework to other battery chemistries and integrate it with real-world experimental data for further validation</description>

      <title>Ab initio calculation of electronic band structure of Cd$_{1-x}$Fe$_x$Se</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17794v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The purpose of this work was to calculate the electronic band structure of Cd$_{1-x}$Fe$_x$Se. Ab-initio, calculations are performed in the Atomistix Toolkit program within the Density Functional Theory and Local Spin Density Approximation on Tight Tiger basis. We have used Hubbard U potential $U_{Fe} = 2.42$eV for 3d states for Fe ions. Super-cells of 8 and 64 atoms were constructed. After the construction of Cd$_{1-x}$Fe$_x$Se ($x=$ 6.25%; 25%) super-cells, atom relaxation and optimization of the crystal structure were carried out. Electronic band structure,and density of states were calculated, and total energy have been defined in antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic phases. The band gap for the Cd$_{1-x}$Fe$_x$Se, $x=0.06$ in ferromagnetic phase is equal to $E_g=1.77$ eV, in antiferromagnetic phase $E_g=1.78$ eV. For $x=0.25$, $E_g=1.92$ eV. Antiferromagnetic phase considered more stable. Our calculations show that the band gap increases with the increases in Fe ion concentration.</description>

      <title>CLAMM: a spin CLuster expansion--Monte Carlo toolkit for Alloys and Magnetic Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17800v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Finite-temperature magnetism gives rise to many phenomena in alloy materials, such as magnetic phase transformations, short or medium range order in magnetic alloys, spin waves, critical phenomena, and the magnetocaloric effect. Lattice models, such as the Ising, Potts, cluster expansion, and magnetic cluster expansion models, are powerful tools for studying complex magnetic alloys and compounds. In this paper we introduce CLAMM, which is a new open source toolkit for developing custom lattice models from density functional theory (DFT) data sets. The toolkit is comprised of three main components. The first component is CLAMM_Prep, a python tool that converts data sets consisting of the Vienna Ab-initio Simulation Package (VASP) DFT simulations into a compact format. The second component, CLAMM_Fit, is also python-based and uses the compact data set to parameterize a lattice model, chosen from a set of available options (cluster expansion, Ising, and others). The third component is CLAMM_MC, which is a C++ Monte Carlo solver for generating ensembles of configurations, accounting for both magnetic and alloy configurational entropies, at different temperatures. These ensembles and their analysis can be used for simulating phase transformations and constructing phase diagrams. The code can also be used for generating special quasi-random structures and structures with user-defined short-range order. This document provides a comprehensive overview of each CLAMM tool in order to demonstrate CLAMM's potential for the computational materials community.</description>

      <title>Boosting biocompatibility and mechanical property evolution in a high-entropy alloy via nanostructure engineering and phase transformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17849v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-entropy alloys (HEAs), as multi-component materials with high configurational entropy, have garnered significant attention as new biomaterials; still, their low yield stress and high elastic modulus need to be overcome for future biomedical applications. In this study, nanograin generation is used to enhance the strength and phase transformation is employed to reduce the elastic modulus of a biocompatible Ti-Zr-Hf-Nb-Ta-based HEA. The alloy is treated via the high-pressure torsion (HPT) process, leading to (i) a BCC (body-centered cubic) to omega phase transformation with [101]{\omega}//[011]BCC and [211]omega//[121]BCC through a twining mechanism, (ii) nanograin formation with a mean grain size of 20 nm, and (iii) dislocation generation particularly close to BCC-omega interphase boundaries. These structural and microstructural features enhance hardness, increase tensile strength up to 2130 MPa, achieve tensile elongation exceeding 13%, reduce elastic modulus down to 69 GPa and improve biocompatibility. Additionally, the HEA exhibits improved anodization, resulting in a homogenous distribution of oxide nanotubes on the surface with a smaller tube diameter and a higher tube length compared to pure titanium. These remarkable properties, which are engineered by the generation of defective nanograins and the co-existence of BCC and metastable omega phases, highlight the potential of HEAs treated using severe plastic deformation for future biomedical usage, particularly in the orthopedic sector.</description>

      <title>Computational Discovery of Metastable NaMnO$_2$ Polymorphs as High-Performance Cathodes with Ultralow Na$^+$ Migration Barriers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17866v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using an ab initio evolutionary algorithm combined with first-principles calculations, two metastable NaMnO$_2$ polymorphs, $I4_1/amd$ and Cmcm, are identified as promising cathode materials for sodium-ion batteries. Both phases exhibit excellent thermodynamic stability, lying within 35~meV/atom of the ground-state \textit{Pmmn} phase across 0--50~GPa, and are dynamically and thermally stable under ambient conditions following high-pressure synthesis, as confirmed by phonon and ab initio molecular dynamics simulations. During desodiation, a Jahn--Teller-induced magnetic transition enhances Mn--O hybridization, reduces the bandgap, and promotes robust charge compensation and oxygen retention. Remarkably, the Cmcm phase achieves record-low Na$^+$ migration barriers (0.39~eV at high Na concentration; 0.27~eV at low concentration), representing 47\% and 36\% reductions respectively compared to conventional $C2/m$, while delivering a higher average voltage (3.19~V vs 2.88~V). The $I4_1/amd$ phase exhibits concentration-dependent diffusion with a low-energy pathway (0.38~eV) and maintains competitive voltage (2.94~V). These findings suggest that metastable NaMnO$_2$ polymorphs may offer viable alternatives to conventional cathode materials, particularly where fast ionic conduction is required.</description>

      <title>Stacking-Dependent Electronic Properties in GaSe/GaTe Heterobilayers: A First-Principles Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17928v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we use first-principles calculations to investigate the stacking-dependent electronic properties of GaSe/GaTe van der Waals heterobilayers. By analyzing five representative stacking configurations--AA, AA$'$, A$'$C, A$'$B, and AB--we show that interlayer atomic registry affects orbital hybridization and interfacial interactions, leading to distinct electronic structures and stabilities. Projected density of states analyses reveal valence and conduction band edges arise from orbitals localized in different layers, confirming a type-II band alignment that facilitates spatial charge separation. Orbital contributions and spectral features vary with stacking, reflecting how interlayer coupling modulates hybridization and electronic behavior. This study provides atomic-level insights for designing and optimizing layered heterostructures in nanoelectronic devices.</description>

      <title>Exploring the impact of Ti/Al on L12 nanoprecipitation and deformation behavior in CoNiFeAlTi multi-principal element alloys through atomistic simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17984v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent studies on CoNi-based multi-principal element alloys (MPEAs) have demonstrated high strength and ductility, attributed to the formation of stable L12 nanoscale precipitates. However, the fundamental mechanisms behind such impressive properties in these complex alloys are not well understood. In this work, we investigate the effects of Ti and Al concentrations on the formation of L12 precipitates in (CoNiFe)84(Al8Ti8), (CoNiFe)86(Al7Ti7), (CoNiFe)88(Al6Ti6), and (CoNiFe)94(Al4Ti2) MPEAs using hybrid molecular dynamics/Monte Carlo (MD/MC) simulations and a MEAM interatomic potential for the CoNiFeTiAl system. Additionally, we study the effect of L12 precipitation on the mechanical properties and stacking fault energy (SFE) of these MPEAs using MD. Our hybrid MD/MC simulations show that the (CoNiFe)86(Al7Ti7) alloy exhibits the highest amount of L12 nanoprecipitates. We find that L12 precipitation increases the SFE, with higher Al and Ti contents leading to greater increases. Tensile simulations reveal that L12 precipitates enhance yield strength, with alloys exhibiting higher precipitation showing increased flow stress. We also investigate dislocation-nanoprecipitate interactions with different precipitate sizes in the (CoNiFe)86(Al7Ti7) alloy. Larger nanoprecipitate sizes result in stronger dislocation pinning. Dislocations predominantly shear through 4-8 nm precipitates instead of looping around them (Orowan mechanism), enhancing strength while maintaining good ductility. Although the lattice mismatch between the L12 nanoprecipitate and the matrix is low (0.139%), the significant difference in SFE between the L12 nanoprecipitate and the matrix results in stronger dislocation pinning. This understanding can guide the design of MPEAs with tailored properties by controlling nanoscale precipitation.</description>

      <title>Nanoscale imaging of reduced forward bias at V-pits in green-emitting nitride LEDs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18025v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Record wall-plug efficiencies in long-wavelength, nitride light-emitting diodes (LEDs) have recently been achieved in devices containing high V-pit densities. Numerical modeling suggests this may be due to improved electrical efficiencies (EE). In order to test this proposition, a novel scanning tunneling luminescence microscope (STLM) is used to map the local optoelectronic properties of commercial, green-emitting LED heterostructures around V-pits with nanoscale spatial resolution. Using the STLM tip as the hole injector, injection at the lips of V-pits is found to be drastically different from injection on the heterostructure's c-plane. A $\approx$ 3-fold improvement in internal quantum efficiency near V-pits is observed at low injection, and at higher injection a $\approx$1.75 V reduction in the forward bias unambiguously confirms the EE hypothesis for hole injection.</description>

      <title>Enhanced UV Photodetector Efficiency with a ZnO/Ga$_2$O$_3$ Heterojunction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Heterostructures comprising uncoated ZnO and coated with thin layers of Ga$_2$O$_3$ were produced using spin-coating and subsequent hydrothermal processing. X-ray diffraction examination verifies the structural integrity of the synthesized heterostructures (HTs). Optical and photoluminescence spectra were recorded to assess the variation in absorption and emission of the Ga$_2$O$_3$-coated HTs in comparison to the pristine ZnO. We conducted comparative density-functional theory (DFT) computations to corroborate the measured band gaps of both categories of HTs. To assess the stability of our devices, the transient response to on/off light switching under zero bias has been studied. The rise time $\tau_{r1}$ ($\tau_{r2}$) is 2300 (500) ms and the decay time $\tau_{d1}$ ($\tau_{d2}$) is 2700 (5000) ms have been observed for bare ZnO and ZnO/Ga$_2$O$_3$ HTs, respectively. A significant amount of change was also observed in the electrical transport properties from bare ZnO to ZnO/Ga$_2$O$_3$. To see the performance of device, responsivity (R) and detectivity (D = 1/NEP$_B$) have been measured. It is evident from observation that responsivity of a device shows maximum value in UV region while it is reducing with visible region for HTs. In case of detectivity, the maximum value reached was $145 \times 10^{14}$ Hz$^{1/2}$/W (at ~ 200 nm) and $38 \times 10^{14}$ Hz$^{1/2}$/W (at 300 nm) for Ga$_2$O$_3$ coated ZnO, and bare ZnO HTs, respectively. The maximum responsivity measured for the bare ZnO HTs is 7 (A/W) while that of Ga$_2$O$_3$ coated ZnO HTs is 38 (A/W). It suggests a simple way of designing materials for fabricating broad-range cost-effective photodetectors.</description>

      <title>Nitrogen Vacancies Induce Fatigue in Ferroelectric $\mathrm{Al_{0.93}B_{0.07}N}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wurtzite ferroelectrics (e.g., $\mathrm{Al_{0.93}B_{0.07}N}$) are being explored for high-temperature and emerging near-, or in-compute, memory architectures due to the material advantages offered by their large remanent polarization and robust chemical stability. Despite these advantages, current $\mathrm{Al_{0.93}B_{0.07}N}$ devices do not have sufficient endurance lifetime to meet roadmap targets. To identify the defects responsible for this limited endurance, a combination of electronic measurements and optical spectroscopies characterized the evolution of defect states within $\mathrm{Al_{0.93}B_{0.07}N}$ with cycling. Ultrathin ($\sim$10 nm) metal contacts were used to optically probe regions subject to ferroelectric switching; photoluminescence spectroscopy identified the emergence of a transition near 2.1 eV whose intensity scaled with the non-switching polarization quantified via positive-up negative-down (PUND) measurements. Accompanying thermally stimulated depolarization current (TSDC) and modulus spectroscopy measurements also observed the strengthening of a state near 2.1 eV. The origin of this feature is ascribed to transitions between a nitrogen vacancy and another defect deeper in the bandgap. Recognizing that the impurity concentration is largely fixed, strengthening of this transition indicates an increase in the number of nitrogen vacancies. Switching, therefore, creates vacancies in $\mathrm{Al_{0.93}B_{0.07}N}$ likely due to hot-atom damage induced by the aggressive fields necessary to switch wurtzite materials that ultimately limits endurance.</description>

      <title>Beyond-quasiparticles transport with vertex correction: self-consistent ladder formalism for electron-phonon interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a self-consistent many-body framework for computing phonon-limited electronic transport from first principles, incorporating both beyond-quasiparticle effects and vertex corrections. Using the recently developed first-principles scGD0 method, we calculate spectral functions with nonperturbative effects such as broadening, satellites, and energy-dependent renormalization. We show that the scGD0 spectral functions outperform one-shot G0D0 and cumulant approximations in model Hamiltonians and real materials, eliminating unphysical spectral kinks and correctly predicting the phonon emission continuum. Building on this, we introduce the self-consistent ladder formalism for transport, which captures vertex corrections due to electron-phonon interactions. This approach unifies and improves upon the two state-of-the-art approaches for first-principles phonon-limited transport: the bubble approximation and the Boltzmann transport equation. Moreover, as a charge-conserving approximation, it enables consistent calculations of the optical conductivity and dielectric function. We validate the developed method against numerically exact results for model Hamiltonians and apply it to real materials. Our results show quantitative agreement with the experimental dc conductivities in intrinsic semiconductors Si and ZnO and the SrVO3 metal, as well as excellent agreement with the experimental THz optical and dielectric properties of Si and ZnO. This work unifies first-principles and many-body approaches for studying transport, opening new directions for applying many-body theory to materials with strong electron-phonon interactions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.18152v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the synthesis of novel magnetic materials via hydroflux synthesis, a method that combines flux-based and hydrothermal techniques. Single crystals of three novel alkali tellurate oxide-hydroxides were synthesized. One, CsTeO$_3$(OH), is nonmagnetic and a new member of the series ATeO$_3$(OH) (A = alkali). The other two phases contain magnetic Cu-Te sublattices, one of which, KCu$_2$Te$_3$O$_{8}$(OH), is structurally three-dimensional and undergoes several magnetic ordering transitions; the other, Cs$_2$Cu$_3$Te$_2$O$_{10}$, is structurally two-dimensional and remains paramagnetic above T = 2K. These exploratory investigations of novel phase spaces reveal key factors including hydroxide concentration, precursor solubility, and oxidizing power of the solution which govern the formation and composition of alkali tellurate oxide-hydroxides.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast scintillating metal-organic frameworks films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18214v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Compositionally engineered metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have been designed and used to fabricate ultrafast scintillating films with emission in both the UV and visible regions. The inclusion of hafnium (Hf) ions in the nodes of the MOF increases the interaction cross-section with ionizing radiation, partially compensating for the low density of the porous material and dramatically increasing the system scintillation yield. The high diffusivity of bimolecular excitons within the framed conjugated ligands allows bimolecular annihilation processes between excited states that partially quench the MOF luminescence, resulting in ultrafast scintillation pulses under X-ray excitation with kinetics in the hundreds of picoseconds time scale. Despite the quenching, the gain in scintillation yield achieved by incorporating Hf ions is large enough to maintain the light yield of the films above 104 ph/MeV under soft X-rays. These unprecedented high efficiencies and simultaneous ultrafast emission kinetics obtained at room temperature in a technologically attractive solid-state configuration, together with the versatility of its composition allowing for further application-specific modifications, place the MOF platform in a prominent position for the realization of the next generation of ultrafast scintillation counters for high-energy physics studies and medical imaging applications.</description>

      <title>Doping-induced Polyamorphic Transitions in Fluorite Oxides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fluorite oxides such as HfO$_2$ exhibit rich and tunable phase behavior, making them promising candidates for next generation electronic devices. A key challenge is to design amorphous HfO$_2$-based high-$k$ materials with both structural and performance stability. Here, using molecular dynamics simulations supported by experimental measurements, we reveal that Ba doping stimulates a polyamorphic transition in HfO$_2$, yielding a semi-ordered amorphous (SA) phase characterized by disordered oxygens embedded within an ordered metal sublattice. We find that this phase arises from degenerate short-range symmetry breaking modes, consistent with Pauling's parsimony rule. Notably, the SA structure is thermodynamically stable and displays a wider bandgap and higher dielectric constant than conventional random-packing amorphous structure, owing to suppressed subgap states and increased Born effective charges. We further demonstrate that this structural motif generalizes to Ba-, Sr-, and Ca-doped HfO$_2$ and ZrO$_2$, establishing a broadly applicable strategy for designing high-performance amorphous dielectrics.</description>

      <title>Wide-field Hyperspectral Optical Microscopy for Rapid Characterization of Two-Dimensional Semiconductors and Heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18342v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electronic and optoelectronic applications of two-dimensional (2D) semiconductors demand precise control over material quality, including thickness, composition, doping, and defect density. Conventional benchmarking methods (e.g., charge transport, confocal mapping, electron or scanning probe microscopy) are slow, perturb sample quality, or involve trade-offs between speed, resolution, and scan area. To accelerate assessment of 2D semiconductors, we demonstrate a broadband, wide-field hyperspectral optical microscope for 2D materials (2D-HOM) that rapidly captures a spatial-spectral data cube within seconds. The data cube includes x-y spatial coordinate (a 300 * 300 $\mu\mathrm{m}^2$ field, with ~ 1 $\mu\mathrm{m}$ resolution) and a selectable wavelength range between 1100 to 200 nm at each pixel. Using synthesized films and heterostructures of transition metal dichalcogenides ($\mathrm{MoS}_{2}$, $\mathrm{WS}_{2}$, $\mathrm{V}_{x}\mathrm{W}_{1-x}\mathrm{S}_{2}$, and $\mathrm{WSe}_{2}$), we show that this cost-effective technique detects spectral fingerprints of material identity, doping, grain boundaries, and alloy composition, and enables advanced analysis, including unsupervised machine learning for spatial segmentation.</description>

      <title>Optical Excitations of Flat Bands Induced by Exciton Condensation in Ta$_2$Pd$_3$Te$_{5}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on the charge dynamics of Ta$_2$Pd$_3$Te$_5$ using temperature-dependent optical spectroscopy with polarized light. We observe a metal-insulator transition characterized by the collapse of Drude response and the emergence of sharp and narrow absorption peaks at low temperatures. Unlike previous excitonic insulator candidates such as TiSe$_2$ and Ta$_2$NiSe$_5$, where the excitonic order is intertwined with charge density wave or structural instabilities, the sharp features in Ta$_2$Pd$_3$Te$_5$ point to intrinsic excitonic excitations associated with ultra-flat bands driven by many-body renormalization of the band structure via spontaneous exciton condensation. Our findings thus provide clear-cut optical evidence for exciton condensation in a bulk crystal and establish Ta$_2$Pd$_3$Te$_5$ as a promising platform for exploring correlated quantum phases and novel excitonic phenomena.</description>

      <title>First-principles prediction of altermagnetism in transition metal graphite intercalation compounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the emergence of altermagnetism, a magnetic phase characterized by the coexistence of compensated spin ordering and momentum-dependent spin splitting, in graphite intercalation compounds (GICs), a prototypical material system long investigated for its tunable electronic and structural properties. Through first-principles calculations, we demonstrate that vanadium-intercalated stage-1 graphite compounds, exhibit inherent altermagnetic properties. The hexagonal crystal system and antiferromagnetic ordering of V atoms generate a magnetic space group that enforces alternating spin polarization in momentum space while maintaining zero net magnetization. The calculated band structure reveals robust altermagnetic signatures: along the high-symmetry direction, we observe a pronounced spin splitting of ~270 meV with alternating spin polarization. Crucially, the spin splitting exhibits minimal sensitivity to spin-orbit coupling (SOC) effect, highlighting the dominance of exchange interactions over relativistic effects. From Monte Carlo simulations, we predict a magnetic transition temperature ($T_m$ ) of ~228 K, indicating stable magnetic ordering above liquid nitrogen temperatures. The combination of symmetry-protected spin textures, SOC-independent splitting, and elevated $T_m$ temperature makes V-GICs as a promising candidate for spintronic applications, particularly for zero-field spin-polarized current generation and topologically robust spin transport. As the first demonstration of carbon-based alternating magnetic systems, this work offers a design paradigm for engineering spin-polarized quantum states governed by crystalline symmetry constraints.</description>

      <title>In situ 2D visualization of hydrogen entry into Zn-coated steels in NaCl solutions: Roles of Zn dissolution and potential distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The hydrogen entry behavior of a partially Zn-coated steel sheet in NaCl solutions was investigated employing a polyaniline-based hydrogenochromic sensor, electrochemical hydrogen permeation tests, and potential measurements using a scanning Kelvin probe. While the Zn coating mitigated corrosion of the steel substrate, it simultaneously accelerated the hydrogen entry. The hydrogen entry occurred at the bare steel surface regions exposed to the NaCl solution, with the hydrogen flux exhibiting non-uniform distribution: higher near the dissolving Zn coating. While no significant differences in Zn dissolution behavior or galvanic current were observed between 0.1 and 0.01 M NaCl solutions, the total hydrogen flux decreased with decreasing Cl ion concentration. This reduction was attributed to a potential gradient induced by differences in electrolyte conductivity. The results demonstrate that potential distribution, rather than galvanic current, is a dominant factor influencing hydrogen entry under the investigated conditions.</description>

      <title>High-throughput development of flexible amorphous materials showing large anomalous Nernst effect via automatic annealing and thermoelectric imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18366v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work demonstrates high-throughput screening of flexible magnetic materials for efficient transverse thermoelectric conversion based on the anomalous Nernst effect (ANE). The approach integrates automated annealing and contactless measurement of transport properties using lock-in thermography. We screen 151 Fe-based alloy ribbons with varying compositions and annealing conditions. Seven high-performance candidates with mechanical flexibility are identified, exhibiting anomalous Nernst coefficients of up to 4.8 uV/K, the highest value reported for flexible materials. Structural analysis reveals that ANE enhancement occurs universally near the first crystallization temperature of the Fe-based ribbons, without strong correlation with composition. Notably, the enhancement is also observed in samples without Cu or Fe nanoclusters, indicating that short-range atomic order in the amorphous matrix may play a role in ANE. These findings demonstrate the effectiveness of high-throughput methodologies for discovering advanced ANE materials and provide new insights into thermoelectric conversion in disordered systems where conventional design principles fall short.</description>

      <title>SeWS/bilayer-SiC heterojunction: An S-scheme photocatalyst with high visible-light absorption, excellent carrier mobility and adjustable band gap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vertically stacked heterojunctions have garnered significant attention for their tunable electronic structures and photocatalytic performance, making them promising candidates for next-generation nanodevices. Using first-principles calculations, we systematically investigate the electronic structure, optical characteristics, and charge transfer of WSSe/SiC heterojunctions. Our results reveal that SeWS/monolayer-SiC, SeWS/bilayer-SiC, and SWSe/monolayer-SiC exhibit type-II band alignment, whereas SWSe/bilayer-SiC displays type-I alignment. Notably, SeWS/bilayer-SiC possesses a direct bandgap, in contrast to the indirect bandgaps of the other three configurations. Remarkably, the SeWS/bilayer-SiC heterojunction demonstrates a high absorption coefficient ($10^{5}~\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$) in the visible range and exhibits exceptional anisotropy in carrier transport, with an outstanding hole mobility of $9.58 \times 10^{3}~\mathrm{cm}^{2}\,\mathrm{V}^{-1}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ along the Y-direction. Furthermore, combining thermodynamic stability with an S-scheme charge transfer mechanism, this system exhibits superior redox capability for photocatalytic water splitting, achieving a high hydrogen evolution efficiency of 22.15%, which surpasses the commercial viability threshold (10\%). Furthermore, we demonstrate effective band gap modulation via external electric fields and biaxial strains, with optical absorption coefficients exhibiting strong strain dependence. This work provides fundamental insights into the design of WSSe/SiC heterojunctions for high-efficiency photocatalytic and tunable photodetector applications.</description>

      <title>Determining the grain orientations of battery materials from electron diffraction patterns using convolutional neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polycrystalline materials have numerous applications due to their unique properties, which are often determined by the grain boundaries. Hence, quantitative characterization of grain as well as interface orientation is essential to optimize these materials, particularly energy materials. Using scanning transmission electron microscopy, matter can be analysed in an extremely fine grid of scan points via electron diffraction patterns at each scan point. By matching the diffraction patterns to a simulated database, the crystal orientation of the material as well as the orientation of the grain boundaries at each scan point can be determined. This pattern matching approach is highly time intensive. Artificial intelligence promises to be a very powerful tool for pattern recognition. In this work, we train convolutional neural networks (CNNs) on dynamically simulated diffraction patterns of LiNiO2, an important cathode-active material for Lithium-ion batteries, to predict the orientation of grains in terms of three Euler angles for the complete fundamental orientation region. Results demonstrate that these networks outperform the conventional pattern matching algorithm with increased accuracy and efficiency. The increased accuracy of the CNN models can be attributed to the fact that these models are trained by data incorporating dynamical effects. This work is the first attempt to apply deep learning for analysis of electron diffraction data and enlightens the great potential of ML to accelerate the analysis of electron microscopy data, toward high-throughput characterization technique.</description>

      <title>Atomistic simulations of irradiation damage on the engineering timescale: Examining the dose rate effect in tungsten</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18471v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The change in materials properties subjected to irradiation by highly energetic particles strongly depends on the irradiation dose rate. Atomistic simulations can in principle be used to predict microstructural evolution where experimental data is sparse or unavailable, however, fundamental limitations of the method make it infeasible to replicate the experimental timescale spanning from seconds to hours. Here, we present an atomistic simulation method where the motion of vacancies is accelerated, while the fast degrees of freedom are propagated with standard molecular dynamics. The resulting method is free of adjustable parameters and can predict microstructural evolution under irradiation at elevated temperatures. Simulating the microstructural evolution of tungsten under irradiation at dose rates of $10^{-5}$, $10^{-4}$, and $10^{-3}$ dpa/second, we find that increasing the temperature or reducing the dose rate primarily results in a reduction of the steady-state defect concentration, in qualitative agreement with deuterium retention and post-irradiation resistivity recovery experiments. The formation of a nanoscale void is observed if a system initially containing a large dislocation loop is irradiated. We present a minimally simple rate theory model which reproduces the time-dependent defect concentration and volume swelling behaviour obtained from the simulations.</description>

      <title>Leveraging neural network interatomic potentials for a foundation model of chemistry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18497v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large-scale foundation models, including neural network interatomic potentials (NIPs) in computational materials science, have demonstrated significant potential. However, despite their success in accelerating atomistic simulations, NIPs face challenges in directly predicting electronic properties and often require coupling to higher-scale models or extensive simulations for macroscopic properties. Machine learning (ML) offers alternatives for structure-to-property mapping but faces trade-offs: feature-based methods often lack generalizability, while deep neural networks require significant data and computational power. To address these trade-offs, we introduce HackNIP, a two-stage pipeline that leverages pretrained NIPs. This method first extracts fixed-length feature vectors (embeddings) from NIP foundation models and then uses these embeddings to train shallow ML models for downstream structure-to-property predictions. This study investigates whether such a hybridization approach, by ``hacking" the NIP, can outperform end-to-end deep neural networks, determines the dataset size at which this transfer learning approach surpasses direct fine-tuning of the NIP, and identifies which NIP embedding depths yield the most informative features. HackNIP is benchmarked on Matbench, evaluated for data efficiency, and tested on diverse tasks including \textit{ab initio}, experimental, and molecular properties. We also analyze how embedding depth impacts performance. This work demonstrates a hybridization strategy to overcome ML trade-offs in materials science, aiming to democratize high-performance predictive modeling.</description>

      <title>Intercalation-Altermagnet-Driven Ferrimagnetic-Ferroelastic Multiferroics and Anomalous and Spin Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin splitting in emerging altermagnets is non-relativistic and momentum-dependent, yet energy-independent and localized, posing challenges for practical applications. Here, we propose a paradigm of intercalation-driven altermagnets to attain ameliorative electronic structures, multiferroic characteristics, and anomalous and spin transport functionalities. As a representative system, we investigate electrochemistry- and self-intercalated V2Se2O bilayers, building on the recently reported room-temperature K- and Rb-intercalated V2Se2O family, utilizing density functional theory, Wannier function analyses, Monte Carlo simulations, and non-equilibrium Green function methods. Intercalation induces room-temperature intralayer ferrimagnetic and interlayer ferromagnetic couplings (358 K for Li-intercalation and 773 K for V-intercalation), ferroelasticity (~1 % signal intensity), in-plane uniaxial magnetic anisotropy and metallization, while modifying the anomalous Hall effect. Notably, Li- and V-intercalated V2Se2O bilayers exhibit enhanced spin splitting and half-metallic behavior, respectively, yielding near-perfect spin filtering efficiencies. Intercalation substantially boosts spin transport in V2Se2O-based devices, enabling giant magnetoresistance (877 %), ultra-high thermal tunneling magnetoresistance (~12000 %), and observable spin Seebeck and temperature negative differential resistance effects. Such intercalation-altermagnet-driven paradigm pioneers the expansion of altermagnetic functionalities through multifunctional integration, offering promising avenues for advanced, miniaturized, room-temperature utilization of anomalous, electron, and spin transport.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.18542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data-driven methodologies hold the promise of revolutionizing inorganic materials discovery, but they often face challenges due to discrepancies between theoretical predictions and experimental validation. In this work, we present an end-to-end discovery framework that leverages synthesizability, oxidation state probability, and reaction pathway calculations to guide the exploration of transition metal oxide spaces. Two previously unsynthesized target compositions, ZnVO3 and YMoO3, passed preliminary computational evaluation and were considered for ultrafast synthesis. Comprehensive structural and compositional analysis confirmed the successful synthesis ZnVO3 in a partially disordered spinel structure, validated via Density Functional Theory (DFT). Exploration of YMoO3 led to YMoO3-x with elemental composition close to 1:1:3; the structure was subsequently identified to be Y4Mo4O11 through micro-electron diffraction (microED) analysis. Our framework effectively integrates multi-aspect physics-based filtration with in-depth characterization, demonstrating the feasibility of designing, testing, synthesizing, and analyzing (DTMA) novel material candidates, marking a significant advancement towards inorganic materials by design.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.18547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An important nonlinear effect in magnonics is the 3-magnon splitting where a high frequency magnon splits into two magnons of lower frequencies. Here, we study the 3-magnon splitting in spin wave conduits made from synthetic antiferromagnets. By combining inductive excitation, inductive detection, Brillouin Light Scattering imaging of the spin waves and analytical modeling based on conservation laws, we elucidate the nature of the spin waves involved in this process. We show in particular that low order optical spin waves propagating along the conduit can split in doublets of non-degenerate acoustic spin waves that have a standing wave character in the confined direction and unsymmetrical wavevectors in the direction of the spin wave conduit. Generally, several splitting channels run in parallel. The rules governing the three-magnon splitting and its interplay with the mode confinement have consequences for the applications in non-linear microwave signal processing based on spin waves.</description>

      <title>Giant orbital magnetization in two-dimensional materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Orbital magnetization typically plays a minor role in compounds where the magnetic properties are governed by transition metal elements. However, in some cases, the orbital magnetization may be fully unquenched, which can have dramatic consequences for magnetic anisotropy and various magnetic response properties. In the present work, we start by summarizing how unquenched orbital moments arise from particular combinations of crystal field splitting and orbital filling. We exemplify this for the cases of two-dimensional (2D) VI$_3$ and FePS$_3$, and show that Hubbard corrections as well as self-consistent spin-orbit coupling are crucial ingredients for predicting correct orbital moments from first principles calculations. We then search the Computational 2D Materials Database (C2DB) for monolayers having tetrahedral or octahedral crystal field splitting of transition metal $d$-states and orbital occupancy that is expected to lead to large orbital moments. We identify 112 monolayers with octahedral crystal field splitting and 62 monolayers with tetrahedral crystal field splitting and for materials with partially filled $t_{2g}$ bands, we verify that inclusion of Hubbard corrections as well as self-consistent spin-orbit coupling typically increases the magnitude of predicted orbital moments by an order of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Spin-polarized triplet excitonic insulators in Ta3X8 (X=I, Br) monolayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18686v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bose-Einstein condensation of spin-polarized triplet excitons can give rise to an intriguing spin supercurrent, enabling experimental detection of exciton condensation. In this work, we predict that Ta3X8 (X=I, Br) ferromagnetic monolayers are spin-polarized triplet excitonic insulators (EIs), based on the systematic first-principles GW calculations coupled with the Bethe-Salpeter equation (GW+BSE). The single-particle calculations of spin-polarized band structures reveal that these monolayers are bipolar magnetic semiconductors, where the highest valence band and the lowest conduction band possess opposite spin polarization. The two low-energy bands, primarily originating from Ta $d_{z^2}$ orbitals, are almost flat. The same-orbital parity and opposite-spin natures of the band-edge states effectively suppress dielectric screening, promoting the emergence of the EI state. The GW+BSE calculations reveal that the binding energy of the lowest-energy exciton is 1.499 eV for Ta3I8 monolayer and 1.986 eV for Ta3Br8 monolayer. Since both values exceed the respective GW band gaps, these results indicate a strong excitonic instability in these monolayers. A wavefunction analysis confirms that the lowest-energy exciton is a tightly bound Frenkel-like state, exhibiting a spin-polarized triplet nature with $S_z=1$.

      <title>Cluster Expansion Toward Nonlinear Modeling and Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18695v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A quantitative first-principles description of complex substitutional materials like alloys is challenging due to the vast number of configurations and the high computational cost of solving the quantum-mechanical problem. Therefore, materials properties must be modeled. The Cluster Expansion (CE) method is widely used for this purpose, but it struggles with properties that exhibit non-linear dependencies on composition, often failing even in a qualitative description. By looking at CE through the lens of machine learning, we resolve this severe problem and introduce a non-linear CE approach, yielding extremely accurate and computationally efficient results as demonstrated by distinct examples.</description>

      <title>Importance of Non-Adiabatic Effects on Kohn Anomalies in 1D metals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kohn anomalies are kinks or dips in phonon dispersions which are pronounced in low-dimensional materials. We investigate the effects of non-adiabatic phonon self-energy on Kohn anomalies in one-dimensional metals by developing a model that analyzes how the adiabatic phonon frequency, electron effective mass, and electron-phonon coupling strength influence phonon mode renormalization. We introduce an electron-phonon coupling strength threshold for low-temperature system instability, providing experimentalists with a tool to predict them. Finally, we validate the predictions of our model against first-principles calculations on a 4 {\AA}-diameter carbon nanotube.</description>

      <title>Challenges and opportunities in piezoelectric polymers: Effect of oriented amorphous fraction in ferroelectric semicrystalline polymers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18722v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite extensive research on piezoelectric polymers since the discovery of piezoelectric poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) in 1969, the fundamental physics of polymer piezoelectricity has remained elusive. Based on the classic principle of piezoelectricity, polymer piezoelectricity should originate from the polar crystalline phase. Surprisingly, the crystal contribution to the piezoelectric strain coefficient d31 is determined to be less than 10%, primarily owing to the difficulty in changing the molecular bond lengths and bond angles. Instead, &gt;85% contribution is from Poisson's ratio, which is closely related to the oriented amorphous fraction (OAF) in uniaxially stretched films of semicrystalline ferroelectric (FE) polymers. In this perspective, the semicrystalline structure-piezoelectric property relationship is revealed using PVDF-based FE polymers as a model system. In melt-processed FE polymers, the OAF is often present and links the crystalline lamellae to the isotropic amorphous fraction. Molecular dynamics simulations demonstrate that the electrostrictive conformation transformation of the OAF chains induces a polarization change upon the application of either a stress (the direct piezoelectric effect) or an electric field (the converse piezoelectric effect). Meanwhile, relaxor-like secondary crystals in OAF (SCOAF), which are favored to grow in the extended-chain crystal (ECC) structure, can further enhance the piezoelectricity. However, the ECC structure is difficult to achieve in PVDF homopolymers without high-pressure crystallization. We have discovered that high-power ultrasonication can effectively induce SCOAF in PVDF homopolymers to improve its piezoelectric performance. Finally, we envision that the electrostrictive OAF mechanism should also be applicable for other FE polymers such as odd-numbered nylons and piezoelectric biopolymers.</description>

      <title>Laser-induced ultrafast structural transformations in thin Fe layer revealed by time-resolved X-ray diffraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18730v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ultrafast response of iron lattice to sub-ps pulsed laser-induced heating has been investigated using time-resolved XRD in the partial melting regime. Strong electron-phonon coupling in Fe leads to rapid heating within 1-2 ps post laser-irradiation, followed by lattice expansion and melting on the 2-5 ps timescale. A tetragonal distortion of the remaining bcc-phase emerges at 6 ps and the unit-cell volume increases up to a value characteristic for the bcc-Fe phase. Under the experimental conditions, the bct-Fe remains metastable up to at least 60 ps, gradually relaxing toward the bcc phase without fully reverting. These findings provide new insight into the ultrafast dynamics, structural pathways, and stability of transient phases during the early stages of solid-solid phase transitions in bcc metals.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Transfer Learning to Overcome Data Limitations in Czochralski Crystal Growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18774v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Czochralski (Cz) method is a widely used process for growing high-quality single crystals, critical for applications in semiconductors, optics, and advanced materials. Achieving optimal growth conditions requires precise control of process and furnace design parameters. Still, data scarcity -- especially for new materials -- limits the application of machine learning (ML) in predictive modeling and optimization. This study proposes a transfer learning approach to overcome this limitation by adapting ML models trained on a higher data volume of one source material (Si) to a lower data volume of another target material (Ge and GaAs). The materials were deliberately selected to assess the robustness of the transfer learning approach in handling varying data similarity, with Cz-Ge being similar to Cz-Si, and GaAs grown via the liquid encapsulated Czochralski method (LEC), which differs from Cz-Si. We explore various transfer learning strategies, including Warm Start, Merged Training, and Hyperparameters Transfer, and evaluate multiple ML architectures across two different materials. Our results demonstrate that transfer learning significantly enhances predictive accuracy with minimal data, providing a practical framework for optimizing Cz growth parameters across diverse materials.</description>

      <title>Generalized energy band alignment model for van der Waals heterostructures with a charge spillage dipole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18850v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The energy band alignment at the interface of van der Waals heterostructures (vdWHs) is a key design parameter for next-generation electronic and optoelectronic devices. Although the Anderson and midgap models have been widely adopted for bulk semiconductor heterostructures, they exhibit severe limitations when applied to vdWHs, particularly for type-III systems. Based on first-principles calculations for approximately $10^3$ vdWHs, we demonstrate these traditional models miss a critical dipole arising from interlayer charge spillage. We introduce a generalized linear response (gLR) model that includes this dipole through a quantum capacitance term while remaining analytically compact. With only two readily computed inputs, the charge neutrality level offset and the sum of the isolated-layer bandgaps, the gLR reproduces DFT band line-ups with $r^2\sim$0.9 across type-I, II, and III stacks. Machine-learning feature analysis confirms that these two descriptors dominate the underlying physics, indicating the model is near-minimal and broadly transferable. The gLR framework therefore provides both mechanistic insight and a fast, accurate surrogate for high-throughput screening of the vast vdW heterostructure design space.</description>

      <title>Three-Dimensional Porous Structures of CO$_2$-Induced Salt Precipitation Sustaining Halite Self-Enhancing Growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17241v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Salt precipitation during CO$_2$ storage in saline aquifers presents challenges for injectivity and containment, with broader implications for soil salinization and cultural heritage preservation. This study utilizes time-lapse X-ray and spectral micro-computed tomography, scanning electron microscopy, and deep learning-assisted image analysis to investigate halite crystallization and brine consumption in porous medium. We identified three-dimensional halite growth structures functioning as a secondary porous medium. Visualizing the spatio-temporal dynamics of salt-brine coexistence and halite precipitation revealed critical insights into the self-enhancing nature of salt growth. Expanding gas-liquid contact surfaces and initial crystal nucleation sites significantly enhanced evaporation and growth rates. Hydrophilic halite crystals attract brine films, establishing a feedback loop that perpetuates growth. The encapsulation of brine between grain surfaces and umbrella-like salt crusts was observed. Delineating the self-enhancing growth, including the role of capillary forces and surface-interface processes, is crucial for improving CO$_2$ injection efficiency and integrity, as well as for addressing environmental challenges related to soil salinization.</description>

      <title>Differentiable neural network representation of multi-well, locally-convex potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17242v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-well potentials are ubiquitous in science, modeling phenomena such as phase transitions, dynamic instabilities, and multimodal behavior across physics, chemistry, and biology. In contrast to non-smooth minimum-of-mixture representations, we propose a differentiable and convex formulation based on a log-sum-exponential (LSE) mixture of input convex neural network (ICNN) modes. This log-sum-exponential input convex neural network (LSE-ICNN) provides a smooth surrogate that retains convexity within basins and allows for gradient-based learning and inference.
  A key feature of the LSE-ICNN is its ability to automatically discover both the number of modes and the scale of transitions through sparse regression, enabling adaptive and parsimonious modeling. We demonstrate the versatility of the LSE-ICNN across diverse domains, including mechanochemical phase transformations, microstructural elastic instabilities, conservative biological gene circuits, and variational inference for multimodal probability distributions. These examples highlight the effectiveness of the LSE-ICNN in capturing complex multimodal landscapes while preserving differentiability, making it broadly applicable in data-driven modeling, optimization, and physical simulation.</description>

      <title>Electron conductive self-assembled hybrid low-molecular weight glycolipid-nanosilver gels</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.17243v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Low-molecular weight (LMW) hydrogels are gaining interest over macromolecular gels due to their reversible, dynamic and stimuli-responsive nature. They are potentially interesting functional materials for advanced applications such as catalysis, nanoelectronics or regenerative medicine. One common strategy to enhance the functional properties is to incorporate inorganic nanostructures. However, simultaneous control of the gel mechanics, shape and size of the nanostructures and functional properties is challenging. Here, a biobased, double amphiphilic, bolaform, single-glucose lipid (containing glucose and COOH in opposite directions) is able to coordinate silver ions, drive the formation of a self-assembled fibrous hydrogel and, after controlling the reduction time (seconds to hours) of the reduction process (NaBH4, ascorbate, $\gamma$-rays), stabilize Ag nanoparticles (NPs) of controlled size (2.8 nm $\pm$ 13%). The NPs are spontaneously embedded in the fibers' core following a two-dimensional anisotropic long-range order. Precise control of the reduction parameters (ascorbate) drives the formation of Ag nanowires, possibly due to an anisotropic coalescence process of the nanoparticles. Samples containing Ag nanowires have shown an electronic conductive response, observed with impedance spectroscopy. This works shows the potential of biological amphiphiles to develop under soft conditions (pseudo single step, water, room temperature) advanced hybrid organic/inorganic (O/I) materials with a multiscale structure, order and electron conductivity functionality</description>

Abstract: Version 14 of XtalOpt, evolutionary multi-objective global optimization algorithm for crystal structure prediction, is now available for download from its official website https://xtalopt.github.io. The new version of the code is designed to perform ground state search for novel crystal structures with variable composition by integrating a suite of ab initio methods alongside classical and machine-learning potentials for structural relaxation. The multi-objective search framework has been further enhanced through the introduction of Pareto optimization, enabling efficient discovery of functional materials. Here, we describe the implemented methodologies, provide detailed instructions for their use, and present an overview of additional improvements included in XtalOpt version 14.</description>

      <title>AutomataGPT: Forecasting and Ruleset Inference for Two-Dimensional Cellular Automata</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17333v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cellular automata (CA) provide a minimal formalism for investigating how simple local interactions generate rich spatiotemporal behavior in domains as diverse as traffic flow, ecology, tissue morphogenesis and crystal growth. However, automatically discovering the local update rules for a given phenomenon and using them for quantitative prediction remains challenging. Here we present AutomataGPT, a decoder-only transformer pretrained on around 1 million simulated trajectories that span 100 distinct two-dimensional binary deterministic CA rules on toroidal grids. When evaluated on previously unseen rules drawn from the same CA family, AutomataGPT attains 98.5% perfect one-step forecasts and reconstructs the governing update rule with up to 96% functional (application) accuracy and 82% exact rule-matrix match. These results demonstrate that large-scale pretraining over wider regions of rule space yields substantial generalization in both the forward (state forecasting) and inverse (rule inference) problems, without hand-crafted priors. By showing that transformer models can faithfully infer and execute CA dynamics from data alone, our work lays the groundwork for abstracting real-world dynamical phenomena into data-efficient CA surrogates, opening avenues in biology, tissue engineering, physics and AI-driven scientific discovery.</description>

      <title>A facility for thermo-mechanical characterization of fusion magnet materials during cryogenic ion irradiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17358v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Commercial fusion power plants demand magnet materials that retain structural integrity and thermal conductivity while operating under the bombardment of energetic neutrons at cryogenic temperatures. Understanding how thermo-mechanical properties evolve under such extreme loads is crucial for selecting materials with high radiation tolerance and predictable failure mechanisms. Presented here is a facility that combines cryogenic transient grating spectroscopy (TGS) with simultaneous ion irradiation, enabling in-situ measurements of thermal diffusivity and surface acoustic wave (SAW) frequency spectra. Employing copper as a benchmark material, an irradiation was performed at 30 K with 12.4 MeV $\text{Cu}^{6+}$ ions producing a final fluence of $1.9 \times 10^{17}$ ions/m$^2$. Over the irradiation period, thermal diffusivity nearly halved from an initial value of $1.2 \times 10^{-4}$ $\text{m}^2/\text{s}$ while SAW speed did not show significant change, maintaining a value of $2162\pm18$ m/s. Given its real-time monitoring capability and the numerous candidate materials that remain uncharacterized under fusion magnet operating conditions, this facility is poised to deliver new scientific insights into fusion magnet material degradation trends, contributing to improved design criteria and operational certainty for forthcoming fusion power plants.</description>

      <title>Quantum Geometric Origin of the Intrinsic Nonlinear Hall Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17386v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze the quantum geometric contribution to the intrinsic second-order nonlinear Hall effect (NLHE) for a general multiband Hamiltonian. The nonlinear conductivity, obtained in Green's function formalism, is decomposed into its quantum geometric constituents using a projector-based approach. In addition to the previously identified Berry curvature and interband quantum metric dipoles, we obtain a third term of quantum geometric origin, given by the momentum derivative of the $intraband$ quantum metric. This contribution, which we term the intraband quantum metric dipole, provides substantial corrections to the NLHE in topological magnets and becomes the dominant geometric term in topological antiferromagnets with gapped Dirac cones. Considering generalized 2D and 3D Weyl/Dirac Hamiltonians, describing a large class of topological band crossings with sizable quantum geometry, we derive analytical expressions of the NLHE, thereby revealing the individual contributions of the three quantum geometric terms. Combined with an exhaustive symmetry classification of all magnetic space groups, this analysis leads to the identification of several candidate materials expected to exhibit large intrinsic NLHE, including the antiferromagnets $\text{Yb}_3\text{Pt}_4$, $\text{CuMnAs}$, and $\text{CoNb}_3\text{S}_6$, as well as the nodal-plane material $\text{MnNb}_3\text{S}_6$. Finally, our projector-based approach yields a compact expression for the NLHE in terms of momentum derivatives of the Bloch Hamiltonian matrix alone, enabling efficient numerical evaluation of each contribution in the aforementioned materials.</description>

      <title>Refining Tc Prediction in Hydrides via Symbolic-Regression-Enhanced Electron-Localization-Function-Based Descriptors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.17456v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hydrogen-based materials are able to possess extremely high superconducting critical temperatures, \tc s, due to hydrogen's low atomic mass and strong electron-phonon interaction. Recently, a descriptor based on the Electron Localization Function (ELF) has enabled the rapid estimation of the \tc\ of hydrogen-containing compounds from electronic networking properties, but its applicability has been limited by the small size and homogeneity of the training dataset used. Herein, the model is re-examined compiling a publicly available combined dataset of 244 binary and ternary hydride superconductors. Our analysis shows that though ELF-based networking remains a valuable descriptor, its predictive power declines with increasing compositional complexity. However, by introducing the molecularity index, defined as the highest value of the ELF at which two hydrogen atoms connect, and applying symbolic regression, the accuracy of the predictions can be substantially enhanced. These results establish a more robust framework for assessing superconductivity in hydride materials, facilitating accelerated screening of novel candidates through integration with crystal structure prediction methods or high-throughput searches.</description>

      <title>Improving the lifetime of aluminum-based superconducting qubits through atomic layer etching and deposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17474v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a dry surface treatment combining atomic layer etching and deposition (ALE and ALD) to mitigate dielectric loss in fully fabricated superconducting quantum devices formed from aluminum thin films on silicon. The treatment, performed as a final processing step prior to device packaging, starts by conformally removing the native metal oxide and fabrication residues from the exposed surfaces through ALE before \textit{in situ} encapsulating the metal surfaces with a thin dielectric layer using ALD. We measure a two-fold reduction in loss attributed to two-level system (TLS) absorption in treated aluminum-based resonators and planar transmon qubits. Treated transmons with compact capacitor plates and gaps achieve median $Q$ and $T_1$ values of $3.69 \pm 0.42 \times 10^6$ and $196 \pm 22$~$\mu$s, respectively. These improvements were found to be sustained over several months. We discuss how the combination of ALE and ALD reverses fabrication-induced surface damages to significantly and durably improve device performance via a reduction of the TLS defect density in the capacitive elements.</description>

      <title>A review of heat transport in solvated gold nanoparticles: Molecular dynamics modeling and experimental perspectives</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.17520v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Turning gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) into nanoscale heat sources via light irradiation has prompted significant research interest, particularly for biomedical applications over the past few decades. The AuNP's tunable photothermal effect, notable biocompatibility, and ability to serve as vehicles for temperature-sensitive chemical linkers enable thermo-therapeutics, such as localized drug/gene delivery and thermal ablation of cancerous tissue. Thermal transport in aqueous AuNP solutions stands as the fundamental challenge to developing targeted thermal therapies; thus, this review article surveys recent advancements in our understanding of heat transfer and surface chemistry in AuNPs, with a particular focus on thermal boundary conductance across gold- and functionalized-gold-water interfaces. This review article highlights computational advances based on molecular dynamics simulations that offer valuable insights into nanoscopic interfacial heat transfer in solvated interfaces, particularly for chemically functionalized AuNPs. Additionally, it outlines current experimental techniques for measuring interfacial thermal transport, their limitations, and potential pathways to improve sensitivity. This review further examines computational methodologies to guide the accurate modeling of solvated gold interfaces. Finally, it concludes with a discussion of future research directions aimed at deepening our understanding of interfacial heat transfer in solvated AuNPs, crucial to optimize thermoplasmonic applications.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Stress-Strain Predictions with Seq2Seq and Cross-Attention based on Small Punch Test</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17680v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel deep-learning approach to predict true stress-strain curves of high-strength steels from small punch test (SPT) load-displacement data. The proposed approach uses Gramian Angular Field (GAF) to transform load-displacement sequences into images, capturing spatial-temporal features and employs a Sequence-to-Sequence (Seq2Seq) model with an LSTM-based encoder-decoder architecture, enhanced by multi-head cross-attention to improved accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves superior prediction accuracy, with minimum and maximum mean absolute errors of 0.15 MPa and 5.58 MPa, respectively. The proposed method offers a promising alternative to traditional experimental techniques in materials science, enhancing the accuracy and efficiency of true stress-strain relationship predictions.</description>

      <title>Influence of nanostructuring through high-pressure torsion (HPT) on superconductivity of a high-entropy alloy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17850v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-entropy alloys (HEAs) have emerged as favorable choices for different applications, including superconductors. The present work examines the impact of nanostructuring via high-pressure torsion (HPT) on the superconducting properties of the equiatomic TiZrHfNbTa HEA. Structural characterization reveals a progressive refinement of grain size and increased dislocation density, together with partial phase transformation to an {\omega} phase with HPT processing. Magnetic susceptibility and magnetization measurements indicate a systematic enhancement in the superconducting transition temperature (from $T_c =$ 6.2 K to 7.2 K) and critical magnetic field, as well as the stabilization of the superconductivity state by HPT processing. The improvement of superconducting properties is attributed to microstructural modifications such as grain boundary density, defect generation and phase transformations, and their impact on vortex pinning, quantum confinement and electron scattering. The results suggest that nanostructuring through severe plastic deformation provides an appropriate route to optimize superconducting properties in high-entropy superconductors.</description>

      <title>A continuous damage accumulation scenario for elastomeric frictional wear</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17860v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding how materials wear off following frictional sliding is a long-standing question in tribology. In this respect, the particular case of the wear of soft rubbery elastomeric materials stands apart: tire wear produces several million tonnes of abraded materials per year, bearing immense industrial and environmental impact, while the soft nature of elastomers and their inability to accommodate plastic deformation before failure renders their wear mechanisms almost intractable. Here, we harness mechanochemical approaches on model elastomeric materials, to reveal that mild elastomeric wear does not proceed from crack propagation processes, but rather from the continuous accumulation of diffuse damage by chain scission, extending well below the surface of the material. Damage accumulates in a discontinuous manner through micro-slippage events at the rough contacting asperities, with in-depth damage extension set by the characteristic asperity size. Surprisingly, damage grows through a slow logarithmic-like process over successive cycles, which we interpret as the occurrence of stress-activated scission events in a broad strand elastic energy landscape. These observations point to the probabilistic nature of this fatigue-like damage accumulation mechanism and allow us to formulate the wear rate as an integral of the damage cumulated over successive asperity sliding. Finally, by tuning the molecular architecture of our materials, we evidence an antagonistic relation between fracture resistance and wear resilience, set by the sensitivity of the material to stress fluctuations. Revealing the role of previously invisible subsurface damage in elastomeric wear, our approach should stimulate further physical-based approaches allowing for the development of sustainable and wear-resilient materials.</description>

      <title>Polarons with arbitrary nonlinear electron-phonon interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17914v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop an exact computational method based on numerical X-propagators for solving polaron models with arbitrary nonlinear couplings of local vibration modes to the electron density and magnitude of the hopping amplitude. Our approach covers various polaron models, some of which were impossible to treat by any existing approximation-free techniques. Moreover, it remains efficient in the most relevant but computationally challenging regime of phonon frequencies much smaller than the electron bandwidth. As a case study, we consider the double-well type nonlinear model with quadratic ($g_2&lt;0$) and quartic ($g_4&gt;0$) interactions describing a broad class of technologically important materials, such as quantum paraelectric compounds and halide perovskites. We observe, depending on the model parameters, three qualitatively different regimes: (i) quantum interplay of quartic and quadratic interactions which suppresses effects of the quadratic coupling, (ii) intermediate-coupling regime with exponential $\propto \exp(\alpha g_2 \Omega^{-1/4})$ scaling of the quasiparticle weight and mass renormalization, and (iii) strong-coupling asymptotic behavior.</description>

      <title>Threshold Displacement Energies of Oxygen in YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_7$: A Multi-Physics Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17976v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neutron bombardment of high temperature superconducting (HTS) magnets may compromise the integrity of the magnetic confinement in future fusion reactors. The amount of damage produced by a single neutron can be predicted from the threshold displacement energies (TDE) of the constituent ions in the HTS materials, such as the Rare Earth Cuperates. Therefore, in this work a Multiphysics simulation approach is adopted to determine the threshold displacement energies for oxygen in YBa2Cu3O7. Classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are employed to determine statistically representative TDEs for all four oxygen sites and these results are validated using Born-Oppenheimer MD employing forces derived from Density Functional Theory (DFT). The simulations were performed at the operational temperature (25 K) and the temperature of existing neutron irradiation studies (360 K) enabling a discussion about the relevance of this data. Overall, these findings enhance our understanding of radiation-induced damage in HTS materials and provide data that can be incorporated into higher order models offering critical insights into shielding design and magnet longevity.</description>

      <title>Pairing-induced Momentum-space Magnetism and Its Implication In Optical Anomalous Hall Effect In Chiral Superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18005v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The intrinsic mechanisms of the magneto-optical Kerr signal in chiral superconductors often involve multi-orbital degree of freedom. Here by considering a generic single-orbital and spinful Hamiltonian, we generalize the Onsager's relation to obtain the necessary conditions for the optical anomalous Hall effect. Using the down-folding method, we identify two types of effective momentum-space magnetism responsible for the optical anomalous Hall conductivity from non-unitary and unitary pairing potentials respectively. The former is due to the angular momentum of Cooper pair, while the latter requires the participation of the spin-orbit coupling in the normal state and has been largely overlooked previously. Using concrete examples, we show that the unitary pairing can lead to both ferromagnetism and complicated antiferromagnetic spin texture in the momentum space, resulting in an in-plane optical anomalous Hall effect with the magnetism parallel to the Hall-deflection plane. Our work reveals the essential role of spin degree of freedom in the optical anomalous Hall effect.</description>

      <title>Solid-State Optical Magnetometer: Next-Generation Approach to Sub-Nanotesla Magnetic Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18111v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a Solid-State Optical Magnetometer (SOM) based on black phosphorus (BP) multilayers, offering a compact, scalable, and highly sensitive alternative to traditional atomic-based magnetometers. Utilizing BP's intrinsic linear dichroism in a metasurface cavity, the SOM achieves sub-nanotesla precision and vector magnetic field sensing. BP enhances light-matter interactions, enabling tunable optical responses driven by Lorentz force-induced cavity deformation. Optimized metasurface unit cells increase polarization-dependent absorption, improving detection sensitivity. Finite Element Method simulations show high linearity (R-squared &gt; 0.999), tunable dynamic range, and adjustable sensitivity via current modulation. At 200 microamps, the SOM reaches a sensitivity of 31.25 picotesla, while lower currents expand the dynamic range up to +-10 nanotesla. This tunability allows for application-specific optimization in areas such as biomagnetic sensing, metrology, and industrial field detection. Unlike SQUIDs and optically pumped magnetometers, the BP-based SOM operates at room temperature and nanoscale dimensions with comparable sensitivity, eliminating the need for cryogenics or vapor cells. Power consumption remains under 1 microwatt, far below conventional technologies. This work establishes BP metasurface integration as a promising platform for low-power, miniaturized, and high-performance magnetic field sensing.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we extend a fractional-dimensional space model for anisotropic solids by incorporating a q-deformed derivative operator, inspired by Tsallis' nonadditive entropy framework. This generalization provides an analytical framework for exploring anisotropic thermal properties, within a unified and flexible mathematical formalism. We derive modified expressions for the phonon density of states and specific heat capacity, highlighting the impact of the deformation parameters on thermodynamic behavior. We apply the model to various solid-state materials, achieving excellent agreement with experimental data, across a wide temperature range and demonstrating its effectiveness in capturing anisotropic and subextensive effects in real systems.</description>

      <title>Plasmon Polaritons in Disordered Nanoparticle Assemblies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18138v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multilayer assemblies of metal nanoparticles can act as photonic structures, where collective plasmon resonances hybridize with cavity modes to create plasmon-polariton states. For sufficiently strong coupling, plasmon polaritons qualitatively alter the optical properties of light-matter systems, with applications ranging from sensing to solar energy. However, results from experimental studies have raised questions about the role of nanoparticle structural disorder in plasmon-polariton formation and light-matter coupling in plasmonic assemblies. Understanding how disorder affects optical properties has practical implications since methods for assembling low-defect nanoparticle superlattices are slow and scale poorly. Modeling realistic disorder requires large system sizes, which is challenging using conventional electromagnetic simulations. We employ Brownian dynamics simulations to construct large-scale nanoparticle multilayers with controlled structural order. We investigate their optical response using a superposition T-matrix method with 2-D periodic boundary conditions. We find that while structural disorder broadens the polaritonic stop band and the near-field hot-spot distribution, the polariton dispersion and coupling strength remain unaltered. To understand effects of nanoparticle composition, we consider assemblies with model particles mimicking gold or tin-doped indium oxide (ITO) nanocrystals. Losses due to higher damping in ITO nanocrystals prevent their assemblies from achieving the deep strong coupling of gold nanoparticle multilayers, although the former still exhibit ultrastrong coupling. We demonstrate that while computationally efficient mutual polarization method calculations employing the quasistatic approximation modestly overestimate the strength of the collective plasmon, they reproduce the polariton dispersion relations determined by electrodynamic simulations.</description>

      <title>Anomalies in G and 2D Raman Modes of Twisted Bilayer Graphene Near the Magic Angle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18166v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The role of twist angle ($\theta_t$) in tailoring the physical properties of heterostructures is emerging as a new paradigm in two-dimensional materials. The influence of flat electronic bands near the magic angle ($\sim$1.1$^{\circ}$) on the phononic properties of twisted bilayer graphene (t-BLG) is not well understood. In this work, we systematically investigate the G and 2D Raman modes of t-BLG samples with twist angles ranging from $\sim$0.3$^{\circ}$ to $\sim$3$^{\circ}$ using micro-Raman spectroscopy. A key finding of our work is the splitting of the G mode near the magic angle due to moir\'e potential induced phonon hybridization. The linewidth of the low-frequency component of the G mode (G$^-$), as well as the main component of the 2D mode, exhibits enhanced broadening near the magic angle due to increased electron-phonon coupling, driven by the emergence of flat electronic bands. Additionally, temperature-dependent Raman measurements (6-300 K) of magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene sample ($\theta_t \sim$ 1$^{\circ}$) reveal an almost tenfold increase in phonon anharmonicity-induced temperature variation in both components of the split G mode, as compared to Bernal-stacked bilayer graphene sample, further emphasizing the role of phonon hybridization in this system. These studies could be important for understanding the thermal properties of the twisted bilayer graphene systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.18554v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We combine state-of-the-art thermo-metallurgical welding process modelling with coupled diffusion-elastic-plastic phase field fracture simulations to predict the failure states of hydrogen transport pipelines. This enables quantitatively resolving residual stress states and the role of brittle, hard regions of the weld such as the heat affected zone (HAZ). Failure pressures can be efficiently quantified as a function of asset state (existing defects), materials and weld procedures adopted, and hydrogen purity. Importantly, simulations spanning numerous relevant conditions (defect size and orientations) are used to build \emph{Virtual} Failure Assessment Diagrams (FADs), enabling a straightforward uptake of this mechanistic approach in fitness-for-service assessment. Model predictions are in very good agreement with FAD approaches from the standards but show that the latter are not conservative when resolving the heterogeneous nature of the weld microstructure. Appropriate, \emph{mechanistic} FAD safety factors are established that account for the role of residual stresses and hard, brittle weld regions.</description>

Abstract: The coarse-grained interactions between N\'eel skyrmions, stabilized by interfacial Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya coupling (iDMI), are studied through the properties of their hexagonal lattices by micromagnetic simulations. The interactions with the film edges are excluded by imposing periodic boundary conditions. The dependence of skyrmion size and interaction energy on the distance is derived. Two types of behavior are observed depending on the value of iDMI compared to the critical value Dc above which the skyrmion size diverges: For iDMI &lt; Dc the skyrmions acquire a finite size that saturates at maximum value independent of the skyrmion distance that corresponds to the one of the isolated skyrmion. This energy is above that of the homogeneous ferromagnetic state. For iDMI &gt; Dc the skyrmions tend to increase in size to the extent that their neighboring skyrmions permit and finite size skyrmions can be stabilized only in arrays due to their mutual repulsion. These configurations have energy below that of the homogeneous ferromagnetic state.</description>

      <title>Lattice-tunable substituted iron garnets for low-temperature magnonics</title>

Abstract: The synthesis of nm-thick epitaxial films of iron garnets by physical vapor deposition has opened up exciting opportunities for the on-chip generation and processing of microwave signals encoded in magnons. However, iron garnet thin films suffer from demanding lattice-matching and stoichiometry requirements. Here a new approach to their synthesis is developed, enabling a precise and continuous tuning of iron garnet compositions based on the co-sputtering of binary oxides. By substituting a controlled proportion of iron with additional yttrium, Y$_{3}$(Y$_{x}$Fe$_{5-x}$)O$_{12}$ films of high crystalline quality are obtained, combining a widely tunable lattice parameter and excellent magnetization dynamics. This enables iron garnet thin films suited for cryogenic applications, which have long remained impractical due to microwave losses caused by paramagnetic garnet substrates. Low-temperature ferromagnetic resonance confirms the elimination of substrate paramagnetic losses for Y$_{3}$(Y$_{x}$Fe$_{5-x}$)O$_{12}$ films lattice-matched to Y$_{3}$Sc$_{2}$Ga$_{3}$O$_{12}$ (YSGG), a diamagnetic substrate. The Y$_{3}$(Y$_{x}$Fe$_{5-x}$)O$_{12}$ system can be matched to other substrates such as (Gd,Y)$_{3}$Sc$_{2}$Ga$_{3}$O$_{12}$. Bi-substituted films of (Bi$_{0.8}$Y$_{2.2}$)Fe$_{5}$O$_{12}$ also have ideal lattice matching to YSGG, demonstrating the versatility of this approach. This opens unprecedented options for cation substitutions in iron garnet films, offering a promising avenue to new properties and quantum magnonic devices operating in low-temperature environments.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Competition Between Hubbard and Superexchange Interactions Selectively Localizes Electrons and Holes Through Polarons</title>

Abstract: Controlling the effects of photoexcited polarons in transition metal oxides can enable the long timescale charge separation necessary for renewable energy applications as well as controlling new quantum phases through dynamically tunable electron-phonon coupling. In previously studied transition metal oxides, polaron formation is facilitated by a photoexcited ligand-to-metal charge transfer (LMCT). When the polaron is formed, oxygen atoms move away from iron centers, which increases carrier localization at the metal center and decreases charge hopping. Studies of yttrium iron garnet and erbium iron oxide have suggested that strong electron and spin correlations can modulate photoexcited polaron formation. To understand the interplay between strong spin and electronic correlations in highly polar materials, we studied gadolinium iron oxide (GdFeO3), which selectively forms photoexcited polarons through an Fe-O-Fe superexchange inter-action. Excitation-wavelength-dependent transient extreme ultraviolet (XUV) spectroscopy selectively excites LMCT and metal-to-metal charge transfer transitions (MMCT). The LMCT transition suppresses photoexcited polaron formation due to the balance between superexchange and Hubbard interactions, while MMCT transitions result in photoexcited polaron formation within 250+/-40 fs. Ab initio theory demonstrates that electron and hole polarons localize on iron centers following MMCT. In addition to understanding how strong electronic and spin correlations can control strong electron-phonon coupling, these experiments separately measure electron and hole polaron interactions on neighboring metal centers for the first time, providing insight into a large range of charge-transfer and Mott-Hubbard insulators.</description>

Abstract: We present new atomistic models of amorphous silicon (a-Si) and hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) surfaces. The a-Si model included 4096 atoms and was obtained using local orbital density functional theory. By analyzing a slab model (periodic in two dimensions with a slab about 44 \AA{} thick), we observed a strong correlation between surface structure and surface charge density, which might be compared to STM experiments. Hydrogen atoms added near the under-coordinated surface atoms passivate dangling bonds and induce structural rearrangements. We analyze the electronic structure, including the localization of the states, and note resonant mixing between bulk and surface defect structures. We also compute the classical normal modes of the hydrogenated a-Si and compare them to experiments where possible. Our work is a step toward understanding the meaning of ``surface reconstruction" for a noncrystalline material.</description>

      <title>Resonant Raman Scattering and Optical Absorption Studies of Zn(II) Impurities in L-Alanine Single Crystal</title>

Abstract: We present a study of low-concentration Zn (II) impurities in L-Alanine Single Crystal (ZNLA) employing resonant Raman scattering and optical absorption spectroscopy. By analyzing the relative integrated intensity of the selective vibrational modes, we observe a resonant enhancement of Raman-active modes near the UV absorption band, associated with vibrations of the amino and carboxyl groups in ZNLA. These findings suggest that zinc cations occupy an interstitial position coordinated by amino and carboxyl groups. Also, ZNLA single crystal shows a strong antiresonance behavior for some modes associated with amino and carboxyl groups. The antiresonance model in the cross-section allowed the estimation of the bandgap to be 3.8 eV, which perfectly agrees with the direct bandgap obtained from the absorption spectrum (3.75 eV). Finally, our approach proves to be useful for detecting interactions between transition metal ion impurities and intramolecular structures in other transition metal-doped organic amino acid systems.</description>

      <title>Theory of fractional corner charges in cylindrical crystal shapes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.18871v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent studies showed that topologically trivial insulators may have fractionally quantized corner charges due to the topological invariant called a filling anomaly. Such crystal shapes in three dimensions are restricted to vertex-transitive polyhedra, which are classified into spherical and cylindrical families. The previous works derived formulas of the fractional corner charge for the spherical family, which corresponds to the tetrahedral and cubic space groups (SGs). In this study, we derive all the corner charge formulas for the cylindrical family, which corresponds to the orthorhombic, tetragonal, hexagonal, and trigonal crystal shapes. We show that all the real-space formulas of the filling anomaly for the cylindrical SGs are universally determined by the total charges at the Wyckoff position (WP) 1a. Moreover, we derive the k-space formulas of the corner charge for the cylindrical cases with time-reversal symmetry (TRS). From our results, we also show that CsLi$_{2}$Cl_{3}, KN_{3}, and Li_{3}N are candidate materials with a quantized corner charge by using the ab initio calculations. Together with our previous work, we exhaust corner charge formulas for all the SGs and crystal shapes having quantized corner charges.</description>

Abstract: This manuscript presents a working model linking chemical disorder and transport properties in correlated-electron perovskites with high-entropy formulations and a framework to actively design them. We demonstrate this new learning in epitaxial Sr$x$(Ti,Cr,Nb,Mo,W)O$3$ thin films that exhibit exceptional crystalline fidelity despite a diverse chemical formulation where most B-site species are highly misfit with respect to valence and radius. X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and transmission electron microscopy confirm a unique combination of chemical disorder and structural perfection in thick epitaxial layers. This combination produces significant electron correlation, low electrical resistivity, and an optical transparency window that surpasses that of constituent end-members, with a flattened frequency- and temperature-dependent response. We address the computational challenges of modeling such systems and investigate short-range ordering using cluster expansion. These results showcase that unusual d-metal combinations access an expanded property design space that is predictable using end-member characteristics -- though unavailable to them -- thus offering performance advances in optical, spintronic, and quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Enhanced magnetoelastic stress in disordered iron-gallium alloy thin films revealed by direct measurement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.12008v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The large magnetostriction in FeGa alloys is relevant for manifold applications, but for thin films, it can play a prominent role in controlling the strength of the magnetic anisotropy. Bulk samples show values depending on the extensive preparation procedure compendium, which is limited in its temperature range for high-quality thin-film synthesis. Here, we present a study of the magnetoelastic coupling coefficients $B_1$ and $B_2$ in epitaxial FeGa thin films below 50 nm deposited on the MgO(001) surface at 150 $^\circ$C by the cantilever method. Series of films with 22, 28, and 33 at. % Ga do not show thickness-dependent variations for $B_1$ and $B_2$, but $-B_1$ for the 22 at. % Ga composition is 10 MPa, roughly 2 times the bulk value and smaller than the bulk-like value of $-B_1$=12.1 MPa obtained for a film with 17 at. % Ga. This enhancement is correlated with the A2 crystal structure for the film rather than the coexistence with D0$_3$ or other ordered nanometric precipitates proposed for bulk samples. Synchrotron diffraction excludes the formation of long-range L6$_0$, or D0$_3$ precipitates in samples with (001)A2 peaks at concentrations around 25 at. % Ga, which implies partial chemical disorder. The analysis of extended x-ray absorption fine structure measurements points to a D0$_3$ local order with a residual number of Ga-Ga pairs. Considering that the substrate quenches the movable strain in the A2 phase described in dual-phase structures, our results point to the important role of the electronic structure of the iron atoms modified by the presence of Ga in the alloy. This effect enlarges $B_1$ in films with the A2 phase, stabilized using epitaxial growth.</description>

Abstract: We theoretically discover possible dc-current induction and high-harmonic generation from photodriven chiral fermions in B20-type semimetals irradiated with circularly polarized light as nonlinear optical responses with several unconventional properties. First, we find multiple sign changes of the induced bulk dc photocurrent as a function of light parameters, which is ascribed to the nature of asymmetric photon-dressed bands in chiral systems. Moreover, we observe a parity-dependent directivity of high-harmonic generation where the odd- and even-order harmonics have intensities only in directions perpendicular and parallel to the polarization plane, respectively, which can be understood from dynamical symmetry of the present photodriven chiral systems.</description>

Abstract: Nowotny chimney ladder (NCL) crystals present physical properties in between the contrasting paradigms of ideal crystal and amorphous solid, making them promising candidates for thermoelectric applications due to their inherently low thermal conductivity. Here, we report an extensive experimental characterization of the thermodynamic and thermoelectric transport properties of a large class of NCL materials, focusing on the intermetallic compound Ru$_2$Sn$_{3}$. We show that the heat capacity of these NCL compounds exhibits a boson-peak-like glassy anomaly between $8$ K and $14$ K. By combining experimental measurements with density functional theory (DFT), we attribute its microscopic origin to extremely low-energy optical phonons that universally appear as a consequence of the chimney ladder sublattice structure. Additionally, the measured thermal conductivity and the thermoelectric response present distinct anomalous glass-like features that strongly correlate with the dynamics of the low-lying optical phonons revealed by DFT. Our work demonstrates that low-energy optical modes in ordered crystals can induce glassy behavior, outlining a pathway to design metallic materials with low thermal conductivity and unique thermoelectric properties without the need for disorder or strong electronic correlations.</description>

Abstract: Altermagnets with non-relativistic momentum-dependent spin splitting and compensated net magnetic moments have recently garnered significant interest in spintronics, particularly as pinning layers in magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs). However, room-temperature (RT) altermagnet-based MTJs with tunable tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) or electroresistance (TER) modulated by multiferroicity remains largely unexplored. Here, we propose an experimentally fabricable above-RT multiferroic MTJ, comprising an altermagnetic metal, ferroelectric barrier, and ferromagnetic metal-epitomized by a CrSb/In2Se3/Fe3GaTe2 heterostructure. Our calculations with first-principles and nonequilibrium Green function method indicate that the architecture enables magnetically switchable TER, electrically tunable TMR, and dual-mode controllable spin filtering. To disentangle the roles of ferroelectricity and the tunnel barrier, non-ferroelectric Sb2Se3 and a vacuum gap are exploited as control cases. Remarkably, the system achieves TMR up to 2308 %, TER of 707 %, and near-perfect spin filtering efficiency. Both TMR and TER are considerable for CrSb/In2Se3/Fe3GaTe2 with either Cr or Sb interface. These findings demonstrate the above-RT multiferroic altermagnet-based MTJs and highlight their exciting potential as a versatile platform for next-generation spin dynamics, magnetic-sensing and quantum logic nano-devices.</description>

      <title>Extending Collinear Density Functionals to Noncollinear Cases under Periodic Boundary Condition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.15024v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate modeling of spin-orbit coupling and noncollinear magnetism in materials requires noncollinear density functionals within the two-component generalized Kohn-Sham (GKS) framework, yet constructing and implementing noncollinear functionals remains challenging. Recently, a methodology was proposed to extend collinear functionals into noncollinear ones, successfully defining noncollinear functionals and their derivatives. However, the initial implementation involved a systematic approach to differentiate energy over density matrix elements rather than the derivatives of the energy functional with respect to density, presenting challenges for integration with periodic boundary condition-density functional theory (PBC-DFT) software. We have derived a novel set of working equations based on the original methodology, which provides noncollinear energy functionals and their derivatives. These working equations have been implemented in our noncollinear functional ensemble named NCXC, ensuring numerical stability and transferability without the need for incorporating derivatives of basis functions. This implementation is expected to facilitate compatibility with most DFT software packages. We demonstrate some preliminary applications in periodic systems, including noncollinear magnetism in spin spirals, band structures in topological insulators, and band gaps in semiconducting inorganic materials, using NCXC.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.10531v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We uncover a new class of dynamical quantum instability in driven magnets leading to emergent enhancement of antiferromagnetic correlations even for purely ferromagnetic microscopic couplings. A primary parametric amplification creates a frequency-tuned nested magnon distribution in momentum space, which seeds a secondary instability marked by the emergence of enhanced antiferromagnetic correlations, mirroring the instability of nested Fermi surfaces in electronic systems. In sharp contrast to the fermionic case, however, the magnon-driven instability is intrinsically non-equilibrium and fundamentally inaccessible in thermal physics. Its quantum mechanical origin sets it apart from classical instabilities such as Faraday and modulation instabilities, which underlie several instances of dynamical behavior observed in magnetic and cold-atom systems.</description>

Abstract: Materials properties depend strongly on chemical composition, i.e., the relative amounts of each chemical element. Changes in composition lead to entirely different chemical arrangements, which vary in complexity from perfectly ordered (i.e., stoichiometric compounds) to completely disordered (i.e., solid solutions). Accurately capturing this range of chemical arrangements remains a major challenge, limiting the predictive accuracy of machine learning potentials (MLPs) in materials modeling. Here, we combine information theory and machine learning to optimize the sampling of chemical motifs and design MLPs that effectively capture the behavior of metallic alloys across their entire compositional and structural landscape. The effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated by predicting the compositional dependence of various material properties - including stacking-fault energies, short-range order, heat capacities, and phase diagrams - for the AuPt and CuAu binary alloys, the ternary CrCoNi, and the TiTaVW high-entropy alloy. Extensive comparison against experimental data demonstrates the robustness of this approach in enabling materials modeling with high physical fidelity.</description>

      <title>All-passive upconversion of incoherent near-infrared light at intensities down to 10$^{-7}$ W/cm$^2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18707v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Frequency upconversion, which converts low-energy photons into higher-energy ones, typically requires intense coherent illumination to drive nonlinear processes or the use of externally driven optoelectronic devices. Here, we demonstrate an upconversion system that converts low-intensity (down to ~10-7 W/cm$^2$) incoherent near-infrared (NIR) light into the visible, reaching intensities perceptible by the human eye, without the use of any external power input. Our upconverting element is enabled by the following ingredients: (1) photon upconversion via triplet-triplet annihilation in a bulk heterojunction of the organic semiconductors Y6 and rubrene; (2) plasmonic enhancement of absorption and field intensity in the heterojunction layer; (3) collection enhancement using a dichroic thin-film assembly. To enable high-resolution imaging, the upconverting element is inserted at an intermediate image plane of a dual-wavelength telescope system, which preserves the relative directionality of rays between the incident NIR light and output visible light. Our all-passive upconversion imaging system will enable NIR imaging and sensing in low-light environments under energy constraints.</description>

      <title>Filtering Spin and Orbital Moment in Centrosymmetric Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10773v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The control of spin and orbital angular momentum without relying on magnetic materials is commonly accomplished by breaking of inversion symmetry, which enables charge-to-spin conversion and spin selectivity in electron transfer processes occurring in chiral media. In contrast to this perspective, we show that orbital moment filtering can be accomplished in centrosymmetric systems: the electron states can be selectively manipulated allowing for the preferential transfer of electrons with a particular orbital momentum orientation. We find that orbital moment filtering is indeed efficiently controlled through orbital couplings that break both mirror and rotational symmetries. We provide the symmetry conditions required for the electron transmission to achieve orbital filtering and relate them to the orientation of the orbital moment. The presence of atomic spin-orbit interaction in the centrosymmetric transmission medium leads to the selective filtering of spin and orbital moments. Our findings allow to identify optimal regimes for having highly efficient simultaneous spin and orbital moment filtering.</description>

      <title>Overcoming light scattering with high optical nonlinearity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10423v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Achieving high-resolution optical imaging deep within heterogeneous and scattering media remains a fundamental challenge in biological microscopy, where conventional techniques are hindered by multiple light scattering and absorption. Here, we present a non-invasive imaging approach that harnesses the nonlinear response of luminescent labels in conjunction with the statistical and spatial properties of speckle patterns - an effect of random light interference. Using avalanching nanoparticles (ANPs) with strong photoluminescence nonlinearity, we demonstrate that random speckle illumination can be converted into a single, localized, sub-diffraction excitation spot. This spot can be scanned across the sample using the angular memory effect, enabling high-resolution imaging through a scattering layer. Our method is general, fast, and cost-effective. It requires no wavefront shaping, no feedback, and no reconstruction algorithm, offering a powerful new route to deep, high-resolution imaging through complex media.</description>

      <title>Revealing the Dominance of the Orbital Hall Effect over Spin in Transition Metal Heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08425v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study inverse spin and orbital Hall effects in 19 transition metals using spin-pumping driven by ferromagnetic resonance. Spin-to-charge conversion was measured in YIG/X(5), while orbital-to-charge conversion was probed in YIG/Pt(2)/X(5) heterostructures. Here, X represents the different transition metals. Surprisingly, the orbital contribution overwhelmingly dominates over the spin response, clarifying the challenge of disentangling these effects. Our results largely agree with first-principles predictions for spin and orbital Hall conductivities but reveal discrepancies in select materials. These findings emphasize the fundamental role of the orbital Hall effect, and position orbitronics as a pivotal frontier in condensed matter physics.</description>
