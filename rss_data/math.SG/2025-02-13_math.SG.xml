      <title>Positive ($S^1$-equivariant) symplectic homology of convex domains, higher capacities, and Clarke's duality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13673v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that the filtered positive ($S^1$-equivariant) symplectic homology of a convex domain is naturally isomorphic to the filtered singular ($S^1$-equivariant) homology induced by Clarke's dual functional associated with the convex domain. As a result, we prove that the Gutt-Hutchings capacities coincide with the spectral invariants introduced by Ekeland-Hofer for convex domains. From this identification, it follows that Besse convex domains can be characterized by their Gutt-Hutchings capacities, which implies that the interiors of Besse-type convex domains encode information about the Reeb flow on their boundaries. Moreover, as a corollary of the aforementioned isomorphism, we deduce that the barcode entropy associated with the singular homology induced by Clarke's dual functional provides a lower bound for the topological entropy of the Reeb flow on the boundary of a convex domain in $\mathbb{R}^{2n}$. In particular, this barcode entropy coincides with the topological entropy for convex domains in $\mathbb{R}^4$.</description>

      <title>Morse-Novikov homology and $\beta$-critical points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17809v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a manifold $M$, some closed $\beta\in\Omega^1(M)$ and a map $f\in C^\infty(M)$, a $\beta$-critical point is some $x\in M$ such that $d_\beta f_{x}=0$ for the Lichnerowicz derivative $d_\beta$. In this paper, we will give a lower bound for the number of $\beta$-critical points of index $i$ of a $\beta$-Morse function $f$ in terms of the Morse-Novikov homology, and we generalize this result to generating functions (quadratic at infinity). We also give an application to the detection of essential Liouville chords of a set length. These are a type of chords that appear in locally conformally symplectic geometry as even-dimensional analogues to Reeb chords.</description>

      <title>Torus knotted Reeb dynamics and the Calabi invariant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.18307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.18307v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish the existence of a secondary Reeb orbit set with quantitative action and linking bounds for any contact form on the standard tight three-sphere admitting the standard transverse positive $T(p,q)$ torus knot as an elliptic Reeb orbit with a canonically determined rotation number. This can be interpreted through an ergodic lens for Reeb flows transverse to a surface of section. Our results also allow us to deduce an upper bound on the mean action of periodic orbits of naturally associated classes of area preserving diffeomorphisms of the associated Seifert surfaces of genus $(p-1)(q-1)/2$ in terms of the Calabi invariant, without the need for genericity or Hamiltonian hypotheses. Our proofs utilize knot filtered embedded contact homology, which was first introduced and computed by Hutchings for the standard transverse unknot in the irrational ellipsoids and further developed in our previous work. We continue our development of nontoric methods for embedded contact homology and establish the knot filtration on the embedded contact homology chain complex of the standard tight three-sphere with respect to positive $T(p,q)$ torus knots, where there are nonvanishing differentials. We also obtain obstructions to the existence of exact symplectic cobordisms between positive transverse torus knots.</description>

      <title>Advancements in Functorial Homological Mirror Symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06951v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mostly inspired by recent work by Katzarkov, Kontsevich, and Shehsmani, combined with previous work by Aganagic, Ooguri, Saulina and Vafa with regard to BPS black hole microstate counting in terms of topological field theory calculations, we will show how these tools can be applied to concrete setups arising from String Theory, and why the formalism of functorial Homological Mirror Symmetry needs to be further developed.</description>
