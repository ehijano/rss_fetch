      <title>Recontextualized Knowledge and Narrative Coalitions on Telegram</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17855v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A defining characteristic of conspiracy texts is that they negotiate power and identity by recontextualizing prior knowledge. This dynamic has been shown to intensify on social media, where knowledge sources can readily be integrated into antagonistic narratives through hyperlinks. The objective of the present chapter is to further our understanding of this dynamic by surfacing and examining 1) how online conspiracy narratives recontextualize prior knowledge by coupling it with heterogeneous antagonistic elements, and 2) how such recontextualizing narratives operate as connectors around which diverse actors might form narrative coalitions. To this end, the chapter offers an empirical analysis of links to prior knowledge in public messaging channels from the Pushshift Telegram dataset. Using transferable methods from the field of bibliometrics, we find that politically extreme Telegram channels engage with a variety of established knowledge sources, including scientific journals, scientific repositories and other sources associated with the system of scholarly communication. Channels engaging with shared knowledge sources thereby form narrative coalitions ranging from scientific and technological imaginaries to far-right extremist and antisemitic conspiracy theories. Our analysis of these coalitions reveals (i) linguistic, political, and thematic forces that shape conspiracy narratives, (ii) emerging ideological, epistemological and ontological positions associated with online conspiracism, and (iii) how references to shared knowledge contribute to the communicability of conspiracy narratives.</description>

      <title>Comparing E-bike and Conventional Bicycle Use Patterns in a Public Bike Share System: A Case Study of Richmond, VA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The results show that pedelecs are generally associated with longer trip distances, shorter trip times, higher speeds, and lower rates of uphill elevation change. The origin-destination analysis considering the business, mixed use, residential, and other uses shows extremely similar trends, with a large number of trips staying within either business or residential locations or mixed use. The roadway use analysis shows that pedelecs are used farther outside of the city than bikes.</description>

      <title>Trust Dynamics and Market Behavior in Cryptocurrency: A Comparative Study of Centralized and Decentralized Exchanges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17227v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the evolving landscape of digital finance, the transition from centralized to decentralized trust mechanisms, primarily driven by blockchain technology, plays a critical role in shaping the cryptocurrency ecosystem. This paradigm shift raises questions about the traditional reliance on centralized trust and introduces a novel, decentralized trust framework built upon distributed networks. Our research delves into the consequences of this shift, particularly focusing on how incidents influence trust within cryptocurrency markets, thereby affecting trade behaviors in centralized (CEXs) and decentralized exchanges (DEXs). We conduct a comprehensive analysis of various events, assessing their effects on market dynamics, including token valuation and trading volumes in both CEXs and DEXs. Our findings highlight the pivotal role of trust in directing user preferences and the fluidity of trust transfer between centralized and decentralized platforms. Despite certain anomalies, the results largely align with our initial hypotheses, revealing the intricate nature of user trust in cryptocurrency markets. This study contributes significantly to interdisciplinary research, bridging distributed systems, behavioral finance, and Decentralized Finance (DeFi). It offers valuable insights for the distributed computing community, particularly in understanding and applying distributed trust mechanisms in digital economies, paving the way for future research that could further explore the socio-economic dimensions and leverage blockchain data in this dynamic domain.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Fairness in Neural Networks Using FairVIC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18134v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mitigating bias in automated decision-making systems, specifically deep learning models, is a critical challenge in achieving fairness. This complexity stems from factors such as nuanced definitions of fairness, unique biases in each dataset, and the trade-off between fairness and model accuracy. To address such issues, we introduce FairVIC, an innovative approach designed to enhance fairness in neural networks by addressing inherent biases at the training stage. FairVIC differs from traditional approaches that typically address biases at the data preprocessing stage. Instead, it integrates variance, invariance and covariance into the loss function to minimise the model's dependency on protected characteristics for making predictions, thus promoting fairness. Our experimentation and evaluation consists of training neural networks on three datasets known for their biases, comparing our results to state-of-the-art algorithms, evaluating on different sizes of model architectures, and carrying out sensitivity analysis to examine the fairness-accuracy trade-off. Through our implementation of FairVIC, we observed a significant improvement in fairness across all metrics tested, without compromising the model's accuracy to a detrimental extent. Our findings suggest that FairVIC presents a straightforward, out-of-the-box solution for the development of fairer deep learning models, thereby offering a generalisable solution applicable across many tasks and datasets.</description>

      <title>Decentralized Peer Review in Open Science: A Mechanism Proposal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18148v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Peer review is a laborious, yet essential, part of academic publishing with crucial impact on the scientific endeavor. The current lack of incentives and transparency harms the credibility of this process. Researchers are neither rewarded for superior nor penalized for bad reviews. Additionally, confidential reports cause a loss of insights and make the review process vulnerable to scientific misconduct. We propose a community-owned and -governed system that 1) remunerates reviewers for their efforts, 2) publishes the (anonymized) reports for scrutiny by the community, 3) tracks reputation of reviewers and 4) provides digital certificates. Automated by transparent smart-contract blockchain technology, the system aims to increase quality and speed of peer review while lowering the chance and impact of erroneous judgements.</description>

      <title>Near-Term Enforcement of AI Chip Export Controls Using A Minimal Firmware-Based Design for Offline Licensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18308v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Offline licensing is a technical mechanism for compute governance that could be used to prevent unregulated training of potentially dangerous frontier AI models. The mechanism works by disabling AI chips unless they have an up-to-date license from a regulator. In this report, we present a technical design for a minimal version of offline licensing that could be delivered via a firmware update. Existing AI chips could potentially support offline licensing within a year if they have the following (relatively common) hardware security features: firmware verification, firmware rollback protection, and secure non-volatile memory. Public documentation suggests that NVIDIA's H100 AI chip already has these security features. Without additional hardware modifications, the system is susceptible to physical hardware attacks. However, these attacks might require expensive equipment and could be difficult to reliably apply to thousands of AI chips. A firmware-based offline licensing design shares the same legal requirements and license approval mechanism as a hardware-based solution. Implementing a firmware-based solution now could accelerate the eventual deployment of a more secure hardware-based solution in the future. For AI chip manufacturers, implementing this security mechanism might allow chips to be sold to customers that would otherwise be prohibited by export restrictions. For governments, it may be important to be able to prevent unsafe or malicious actors from training frontier AI models in the next few years. Based on this initial analysis, firmware-based offline licensing could partially solve urgent security and trade problems and is technically feasible for AI chips that have common hardware security features.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18518v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generative large-scale language models create the fifth paradigm of scientific research, organically combine data science and computational intelligence, transform the research paradigm of natural language processing and multimodal information processing, promote the new trend of AI-enabled social science research, and provide new ideas for digital humanities research and application. This article profoundly explores the application of large-scale language models in digital humanities research, revealing their significant potential in ancient book protection, intelligent processing, and academic innovation. The article first outlines the importance of ancient book resources and the necessity of digital preservation, followed by a detailed introduction to developing large-scale language models, such as ChatGPT, and their applications in document management, content understanding, and cross-cultural research. Through specific cases, the article demonstrates how AI can assist in the organization, classification, and content generation of ancient books. Then, it explores the prospects of AI applications in artistic innovation and cultural heritage preservation. Finally, the article explores the challenges and opportunities in the interaction of technology, information, and society in the digital humanities triggered by AI technologies.</description>

      <title>Towards A Structured Overview of Use Cases for Natural Language Processing in the Legal Domain: A German Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18759v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, the field of Legal Tech has risen in prevalence, as the Natural Language Processing (NLP) and legal disciplines have combined forces to digitalize legal processes. Amidst the steady flow of research solutions stemming from the NLP domain, the study of use cases has fallen behind, leading to a number of innovative technical methods without a place in practice. In this work, we aim to build a structured overview of Legal Tech use cases, grounded in NLP literature, but also supplemented by voices from legal practice in Germany. Based upon a Systematic Literature Review, we identify seven categories of NLP technologies for the legal domain, which are then studied in juxtaposition to 22 legal use cases. In the investigation of these use cases, we identify 15 ethical, legal, and social aspects (ELSA), shedding light on the potential concerns of digitally transforming the legal domain.</description>

Abstract: Across the African continent, students grapple with various educational challenges, including limited access to essential resources such as computers, internet connectivity, reliable electricity, and a shortage of qualified teachers. Despite these challenges, recent advances in AI such as BERT, and GPT-4 have demonstrated their potential for advancing education. Yet, these AI tools tend to be deployed and evaluated predominantly within the context of Western educational settings, with limited attention directed towards the unique needs and challenges faced by students in Africa. In this chapter, we discuss challenges with using AI to advance education across Africa. Then, we describe our work developing and deploying AI in Education tools in Africa for science and computing education: (1) SuaCode, an AI-powered app that enables Africans to learn to code using their smartphones, (2) AutoGrad, an automated grading, and feedback tool for graphical and interactive coding assignments, (3) a tool for code plagiarism detection that shows visual evidence of plagiarism, (4) Kwame, a bilingual AI teaching assistant for coding courses, (5) Kwame for Science, a web-based AI teaching assistant that provides instant answers to students' science questions and (6) Brilla AI, an AI contestant for the National Science and Maths Quiz competition. Finally, we discuss potential opportunities to leverage AI to advance education across Africa.</description>

      <title>Towards Measuring and Modeling "Culture" in LLMs: A Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15412v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a survey of 39 recent papers that aim to study cultural representation and inclusion in large language models. We observe that none of the studies define "culture," which is a complex, multifaceted concept; instead, they probe the models on some specially designed datasets which represent certain aspects of "culture." We call these aspects the proxies of cultures, and organize them across three dimensions of demographic, semantic and linguistic-cultural interaction proxies. We also categorize the probing methods employed. Our analysis indicates that only certain aspects of "culture," such as values and objectives, have been studied, leaving several other interesting and important facets, especially the multitude of semantic domains (Thompson et al., 2020) and aboutness (Hershcovich et al., 2022), unexplored. Two other crucial gaps are the lack of robustness and situatedness of the current methods. Based on these observations, we provide several recommendations for a holistic and practically useful research agenda for furthering cultural inclusion in LLMs and LLM-based applications.</description>

      <title>A Legal Risk Taxonomy for Generative Artificial Intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09479v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For the first time, this paper presents a taxonomy of legal risks associated with generative AI (GenAI) by breaking down complex legal concepts to provide a common understanding of potential legal challenges for developing and deploying GenAI models. The methodology is based on (1) examining the legal claims that have been filed in existing lawsuits and (2) evaluating the reasonably foreseeable legal claims that may be filed in future lawsuits. First, we identified 22 lawsuits against prominent GenAI entities and tallied the claims of each lawsuit. From there, we identified seven claims that are cited at least four times across these lawsuits as the most likely claims for future GenAI lawsuits. For each of these seven claims, we describe the elements of the claim (what the plaintiff must prove to prevail) and provide an example of how it may apply to GenAI. Next, we identified 30 other potential claims that we consider to be more speculative, because they have been included in fewer than four lawsuits or have yet to be filed. We further separated those 30 claims into 19 that are most likely to be made in relation to pre-deployment of GenAI models and 11 that are more likely to be made in connection with post-deployment of GenAI models since the legal risks will vary between entities that create versus deploy them. For each of these claims, we describe the elements of the claim and the potential remedies that plaintiffs may seek to help entities determine their legal risks in developing or deploying GenAI. Lastly, we close the paper by noting the novelty of GenAI technology and propose some applications for the paper's taxonomy in driving further research.</description>

      <title>Beyond Trial-and-Error: Predicting User Abandonment After a Moderation Intervention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14846v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Current content moderation practices follow the trial-and-error approach, meaning that moderators apply sequences of interventions until they obtain the desired outcome. However, being able to preemptively estimate the effects of an intervention would allow moderators the unprecedented opportunity to plan their actions ahead of application. As a first step towards this goal, here we propose and tackle the novel task of predicting the effect of a moderation intervention. We study the reactions of 16,540 users to a massive ban of online communities on Reddit, training a set of binary classifiers to identify those users who would abandon the platform after the intervention - a problem of great practical relevance. We leverage a dataset of 13.8M posts to compute a large and diverse set of 142 features, which convey information about the activity, toxicity, relations, and writing style of the users. We obtain promising results, with the best-performing model achieving micro F1 = 0.800 and macro F1 = 0.676. Our model demonstrates robust generalizability when applied to users from previously unseen communities. Furthermore, we identify activity features as the most informative predictors, followed by relational and toxicity features, while writing style features exhibit limited utility. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of predicting the effects of a moderation intervention, paving the way for a new research direction in predictive content moderation aimed at empowering moderators with intelligent tools to plan ahead their actions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.16244v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper focuses on the opportunities and the ethical and societal risks posed by advanced AI assistants. We define advanced AI assistants as artificial agents with natural language interfaces, whose function is to plan and execute sequences of actions on behalf of a user, across one or more domains, in line with the user's expectations. The paper starts by considering the technology itself, providing an overview of AI assistants, their technical foundations and potential range of applications. It then explores questions around AI value alignment, well-being, safety and malicious uses. Extending the circle of inquiry further, we next consider the relationship between advanced AI assistants and individual users in more detail, exploring topics such as manipulation and persuasion, anthropomorphism, appropriate relationships, trust and privacy. With this analysis in place, we consider the deployment of advanced assistants at a societal scale, focusing on cooperation, equity and access, misinformation, economic impact, the environment and how best to evaluate advanced AI assistants. Finally, we conclude by providing a range of recommendations for researchers, developers, policymakers and public stakeholders.</description>

      <title>Warmth and competence in human-agent cooperation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2201.13448v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Interaction and cooperation with humans are overarching aspirations of artificial intelligence (AI) research. Recent studies demonstrate that AI agents trained with deep reinforcement learning are capable of collaborating with humans. These studies primarily evaluate human compatibility through "objective" metrics such as task performance, obscuring potential variation in the levels of trust and subjective preference that different agents garner. To better understand the factors shaping subjective preferences in human-agent cooperation, we train deep reinforcement learning agents in Coins, a two-player social dilemma. We recruit $N = 501$ participants for a human-agent cooperation study and measure their impressions of the agents they encounter. Participants' perceptions of warmth and competence predict their stated preferences for different agents, above and beyond objective performance metrics. Drawing inspiration from social science and biology research, we subsequently implement a new ``partner choice'' framework to elicit revealed preferences: after playing an episode with an agent, participants are asked whether they would like to play the next episode with the same agent or to play alone. As with stated preferences, social perception better predicts participants' revealed preferences than does objective performance. Given these results, we recommend human-agent interaction researchers routinely incorporate the measurement of social perception and subjective preferences into their studies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2302.10786v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Africa has a high student-to-teacher ratio which limits students' access to teachers for learning support such as educational question answering. In this work, we extended Kwame, a bilingual AI teaching assistant for coding education, adapted it for science education, and deployed it as a web app. Kwame for Science provides passages from well-curated knowledge sources and related past national exam questions as answers to questions from students based on the Integrated Science subject of the West African Senior Secondary Certificate Examination (WASSCE). Furthermore, students can view past national exam questions along with their answers and filter by year, question type, and topics that were automatically categorized by a topic detection model which we developed (91% unweighted average recall). We deployed Kwame for Science in the real world over 8 months and had 750 users across 32 countries (15 in Africa) and 1.5K questions asked. Our evaluation showed an 87.2% top 3 accuracy (n=109 questions) implying that Kwame for Science has a high chance of giving at least one useful answer among the 3 displayed. We categorized the reasons the model incorrectly answered questions to provide insights for future improvements. We also share challenges and lessons with the development, deployment, and human-computer interaction component of such a tool to enable other researchers to deploy similar tools. With a first-of-its-kind tool within the African context, Kwame for Science has the potential to enable the delivery of scalable, cost-effective, and quality remote education to millions of people across Africa.</description>

      <title>Topics, Authors, and Institutions in Large Language Model Research: Trends from 17K arXiv Papers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.10700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.10700v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are dramatically influencing AI research, spurring discussions on what has changed so far and how to shape the field's future. To clarify such questions, we analyze a new dataset of 16,979 LLM-related arXiv papers, focusing on recent trends in 2023 vs. 2018-2022. First, we study disciplinary shifts: LLM research increasingly considers societal impacts, evidenced by 20x growth in LLM submissions to the Computers and Society sub-arXiv. An influx of new authors -- half of all first authors in 2023 -- are entering from non-NLP fields of CS, driving disciplinary expansion. Second, we study industry and academic publishing trends. Surprisingly, industry accounts for a smaller publication share in 2023, largely due to reduced output from Google and other Big Tech companies; universities in Asia are publishing more. Third, we study institutional collaboration: while industry-academic collaborations are common, they tend to focus on the same topics that industry focuses on rather than bridging differences. The most prolific institutions are all US- or China-based, but there is very little cross-country collaboration. We discuss implications around (1) how to support the influx of new authors, (2) how industry trends may affect academics, and (3) possible effects of (the lack of) collaboration.</description>

      <title>Describing Differences in Image Sets with Natural Language</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.02974v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: How do two sets of images differ? Discerning set-level differences is crucial for understanding model behaviors and analyzing datasets, yet manually sifting through thousands of images is impractical. To aid in this discovery process, we explore the task of automatically describing the differences between two $\textbf{sets}$ of images, which we term Set Difference Captioning. This task takes in image sets $D_A$ and $D_B$, and outputs a description that is more often true on $D_A$ than $D_B$. We outline a two-stage approach that first proposes candidate difference descriptions from image sets and then re-ranks the candidates by checking how well they can differentiate the two sets. We introduce VisDiff, which first captions the images and prompts a language model to propose candidate descriptions, then re-ranks these descriptions using CLIP. To evaluate VisDiff, we collect VisDiffBench, a dataset with 187 paired image sets with ground truth difference descriptions. We apply VisDiff to various domains, such as comparing datasets (e.g., ImageNet vs. ImageNetV2), comparing classification models (e.g., zero-shot CLIP vs. supervised ResNet), summarizing model failure modes (supervised ResNet), characterizing differences between generative models (e.g., StableDiffusionV1 and V2), and discovering what makes images memorable. Using VisDiff, we are able to find interesting and previously unknown differences in datasets and models, demonstrating its utility in revealing nuanced insights.</description>

      <title>How Platform Exchange and Safeguards Matter: The Case of Sexual Risk in Airbnb and Couchsurfing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18705v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent work in CHI and CSCW has devoted increasing attention to how the design of network hospitality platforms shapes user experiences and relational outcomes. In this article, I interrogate how different risk factors emerge based on the type of exchanges these platforms facilitate. To do so, I juxtapose two prominent network hospitality platforms: one facilitating negotiated exchange (i.e., Airbnb) with another facilitating reciprocal exchange (i.e., Couchsurfing). Homing in on sexual risk, an underexplored form of platform danger, and drawing on interviews with 40 female dual-platform users, I argue that Airbnb's provision of binding negotiated exchange and institutional safeguards reduces risk through three mechanisms: casting initial guest-host relation into a buyer-seller arrangement, stabilizing interactional scripts, and formalizing sexual violence recourse. Conversely, Couchsurfing's focus on reciprocal exchange and lack of safeguards increase sexual precarity for users both on- and off-platform. This study demonstrates how platforms with strong prosocial motivations can jeopardize sociality and concludes with design implications for protecting vulnerable user populations.</description>

      <title>Prompting ChatGPT for Translation: A Comparative Analysis of Translation Brief and Persona Prompts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00127v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Prompt engineering has shown potential for improving translation quality in LLMs. However, the possibility of using translation concepts in prompt design remains largely underexplored. Against this backdrop, the current paper discusses the effectiveness of incorporating the conceptual tool of translation brief and the personas of translator and author into prompt design for translation tasks in ChatGPT. Findings suggest that, although certain elements are constructive in facilitating human-to-human communication for translation tasks, their effectiveness is limited for improving translation quality in ChatGPT. This accentuates the need for explorative research on how translation theorists and practitioners can develop the current set of conceptual tools rooted in the human-to-human communication paradigm for translation purposes in this emerging workflow involving human-machine interaction, and how translation concepts developed in translation studies can inform the training of GPT models for translation tasks.</description>

      <title>Brilla AI: AI Contestant for the National Science and Maths Quiz</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01699v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The African continent lacks enough qualified teachers which hampers the provision of adequate learning support. An AI could potentially augment the efforts of the limited number of teachers, leading to better learning outcomes. Towards that end, this work describes and evaluates the first key output for the NSMQ AI Grand Challenge, which proposes a robust, real-world benchmark for such an AI: "Build an AI to compete live in Ghana's National Science and Maths Quiz (NSMQ) competition and win - performing better than the best contestants in all rounds and stages of the competition". The NSMQ is an annual live science and mathematics competition for senior secondary school students in Ghana in which 3 teams of 2 students compete by answering questions across biology, chemistry, physics, and math in 5 rounds over 5 progressive stages until a winning team is crowned for that year. In this work, we built Brilla AI, an AI contestant that we deployed to unofficially compete remotely and live in the Riddles round of the 2023 NSMQ Grand Finale, the first of its kind in the 30-year history of the competition. Brilla AI is currently available as a web app that livestreams the Riddles round of the contest, and runs 4 machine learning systems: (1) speech to text (2) question extraction (3) question answering and (4) text to speech that work together in real-time to quickly and accurately provide an answer, and then say it with a Ghanaian accent. In its debut, our AI answered one of the 4 riddles ahead of the 3 human contesting teams, unofficially placing second (tied). Improvements and extensions of this AI could potentially be deployed to offer science tutoring to students and eventually enable millions across Africa to have one-on-one learning interactions, democratizing science education.</description>

      <title>The WMDP Benchmark: Measuring and Reducing Malicious Use With Unlearning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03218v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The White House Executive Order on Artificial Intelligence highlights the risks of large language models (LLMs) empowering malicious actors in developing biological, cyber, and chemical weapons. To measure these risks of malicious use, government institutions and major AI labs are developing evaluations for hazardous capabilities in LLMs. However, current evaluations are private, preventing further research into mitigating risk. Furthermore, they focus on only a few, highly specific pathways for malicious use. To fill these gaps, we publicly release the Weapons of Mass Destruction Proxy (WMDP) benchmark, a dataset of 3,668 multiple-choice questions that serve as a proxy measurement of hazardous knowledge in biosecurity, cybersecurity, and chemical security. WMDP was developed by a consortium of academics and technical consultants, and was stringently filtered to eliminate sensitive information prior to public release. WMDP serves two roles: first, as an evaluation for hazardous knowledge in LLMs, and second, as a benchmark for unlearning methods to remove such hazardous knowledge. To guide progress on unlearning, we develop RMU, a state-of-the-art unlearning method based on controlling model representations. RMU reduces model performance on WMDP while maintaining general capabilities in areas such as biology and computer science, suggesting that unlearning may be a concrete path towards reducing malicious use from LLMs. We release our benchmark and code publicly at https://wmdp.ai</description>

      <title>Public-private funding models in open source software development: A case study on scikit-learn</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06484v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Governments are increasingly funding open source software (OSS) development to support software security, digital sovereignty, and national competitiveness in science and innovation, amongst others. However, little is known about how OSS developers evaluate the relative benefits and drawbacks of emergent governmental funding for OSS. This paper explores this question through a case study on scikit-learn, a popular Python library for machine learning, which has been funded by public research grants, commercial sponsorship, micro-donations, and a 32 million euro grant announced in France's artificial intelligence strategy. Through 25 interviews with scikit-learn's maintainers and funders, this study makes two key contributions to research and practice. First, it contributes novel empirical findings on the effective design and implementation of a public-private funding model in an OSS project, as well as how the maintainers of scikit-learn have designed and employed governance protocols to balance the diverse interests of their funders and to safeguard their community ethos. Second, it offers practical lessons on funding in community-led OSS projects and makes recommendations to practitioners. The paper concludes with a discussion of the key recommendations.</description>

      <title>What Hides behind Unfairness? Exploring Dynamics Fairness in Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10942v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In sequential decision-making problems involving sensitive attributes like race and gender, reinforcement learning (RL) agents must carefully consider long-term fairness while maximizing returns. Recent works have proposed many different types of fairness notions, but how unfairness arises in RL problems remains unclear. In this paper, we address this gap in the literature by investigating the sources of inequality through a causal lens. We first analyse the causal relationships governing the data generation process and decompose the effect of sensitive attributes on long-term well-being into distinct components. We then introduce a novel notion called dynamics fairness, which explicitly captures the inequality stemming from environmental dynamics, distinguishing it from those induced by decision-making or inherited from the past. This notion requires evaluating the expected changes in the next state and the reward induced by changing the value of the sensitive attribute while holding everything else constant. To quantitatively evaluate this counterfactual concept, we derive identification formulas that allow us to obtain reliable estimations from data. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed techniques in explaining, detecting, and reducing inequality in reinforcement learning. We publicly release code at https://github.com/familyld/InsightFair.</description>
