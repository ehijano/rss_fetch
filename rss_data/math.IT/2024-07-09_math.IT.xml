      <title>Optimal Quantized Compressed Sensing via Projected Gradient Descent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper provides a unified treatment to the recovery of structured signals living in a star-shaped set from general quantized measurements $\mathcal{Q}(\mathbf{A}\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{\tau})$, where $\mathbf{A}$ is a sensing matrix, $\mathbf{\tau}$ is a vector of (possibly random) quantization thresholds, and $\mathcal{Q}$ denotes an $L$-level quantizer. The ideal estimator with consistent quantized measurements is optimal in some important instances but typically infeasible to compute. To this end, we study the projected gradient descent (PGD) algorithm with respect to the one-sided $\ell_1$-loss and identify the conditions under which PGD achieves the same error rate, up to logarithmic factors. For multi-bit case, these conditions only ensure local convergence, and we further develop a complementary approach based on product embedding. When applied to popular models such as 1-bit compressed sensing with Gaussian $\mathbf{A}$ and zero $\mathbf{\tau}$ and the dithered 1-bit/multi-bit models with sub-Gaussian $\mathbf{A}$ and uniform dither $\mathbf{\tau}$, our unified treatment yields error rates that improve on or match the sharpest results in all instances. Particularly, PGD achieves the information-theoretic optimal rate $\tilde{O}(\frac{k}{mL})$ for recovering $k$-sparse signals, and the rate $\tilde{O}((\frac{k}{mL})^{1/3})$ for effectively sparse signals. For 1-bit compressed sensing of sparse signals, our result recovers the optimality of normalized binary iterative hard thresholding (NBIHT) that was proved very recently.</description>

      <title>Wi-Fi Beyond Communications: Experimental Evaluation of Respiration Monitoring and Motion Detection Using COTS Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wi-Fi sensing has become an attractive option for non-invasive monitoring of human activities and vital signs. This paper explores the feasibility of using state-of-the-art commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) devices for Wi-Fi sensing applications, particularly respiration monitoring and motion detection. We utilize the Intel AX210 network interface card (NIC) to transmit Wi-Fi signals in both 2.4 GHz and 6 GHz frequency bands. Our experiments rely on channel frequency response (CFR) and received signal strength indicator (RSSI) data, which are processed using a moving average algorithm to extract human behavior patterns. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in capturing and representing human respiration and motion patterns. Furthermore, we compare the performance of Wi-Fi sensing across different frequency bands, highlighting the advantages of using higher frequencies for improved sensitivity and clarity. Our findings showcase the practicality of using COTS devices for Wi-Fi sensing and lay the groundwork for the development of non-invasive, contactless sensing systems. These systems have potential applications in various fields, including healthcare, smart homes, and Metaverse.</description>

      <title>RIS-assisted Coverage Enhancement in mmWave Integrated Sensing and Communication Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05249v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) has emerged as a promising technology to facilitate high-rate communications and super-resolution sensing, particularly operating in the millimeter wave (mmWave) band. However, the vulnerability of mmWave signals to blockages severely impairs ISAC capabilities and coverage. To tackle this, an efficient and low-cost solution is to deploy distributed reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) to construct virtual links between the base stations (BSs) and users in a controllable fashion. In this paper, we investigate the generalized RIS-assisted mmWave ISAC networks considering the blockage effect, and examine the beneficial impact of RISs on the coverage rate utilizing stochastic geometry. Specifically, taking into account the coupling effect of ISAC dual functions within the same network topology, we derive the conditional coverage probability of ISAC performance for two association cases, based on the proposed beam pattern model and user association policies. Then, the marginal coverage rate is calculated by combining these two cases through the distance-dependent thinning method. Simulation results verify the accuracy of derived theoretical formulations and provide valuable guidelines for the practical network deployment. Specifically, our results indicate the superiority of the RIS deployment with the density of 40 km${}^{-2}$ BSs, and that the joint coverage rate of ISAC performance exhibits potential growth from $67.1\%$ to $92.2\%$ with the deployment of RISs.</description>

      <title>Improved Channel Coding Performance Through Cost Variability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05260v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Channel coding for discrete memoryless channels (DMCs) with mean and variance cost constraints has been studied recently. In this work, we show that there is coding performance improvement due to the cost variability, both with feedback and without feedback. We demonstrate this improvement over the almost-sure cost constraint that prohibits any cost variation above a fixed threshold.</description>

      <title>DM-MIMO: Diffusion Models for Robust Semantic Communications over MIMO Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05289v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates robust semantic communications over multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) fading channels. Current semantic communications over MIMO channels mainly focus on channel adaptive encoding and decoding, which lacks exploration of signal distribution. To leverage the potential of signal distribution in signal space denoising, we develop a diffusion model over MIMO channels (DM-MIMO), a plugin module at the receiver side in conjunction with singular value decomposition (SVD) based precoding and equalization. Specifically, due to the significant variations in effective noise power over distinct sub-channels, we determine the effective sampling steps accordingly and devise a joint sampling algorithm. Utilizing a three-stage training algorithm, DM-MIMO learns the distribution of the encoded signal, which enables noise elimination over all sub-channels. Experimental results demonstrate that the DM-MIMO effectively reduces the mean square errors (MSE) of the equalized signal and the DM-MIMO semantic communication system (DM-MIMO-JSCC) outperforms the JSCC-based semantic communication system in image reconstruction.</description>

      <title>Multi-level Reliability Interface for Semantic Communications over Wireless Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05487v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semantic communication, when examined through the lens of joint source-channel coding (JSCC), maps source messages directly into channel input symbols, where the measure of success is defined by end-to-end distortion rather than traditional metrics such as block error rate. Previous studies have shown significant improvements achieved through deep learning (DL)-driven JSCC compared to traditional separate source and channel coding. However, JSCC is impractical in existing communication networks, where application and network providers are typically different entities connected over general-purpose TCP/IP links. In this paper, we propose designing the source and channel mappings separately and sequentially via a novel multi-level reliability interface. This conceptual interface enables semi-JSCC at both the learned source and channel mappers and achieves many of the gains observed in existing DL-based JSCC work (which would require a fully joint design between the application and the network), such as lower end-to-end distortion and graceful degradation of distortion with channel quality. We believe this work represents an important step towards realizing semantic communications in wireless networks.</description>

      <title>Study of Clustered Robust Linear Precoding for Cell-Free MU-MIMO Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05517v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Precoding techniques are key to dealing with multiuser interference in the downlink of cell-free (CF) multiple-input multiple-output systems. However, these techniques rely on accurate estimates of the channel state information at the transmitter (CSIT), which is not possible to obtain in practical systems. As a result, precoders cannot handle interference as expected and the residual interference substantially degrades the performance of the system. To address this problem, CF systems require precoders that are robust to CSIT imperfections. In this paper, we propose novel robust precoding techniques to mitigate the effects of residual multiuser interference. To this end, we include a loading term that minimizes the effects of the imperfect CSIT in the optimization objective. We further derive robust precoders that employ clusters of users and access points to reduce the computational cost and the signaling load. Numerical experiments show that the proposed robust minimum mean-square error (MMSE) precoding techniques outperform the conventional MMSE precoder for various accuracy levels of CSIT estimates.</description>

      <title>Recovering a Message from an Incomplete Set of Noisy Fragments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of communicating over a channel that breaks the message block into fragments of random lengths, shuffles them out of order, and deletes a random fraction of the fragments. Such a channel is motivated by applications in molecular data storage and forensics, and we refer to it as the torn-paper channel. We characterize the capacity of this channel under arbitrary fragment length distributions and deletion probabilities. Precisely, we show that the capacity is given by a closed-form expression that can be interpreted as F - A, where F is the coverage fraction ,i.e., the fraction of the input codeword that is covered by output fragments, and A is an alignment cost incurred due to the lack of ordering in the output fragments. We then consider a noisy version of the problem, where the fragments are corrupted by binary symmetric noise. We derive upper and lower bounds to the capacity, both of which can be seen as F - A expressions. These bounds match for specific choices of fragment length distributions, and they are approximately tight in cases where there are not too many short fragments.</description>

      <title>Enabling 6G Performance in the Upper Mid-Band Through Gigantic MIMO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The initial 6G networks will likely operate in the upper mid-band (7-24 GHz), which has decent propagation conditions but underwhelming new spectrum availability. In this paper, we explore whether we can anyway reach the ambitious 6G performance goals by evolving the multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) technology from being massive to gigantic. We describe how many antennas are needed and can realistically be deployed, and what the peak user rate and degrees-of-freedom (DOF) can become. We further suggest a new deployment strategy that enables the utilization of radiative near-field effects in these bands for precise beamfocusing, localization, and sensing from a single base station site. We also identify five open research challenges that must be overcome to efficiently use gigantic MIMO dimensions in 6G from hardware, cost, and algorithmic perspectives.</description>

      <title>Robust Precoding Designs for Multiuser MIMO Systems with Limited Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05636v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It has been well known that the achievable rate of multiuser multiple-input multiple-output systems with limited feedback is severely degraded by quantization errors when the number of feedback bits is not sufficient. To overcome such a rate degradation, we propose new robust precoding designs which can compensate for the quantization errors. In this paper, we first analyze the achievable rate of traditional precoding designs for limited feedback systems. Then, we obtain an approximation of the second-order statistics of quantized channel state information. With the aid of the derived approximation, we propose robust precoding designs in terms of the mean square error (MSE) with conditional expectation in non-iterative and iterative fashions. For the non-iterative precoding design, we study a robust minimum MSE (MMSE) precoding algorithm by extending a new channel decomposition. Also, in the case of iterative precoding, we investigate a robust weighted MMSE (WMMSE) precoding to further improve the achievable rate. Simulation results show that the proposed precoding schemes yield significant improvements over traditional precoding designs.</description>

      <title>Spatial Non-Stationary Dual-Wideband Channel Estimation for XL-MIMO Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the channel estimation problem for extremely large-scale multi-input and multi-output (XL-MIMO) systems, considering the spherical wavefront effect, spatially non-stationary (SnS) property, and dual-wideband effects. To accurately characterize the XL-MIMO channel, we first derive a novel spatial-and-frequency-domain channel model for XL-MIMO systems and carefully examine the channel characteristics in the angular-and-delay domain. Based on the obtained channel representation, we formulate XL-MIMO channel estimation as a Bayesian inference problem. To fully exploit the clustered sparsity of angular-and-delay channels and capture the inter-antenna and inter-subcarrier correlations, a Markov random field (MRF)-based hierarchical prior model is adopted. Meanwhile, to facilitate efficient channel reconstruction, we propose a sparse Bayesian learning (SBL) algorithm based on approximate message passing (AMP) with a unitary transformation. Tailored to the MRF-based hierarchical prior model, the message passing equations are reformulated using structured variational inference, belief propagation, and mean-field rules. Finally, simulation results validate the convergence and superiority of the proposed algorithm over existing methods.</description>

      <title>Revisit the Arimoto-Blahut algorithm: New Analysis with Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By the seminal paper of Claude Shannon \cite{Shannon48}, the computation of the capacity of a discrete memoryless channel has been considered as one of the most important and fundamental problems in Information Theory. Nearly 50 years ago, Arimoto and Blahut independently proposed identical algorithms to solve this problem in their seminal papers \cite{Arimoto1972AnAF, Blahut1972ComputationOC}. The Arimoto-Blahut algorithm was proven to converge to the capacity of the channel as $t \to \infty$ with the convergence rate upper bounded by $O\left(\log(m)/t\right)$, where $m$ is the size of the input distribution, and being inverse exponential when there is a unique solution in the interior of the input probability simplex \cite{Arimoto1972AnAF}. Recently it was proved, in \cite{Nakagawa2020AnalysisOT}, that the convergence rate is at worst inverse linear $O(1/t)$ in some specific cases.
  In this paper, we revisit this fundamental algorithm looking at the rate of convergence to the capacity and the time complexity, given $m,n$, where $n$ is size of the output of the channel, focusing on the approximation of the capacity. We prove that the rate of convergence to an $\varepsilon$-optimal solution, for any constant $\varepsilon &gt; 0$, is inverse exponential $O\left(\log(m)/c^t\right)$, for a constant $c &gt; 1$ and $O\left(\log \left(\log (m)/\varepsilon\right)\right)$ at most iterations, implying $O\left(m n\log \left(\log (m)/\varepsilon\right)\right)$ total complexity of the algorithm.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06050v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We reconsider the problem of joint power control and beamforming design to maximize the weighted sum rate in large and potentially cell-free massive MIMO networks. In contrast to the available short-term methods, where an iterative algorithm is run for every instantaneous channel realization, we derive an iterative algorithm that can be run only sporadically leveraging known channel statistics, with minor performance loss. In addition, our algorithm also applies to the design of non-trivial cooperative beamforming schemes subject to limited sharing of instantaneous channel state information. Furthermore, our algorithm generalizes and outperforms the competing long-term methods from the massive MIMO literature, which are restricted to long-term power control only or to long-term joint power control and large-scale fading decoding design.</description>

      <title>R\'enyi Common Information for Doubly Symmetric Binary Sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note, we provide analytic expressions for the R\'enyi common information of orders in $(1,\infty)$ for the doubly symmetric binary source (DSBS). Until now, analytic expressions for the R\'enyi common information of all orders in $[0,\infty]$ have been completely known for this source. We also consider the R\'enyi common information of all orders in $[-\infty,0)$ and evaluate it for the DSBS. We provide a sufficient condition under which the R\'enyi common information of such orders coincides with Wyner's common information for the DSBS. Based on numerical analysis, we conjecture that there is a certain phase transition as the crossover probability increasing for the R\'enyi common information of negative orders for the DSBS. Our proofs are based on a lemma on splitting of the entropy and the analytic expression of relaxed Wyner's common information.</description>

      <title>Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning for Distributed Satellite Routing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.17666v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning (MA-DRL) approach for routing in Low Earth Orbit Satellite Constellations (LSatCs). Each satellite is an independent decision-making agent with a partial knowledge of the environment, and supported by feedback received from the nearby agents. Building on our previous work that introduced a Q-routing solution, the contribution of this paper is to extend it to a deep learning framework able to quickly adapt to the network and traffic changes, and based on two phases: (1) An offline exploration learning phase that relies on a global Deep Neural Network (DNN) to learn the optimal paths at each possible position and congestion level; (2) An online exploitation phase with local, on-board, pre-trained DNNs. Results show that MA-DRL efficiently learns optimal routes offline that are then loaded for an efficient distributed routing online.</description>

      <title>Agnostic Private Density Estimation via Stable List Decoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04783v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new notion of stability--which we call stable list decoding--and demonstrate its applicability in designing differentially private density estimators. This definition is weaker than global stability [ABLMM22] and is related to the notions of replicability [ILPS22] and list replicability [CMY23]. We show that if a class of distributions is stable list decodable, then it can be learned privately in the agnostic setting. As the main application of our framework, we prove the first upper bound on the sample complexity of private density estimation for Gaussian Mixture Models in the agnostic setting, extending the realizable result of Afzali et al. [AAL24].</description>

      <title>RPN: Reconciled Polynomial Network Towards Unifying PGMs, Kernel SVMs, MLP and KAN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04819v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we will introduce a novel deep model named Reconciled Polynomial Network (RPN) for deep function learning. RPN has a very general architecture and can be used to build models with various complexities, capacities, and levels of completeness, which all contribute to the correctness of these models. As indicated in the subtitle, RPN can also serve as the backbone to unify different base models into one canonical representation. This includes non-deep models, like probabilistic graphical models (PGMs) - such as Bayesian network and Markov network - and kernel support vector machines (kernel SVMs), as well as deep models like the classic multi-layer perceptron (MLP) and the recent Kolmogorov-Arnold network (KAN).
  Technically, RPN proposes to disentangle the underlying function to be inferred into the inner product of a data expansion function and a parameter reconciliation function. Together with the remainder function, RPN accurately approximates the underlying functions that governs data distributions. The data expansion functions in RPN project data vectors from the input space to a high-dimensional intermediate space, specified by the expansion functions in definition. Meanwhile, RPN also introduces the parameter reconciliation functions to fabricate a small number of parameters into a higher-order parameter matrix to address the ``curse of dimensionality'' problem caused by the data expansions. Moreover, the remainder functions provide RPN with additional complementary information to reduce potential approximation errors. We conducted extensive empirical experiments on numerous benchmark datasets across multiple modalities, including continuous function datasets, discrete vision and language datasets, and classic tabular datasets, to investigate the effectiveness of RPN.</description>

      <title>Flexible Antenna Arrays for Wireless Communications: Modeling and Performance Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04944v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Flexible antenna arrays (FAAs), distinguished by their rotatable, bendable, and foldable properties, are extensively employed in flexible radio systems to achieve customized radiation patterns. This paper aims to illustrate that FAAs, capable of dynamically adjusting surface shapes, can enhance communication performances with both omni-directional and directional antenna patterns, in terms of multi-path channel power and channel angle Cram\'{e}r-Rao bounds. To this end, we develop a mathematical model that elucidates the impacts of the variations in antenna positions and orientations as the array transitions from a flat to a rotated, bent, and folded state, all contingent on the flexible degree-of-freedom. Moreover, since the array shape adjustment operates across the entire beamspace, especially with directional patterns, we discuss the sum-rate in the multi-sector base station that covers the $360^\circ$ communication area. Particularly, to thoroughly explore the multi-sector sum-rate, we propose separate flexible precoding (SFP), joint flexible precoding (JFP), and semi-joint flexible precoding (SJFP), respectively. In our numerical analysis comparing the optimized FAA to the fixed uniform planar array, we find that the bendable FAA achieves a remarkable $156\%$ sum-rate improvement compared to the fixed planar array in the case of JFP with the directional pattern. Furthermore, the rotatable FAA exhibits notably superior performance in SFP and SJFP cases with omni-directional patterns, with respective $35\%$ and $281\%$.</description>

      <title>Ubiquitous Integrated Sensing and Communications for Massive MIMO LEO Satellite Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05029v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The next sixth generation (6G) networks are envisioned to integrate sensing and communications in a single system, thus greatly improving spectrum utilization and reducing hardware costs. Low earth orbit (LEO) satellite communications combined with massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) technology holds significant promise in offering ubiquitous and seamless connectivity with high data rates. Existing integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) studies mainly focus on terrestrial systems, while operating ISAC in massive MIMO LEO satellite systems is promising to provide high-capacity communication and flexible sensing ubiquitously. In this paper, we first give an overview of LEO satellite systems and ISAC and consider adopting ISAC in the massive MIMO LEO satellite systems. Then, the recent research advances are presented. A discussion on related challenges and key enabling technologies follows. Finally, we point out some open issues and promising research directions.</description>

      <title>Blind Bistatic Radar Parameter Estimation in Doubly-Dispersive Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05328v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel method for blind bistatic radar parameter estimation (RPE), which enables integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) by allowing passive (receive) base stations (BSs) to extract radar parameters (ranges and velocities of targets), without requiring knowledge of the information sent by an active (transmit) BS to its users. The contributed method is formulated with basis on the covariance of received signals, and under a generalized doubly-dispersive channel model compatible with most of the waveforms typically considered for ISAC, such as orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM), orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) and affine frequency division multiplexing (AFDM). The original non-convex problem, which includes an $\ell_0$-norm regularization term in order to mitigate clutter, is solved not by relaxation to an $\ell_1$-norm, but by introducing an arbitrarily-tight approximation then relaxed via fractional programming (FP). Simulation results show that the performance of the proposed method approaches that of an ideal system with perfect knowledge of the transmit signal covariance with an increasing number of transmit frames.</description>

      <title>New Directions in Text Classification Research: Maximizing The Performance of Sentiment Classification from Limited Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05627v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The stakeholders' needs in sentiment analysis for various issues, whether positive or negative, are speed and accuracy. One new challenge in sentiment analysis tasks is the limited training data, which often leads to suboptimal machine learning models and poor performance on test data. This paper discusses the problem of text classification based on limited training data (300 to 600 samples) into three classes: positive, negative, and neutral. A benchmark dataset is provided for training and testing data on the issue of Kaesang Pangarep's appointment as Chairman of PSI. External data for aggregation and augmentation purposes are provided, consisting of two datasets: the topic of Covid Vaccination sentiment and an open topic. The official score used is the F1-score, which balances precision and recall among the three classes, positive, negative, and neutral. A baseline score is provided as a reference for researchers for unoptimized classification methods. The optimized score is provided as a reference for the target score to be achieved by any proposed method. Both scoring (baseline and optimized) use the SVM method, which is widely reported as the state-of-the-art in conventional machine learning methods. The F1-scores achieved by the baseline and optimized methods are 40.83% and 51.28%, respectively.</description>

      <title>Performance Evaluation of MLO for XR Streaming: Can Wi-Fi 7 Meet the Expectations?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05802v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Extended Reality (XR) has stringent throughput and delay requirements that are hard to meet with current wireless technologies. Missing these requirements can lead to worsened picture quality, perceived lag between user input and corresponding output, and even dizziness for the end user. In this paper, we study the capability of upcoming Wi-Fi 7, and its novel support for Multi-Link Operation (MLO), to cope with these tight requirements. Our study is based on simulation results extracted from an MLO-compliant simulator that realistically reproduces VR traffic. Results show that MLO can sustain VR applications. By jointly using multiple links with independent channel access procedures, MLO can reduce the overall delay, which is especially useful in the uplink, as it has more stringent requirements than the downlink, and is instrumental in delivering the expected performance. We show that using MLO can allow more users per network than an equivalent number of links using SLO. We also show that while maintaining the same overall bandwidth, a higher number of MLO links with narrow channels leads to lower delays than a lower number of links with wider channels.</description>

Abstract: In recent years, linear complementary pairs (LCP) of codes and linear complementary dual (LCD) codes have gained significant attention due to their applications in coding theory and cryptography. In this work, we construct explicit LCPs of codes and LCD codes from function fields of genus $g \geq 1$. To accomplish this, we present pairs of suitable divisors giving rise to non-special divisors of degree $g-1$ in the function field. The results are applied in constructing LCPs of algebraic geometry codes and LCD algebraic geometry (AG) codes in Kummer extensions, hyperelliptic function fields, and elliptic curves.</description>

      <title>Receiver Selection and Transmit Beamforming for Multi-static Integrated Sensing and Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05873v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Next-generation wireless networks are expected to develop a novel paradigm of integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) to enable both the high-accuracy sensing and high-speed communications. However, conventional mono-static ISAC systems, which simultaneously transmit and receive at the same equipment, may suffer from severe self-interference, and thus significantly degrade the system performance.To address this issue, this paper studies a multi-static ISAC system for cooperative target localization and communications, where the transmitter transmits ISAC signal to multiple receivers (REs) deployed at different positions. We derive the closed-form Cram\'{e}r-Rao bound (CRB) on the joint estimations of both the transmission delay and Doppler shift for cooperative target localization, and the CRB minimization problem is formulated by considering the cooperative cost and communication rate requirements for the REs. To solve this problem, we first decouple it into two subproblems for RE selection and transmit beamforming, respectively. Then, a minimax linkage-based method is proposed to solve the RE selection subproblem, and a successive convex approximation algorithm is adopted to deal with the transmit beamforming subproblem with non-convex constraints. Finally, numerical results validate our analysis and reveal that our proposed multi-static ISAC scheme achieves better ISAC performance than the conventional mono-static ones when the number of cooperative REs is large.</description>

      <title>Near-Optimal MIMO Detection Using Gradient-Based MCMC in Discrete Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06042v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The discrete nature of transmitted symbols poses challenges for achieving optimal detection in multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems associated with a large number of antennas. Recently, the combination of two powerful machine learning methods, Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling and gradient descent, has emerged as a highly efficient solution to address this issue. However, existing gradient-based MCMC detectors are heuristically designed and thus are theoretically untenable. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel sampling algorithm tailored for discrete spaces. This algorithm leverages gradients from the underlying continuous spaces for acceleration while maintaining the validity of probabilistic sampling. We prove the convergence of this method and also analyze its convergence rate using both MCMC theory and empirical diagnostics. On this basis, we develop a MIMO detector that precisely samples from the target discrete distribution and generates posterior Bayesian estimates using these samples, whose performance is thereby theoretically guaranteed. Furthermore, our proposed detector is highly parallelizable and scalable to large MIMO dimensions, positioning it as a compelling candidate for next-generation wireless networks. Simulation results show that our detector achieves near-optimal performance, significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, and showcases resilience to various system setups.</description>

      <title>Noisy Sorting Capacity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2202.01446v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sorting is the task of ordering $n$ elements using pairwise comparisons. It is well known that $m=\Theta(n\log n)$ comparisons are both necessary and sufficient when the outcomes of the comparisons are observed with no noise. In this paper, we study the sorting problem when each comparison is incorrect with some fixed yet unknown probability $p$. Unlike the common approach in the literature which aims to minimize the number of pairwise comparisons $m$ to achieve a given desired error probability, we consider randomized algorithms with expected number of queries $\textsf{E}[M]$ and aim at characterizing the maximal sorting rate $\frac{n\log n}{\textsf{E}[M]}$ such that the ordering of the elements can be estimated with a vanishing error probability asymptotically. The maximal rate is referred to as the noisy sorting capacity. In this work, we derive upper and lower bounds on the noisy sorting capacity. The two lower bounds -- one for fixed-length algorithms and one for variable-length algorithms -- are established by combining the insertion sort algorithm with the well-known Burnashev--Zigangirov algorithm for channel coding with feedback. Compared with existing methods, the proposed algorithms are universal in the sense that they do not require the knowledge of $p$, while maintaining a strictly positive sorting rate. Moreover, we derive a general upper bound on the noisy sorting capacity, along with an upper bound on the maximal rate that can be achieved by sorting algorithms that are based on insertion sort.</description>

Abstract: The exact common information between a set of random variables $X_1,...,X_n$ is defined as the minimum entropy of a shared random variable that allows for the exact distributive simulation of $X_1,...,X_n$. It has been established that, in certain instances, infinite entropy is required to achieve distributive simulation, suggesting that continuous random variables may be needed in such scenarios. However, to date, there is no established metric to characterize such cases. In this paper, we propose the concept of Common Information Dimension (CID) with respect to a given class of functions $\mathcal{F}$, defined as the minimum dimension of a random variable $W$ required to distributively simulate a set of random variables $X_1,...,X_n$, such that $W$ can be expressed as a function of $X_1,\cdots,X_n$ using a member of $\mathcal{F}$. Our main contributions include the computation of the common information dimension for jointly Gaussian random vectors in a closed form, with $\mathcal{F}$ being the linear functions class.</description>

      <title>A Stochastic Geometry Framework for Performance Analysis of RIS-assisted OFDM Cellular Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.06754v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) technology allows one to engineer spatial diversity in complex cellular networks. This paper provides a framework for the system-level performance assessment of RIS-assisted networks and in particular downlink coverage probability and ergodic rate. To account for the inherent randomness in the spatial deployments of base stations (BSs) and RISs, we model the placements of the RISs as point processes (PPs) conditioned on the associated BSs, which are modeled by a Poisson point process (PPP). These RIS PPs can be adapted based on the deployment strategy. We focus on modeling the RISs as a Mat\'ern cluster process (MCP), where each RIS cluster is a finite PPP with support a disc centered on the association BS. We assume that the system uses the orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) technique to exploit the multipath diversity provided by RISs. The coverage probability and the ergodic rate can be evaluated when RISs operate as batched powerless beamformers. The resulting analytical expressions provide a general methodology to evaluate the impact of key RIS-related parameters, such as the batch size and the density of RISs, on system-level performance. To demonstrate the framework's broad applicability, we also analyze a RIS placement variant where RISs are deployed around coverage holes. Numerical evaluations of the analytical expressions and Monte-Carlo simulations jointly validate the proposed analytical approach and provide valuable insights into the design of future RIS-assisted cellular networks.</description>

      <title>Time-Domain Channel Estimation for Extremely Large MIMO THz Communication Systems Under Dual-Wideband Fading Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.14745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.14745v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the problem of extremely large (XL) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channel estimation in the terahertz (THz) frequency band, considering the presence of propagation delays across the entire array apertures at both communication ends, which naturally leads to frequency selectivity. This problem is known as beam squint and may be pronounced when communications are subject to multipath fading conditions. Multi-carrier (MC) transmission schemes, which are usually deployed in THz communication systems to address these issues, suffer from high peak-to-average power ratio, which is specifically dominant in this frequency band where low transmit power is mostly feasible. Furthermore, the frequency selectivity caused by severe molecular absorption in the THz band necessitates delicate consideration in MC system design. Motivated by the benefits of single-carrier (SC) waveforms for practical THz communication systems, diverging from the current dominant research trend on MC systems, we devise a novel channel estimation problem formulation in the time domain for SC XL MIMO systems subject to multipath signal propagation, spatial wideband effects, and molecular absorption. An efficient alternating minimization approach is presented to solve the proposed mixed-integer sparse problem formulation. The conducted extensive performance evaluation results validate that the proposed XL MIMO estimation scheme exhibits superior performance than conventional SC- and MC-based techniques, approaching the idealized lower bound.</description>

      <title>Channel Estimation for mmWave MIMO using sub-6 GHz Out-of-Band Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.08996v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Future wireless multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communication systems will employ sub-6 GHz and millimeter wave (mmWave) frequency bands working cooperatively. Establishing a MIMO communication link usually relies on estimating channel state information (CSI) which is difficult to acquire at mmWave frequencies due to a low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). In this paper, we propose three novel methods to estimate mmWave MIMO channels using out-of-band information obtained from the sub-6GHz band. We compare the proposed channel estimation methods with a conventional one utilizing only in-band information. Simulation results show that the proposed methods outperform the conventional mmWave channel estimation method in terms of achievable spectral efficiency, especially at low SNR and high K-factor.</description>

      <title>Two-timescale joint power control and beamforming design with applications to cell-free massive MIMO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.02080v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study we derive novel optimal algorithms for joint power control and beamforming design in modern large-scale MIMO systems, such as those based on the cell-free massive MIMO and XL-MIMO concepts. In particular, motivated by the need for scalable system architectures, we formulate and solve nontrivial two-timescale extensions of the classical uplink power minimization and max-min fair resource allocation problems. In our formulations, we let the beamformers be functions mapping partial instantaneous channel state information (CSI) to beamforming weights, and jointly optimize these functions and the power control coefficients based on long-term statistical CSI. This long-term approach mitigates the severe scalability issues of competing short-term iterative algorithms in the literature, where a central controller endowed with global instantaneous CSI must solve a complex optimization problem for every channel realization, hence imposing very demanding requirements in terms of computational complexity and signaling overhead. Moreover, our approach outperforms the available long-term approaches, which do not jointly optimize powers and beamformers. The obtained optimal long-term algorithms are then illustrated and compared against existing short-term and long-term algorithms via numerical simulations in a cell-free massive MIMO setup with different levels of cooperation.</description>

      <title>Stability Analysis of Interacting Wireless Repeaters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01074v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a wireless network with multiple single-antenna repeaters that amplify and instantaneously re-transmit the signals they receive to improve the channel rank and system coverage. Due to the positive feedback formed by inter-repeater interference, stability could become a critical issue. We investigate the problem of determining the maximum amplification gain that the repeaters can use without breaking the system stability. Specifically, we obtain a bound by using the Gershgorin disc theorem, which reveals that the maximum amplification gain is restricted by the sum of channel amplitude gains. We show by case studies the usefulness of the so-obtained bound and provide insights on how the repeaters should be deployed.</description>

      <title>Byzantine-Resilient Secure Aggregation for Federated Learning Without Privacy Compromises</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08698v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Federated learning (FL) shows great promise in large scale machine learning, but brings new risks in terms of privacy and security. We propose ByITFL, a novel scheme for FL that provides resilience against Byzantine users while keeping the users' data private from the federator and private from other users. The scheme builds on the preexisting non-private FLTrust scheme, which tolerates malicious users through trust scores (TS) that attenuate or amplify the users' gradients. The trust scores are based on the ReLU function, which we approximate by a polynomial. The distributed and privacy-preserving computation in ByITFL is designed using a combination of Lagrange coded computing, verifiable secret sharing and re-randomization steps. ByITFL is the first Byzantine resilient scheme for FL with full information-theoretic privacy.</description>

      <title>Information limits and Thouless-Anderson-Palmer equations for spiked matrix models with structured noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20993v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a prototypical problem of Bayesian inference for a structured spiked model: a low-rank signal is corrupted by additive noise. While both information-theoretic and algorithmic limits are well understood when the noise is a Gaussian Wigner matrix, the more realistic case of structured noise still proves to be challenging. To capture the structure while maintaining mathematical tractability, a line of work has focused on rotationally invariant noise. However, existing studies either provide sub-optimal algorithms or are limited to special cases of noise ensembles. In this paper, using tools from statistical physics (replica method) and random matrix theory (generalized spherical integrals) we establish the first characterization of the information-theoretic limits for a noise matrix drawn from a general trace ensemble. Remarkably, our analysis unveils the asymptotic equivalence between the rotationally invariant model and a surrogate Gaussian one. Finally, we show how to saturate the predicted statistical limits using an efficient algorithm inspired by the theory of adaptive Thouless-Anderson-Palmer (TAP) equations.</description>

      <title>Fair Resource Allocation for Probabilistic Semantic Communication in IIoT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02922v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, the problem of minimum rate maximization for probabilistic semantic communication (PSCom) in industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) is investigated. In the considered model, users employ semantic information extraction techniques to compress the original data before sending it to the base station (BS). During this semantic compression process, knowledge graphs are employed to represent the semantic information, and the probability graph sharing between users and the BS is utilized to further compress the knowledge graph. The semantic compression process can significantly reduce the transmitted data size, but it inevitably introduces additional computation overhead. Considering the limited power budget of the user, we formulate a joint communication and computation optimization problem is formulated aiming to maximize the minimum equivalent rate among all users while meeting total power and semantic compression ratio constraints. To address this problem, two algorithms with different computational complexities are proposed to obtain suboptimal solutions. One algorithm is based on a prorate distribution of transmission power, while the other traverses the combinations of semantic compression ratios among all users. In both algorithms, bisection is employed in order to achieve the greatest minimum equivalent rate. The simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.</description>

      <title>Decoding Analog Subspace Codes: Algorithms for Character-Polynomial Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03606v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose efficient minimum-distance decoding and list-decoding algorithms for a certain class of analog subspace codes, referred to as character-polynomial (CP) codes, recently introduced by Soleymani and the second author. In particular, a CP code without its character can be viewed as a subcode of a Reed-Solomon (RS) code, where a certain subset of the coefficients of the message polynomial is set to zeros. We then demonstrate how classical decoding methods, including list decoders, for RS codes can be leveraged for decoding CP codes. For instance, it is shown that, in almost all cases, the list decoder behaves as a unique decoder. We also present a probabilistic analysis of the improvements in list decoding of CP codes when leveraging their certain structure as subcodes of RS codes.</description>

      <title>On the monotonicity of discrete entropy for log-concave random vectors on $\mathbb{Z}^d$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.15462v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove the following type of discrete entropy monotonicity for sums of isotropic, log-concave, independent and identically distributed random vectors $X_1,\dots,X_{n+1}$ on $\mathbb{Z}^d$: $$ H(X_1+\cdots+X_{n+1}) \geq H(X_1+\cdots+X_{n}) + \frac{d}{2}\log{\Bigl(\frac{n+1}{n}\Bigr)} +o(1), $$ where $o(1)$ vanishes as $H(X_1) \to \infty$. Moreover, for the $o(1)$-term, we obtain a rate of convergence $ O\Bigl({H(X_1)}{e^{-\frac{1}{d}H(X_1)}}\Bigr)$, where the implied constants depend on $d$ and $n$. This generalizes to $\mathbb{Z}^d$ the one-dimensional result of the second named author (2023). As in dimension one, our strategy is to establish that the discrete entropy $H(X_1+\cdots+X_{n})$ is close to the differential (continuous) entropy $h(X_1+U_1+\cdots+X_{n}+U_{n})$, where $U_1,\dots, U_n$ are independent and identically distributed uniform random vectors on $[0,1]^d$ and to apply the theorem of Artstein, Ball, Barthe and Naor (2004) on the monotonicity of differential entropy. In fact, we show this result under more general assumptions than log-concavity, which are preserved up to constants under convolution. In order to show that log-concave distributions satisfy our assumptions in dimension $d\ge2$, more involved tools from convex geometry are needed because a suitable position is required. We show that, for a log-concave function on $\mathbb{R}^d$ in isotropic position, its integral, barycenter and covariance matrix are close to their discrete counterparts. Moreover, in the log-concave case, we weaken the isotropicity assumption to what we call almost isotropicity. One of our technical tools is a discrete analogue to the upper bound on the isotropic constant of a log-concave function, which extends to dimensions $d\ge1$ a result of Bobkov, Marsiglietti and Melbourne (2022).</description>

      <title>Alon's transmitting problem and multicolor Beck--Spencer Lemma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19945v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Hamming graph $H(n,q)$ is defined on the vertex set $\{1,2,\ldots,q\}^n$ and two vertices are adjacent if and only if they differ in precisely one coordinate. Alon proved that for any sequence $v_1,\ldots,v_b$ of $b=\lceil\frac n2\rceil$ vertices of $H(n,2)$, there is a vertex whose distance from $v_i$ is at least $b-i+1$ for all $1\leq i\leq b$. In this note, we prove that for any $q\geq 3$ and any sequence $v_1,\ldots,v_b$ of $b=\lfloor(1-\frac1q)n\rfloor$ vertices of $H(n,q)$, there is a vertex whose distance from $v_i$ is at least $b-i+1$ for all $1\leq i\leq b$.
  Alon used the Beck--Spencer Lemma which, in turn, was based on the floating variable method introduced by Beck and Fiala who studied combinatorial discrepancies. For our proof, we extend the Beck--Spencer Lemma by using a multicolor version of the floating variable method due to Doerr and Srivastav.</description>
