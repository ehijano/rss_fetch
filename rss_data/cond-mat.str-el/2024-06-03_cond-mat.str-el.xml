      <title>Fractionalization of Coset Non-Invertible Symmetry and Exotic Hall Conductance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20401v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate fractionalization of non-invertible symmetry in (2+1)D topological orders. We focus on coset non-invertible symmetries obtained by gauging non-normal subgroups of invertible $0$-form symmetries. These symmetries can arise as global symmetries in quantum spin liquids, given by the quotient of the projective symmetry group by a non-normal subgroup as invariant gauge group. We point out that such coset non-invertible symmetries in topological orders can exhibit symmetry fractionalization: each anyon can carry a "fractional charge" under the coset non-invertible symmetry given by a gauge invariant superposition of fractional quantum numbers. We present various examples using field theories and quantum double lattice models, such as fractional quantum Hall systems with charge conjugation symmetry gauged and finite group gauge theory from gauging a non-normal subgroup. They include symmetry enriched $S_3$ and $O(2)$ gauge theories. We show that such systems have a fractionalized continuous non-invertible coset symmetry and a well-defined electric Hall conductance. The coset symmetry enforces a gapless edge state if the boundary preserves the continuous non-invertible symmetry. We propose a general approach for constructing coset symmetry defects using a "sandwich" construction: non-invertible symmetry defects can generally be constructed from an invertible defect sandwiched by condensation defects. The anomaly free condition for finite coset symmetry is also identified.</description>

      <title>Mott insulating phase and coherent-incoherent crossover across magnetic phase transition in 2D antiferromagnetic CrSBr</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20598v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In two-dimensional van der Waals magnetic materials, the interplay between magnetism and electron correlation can give rise to new ground states and lead to novel transport and optical properties. A fundamental question in these materials is how the electron correlation manifests and interacts with the magnetic orders. In this study, we demonstrate that the recently discovered 2D antiferromagnetic material, CrSBr, is a Mott insulator, through the combined use of resonant and temperature-dependent angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy techiniques, supplemented by dynamical mean-field theory analysis. Intriguingly, we found that as the system transitions from the antiferromagnetic to the paramagnetic phases, its Mott bands undergo a reconfiguration, and a coherent-incoherent crossover, driven by the dissolution of the magnetic order. Our findings reveal a distinctive evolution of band structure associated with magnetic phase transitions, shedding light on the investigation of intricate interplay between correlation and magnetic orders in strongly correlated van der Waals magnetic materials.</description>

      <title>Quantum and classical magnetic Bloch points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20798v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A Bloch point represents a three-dimensional hedgehog singularity of a magnetic vector field in which the magnetization vanishes. However, standard micromagnetic theory, developed for magnetic moments of fixed lengths, lacks full applicability in studying such singularities. To address this gap, we study a Bloch point in a quantum Heisenberg model for the case of spin-1/2 particles. Performing an exact diagonalization of the Hamiltonian as well as using density matrix renormalization group techniques, we obtain the ground state, which can be used to recover the corresponding magnetization profile. Our findings demonstrate a variation of the spin length in the quantum model, leading smoothly to zero magnetization at the Bloch point. Our results indicate the necessity of generalizing the classical micromagnetic model by adding the third degree of freedom of the spins: the ability to change its length. To this end, we introduce the micromagnetic $\mathbb{S}_{3}$-model, which enables the description of magnets with and without Bloch point singularities.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20897v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A quantum description is given of nanoskyrmions in 2D textures with localised spins and itinerant electrons, isolated or coupled to leads, in or out of equilibrium. The spin-electron exchange is treated at the mean-field level, while Tensor Networks and exact diagonalization or nonequilibrium Green's functions are used for localised spins and itinerant electrons. We motivate our scheme via exact benchmarks, then show by several examples that itinerant electrons distinctly affect the properties of quantum nanoskyrmions. Finally, we mention lines of future work and improvement of the approach.</description>

      <title>KeldyshQFT: A C++ codebase for real-frequency multiloop functional renormalization group and parquet computations of the single-impurity Anderson model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20996v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a detailed exposition of our computational framework designed for the accurate calculation of real-frequency dynamical correlation functions of the single-impurity Anderson model (AM) in the regime of weak to intermediate coupling. Using quantum field theory within the Keldysh formalism to directly access the self-energy and dynamical susceptibilities in real frequencies, as detailed in our recent publication (https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevB.109.115128), the primary computational challenge is the full three-dimensional real-frequency dependence of the four-point vertex. Our codebase provides a fully MPI+OpenMP parallelized implementation of the functional renormalization group (fRG) and the self-consistent parquet equations within the parquet approximation. It leverages vectorization to handle the additional complexity imposed by the Keldysh formalism, using optimized data structures and highly performant integration routines. Going beyond the results shown in the previous publication, the code includes functionality to perform fRG calculations in the multiloop framework, at arbitrary loop order, including self-consistent self-energy iterations. Moreover, implementations of various regulators, such as hybridization, interaction, frequency, and temperature are supplied.</description>

      <title>Magnetotransport Properties of Ferromagnetic/Antiferromagnetic Superlattices: Probing the role of induced magnetization in antiferromagnetic layer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.21006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.21006v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the magnetic and transport properties of the $La_{1-x}Sr_{x}MnO_{3}$ (LSMO)/$Pr_{1-x}Ca_{x}MnO_{3}$ (PCMO) like ferromagnetic/antiferromagnetic superlattices in three dimensions using a two orbitals double exchange model incorporating the Jahn-Teller lattice distortions, superexchange interactions and long-range Coulomb interactions. In our simulations we primarily focus on periodic arrangement of $w_L$ planes of ferromagnetic LSMO and $w_P$ planes of antiferromagnetic PCMO manganites, and set $w_L$+$w_P$ = 10. The induced ferromagnetic correlations in the parent PCMO layer decreases monotonically with increasing the PCMO layer width $w_P$ at high temperatures for both half-doping ($n =0.5$) and off-half-doping ($n = 0.55$) scenarios. As we decrease the temperature further the induced ferromagnetic moments in PCMO layer disappears or decreases considerably at half-doping due to the onset of charge ordering in antiferromagnetic PCMO layers. Overall, the magnetization in PCMO layer decreases at low temperatures and the metal-insulator transition temperature of the LSMO/PCMO superlattices increases with increase of the PCMO layer width $w_P$, similar to the experiments. On the other hand, at off-half-doping, the induced ferromagnetic moment survives even at low temperatures due to weakened charge ordering in PCMO layer and interestingly, varies nonmonotonically with PCMO layer width, in agreement with experiments. The nonmonotonic trend of the conductivity of the superlattice with increase of the PCMO layer width $w_P$ shows an one-to-one correspondence between conductivity of the superlattice and the induced ferromagnetic moments in the PCMO layer. We highlight the key role of induced ferromagnetic moment in PCMO layer in analyzing the magnetotransport properties of the LSMO/PCMO superlattices.</description>

      <title>Fate of many-body localization in an Abelian lattice gauge theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20379v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We address the fate of many-body localization (MBL) of mid-spectrum eigenstates of a matter-free $U(1)$ quantum-link gauge theory Hamiltonian with random couplings on ladder geometries. We specifically consider an intensive estimator, $\mathcal{D} \in [0,1/4]$, that acts as a measure of elementary plaquettes on the lattice being active or inert in mid-spectrum eigenstates as well as the concentration of these eigenstates in Fock space, with $\mathcal{D}$ being equal to its maximum value of $1/4$ for Fock states in the electric flux basis. We calculate its distribution, $p(\mathcal{D})$, for $L_x \times L_y$ lattices, with $L_y=2$ and $4$, as a function of (a dimensionless) disorder strength $\alpha$ ($\alpha=0$ implies zero disorder) using exact diagonalization on many disorder realizations. Analyzing the skewness of $p(\mathcal{D})$ shows that the finite-size estimate of the critical disorder strength, beyond which MBL sets in for thin ladders with $L_y=2$, increases linearly with $L_x$ while the behavior of the full distribution with increasing $L_x$ at fixed $\alpha$ shows that $\alpha_c (L_y=2) &gt;40$, if at all finite, based on data for $L_x \leq 12$. $p(\mathcal{D})$ for wider ladders with $L_y=4$ show their lower tendency to localize, suggesting a lack of MBL in two dimensions. A remarkable observation is the resolution of the (monotonic) infinite temperature autocorrelation function of single plaquette diagonal operators in typical high-energy Fock states into a plethora of emergent timescales of increasing spatio-temporal heterogeneity as the disorder is increased even before MBL sets in. At intermediate and large $\alpha$, but below $\alpha_c (L_y)$, certain randomly selected initial Fock states display striking oscillatory temporal behavior of such plaquette operators dominated by only a few frequencies, reminiscent of oscillations induced by quantum many-body scars.</description>

      <title>Recurrent neural network wave functions for Rydberg atom arrays on kagome lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20384v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rydberg atom array experiments have demonstrated the ability to act as powerful quantum simulators, preparing strongly-correlated phases of matter which are challenging to study for conventional computer simulations. A key direction has been the implementation of interactions on frustrated geometries, in an effort to prepare exotic many-body states such as spin liquids and glasses. In this paper, we apply two-dimensional recurrent neural network (RNN) wave functions to study the ground states of Rydberg atom arrays on the kagome lattice. We implement an annealing scheme to find the RNN variational parameters in regions of the phase diagram where exotic phases may occur, corresponding to rough optimization landscapes. For Rydberg atom array Hamiltonians studied previously on the kagome lattice, our RNN ground states show no evidence of exotic spin liquid or emergent glassy behavior. In the latter case, we argue that the presence of a non-zero Edwards-Anderson order parameter is an artifact of the long autocorrelations times experienced with quantum Monte Carlo simulations. This result emphasizes the utility of autoregressive models, such as RNNs, to explore Rydberg atom array physics on frustrated lattices and beyond.</description>

      <title>Large low-field magnetocaloric response in a ferromagnetic gadolinium orthophosphate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20714v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bulk magnetic and thermodynamic measurements, along with mean-field calculations, were conducted on the ferromagnetic K3Gd5(PO4)6 powders. No magnetic ordering was observed until 2 K, while the application of an external field B &gt; 1 T resulted in the splitting of the Gd3+ ground state multiplet and induced a non-cooperative Schottky effect. The average nearest-neighbor exchange strength |J1/kB| is determined to be 0.017 K, which leads to a remarkably large low field magnetic entropy change {\Delta}Sm = 36.2 J kg-1 K-1 under applied field change B = 2 T at temperature T = 2 K, as well as a maximum adiabatic temperature change Tad = 10.9 K. We contend that ferromagnetic gadolinium orthophosphates serve as a promising reservoir for exploring advanced magnetic refrigerants applicable under low magnetic fields.</description>

      <title>Emergent flat band and topological Kondo semimetal driven by orbital-selective correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.08017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.08017v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Flat electronic bands are expected to show proportionally enhanced electron correlations, which may generate a plethora of novel quantum phases and unusual low-energy excitations. They are increasingly being pursued in $d$-electron-based systems with crystalline lattices that feature destructive electronic interference, where they are often topological. Such flat bands, though, are generically located far away from the Fermi energy, which limits their capacity to partake in the low-energy physics. Here we show that electron correlations produce emergent flat bands that are pinned to the Fermi energy. We demonstrate this effect within a Hubbard model, in the regime described by Wannier orbitals where an effective Kondo description arises through orbital-selective Mott correlations. Moreover, the correlation effect cooperates with symmetry constraints to produce a topological Kondo semimetal. Our results motivate a novel design principle for Weyl Kondo semimetals in a new setting, viz. $d$-electron-based materials on suitable crystal lattices, and uncover interconnections among seemingly disparate systems that may inspire fresh understandings and realizations of correlated topological effects in quantum materials and beyond.</description>

      <title>Exact Diagonalization of $\mathrm{SU}(N)$ Fermi-Hubbard Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.09965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.09965v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show how to perform exact diagonalizations of $\mathrm{SU}(N)$ Fermi-Hubbard models on $L$-site clusters separately in each irreducible representation ({irrep}) of $\mathrm{SU}(N)$. Using the representation theory of the unitary group $\mathrm{U}(L)$, we demonstrate that a convenient orthonormal basis, on which matrix elements of the Hamiltonian are very simple, is given by the set of {\it semistandard Young tableaux} (or, equivalently the Gelfand-Tsetlin patterns) corresponding to the targeted irrep. As an application of this color factorization, we study the robustness of some $\mathrm{SU}(N)$ phases predicted in the Heisenberg limit upon decreasing the on-site interaction $U$ on various lattices of size $L \leq 12$ and for $2 \leq N \leq 6$. In particular, we show that a long-range color ordered phase emerges for intermediate $U$ for $N=4$ at filling $1/4$ on the triangular lattice.</description>

      <title>Origin of spin-driven ferroelectricity and effect of external pressure on the complex magnetism of 6H-perovskite Ba3HoRu2O9</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.13465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.13465v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The compound Ba3HoRu2O9 magnetically orders at 50 K (TN1) followed by another complex magnetic ordering at 10.2 K (TN2). The 2nd magnetic phase transition was characterized by the co-existence of two competing magnetic ground states associated with two different magnetic wave vectors (K1=1/2 0 0 and K2=1/4 1/4 0). Here, we have discussed the origin of spin-driven ferroelectricity, which is not known yet. We demonstrate through time-of-flight Neutron diffraction and theoretical calculation that the non-collinear structure involving two different magnetic ions, Ru(4d) and Ho(4f), break the spatial inversion symmetry via inverse Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (D-M) interaction through strong 4d-4f magnetic correlation, which shifts the oxygen atoms and results in non-zero polarization. Such an observation of inverse D-M interaction from two different magnetic ions which caused ferroelectricity is rarely observed. We have systematically studied the spin and dipolar dynamics, which exhibit intriguing behavior with shorter coherence lengths of 2nd magnetic phase associated with the k2-wave vector. The results manifest the development of finite-size magnetoelectric domains instead of true long-range ordering which justifies the experimentally obtained low value of ferroelectric polarization. The synchrotron XRD analysis predicts a non-centrosymmetric space group P-62c. Furthermore, we have investigated the effect of external pressure on this complex magnetism. The result reveals an enhancement of ordering temperature by the application of external pressure (1.6 K/GPa). The external pressure might favor stabilizing the magnetic ground state associated with 2nd magnetic phase. Our study shows an unconventional mechanism of spin-driven ferroelectricity.</description>

      <title>Relevant long-range interaction of the entanglement Hamiltonian emerges from a short-range system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.16089v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Beyond the Li-Haldane-Poilblanc conjecture, we find the entanglement Hamiltonian (EH) is actually not closely similar to the original Hamiltonian on the virtual edge. Unexpectedly, the EH has some relevant long-range interacting terms which hugely affect the physics. Without loss of generality, we study a spin-1/2 Heisenberg bilayer to obtain the entanglement information between the two layers through our newly developed quantum Monte Carlo scheme, which can simulate large-scale EH. Although the entanglement spectrum carrying the Goldstone mode seems like a Heisenberg model on a single layer, which is consistent with Li-Haldane-Poilblanc conjecture, we demonstrate that there actually exists a finite-temperature phase transition of the EH. The results violate the Mermin-Wagner theorem, which means there should be relevant long-range terms in the EH. It reveals that the Li-Haldane-Poilblanc conjecture ignores necessary corrections for the EH which may lead totally different physics.</description>

      <title>Quantum transport properties of the topological Dirac Semimetal $\alpha$-Sn</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00083v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report measurements of the electrical resistivity ($\rho$) and thermoelectric power (S) in a thin film of strained single-crystalline $\alpha$-Sn grown by molecular beam epitaxy on an insulating substrate. The temperature (T) dependence of the resistivity of $\alpha$-Sn can be divided into two regions:below T* $\approx$ 135 K $\rho$(T) shows a metallic-like behaviour, while above this temperature an increasing contribution from thermally excited holes to electrical transport is observed. However, it is still dominated by highly mobile electrons, resulting in a negative sign of the Seebeck coefficient above T = 47 K. In the presence of the magnetic field (B) applied along an electric field or thermal gradient, we note a negative magnetoresistance or a negative slope of S(B), respectively. The theoretical prediction for the former (calculated using density functional theory) agrees well with the experiment. However, these characteristics quickly disappear when the magnetic field is deviated from an orientation parallel to the electrical field or the thermal gradient. We indicate that the behaviour of the electrical resistivity and thermoelectric power can be explained in terms of the chiral current arising from the topologically non-trivial electronic structure of $\alpha$-Sn. Its decay at high temperature is a consequence of the decreasing ratio between the intervalley Weyl relaxation time to the Drude scattering time.</description>

      <title>Quasi-Nambu-Goldstone modes in many-body scar models</title>

Abstract: From the quasisymmetry-group perspective [Phys. Rev. Lett. 126, 120604 (2021)], we show the universal existence of collective, coherent modes of excitations in many-body scar models in the degenerate limit, where the energy spacing in the scar tower vanishes. The number of these modes, as well as the quantum numbers carried by them, are given, not by the symmetry of the Hamiltonian, but by the quasisymmetry of the scar tower: hence the name quasi-Nambu-Goldstone modes. Based on this, we draw a concrete analogy between the paradigm of spontaneous symmetry breaking and the many-body scar physics in the degenerate limit.</description>

      <title>Low-rank quantics tensor train representations of Feynman diagrams for multiorbital electron-phonon models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06440v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Feynman diagrams are an essential tool for simulating strongly correlated electron systems. However, stochastic quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) sampling suffers from the sign problem, e.g., when solving a multiorbital quantum impurity model. Recently, two approaches have been proposed for efficient numerical treatment of Feynman diagrams: Tensor Cross Interpolation (TCI) for replacing the stochastic sampling and the Quantics Tensor Train (QTT) representation for compressing space-time dependence. Combining these approaches, we find low-rank structures in weak-coupling Feynman diagrams for a multiorbital electron-phonon model and demonstrate their efficient numerical integrations with exponential resolution in time and exponential convergence of error with respect to computational cost.</description>

      <title>Out-of-plane magnetic phase diagram of Kitaev quantum spin liquid candidate Na2Co2TeO6</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13935v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We have investigated the magnetic properties and mapped out the phase diagram of the honeycomb magnet Na2Co2TeO6 with Co 3d7 in out-of-plane magnetic fields. This material has previously been proposed to show nearest-neighbor Kitaev interactions between Co spins and maybe even Kitaev quantum spin liquid behavior in high fields. At low magnetic fields, we observe a thermal phase transition at TN = 27 K, transitioning from a paramagnetic state to a canonical ferrimagnetic state. Under the application of magnetic fields, a spin flop-like phase transition occurred before saturation of J = 1/2 between 10 K and TN. Below 10 K, a peak-dip-peak structure emerges between 10 and 17 T in the magnetic susceptibility (dM/dH) before the magnetic saturation, reminiscent of magnetic plateau behavior. The measurement of the magnetocaloric effect also shows dip-peak-dip behavior in this field range. Our data can be explained by an XXZ model with a single ion anisotropy and possibly small Kitaev and {\Gamma} exchange interactions. We also unambiguously determined the magnetization saturation field that helps constrain the energy scale of the exchange interactions</description>

      <title>TensorKrowch: Smooth integration of tensor networks in machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.08595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.08595v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Tensor networks are factorizations of high-dimensional tensors into networks of smaller tensors. They have applications in physics and mathematics, and recently have been proposed as promising machine learning architectures. To ease the integration of tensor networks in machine learning pipelines, we introduce TensorKrowch, an open source Python library built on top of PyTorch. Providing a user-friendly interface, TensorKrowch allows users to construct any tensor network, train it, and integrate it as a layer in more intricate deep learning models. In this paper, we describe the main functionality and basic usage of TensorKrowch, and provide technical details on its building blocks and the optimizations performed to achieve efficient operation.</description>

      <title>High temperature transport in the one dimensional mass-imbalanced Fermi-Hubbard model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08076v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study transport in the one-dimensional mass-imbalanced Fermi-Hubbard model at infinite temperature, focusing on the case of strong interactions. Prior theoretical and experimental investigations have revealed unconventionally long transport timescales, with complications due to strong finite size effects. We compute the dynamical current-current correlation function directly in the thermodynamic limit using infinite tensor network techniques. We show that transport in the strong-imbalance limit is dominated by AC resonances, which we compute with an analytic expansion. We study the dephasing of these resonances with mass imbalance, $\eta$. In the small-imbalance limit, the model is nearly integrable. We connect these unusual limits by computing the DC conductivity and transport decay time as a function of $\eta$ and the interaction strength $U/t$. We propose an experimental protocol to measure these correlation functions in cold atom experiments.</description>
