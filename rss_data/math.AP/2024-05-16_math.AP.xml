      <title>Blow-up criterion for a three-dimensional compressible non-Newtonian fluid with vacuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09028v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work is devoted to establish an improved blow-up criterion for strong solutions to a three-dimensional compressible non-Newtonian fluid with vacuum. The considered system is the Power Law model in a bounded periodic domain in R^3.We establish a blow-up criterion for the local strong solutions in terms of the L^4(0,T;L^{\infty}({\Omega}))norm of the gradient of the velocity for any power-law index q is greater than 1.</description>

      <title>Principal eigenvalue for some elliptic operators with large drift: Neumann boundary conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09031v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper is concerned with the principal eigenvalue of some linear elliptic operators with drift in two dimensional space. We provide a refined description of the asymptotic behavior for the principal eigenvalue as the drift rate approaches infinity. Under some non-degeneracy assumptions, our results illustrate that these asymptotic behaviors are completely determined by some connected components in the omega-limit set of the system of ordinary differential equations associated with the drift term, which includes stable fixed points, stable limit cycles, hyperbolic saddles connecting homoclinic orbits, and families of closed orbits. Some discussions on degenerate cases are also included.</description>

      <title>Local strong magnetic fields and the Little-Parks effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09099v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Starting from the Ginzburg--Landau model in a planar simply connected domain, with a local compactly supported applied magnetic field, we derive an effective model in the strong field limit, defined on a non-simply connected domain. The effective model features oscillations in the Little-Parks and Aharonov--Bohm spirit. We discuss also a similar question for the lowest eigenvalue of the magnetic Laplacian.</description>

      <title>Propagation of chaos for moderately interacting particle systems related to singular kinetic Mckean-Vlasov SDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the propagation of chaos in a class of moderately interacting particle systems for the approximation of singular kinetic McKean-Vlasov SDEs driven by alpha-stable processes. Diffusion parts include Brownian (alpha=2) and pure-jump (1&lt;\alpha&lt;2) perturbations and interaction kernels are considered in a non-smooth anisotropic Besov space. Using Duhamel formula, sharp density estimates (recently issued in Hao, Rockner and Zhang 2023), and suitable martingale functional inequalities, we obtain direct estimates on the  convergence rate between the empirical measure of the particle systems toward the McKean-Vlasov distribution. These estimates further lead to quantitative propagation of chaos results in the weak and strong sense.</description>

      <title>On the orbital stability of solitary waves for the fourth order nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09268v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present new results regarding the orbital stability of solitary standing waves for the general fourth-order Schr\"odinger equation with mixed dispersion. The existence of solitary waves can be determined both as minimizers of a constrained complex functional and by using a numerical approach. In addition, for specific values of the frequency associated with the standing wave, one obtains explicit solutions with a hyperbolic secant profile. Despite these explicit solutions being minimizers of the constrained functional, they cannot be seen as a smooth curve of solitary waves, and this fact prevents their determination of stability using classical approaches in the current literature. To overcome this difficulty, we employ a numerical approach to construct a smooth curve of solitary waves. The existence of a smooth curve is useful for showing the existence of a threshold power $\alpha_0\approx 4.8$ of the nonlinear term such that if $\alpha\in (0,\alpha_0),$ the explicit solitary wave is stable, and if $\alpha&gt;\alpha_0$, the wave is unstable. An important feature of our work, caused by the presence of the mixed dispersion term, concerns the fact that the threshold value $\alpha_0 \approx 4.8$ is not the same as that established for proving the existence of global solutions in the energy space, as is well known for the classical nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation.</description>

      <title>Energy conservation for 3D Euler and Navier-Stokes equations in a bounded domain. Applications to Beltrami flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09316v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we consider the incompressible 3D Euler and Navier-Stokes equations in a smooth bounded domain. First, we study the 3D Euler equations endowed with slip boundary conditions and we prove the same criteria for energy conservation involving the gradient, already known for the Navier-Stokes equations. Subsequently, we utilise this finding, which is based on a proper approximation of the velocity (and doesn't require estimates or additional assumptions on the pressure), to explore energy conservation for Beltrami flows. Finally, we explore Beltrami solutions to the Navier-Stokes equations and demonstrate that conditions leading to energy conservation are significantly distinct from those implying regularity. This remains true even when making use of the bootstrap regularity improvement, stemming from the solution being a Beltrami vector field.</description>

      <title>Optimal constants of smoothing estimates for the 3D Dirac equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, Ikoma (2022) considered optimal constants and extremisers for the $2$-dimensional Dirac equation using the spherical harmonics decomposition. Though its argument is valid in any dimensions $d \geq 2$, the case $d \geq 3$ remains open since it leads us to too complicated calculation: determining all eigenvalues and eigenvectors of infinite dimensional matrices. In this paper, we give optimal constants and extremisers of smoothing estimates for the $3$-dimensional Dirac equation. In order to prove this, we construct a certain orthonormal basis of spherical harmonics. With respect to this basis, infinite dimensional matrices actually become block diagonal and so that eigenvalues and eigenvectors can be easily found.</description>

      <title>Sobolev estimates for Kolmogorov-Fokker-Planck operators with coefficients measurable in time and $VMO$ in space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider Kolmogorov-Fokker-Planck operators of the form \[ \mathcal{L}u=\sum_{i,j=1}^{q}a_{ij}(x,t)u_{x_{i}x_{j}}+\sum_{k,j=1}^{N}b_{jk}x_{k}u_{x_{j}}-\partial_{t}u, \] with $\left( x,t\right) \in\mathbb{R}^{N+1},N\geq q\geq1$. We assume that $a_{ij}\in L^{\infty}\left( \mathbb{R}^{N+1}\right) $, the matrix $\left\{a_{ij}\right\} $ is symmetric and uniformly positive on $\mathbb{R}^{q}$, and the \emph{drift}% \[ Y=\sum_{k,j=1}^{N}b_{jk}x_{k}\partial_{x_{j}}-\partial_{t}% \] has a structure which makes the model operator with constant $a_{ij}$ hypoelliptic, translation invariant w.r.t. a suitable Lie group operation, and $2$-homogeneus w.r.t. a suitable family of dilations. We also assume that the coefficients $a_{ij}$ are $VMO$ w.r.t. the space variable, and only bounded measurable in $t$. We prove, for every $p\in\left( 1,\infty\right) $, global Sobolev estimates of the kind:% \begin{align*} &amp; \sum_{i,j=1}^{q}\left\Vert u_{x_{i}x_{j}}\right\Vert _{L^{p}\left( \mathbb{R}^{N+1}\right) }+\left\Vert Yu\right\Vert _{L^{p}\left( \mathbb{R}^{N+1}\right) }+\sum_{i=1}^{q}\left\Vert u_{x_{i}}\right\Vert _{L^{p}\left( \mathbb{R}^{N+1}\right) }\\ &amp; \leq c\left\{ \left\Vert \mathcal{L}u\right\Vert _{L^{p}\left( \mathbb{R}^{N+1}\right) }+\left\Vert u\right\Vert _{L^{p}\left( \mathbb{R}^{N+1}\right) }\right\} . \end{align*}</description>

      <title>$p$-Wasserstein barycenters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09381v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study barycenters of $N$ probability measures on $\mathbb{R}^d$ with respect to the $p$-Wasserstein metric ($1&lt;p&lt;\infty$). We prove that
  -- $p$-Wasserstein barycenters of absolutely continuous measures are unique, and again absolutely continuous
  -- $p$-Wasserstein barycenters admit a multi-marginal formulation
  -- the optimal multi-marginal plan is unique and of Monge form if the marginals are absolutely continuous, and its support has an explicit parametrization as a graph over any marginal space.
  This extends the Agueh--Carlier theory of Wasserstein barycenters [SIAM J. Math. Anal. 43 (2011), no.2, 904--924] to exponents $p\neq 2$. A key ingredient is a quantitative injectivity estimate for the (highly non-injective) map from $N$-point configurations to their $p$-barycenter on the support of an optimal multi-marginal plan. We also discuss the statistical meaning of $p$-Wasserstein barycenters in one dimension.</description>

      <title>Sharp PDE estimates for random two-dimensional bipartite matching with power cost function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09397v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the random bipartite optimal matching problem on a flat torus in two-dimensions, considering general strictly convex power costs of the distance. We extend the successful ansatz first introduced by Caracciolo et al. for the quadratic case, involving a linear Poisson equation, to a non-linear equation of $q$-Poisson type, allowing for a more comprehensive analysis of the optimal transport cost. Our results establish new asymptotic connections between the energy of the solution to the PDE and the optimal transport cost, providing insights on their asymptotic behavior.</description>

      <title>Singular parabolic operators in the half-space with boundary degeneracy: Dirichlet and oblique derivative boundary conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09540v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study elliptic and parabolic problems governed by the singular elliptic operators $$ \mathcal L=y^{\alpha_1}\mbox{Tr }\left(QD^2_x\right)+2y^{\frac{\alpha_1+\alpha_2}{2}}q\cdot \nabla_xD_y+\gamma y^{\alpha_2} D_{yy}+y^{\frac{\alpha_1+\alpha_2}{2}-1}\left(d,\nabla_x\right)+cy^{\alpha_2-1}D_y-by^{\alpha_2-2}$$ in the half-space $\mathcal{R}^{N+1}_+=\{(x,y): x \in \mathcal{R}^N, y&gt;0\}$, under Dirichlet or oblique derivative boundary conditions. In the special case $\alpha_1=\alpha_2=\alpha$ the operator $\mathcal L$ takes the form $$ \mathcal L=y^{\alpha}\mbox{Tr }\left(AD^2\right)+y^{\alpha-1}\left(v,\nabla\right)-by^{\alpha-2},$$ where $v=(d,c)\in\mathcal{R}^{N+1}$, $b\in\mathcal{R}$ and $ A=\left( \begin{array}{c|c}
  Q &amp; { q}^t \\[1ex] \hline
  q&amp; \gamma \end{array}\right)$ is an elliptic matrix. We prove elliptic and parabolic $L^p$-estimates and solvability for the associated problems. In the language of semigroup theory, we prove that $\mathcal L$ generates an analytic semigroup, characterize its domain as a weighted Sobolev space and show that it has maximal regularity.</description>

      <title>Unbounded Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman Equations with one co-dimensional discontinuities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06396v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The aim of this work is to deal with a discontinuous Hamilton-Jacobi equation in the whole euclidian N-dimensional space, associated to a possibly unbounded optimal control problem. Here, the discontinuities are located on a hyperplane and the typical questions we address concern the existence and uniqueness of solutions, and of course the definition itself of solution. We consider viscosity solutions in the sense of Ishii. The convex Hamiltonians are associated to a control problem with specific cost and dynamics given on each side of the hyperplane. We assume that those are Lipschitz continuous but the main difficulty we deal with is that they are potentially unbounded, as well as the control spaces. Using Bellman's approach we construct two value functions which turn out to be the minimal and maximal solutions in the sense of Ishii. Moreover, we also build a whole family of value functions, which are still solutions in the sense of Ishii and connect continuously the minimal solution to the maximal one.</description>

      <title>New spectral Bishop--Gromov and Bonnet--Myers theorems and applications to isoperimetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08918v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show a sharp and rigid spectral generalization of the classical Bishop--Gromov volume comparison theorem: if a closed Riemannian manifold $(M,g)$ of dimension $n\geq3$ satisfies \[ \lambda_1(-\gamma\Delta+\mathrm{Ric})\geqslant n-1 \] for some $0\leqslant\gamma\leqslant\frac{n-1}{n-2}$, then $\mathrm{vol}(M)\leqslant\mathrm{vol}(\mathbb S^{n})$, and $\pi_1(M)$ is finite. Moreover, the bound on $\gamma$ is sharp for this result to hold. A generalization of the Bonnet--Myers theorem is also shown under the same spectral condition. The proofs involve the use of a new unequally weighted isoperimetric problem and unequally warped $\mu$-bubbles. As an application, in dimensions $3\leqslant n\leqslant 5$, we infer sharp results on the isoperimetric structure at infinity of complete manifolds with nonnegative Ricci curvature and uniformly positive biRicci curvature.</description>

      <title>On backward problem for a time-fractional fourth order parabolic equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09424v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with the inverse problem of retrieving the initial value of a time-fractional fourth order parabolic equation from source and final time observation. The considered problem is an {\it ill-posed problem.} We obtain regularized approximations for the sought initial value by employing the quasi-boundary value method, its modified version and by Fourier truncation method(FTM). We provide both the apriori and aposteriori parameter choice strategies and derive the error estimates for all these methods under some {\it source conditions} involving some Sobolev smoothness. As an important implication of the obtained rates, we observe that for both the apriori and aposteriori cases, the rates obtained by all these three methods are same for some source sets. Moreover, we observe that in both the apriori and aposteriori cases, the FTM is free from the so-called {\it saturation effect}, whereas both the quasi-boundary value method and its generalizations possesses the saturation effect for both the cases. Further, we observe that the rates obtained by the FTM is always order optimal for all the considered source sets.</description>

      <title>Blow-up criteria below scaling for defocusing energy-supercritical NLS and quantitative global scattering bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.05477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2001.05477v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish quantitative blow-up criteria below the scaling threshold for radially symmetric solutions to the defocusing nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation with nonlinearity $|u|^6u$. This provides to our knowledge the first generic results distinguishing potential blow-up solutions of the defocusing equation from many of the known examples of blow-up in the focusing case. Our main tool is a quantitative version of a result showing that uniform bounds on $L^2$-based critical Sobolev norms imply scattering estimates.
  As another application of our techniques, we establish a variant which allows for slow growth in the critical norm. We show that if the critical Sobolev norm on compact time intervals is controlled by a slowly growing quantity depending on the Stricharz norm, then the solution can be extended globally in time, with a corresponding scattering estimate.</description>

      <title>The full delocalization of eigenstates for the quantized cat map</title>

      <description>arXiv:2103.06633v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the quantum cat map - a toy model of a quantized chaotic system. We show that its eigenstates are fully delocalized on $\mathbb{T}^2$ in the semiclassical limit (or equivalently that each semiclassical measure is fully supported on $\mathbb{T}^2$). We adapt the proof of a similar result proved for the eigenstates of $-\Delta_g$ on compact hyperbolic surfaces from [arXiv:1705.05019], relying on the fractal uncertainty principle in [arXiv:1612.09040].</description>

      <title>Linear vs. nonlinear speed selection of the front propagation into unstable states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2207.03371v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the speed selection problem of the scalar reaction-diffusion equations and the two-species Lotka-Volterra competition systems. We propose a sufficient and necessary criterion for this long-standing problem of monostable dynamical systems for the first time, from a different point of view as compared to the classical result on single equations in [Lucia-Muratov-Novaga, CPAM 2004]. Moreover, our results can further reveal the essence of the linear determined problem from a new viewpoint on the decay rate of traveling wave solutions. Our results seem to be the first that provide a sufficient and necessary criterion for the speed selection of the two-species Lotka-Volterra competition system.</description>

      <title>The Boussinesq systems on non-compact Riemannian Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.07803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.07803v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the global existence, uniqueness and exponential stability of mild solutions to the Boussinesq systems on the framework of non-compact Riemannian manifolds. We work on some manifolds satisfying some bounded and negative conditions on curvature tensors. We consider a couple of Stokes and heat semigroups associated with the corresponding linear system which provides a vectorial matrix semigoup. By using dispersive and smoothing estimates of the vectorial matrix semigroup we establish the existence and uniqueness of the bounded-in-time mild solution for linear system. Next, we can pass from the linear system to the semilinear system to obtain the well-posedness by utilizing fixed point arguments. Moreover, we will prove the exponential stability of such solutions by using Gronwall's inequality. Finally, we give an application of stability to study periodic mild solutions. Our results extend the ones in \cite{Pi,HuyHa2022} in the aspect of global-in-time well-posedness and the existence of periodic mild solutions.</description>

      <title>Minimization of a Ginzburg-Landau functional with mean curvature operator in 1-D</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.01832v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to investigate the minimization problem related to a Ginzburg-Landau energy functional, where in particular a nonlinear diffusion of mean curvature-type is considered, together with a classical double well potential. A careful analysis of the corresponding Euler-Lagrange equation, equipped with natural boundary conditions and mass constraint, leads to the existence of an unique Maxwell solution, namely a monotone increasing solution obtained for small diffusion and close to the so-called Maxwell point. Then, it is shown that this particular solution (and its reversal) has least energy among all the stationary points satisfying the given mass constraint. Moreover, as the viscosity parameter tends to zero, it converges to the increasing (decreasing for the reversal) single interface solution, namely the constrained minimizer of the corresponding energy without diffusion. Connections with Cahn-Hilliard models, obtained in terms of variational derivatives of the total free energy considered here, are also presented.</description>

      <title>Optimal constants of smoothing estimates for Dirac equations with radial data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.08982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.08982v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Kato--Yajima smoothing estimates are one of the fundamental results in study of dispersive equations such as Schr\"odinger equations and Dirac equations. For $d$-dimensional Schr\"odinger-type equations ($d \geq 2$), optimal constants of smoothing estimates were obtained by Bez--Saito--Sugimoto (2017) via the so-called Funk--Hecke theorem. Recently Ikoma (2022) considered optimal constants for $d$-dimensional Dirac equations using a similar method, and it was revealed that determining optimal constants for Dirac equations is much harder than the case of Schr\"odinger-type equations. Indeed, Ikoma obtained the optimal constant in the case $d = 2$, but only upper bounds (which seem not optimal) were given in other dimensions. In this paper, we give optimal constants for $d$-dimensional Schr\"odinger-type and Dirac equations with radial initial data for any $d \geq 2$. In addition, we also give optimal constants for the one-dimensional Schr\"odinger-type and Dirac equations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.10112v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that, on a planar regular domain, suitably scaled functionals of Ginzburg-Landau type, given by the sum of quadratic fractional Sobolev seminorms and a penalization term vanishing on the unitary sphere, $\Gamma$-converge to vortex-type energies with respect to the flat convergence of Jacobians. The compactness and the $\Gamma$-$\liminf$ follow by comparison with standard Ginzburg-Landau functionals depending on Riesz potentials. The $\Gamma$-$\limsup$, instead, is achieved via a direct argument by joining a finite number of vortex-like functions suitably truncated around the singularity.</description>

      <title>On stability problem for the stationary Boussinesq system in Morrey-type spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.06466v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we establish the asymptotic stability of steady solutions for the Boussinesq systems in the framework of Cartesian product of critical weak-Morrey spaces on $\mathbb{R}^n$, where $n \geqslant 3$. In our strategy, we first establish the continuity for the long time of the bilinear terms associated with the mild solutions of the Boussinesq systems, i.e., the bilinear estimates by using only the norm of the present spaces. As a direct consequence, we obtain the existence of global small mild solutions and asymptotic stability of steady solutions of the Boussinesq systems in the class of continuous functions from $[0, \infty)$ to the Cartesian product of critical weak-Morrey spaces. Our techniques consist interpolation of operators, duality, heat semigroup estimates , Holder and Young inequalities in block spaces (based on Lorentz spaces) that are preduals of Morrey-Lorentz spaces. Our results are generalized the previous ones of the steady Boussinesq systems in weak-$L^p$ spaces obtained by Hishida [T. Hishida, {\it On a class of Stable Steady flow to the Exterior Convection Problem}, Journal of Differential Equations, Vol. 141, Iss. 1 (1997), pages 54-85] and Ferreira et al. [L.C.F. Ferreira and E.J. Villamizar-Roa, {\it On the stability problem for the Boussinesq equations in weak-$L^p$ spaces}, Commun. Pure Appl. Anal.

Yamazaki, {\it The stability of small stationary solutions in Morrey Spaces of the Navier-Stokes equation}, Indiana University Mathematics Journal, Vol. 44, No. 4 (1995), pages 1307-1336].</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.11078v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the stationary (time-independent) Navier-Stokes equations in the whole threedimensional space, under the action of a source term and with the fractional Laplacian operator (--$\Delta$) $\alpha$/2 in the diffusion term. In the framework of Lebesgue and Lorentz spaces, we find some natural sufficient conditions on the external force and on the parameter $\alpha$ to prove the existence and in some cases nonexistence of solutions. Secondly, we obtain sharp pointwise decaying rates and asymptotic profiles of solutions, which strongly depend on $\alpha$. Finally, we also prove the global regularity of solutions. As a bi-product, we obtain some uniqueness theorems so-called Liouville-type results. On the other hand, our regularity result yields a new regularity criterion for the classical ( i.e. with $\alpha$ = 2) stationary Navier-Stokes equations. Contents</description>

      <title>Diffusive Limit of the Vlasov-Poisson-Boltzmann System without Angular Cutoff</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.16588v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Diffusive limit of the Vlasov-Poisson-Boltzmann system without angular cutoff in the framework of perturbation around global Maxwellian still remains open. By employing the weighted energy method with a newly introduced weight function $w_l(\alpha,\beta)$ and some novel treatments, we solve this problem for the full range of non-cutoff potentials $\gamma&gt;-3$ and $0&lt;s&lt;1$. Uniform estimate with respect to the Knudsen number $\varepsilon \in (0,1]$ is established globally in time, which eventually leads to the global existence of solutions to the Vlasov-Poisson-Boltzmann system without angular cutoff for the full range of non-cutoff potentials and hydrodynamic limit to the two-fluid incompressible Navier-Stokes-Fourier-Poisson system with Ohm's law. As a byproduct, this approach also extends the global existence results of previous studies on the Vlasov-Poisson-Boltzmann system without angular cutoff to the full range of non-cutoff potentials $\gamma&gt;-3$ and $0&lt;s&lt;1$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.02845v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove a new general differential identity and an associated integral identity, which entails a pair of solutions of the Poisson equation with constant source term. This generalizes a formula that the first and third authors previously proved and used to obtain quantitative estimates of spherical symmetry for the Serrin overdetermined boundary value problem. As an application, we prove a quantitative symmetry result for the reverse Serrin problem, which we introduce for the first time in this paper. In passing, we obtain a rigidity result for solutions of the aforementioned Poisson equation subject to a constant Neumann condition.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we prove the existence of a family of non trivial compact subdomains $\O$ in the manifold $\mathcal{M}=\R^N\times \R/2\pi\Z$ for which the overdetermined Neumann boundary value problem
  \begin{align}\label{Neumann1}
  \left \{
  \begin{aligned}
  -\D w&amp;=\mu |w|^{p-2}w &amp;&amp; \qquad \text{in $ \Omega$,}
  \frac{\partial w}{\partial\eta} &amp;=0 &amp;&amp;\qquad \text{on $\partial \Omega,$}
w&amp;=c\ne 0 &amp;&amp;\qquad \text{on $\partial \Omega$,}
  \end{aligned}
  \right. \end{align}
admits solutions for some $\mu &gt; 0$ and $2&lt;p&lt;2^{*}=\frac{2N}{N-2}$ if $N\geq 3$ or $p&gt;2$ if $N=2$. The domains we construct have nonconstant principal curvature, and therefore are not isoparametric nor homogeneous. By this, we establish a non-linear analogue of a recent result obtained by Fall, Weth and the first named author in \cite{Fall-MinlendI-Weth4}, where the overdetermined Neumann eigenvalue problem for the Laplacian was considered.</description>

      <title>Global exterior stability of the Minkowski space: coupled Einstein-Yang-Mills perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.03167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.03167v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Here we prove a global gauge-invariant radiation estimates for the perturbations of the $3+1$ dimensional Minkowski spacetime in the presence of Yang-Mills sources. In particular, we obtain a novel gauge invariant estimate for the Yang-Mills fields coupled to gravity in a double null framework in the Causal complement of a compact set of a Cauchy slice. A consequence of our result is the global exterior stability of the Minkowski space under coupled Yang-Mills perturbations. A special structure present both in the null Bianchi equations and the null Yang-Mills equations is utilized crucially to obtain the dispersive estimates necessary to conclude the global existence property. Direct use of Bel-Robinson and Yang-Mills stress-energy tensor to obtain the energy estimates is avoided in favor of weighted integration by parts taking advantage of the manifestly symmetric hyperbolic characteristics of null Bianchi and null Yang-Mills equations. Our result holds for any compact semi-simple gauge group. This is the first stability result of Minkowski space including a non-linear source.</description>

      <title>Slender vortex filaments in the Boussinesq Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00460v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A model for the motion of slender vortex filaments is extended to include the effect of gravity. The model, initially introduced by Callegari and Ting (SIAM, J. of App. Math., (1978), vol. 35, pp. 148-175), is based on a matched asymptotic expansion in which the outer solution, given by the Biot-Savart law, is matched with the inner solution derived from the Navier-Stokes equations. Building on recent work by Harikrishnan et al (Phys. of Fluids, (2023), vol. 35) the Boussinesq approximation is applied such that the density variations only enter in the gravity term. However, unlike Harikrishnan et al. (2023) the density variation enters at a lower order in the asymptotic expansion, and thus has a more significant impact on the self-induced velocity of the vortex filament. In this regime, which corresponds to the regime studied by Chang and Smith (J. of Fl. Mech., (2018), vol. 857), the effect of gravity is given by an alteration of the core constant, which couples the motion of the filament to the motion within the vortical core, in addition to a change in the compatability conditions (evolution equations) which determine the leading order azimuthal and tangential velocity fields in the vortex core. The results are used to explain certain properties of bouyant vortex rings, as well as qualitatively explore the impact of gravity on tornado type atmospheric vorticies.</description>
