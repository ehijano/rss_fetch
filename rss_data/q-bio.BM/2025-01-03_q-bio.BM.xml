      <title>Minimal Models for RNA Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00194v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing importance of RNA as a prime player in biology can hardly be overstated. It is suspected that the functions of RNA are linked to their structures and dynamics. Many of the problems in RNA, such as folding and RNA-RNA interactions that drive phase separation even in the absence of proteins, require cations. Because experiments alone cannot directly reveal the dynamics of cation-RNA interactions, well calibrated theory and computations are needed to predict how ions control the behavior of RNA. In this review, we outline the development of coarse-grained models at different resolutions with application to phase separation in low complexity sequences. We also describe folding of ribozymes and riboswitches with a focus on the impact of monovalent and divalent cations. We outline major challenges that need to be overcome to simulate complex problems such as assembly of ribosomes.</description>

      <title>Electrostatics of Salt-Dependent Reentrant Phase Behaviors Highlights Diverse Roles of ATP in Biomolecular Condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.04873v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) involving intrinsically disordered protein regions (IDRs) is a major physical mechanism for biological membraneless compartmentalization. The multifaceted electrostatic effects in these biomolecular condensates are exemplified here by experimental and theoretical investigations of the different salt- and ATP-dependent LLPSs of an IDR of messenger RNA-regulating protein Caprin1 and its phosphorylated variant pY-Caprin1, exhibiting, e.g., reentrant behaviors in some instances but not others. Experimental data are rationalized by physical modeling using analytical theory, molecular dynamics, and polymer field-theoretic simulations, indicating that interchain ion bridges enhance LLPS of polyelectrolytes such as Caprin1 and the high valency of ATP-magnesium is a significant factor for its colocalization with the condensed phases, as similar trends are observed for other IDRs. The electrostatic nature of these features complements ATP's involvement in $\pi$-related interactions and as an amphiphilic hydrotrope, underscoring a general role of biomolecular condensates in modulating ion concentrations and its functional ramifications.</description>

      <title>PepTune: De Novo Generation of Therapeutic Peptides with Multi-Objective-Guided Discrete Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17780v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Peptide therapeutics, a major class of medicines, have achieved remarkable success across diseases such as diabetes and cancer, with landmark examples such as GLP-1 receptor agonists revolutionizing the treatment of type-2 diabetes and obesity. Despite their success, designing peptides that satisfy multiple conflicting objectives, such as target binding affinity, solubility, and membrane permeability, remains a major challenge. Classical drug development and structure-based design are ineffective for such tasks, as they fail to optimize global functional properties critical for therapeutic efficacy. Existing generative frameworks are largely limited to continuous spaces, unconditioned outputs, or single-objective guidance, making them unsuitable for discrete sequence optimization across multiple properties. To address this, we present PepTune, a multi-objective discrete diffusion model for the simultaneous generation and optimization of therapeutic peptide SMILES. Built on the Masked Discrete Language Model (MDLM) framework, PepTune ensures valid peptide structures with state-dependent masking schedules and penalty-based objectives. To guide the diffusion process, we propose a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)-based strategy that balances exploration and exploitation to iteratively refine Pareto-optimal sequences. MCTS integrates classifier-based rewards with search-tree expansion, overcoming gradient estimation challenges and data sparsity inherent to discrete spaces. Using PepTune, we generate diverse, chemically-modified peptides optimized for multiple therapeutic properties, including target binding affinity, membrane permeability, solubility, hemolysis, and non-fouling characteristics on various disease-relevant targets. In total, our results demonstrate that MCTS-guided discrete diffusion is a powerful and modular approach for multi-objective sequence design in discrete state spaces.</description>

      <title>Accurate RNA 3D structure prediction using a language model-based deep learning approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.01586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.01586v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate prediction of RNA three-dimensional (3D) structure remains an unsolved challenge. Determining RNA 3D structures is crucial for understanding their functions and informing RNA-targeting drug development and synthetic biology design. The structural flexibility of RNA, which leads to scarcity of experimentally determined data, complicates computational prediction efforts. Here, we present RhoFold+, an RNA language model-based deep learning method that accurately predicts 3D structures of single-chain RNAs from sequences. By integrating an RNA language model pre-trained on ~23.7 million RNA sequences and leveraging techniques to address data scarcity, RhoFold+ offers a fully automated end-to-end pipeline for RNA 3D structure prediction. Retrospective evaluations on RNA-Puzzles and CASP15 natural RNA targets demonstrate RhoFold+'s superiority over existing methods, including human expert groups. Its efficacy and generalizability are further validated through cross-family and cross-type assessments, as well as time-censored benchmarks. Additionally, RhoFold+ predicts RNA secondary structures and inter-helical angles, providing empirically verifiable features that broaden its applicability to RNA structure and function studies.</description>
