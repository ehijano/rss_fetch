      <title>Charges in light cones and quenched infrared radiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02342v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The creation of electrically charged states and the resulting electromagnetic fields are considered in space-time regions in which such experiments can actually be carried out, namely in future-directed light cones. Under the simplifying assumption of external charges, charged states are formed from neutral pairs of opposite charges, with one charge being shifted to light-like infinity. It thereby escapes observation. Despite the fact that this charge moves asymptotically at the speed of light, the resulting electromagnetic field has a well-defined energy operator that is bounded from below. Moreover, due to the spatiotemporal restrictions, the transverse electromagnetic field (the radiation) has no infrared singularities in the light cone. They are quenched and the observed radiation can be described by states in the Fock space of photons. The longitudinal field between the charges (giving rise to Gauss's law) disappears for inertial observers in an instant. This is consistent with the fact that there is no evidence for the existence of longitudinal photons. The results show that the restrictions of operations and observations to light cones, which are dictated by the arrow of time, amount to a Lorentz-invariant infrared cutoff.</description>

      <title>Stable soap bubble clusters with multiple torus bubbles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the last two centuries and more particularly in the last decades, the geometry of foams has become an important research domain, in mathematics, physics, material sciences and biology. Most of the simplest geometrical observations of bubble clusters have long resisted rigorous mathematical proofs and many questions are still unanswered, even more if immiscible fluids are considered. For instance, it is unknown if immiscible fluids have to fulfill Plateau's laws, although it is proven to be for surface tensions close to unity. Whether we consider immiscible fluids clusters or soap type bubble clusters, an interesting question is the existence clusters with topological torus bubbles. We propose to answer the latter numerically with simple numerical examples of clusters with bubbles having the topology of a torus, a triple torus, a fivefold torus or an elevenfold torus.</description>

      <title>The structures of simple Hurwitz numbers and monotone Hurwitz numbers with varying genus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01920v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the structures of ordinary simple Hurwitz numbers and monotone Hurwitz numbers with varying genus. More precisely, we prove that when the ramification type is fixed and the genus is treated as a variable, the connected monotone Hurwitz number is a linear combination of products of exponentials and polynomials, and the ordinary simple Hurwitz number is a linear combination of exponentials. Using these structural properties, we also derive the large genus asymptotics of these two kinds of Hurwitz numbers. As a result, we prove one conjecture, and disprove another, both proposed by Do, He and Robertson.</description>

Abstract: We review various aspects of Sasaki-Einstein and GK geometry, emphasising their similarities, interconnections and significance for the AdS/CFT correspondence. In particular, we highlight the key role that physical considerations have played in formulating geometric extremization principles, which have been instrumental in both understanding the geometry and identifying the corresponding dual field theories.</description>

      <title>Counterdiabatic Driving with Performance Guarantees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01958v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Counterdiabatic (CD) driving has the potential to speed up adiabatic quantum state preparation by suppressing unwanted excitations. However, existing approaches either require intractable classical computations or are based on approximations which do not have performance guarantees. We propose and analyze a non-variational, system-agnostic CD expansion method and analytically show that it converges exponentially quickly in the expansion order. In finite systems, the required resources scale inversely with the spectral gap, which we argue is asymptotically optimal. To extend our method to the thermodynamic limit and suppress errors stemming from high-frequency transitions, we leverage finite-time adiabatic protocols. In particular, we show that a time determined by the quantum speed limit is sufficient to prepare the desired ground state, without the need to optimize the adiabatic trajectory. Numerical tests of our method on the quantum Ising chain show that our method can outperform state-of-the-art variational CD approaches.</description>

      <title>Entanglement dynamics of many-body quantum states with evolving system conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01989v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The entanglement analysis of a pure state of a many-body quantum system requires a prior information about its density matrix/ state matrix, obtained in principle by solving the Hamiltonian matrix. The missing information due to complexity of the many-body interactions however renders it necessary to consider an ensemble of Hamiltonians and thereby an ensemble of pure states. This in turn leaves a statistical description of the entanglement measures as the only option.
  We consider physical Hamiltonians that can be modelled by a multiparametric Gaussian ensembles, theoretically derive the state ensembles for its eigenstates and analyze the effect of varying system conditions on its entanglement statistics. Our approach leads to a single parametric based common mathematical formulation for the evolution of the statistics of different state ensembles. The parameter turns out to be a single functional of the system parameters and thereby reveals a deep web of connection underlying different quantum states.</description>

      <title>Polynomial Toda maps are transfer matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02153v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider entire matrix functions $A(z)$ taking values in $\operatorname{SL}(2,\mathbb C)$. These map pairs of Herglotz functions by acting pointwise as linear fractional transformations. The main examples of such Toda maps are provided by transfer matrices of differential and difference operators and by the cocycles associated with the classical integrable systems (Toda, KdV, etc.) on these operators. Here we consider polynomial matrix functions $A(z)$. We describe these in terms of a factorization, and we then prove that if $A$ induces a Toda map, then $A$ is essentially a transfer matrix.</description>

      <title>Streams, Graphs and Global Attractors of Dynamical Systems on Locally Compact Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02262v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a recent article, we introduced the concept of streams and graphs of a semiflow. An important related concept is the one of semiflow with {\em compact dynamics}, which we defined as a semiflow $F$ with a {\em compact global trapping region}. In this follow-up, we restrict to the important case where the phase space $X$ is locally compact and we move the focus on the concept of {\em global attractor}, a maximal compact set that attracts every compact subset of $X$. A semiflow $F$ can have many global trapping regions but, if it has a global attractor, this is unique. We modify here our original definition and we say that $F$ has compact dynamics if it has a global attractor $G$. We show that most of the qualitative properties of $F$ are inherited by the restriction $F_G$ of $F$ to $G$ and that, in case of Conley's chains stream of $F$, the qualitative behavior of $F$ and $F_G$ coincide. Moreover, if $F$ is a continuous-time semiflow, then its graph is identical to the graph of its time-1 map. Our main result is that, for each semiflow $F$ with compact dynamics over a locally compact space, the graphs of the prolongational relation of $F$ and of every stream of $F$ are connected if the global attractor is connected.</description>

      <title>Non-split superstrings of dimension $(1|2)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02416v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Any supermanifold diffeomorphic to one whose structure sheaf is the sheaf of sections of a~vector bundle over the underlying manifold is called split. Gaw\c{e}dzki (1977) and Batchelor (1979) were the first to prove that any smooth supermanifold is split. In 1981, P.~Green, and Palamodov, found examples of non-split analytic supermanifolds and described obstructions to splitness that were further studied by Manin (resp. Onishchik with his students) following Palamodov's (resp. Green's) approach. Following Palamodov, Donagi and Witten demonstrated that some of the moduli supervarieties of superstring theories are non-split. None of the above-mentioned authors considered odd parameters of supervarieties of obstructions to non-splitness. Here, using Palamodov's approach, we classify and describe the even (degree-2) and the odd (degree-1) obstructions to splitness of $(1|2)$-dimensional superstrings. In particular, we correct calculations of degree-2 obstructions due to Bunegina and Onishchik and confirm Manin's answer.</description>

      <title>Linear Instability of the Prandtl Equations via Hypergeometric Functions and the Harmonic Oscillator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02417v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish a deep connection between the Prandtl equations linearised around a quadratic shear flow, confluent hypergeometric functions of the first kind, and the Schr\"odinger operator.
  Our first result concerns an ODE and a spectral condition derived in [10], associated with unstable quasi-eigenmodes of the Prandtl equations. We entirely determine the space of solutions in terms of Kummer's functions. By classifying their asymptotic behaviour, we verify that the spectral condition has a unique, explicitly determined pair of eigenvalue and eigenfunction, the latter being expressible as a combination of elementary functions.
  Secondly, we prove that any quasi-eigenmode solution of the linearised Prandtl equations around a quadratic shear flow can be explicitly determined from algebraic eigenfunctions of the Schr\"odinger operator with quadratic potential.
  We show finally that the obtained analytical formulation of the velocity align with previous numerical simulations in the literature.</description>

      <title>Row and column detection complexities of character tables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02543v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Character tables of finite groups and closely related commutative algebras have been investigated recently using new perspectives arising from the AdS/CFT correspondence and low-dimensional topological quantum field theories. Two important elements in these new perspectives are physically motivated definitions of quantum complexity for the algebras and a notion of row-column duality. These elements are encoded in properties of the character table of a group G and the associated algebras, notably the centre of the group algebra and the fusion algebra of irreducible representations of the group. Motivated by these developments, we define row and column versions of detection complexities for character tables, and investigate the relation between these complexities under the exchange of rows and columns. We observe regularities that arise in the statistical averages over small character tables and propose corresponding conjectures for arbitrarily large character tables.</description>

      <title>Mode stability of blow-up for wave maps in the absence of symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02632v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The wave maps equation in three spatial dimensions with a spherical target admits an explicit blow-up solution. Numerical studies suggest this solution captures the generic blow-up behaviour in the backward light cone of the singularity. In this work, we establish the mode stability of this blow-up solution in the backward light cone of the blow-up point without any assumptions on the symmetries of the perturbation. We classify all smooth mode solutions for growth rates $\lambda$ with $\mathrm{Re} \, \lambda \geq 0$ and demonstrate that the blow-up solution is stable up to the mode solutions arising from the symmetry group of the wave maps equation. Our proof relies on a decomposition of the linearised wave maps equation into a tractable system of symmetry-equivariant ordinary differential equations (ODEs), utilising the representation theory of the stabiliser of the blow-up solution. We then use the quasi-solution method of Costin-Donninger-Glogi\'{c} to show the absence of non-zero smooth solutions for the resulting system of ODEs.</description>

      <title>$C^{1}$-Stable-Manifolds for Periodic Heteroclinic Chains in Bianchi IX: Symbolic Computations and Statistical Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02664v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we study oscillatory Bianchi models of class A and are able to show that for admissible periodic heteroclinic chains in Bianchi IX there exisist $C^{1}$- stable - manifolds of orbits that follow these chains towards the big bang. A detailed study of Takens Linearization Theorem and the Non-Resonance-Conditions leads us to this new result in Bianchi class A. More precisely, we can show that there are no heteroclinic chains in Bianchi IX with constant continued fraction development that allow Takens-Linearization at all of their base points. Geometrically speaking, this excludes "symmetric" heteroclinic chains with the same number of "bounces" near all of the 3 Taub Points - the result shows that we have to require some "asymmetry" in the bounces in order to allow for Takens Linearization, e.g. by considering admissible 2-periodic continued fraction developments. We conclude by discussing the statistical properties of those solutions, including their topological and measure-theoretic genericity.</description>

      <title>The 18-cycle in Bianchi $VI_{-1/9}^{^{*}}$: Combined Linear Local Passage and Numerical Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02684v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we find an example for a periodic heteroclinic chain in Bianchi $VI_{-1/9}^{^{*}}$ that allows Takens Linearization at all base points. It turns out to be a "18-cycle'', i.e. involving a heteroclinic chain of 18 different base points at the Kasner circle. We then show that the combined cinear local passage at the 18-cycle is a contraction. This qualifies the 18-cycle as a candidate for proving the first rigorous convergence theorem in Bianchi $VI_{-1/9}^{^{*}}$.
  For the numerical simulation of solutions that follow such heteroclinic cycles, we use a variable-step, variable-order (VSVO) Adams-Bashforth-Moulton PECE solver in Matlab. We conclude with a discussion on how to proceed further in studying Bianchi cosmologies, and also discuss directions for future research in inhomogeneous (PDE-) cosmological models. This puts our results in a broader perspective. The appendix contains symbolic and computations done by Mathematica for examples discussed throughout the text.</description>

      <title>Large deviations of SLE(0+) variants in the capacity parameterization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02795v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove large deviation principles (LDPs) for full chordal, radial, and multichordal SLE(0+) curves parameterized by capacity. The rate function is given by the appropriate variant of the Loewner energy. There are two key novelties in the present work. First, we strengthen the topology in the known chordal LDPs into the topology of full parameterized curves including all curve endpoints. We also obtain LDPs in the space of unparameterized curves. Second, we address the radial case, which requires in part different methods from the chordal case, due to the different topological setup. We establish our main results via proving an exponential tightness property and combining it with detailed curve return probability estimates, in the spirit of exponentially good approximations in LDP theory. Notably, since we manage to prove a finite-time LDP in a better topology than in earlier literature, return energy estimates follow as a consequence of the return probability estimates.</description>

      <title>Lecture notes on Legendre polynomials: their origin and main properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.10942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.10942v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is well-known that separation of variables in 2nd order partial differential equations (PDEs) for physical problems with spherical symmetry usually leads to Cauchy's differential equation for the radial coordinate and Legendre's differential equation for the polar angle $\theta$. For eigenvalues of the form $\,n\,(n+1)$, $n \ge 0\,$ being an integer, Legendre's equation admits certain polynomials $P_n(\cos{\theta})$ as solutions, which form a complete set of continuous orthogonal functions for all $\theta \in [0,\pi]$. This allows us to take the polynomials $P_n(x)$, where $x = \cos{\theta}$, as a basis for the Fourier-Legendre series expansion of any function $f(x)$ continuous by parts over $\,x \in [-1,1]$. These lecture notes correspond to the end of my course on Mathematical Methods for Physics, when I did derive the differential equations and solutions for physical problems with spherical symmetry. For those interested in Number Theory, I have included an application of shifted Legendre polynomials in \emph{irrationality proofs}, following a method introduced by Beukers to show that $\zeta{(2)}$ and $\zeta{(3)}$ are irrational numbers.</description>

      <title>Momentum Distribution of a Fermi Gas in the Random Phase Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.02706v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a system of interacting fermions on the three-dimensional torus in a mean-field scaling limit. Our objective is computing the occupation number of the Fourier modes in a trial state obtained through the random phase approximation (in its collective bosonization formulation) for the ground state. We prove that the trial state's momentum distribution has a jump discontinuity, i.e., a well-defined Fermi surface. Moreover the Fermi momentum does not depend on the interaction potential (it is universal). Our result shows that the random phase approximation in the mean-field scaling limit is in principle sufficiently precise to identify a non-trivial Fermi liquid phase.</description>

      <title>From the Conformal Anomaly to the Virasoro Algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09628v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The conformal anomaly and the Virasoro algebra are fundamental aspects of 2D conformal field theory and conformally covariant models in planar random geometry. In this article, we explicitly derive the Virasoro algebra from an axiomatization of the conformal anomaly in terms of real determinant lines, one-dimensional vector spaces associated to Riemann surfaces with analytically parametrized boundary components. Here, analytical orientation-preserving diffeomorphisms and deformations of the circle naturally act on the boundary components. We introduce a sewing operation on the real determinant lines over the semigroup of annuli, which then induces central extensions of the diffeomorphism group, as well as of the complex deformations.
  Our main theorem shows that on the one hand, the cocycle associated to the central extension of diffeomorphisms is trivial, while on the other hand, the Lie algebra cocycle associated to the central extension of complex deformations is nontrivial, yielding the imaginary part of the Gel'fand-Fuks cocycle. We thus answer a question, partly negatively and partly affirmatively, discussed by Andre Henriques and Dylan Thurston in 2011. The proof uses concrete computations, which we aim to be accessible to a wide audience.
  We also show an explicit relation to loop Loewner energy, anticipating the real determinant lines to be pertinent to locally conformally covariant (Malliavin-Kontsevich-Suhov) measures on curves and loops, as well as to K\"ahler geometry and geometric quantization of moduli spaces of Riemann surfaces. Inherently, the conformal anomaly and real determinant line bundles are expected to be universal, following a classification of modular functors.</description>

      <title>Mesoscopic and Macroscopic Entropy Balance Equations in a Stochastic Dynamics and Its Deterministic Limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00165v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Entropy, its production, and its change in a dynamical system can be understood from either a fully stochastic dynamic description or from a deterministic dynamics exhibiting chaotic behavior. By taking the former approach based on the general diffusion process with diffusion $\tfrac{1}{\alpha}{\bf D}(\bf x)$ and drift $\bf b(\bf x)$, where $\alpha$ represents the ``size parameter'' of a system, we show that there are two distinctly different entropy balance equations. One reads ${\rm d} S^{(\alpha)}/{\rm d} t = e^{(\alpha)}_p + Q^{(\alpha)}_{ex}$ for all $\alpha$. However, the leading $\alpha$-order, ``extensive'', terms of the entropy production rate $e^{(\alpha)}_p$ and heat exchange rate $Q^{(\alpha)}_{ex}$ are exactly cancelled. Therefore, in the asymptotic limit of $\alpha\to\infty$, there is a second, local ${\rm d} S/{\rm d} t = \nabla\cdot{\bf b}({\bf x}(t))+\left({\bf D}:{\bf \Sigma}^{-1}\right)({\bf x}(t))$ on the order of $O(1)$, where $\tfrac{1}{\alpha}{\bf D}(\bf x(t))$ represents the randomness generated in the dynamics usually represented by metric entropy, and $\tfrac{1}{\alpha}{\bf \Sigma}({\bf x}(t))$ is the covariance matrix of the local Gaussian description at ${\bf x}(t)$, which is a solution to the ordinary differential equation $\dot{\bf x}={\bf b}(\bf x)$ at time $t$. This latter equation is akin to the notions of volume-preserving conservative dynamics and entropy production in the deterministic dynamic approach to nonequilibrium thermodynamics {\it \`{a} la} D. Ruelle. As a continuation of [17], mathematical details with sufficient care are given in four Appendices.</description>

      <title>Quantum Field Theory in Curved Spacetime (2nd Edition)</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.14517v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The 2023 second edition of a 2006 encyclopedia article on mathematical aspects of quantum field theory in curved spacetimes (QFTCST). Section-titles (with new sections indicated with stars) are: Introduction and preliminaries, Construction of a $*$-algebra for a real linear scalar field on globally hyperbolic spacetimes and some general theorems, *More about (quasifree) Hadamard states, Particle creation and the limitations of the particle concept, Theory of the stress-energy tensor, *More about the intersection of QFTCST with AQFT and the Fewster-Verch No-Go Theorem, Hawking and Unruh effects, *More about (classical and) quantum fields on black hole backgrounds, Non-globally hyperbolic spacetimes and the time-machine question, *More about QFT on non-globally hyperbolic spacetimes, Other related topics and some warnings. The article contains many references. It also includes a review of, and also compares and contrasts, recent results on the implications of QFTCST for the question of the instability of three sorts of Cauchy horizon -- first those inside black holes such as especially Reissner-Nordstr\"om-de Sitter and Kerr-de Sitter, second the compactly generated Cauchy horizons of spacetimes in which time-machines get manufactured, and third the Cauchy horizon of the spacetime which is believed to describe evaporating black holes and which underlies (one version of) the black hole information-loss puzzle.</description>

      <title>Mutual Information Bounded by Fisher Information</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10248v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive a general upper bound to mutual information in terms of the Fisher information. The bound may be further used to derive a lower bound for the Bayesian quadratic cost. These two provide alternatives to other inequalities in the literature (e.g.~the van Trees inequality) that are useful also for cases where the latter ones give trivial bounds. We then generalize them to the quantum case, where they bound the Holevo information in terms of the quantum Fisher information. We illustrate the usefulness of our bounds with a case study in quantum phase estimation. Here, they allow us to adapt to mutual information (useful for global strategies where the prior plays an important role) the known and highly nontrivial bounds for the Fisher information in the presence of noise. The results are also useful in the context of quantum communication, both for continuous and discrete alphabets.</description>

      <title>Embedding formalism for AdS superspaces in five dimensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.10875v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The standard geometric description of $d$-dimensional anti-de Sitter (AdS) space is a quadric in ${\mathbb R}^{d-1,2}$ defined by $(X^0)^2 - (X^1)^2 - \dots - (X^{d-1})^2 + (X^d)^2 = \ell^2 = \text{const}$. In this paper we provide a supersymmetric generalisation of this embedding construction in the $d=5$ case. Specifically, a bi-supertwistor realisation is given for the ${\cal N}$-extended AdS superspace $\text{AdS}^{5|8\cal N}$, with ${\cal N}\geq 1$. The proposed formalism offers a simple construction of AdS super-invariants. As an example, we present a new model for a massive superparticle in $\text{AdS}^{5|8\cal N}$ which is manifestly invariant under the AdS isometry supergroup $\mathsf{SU}(2,2|{\cal N})$ and involves two independent two-derivative terms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04372v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use an exact Moreau-Yosida regularized formulation to obtain the exchange-correlation potential for periodic systems. We reveal a profound connection between rigorous mathematical principles and efficient numerical implementation, which marks the first computation of a Moreau-Yosida-based inversion for physical systems. We develop a mathematically rigorous inversion algorithm which is demonstrated for representative bulk materials, specifically bulk silicon, gallium arsenide, and potassium chloride. This inversion algorithm allows the construction of rigorous error bounds that we are able to verify numerically. This unlocks a new pathway to analyze Kohn-Sham inversion methods, which we expect in turn to foster mathematical approaches for developing approximate functionals.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.06581v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we establish the existence of large deviation principles of random walk in strongly mixing environments. The quenched and annealed rate functions have the same zero set whose shape is either a singleton point or a line segment, with an illustrative example communicated and given by F. Rassoul-Agha. Whenever the level of disorder is controlled, the two rate functions agree on compact sets at the boundary and in the interior both under strongly mixing conditions. Along the line we also indicate that under slightly more refined monotonicity conditions, there is a phase transition of the difference of two rate functions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.06817v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of an open quantum system linearly coupled to a bosonic reservoir. We show that, in the ultrastrong coupling limit, the system undergoes a nonselective measurement and then evolves unitarily according to an effective Zeno Hamiltonian. This dynamical process is largely independent of the reservoir state. We examine the entanglement breaking effect of the ultrastrong coupling on the system. We also derive the evolution equation for systems in contact with several reservoirs when one coupling is ultrastrong. The effective system dynamics displays a rich structure and, contrarily to the single reservoir case, it is generally non-Markovian. Our approach is based on a Dyson series expansion, in which we can take the ultrastrong limit termwise, and a subsequent resummation of the series. Our derivation is mathematically rigorous and uncomplicated.</description>

      <title>Traversable Wormholes with Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09236v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We argue that a spherically symmetric traversable wormhole solution of the Einstein field equations can be supported by minimally coupled self-interacting scalar field which allows a spontaneous symmetry breaking of the field around the wormhole throat. We study two cases : (i) the phantom wormhole solution of Bronnikov and (ii) a generalized Kiselev wormhole. We study the property of radial null geodesics and show that the metric can describe either a two-way or a one-way traversable wormhole depending on certain parameter ranges. The scalar field exhibits spontaneous symmetry breaking within the coordinate range where a wormhole throat forms and helps one suggest that spontaneous symmetry breaking may act as a threshold for wormhole throat formation. We also compute the radius of the photon sphere, the Lyapunov exponent, the shadow radius, and the innermost stable circular orbits for the geometries.</description>

      <title>A new look at unitarity in quantization commutes with reduction for toric manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17157v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For a symplectic toric manifold we consider half-form quantization in mixed polarizations $\mathcal{P}_\infty$, associated to the action of a subtorus $T^p\subset T^n$. The real directions in these polarizations are generated by components of the $T^p$ moment map.
  Polarizations of this type can be obtained by starting at a toric K\"ahler polarization $\mathcal{P}_0$ and then following
  Mabuchi rays of toric K\"ahler polarizations generated by the norm square of the moment map of the torus subgroup. These geodesic rays are lifted to the quantum bundle via a generalized coherent state transform (gCST) and define equivariant isomorphisms between Hilbert spaces for the K\"ahler polarizations and the Hilbert space for the mixed polarization.
  The polarizations $\mathcal{P}_\infty$ give a new way of looking at the problem of unitarity in the quantization commutes with reduction with respect to the $T^p$-action, as follows. The prequantum operators for the components of the moment map of the $T^p$-action act diagonally with discrete spectrum corresponding to the integral points of the moment polytope. The Hilbert space for the quantization with respect to $\mathcal{P}_\infty$ then naturally decomposes as a direct sum of the Hilbert spaces for all its quantizable coisotropic reductions which, in fact, are the K\"ahler reductions of the initial K\"ahler polarization $\mathcal{P}_0$. This will be shown to imply that, for the polarization $\mathcal{P}_\infty$, quantization commutes unitarily with reduction. The problem of unitarity in quantization commutes with reduction for $\mathcal{P}_0$ is then equivalent to the question of whether quantization in the polarization $\mathcal{P}_0$ is unitarily equivalent with quantization in the polarization $\mathcal{P}_\infty$. In fact, this does not hold in general in the toric case.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19640v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We calculate n-point hard string scattering amplitudes (HSSA) with n-2 tachyons and 2 tensor states at arbitrary mass levels. We discover the stringy scaling behavior of these HSSA. It is found that for HSSA with more than 2 transverse directions, the degree of stringy scaling dimM2 decreases comparing to the degree of stringy scaling dimM1 of the n-1 tachyons and 1 tensor HSSA calculated previously. Moreover, we propose a set of K-identities which is the key to demonstrate the stringy scaling behavior of HSSA. We explicitly prove both the diagonal and off-diagonal K-identities for the 4-point HSSA and give numerical proofs of these K-identities for some higher point HSSA.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.12126v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Operator systems are the unital self-adjoint subspaces of the bounded operators on a Hilbert space. Complex operator systems are an important category containing the C$^*$-algebras and von Neumann algebras, which is increasingly of interest in modern analysis and also in modern quantum physics (such as quantum information theory). They have an extensive theory, and have very important applications in all of these subjects. We present here the real case of the theory of (complex) operator systems, and also the real case of their remarkable tensor product theory, due in the complex case to Paulsen and his coauthors and students (such as Kavruk), building on pioneering earlier work of Kirchberg and others. We uncover several notable differences between the real and complex theory, including the absence of minimal and maximal functors in the category of real operator systems. We also develop very many foundational structural results for real operator systems, and elucidate how the complexification interacts with the basic constructions in the subject. In the final two sections of our paper we study real analogues of the Kirchberg conjectures (and of several important related problems that have attracted much interest recently), and study the deep relationships between them.</description>

Abstract: The impact of topological terms that modify the Hilbert-Einstein action is here explored by virtue of a further $f(G)$ contribution. In particular, we investigate the phase-space stability and critical points of an equivalent scalar field representation that makes use of a massive field, whose potential is function of the topological correction. To do so, we introduce to the gravitational Action Integral a Lagrange multiplier and model the modified Friedmann equations by virtue of new non-dimensional variables. We single out dimensionless variables that permit \emph{a priori} the Hubble rate change of sign, enabling regions in which the Hubble parameter either vanishes or becomes negative. In this respect, we thus analyze the various possibilities associated with a universe characterized by such topological contributions and find the attractors, saddle points and regions of stability, in general. The overall analysis is carried out considering the exponential potential first and then shifting to more complicated cases, where the underlying variables do not simplify. We compute the eigenvalues of our coupled differential equations and, accordingly, the stability of the system, in both a spatially-flat and non-flat universe. Quite remarkably, regardless of the spatial curvature, we show that a stable de Sitter-like phase that can model current time appears only a small fraction of the entire phase-space, suggesting that the model under exam is unlikely in describing the whole universe dynamics, i.e., the topological terms appear disfavored in framing the entire evolution of the universe.</description>
