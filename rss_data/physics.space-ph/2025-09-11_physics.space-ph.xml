      <title>Optimal Landau-type closure parameters for two-fluid simulations of plasma turbulence at kinetic scales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08525v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two fluid simulations using local Landau-fluid closures derived from linear theory provide an efficient computational framework for plasma modelling, since they bridge the gap between computationally intensive kinetic simulations and fluid descriptions. Their accuracy in representing kinetic effects depends critically on the validity of the linear approximation used in the derivation: the plasma should not be too far from local thermodynamic equilibrium, LTE. However, many of the problems where these models are of particular interest (such as plasma turbulence and instabilities) are in fact quite far from LTE. The question then arises, if kinetic scale processes are still sufficiently well captured outside of the theoretical regime of applicability of the closure. In this paper, we show that two fluid simulations with Landau fluid closures can effectively reproduce the energy spectra obtained with fully kinetic Vlasov simulations, used as references, as long as the local closure parameter is appropriately chosen. Our findings validate the usage of two fluid simulations with Landau-fluid closure as a possible alternative to fully kinetic simulations of turbulence, in cases where being able to simulate extremely large domains is of particular interest.</description>

      <title>Release and Recapture of Silica Nanoparticles from an Optical Trap in Weightlessness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08666v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optically trapped Silica nanoparticles are a promising tool for precise sensing of gravitational or inertial forces and fundamental physics, including tests of quantum mechanics at 'large' mass scales. This field, called levitated optomechanics can greatly benefit from an application in weightlessness. In this paper we demonstrate the feasibility of such setups in a microgravity environment for the first time. Our experiment is operated in the GraviTower Bremen that provides up to 2.5 s of free fall. System performance and first release-recapture experiments, where the particle is no longer trapped are conducted in microgravity. This demonstration should also be seen in the wider context of preparing space missions on the topic of levitated optomechanics.</description>
