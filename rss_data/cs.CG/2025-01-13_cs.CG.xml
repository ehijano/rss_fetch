      <title>Accelerating Computation of Stable Merge Tree Edit Distances using Parameterized Heuristics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel heuristic algorithm for the stable but NP-complete deformation-based edit distance on merge trees. Our key contribution is the introduction of a user-controlled look-ahead parameter that allows to trade off accuracy and computational cost. We achieve a fixed parameter tractable running time that is polynomial in the size of the input but exponential in the look-ahead value. This extension unlocks the potential of the deformation-based edit distance in handling saddle swaps, while maintaining feasible computation times. Experimental results demonstrate the computational efficiency and effectiveness of this approach in handling specific perturbations.</description>

      <title>Non-planar 3D Printing of Double Shells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06088v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a method to fabricate double shell structures printed in trans-versal directions using multi-axis fused-deposition-modeling (FDM) robot-ic 3D printing. Shell structures, characterized by lightweight, thin walls, fast buildup, and minimal material usage, find diverse applications in pro-totyping and architecture for uses such as fa\c{c}ade panels, molds for concrete casting, or full-scale pavilions. We leverage an underlying representation of transversal strip networks generated using existing methods and propose a methodology for converting them into printable partitions. Each partition is printed separately and assembled into a double-shell structure. We out-line the specifications and workflow that make the printing of each piece and the subsequent assembly process feasible. The versatility and robust-ness of our method are demonstrated with both digital and fabricated re-sults on surfaces of different scales and geometric complexity.</description>

      <title>Relating Interleaving and Fr\'echet Distances via Ordered Merge Trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.11113v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Merge trees are a common topological descriptor for data with a hierarchical component, such as terrains and scalar fields. The interleaving distance, in turn, is a common distance for comparing merge trees. However, the interleaving distance for merge trees is solely based on the hierarchical structure, and disregards any other geometrical or topological properties that might be present in the underlying data. Furthermore, the interleaving distance is NP-hard to compute. In this paper, we introduce a form of ordered merge trees that can capture intrinsic order present in the data. We further define a natural variant of the interleaving distance, the monotone interleaving distance, which is an order-preserving distance for ordered merge trees. Analogously to the regular interleaving distance for merge trees, we show that the monotone variant has three equivalent definitions in terms of two maps, a single map, or a labelling. Furthermore, we establish a connection between the monotone interleaving distance of ordered merge trees and the Fr\'echet distance of 1D curves. As a result, the monotone interleaving distance between two ordered merge trees can be computed exactly in near-quadratic time in their complexity. The connection between the monotone interleaving distance and the Fr\'echet distance builds a new bridge between the fields of topological data analysis, where interleaving distances are a common tool, and computational geometry, where Fr\'echet distances are studied extensively.</description>

      <title>On the rectilinear crossing number of complete balanced multipartite graphs and layered graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13155v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A rectilinear drawing of a graph is a drawing of the graph in the plane in which the edges are drawn as straight-line segments. The rectilinear crossing number of a graph is the minimum number of pairs of edges that cross over all rectilinear drawings of the graph. Let $n \ge r$ be positive integers. The graph $K_n^r$, is the complete $r$-partite graph on $n$ vertices, in which every set of the partition has at least $\lfloor n/r \rfloor$ vertices. The layered graph, $L_n^r$, is an $r$-partite graph on $n$ vertices, in which for every $1\le i \le r-1$, all the vertices in the $i$-th partition are adjacent to all the vertices in the $(i+1)$-th partition. In this paper, we give upper bounds on the rectilinear crossing numbers of $K_n^r$ and~$L_n^r$.</description>
