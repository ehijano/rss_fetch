      <title>Advancing Spatio-temporal Storm Surge Prediction with Hierarchical Deep Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12823v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coastal regions in North America face major threats from storm surges caused by hurricanes and nor'easters. Traditional numerical models, while accurate, are computationally expensive, limiting their practicality for real-time predictions. Recently, deep learning techniques have been developed for efficient simulation of time-dependent storm surge. To resolve the small scales of storm surge in both time and space over a long duration and a large area, these simulations typically need to employ oversized neural networks that struggle with the accumulation of prediction errors over successive time steps. To address these challenges, this study introduces a hierarchical deep neural network (HDNN) combined with a convolutional autoencoder (CAE) to accurately and efficiently predict storm surge time series. The CAE reduces the dimensionality of storm surge data, streamlining the learning process. HDNNs then map storm parameters to the low-dimensional representation of storm surge, allowing for sequential predictions across different time scales. Specifically, the current-level neural network is utilized to predict future states with a relatively large time step, which are passed as inputs to the next-level neural network for smaller time-step predictions. This process continues sequentially for all time steps. The results from different-level neural networks across various time steps are then stacked to acquire the entire time series of storm surge. The simulated low-dimensional representations are finally decoded back into storm surge time series. The proposed model was trained and tested using synthetic data from the North Atlantic Comprehensive Coastal Study. Results demonstrate its excellent performance to effectively handle high-dimensional surge data while mitigating the accumulation of prediction errors over time, making it a promising tool for advancing storm surge prediction.</description>

      <title>Multi-modal graph neural networks for localized off-grid weather forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12938v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Urgent applications like wildfire management and renewable energy generation require precise, localized weather forecasts near the Earth's surface. However, weather forecast products from machine learning or numerical weather models are currently generated on a global regular grid, on which a naive interpolation cannot accurately reflect fine-grained weather patterns close to the ground. In this work, we train a heterogeneous graph neural network (GNN) end-to-end to downscale gridded forecasts to off-grid locations of interest. This multi-modal GNN takes advantage of local historical weather observations (e.g., wind, temperature) to correct the gridded weather forecast at different lead times towards locally accurate forecasts. Each data modality is modeled as a different type of node in the graph. Using message passing, the node at the prediction location aggregates information from its heterogeneous neighbor nodes. Experiments using weather stations across the Northeastern United States show that our model outperforms a range of data-driven and non-data-driven off-grid forecasting methods. Our approach demonstrates how the gap between global large-scale weather models and locally accurate predictions can be bridged to inform localized decision-making.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the hydrodynamic modulation of short surface waves by longer waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12960v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hydrodynamic modulation of short ocean surface waves by longer ambient waves is a well-known ocean surface process that affects remote sensing, the interpretation of in situ wave measurements, and numerical wave forecasting. In this paper, we revisit the linear wave theory and derive higher-order steady solutions for the change of short-wave wavenumber, action density, and gravitational acceleration due to the presence of longer waves. We validate the analytical solutions with numerical simulations of the full wave crest and action conservation equations. The nonlinear analytical solutions of short-wave wavenumber, amplitude, and steepness modulation significantly deviate from the linear analytical solutions of Longuet-Higgins &amp; Stewart (1960), and are similar to the nonlinear numerical solutions by Longuet-Higgins (1987) and Zhang &amp; Melville (1990). The short-wave steepness modulation is attributed to be 5/8 due to the wavenumber, 1/4 due to the wave action, and 1/8 due to the effective gravity. We further examine the result of Peureux et al. (2021) who found through numerical simulations that the short-wave modulation grows unsteadily with each long-wave passage. We show that this unsteady growth only occurs only for homogeneous initial conditions as a special case and does not generally occur, for example in more realistic long-wave groups. The proposed steady solutions are a good approximation of the fully nonlinear numerical solutions in long-wave steepness up to ~0.2. Except for a subset of initial conditions, the solutions to the fully nonlinear crest-action conservation equations are mostly steady in the reference frame of the long waves.</description>

      <title>How thermally-induced secondary motions in offshore hybrid wind-solar farms improve wind-farm efficiency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13005v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Integrating floating photovoltaic (FPV) installations into offshore wind farms has been proposed as a major opportunity to scale up offshore renewable energy generation. The interaction between these hybrid wind-solar farms and the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) is for the first time addressed in the present study. Idealized large-eddy simulations (LES) are used to investigate the flow through both isolated wind and solar farms, as well as combined wind-solar farms, in varying configurations and under different atmospheric conditions. When the FPV modules are arranged in long strips parallel to the flow direction, secondary motions arise due to the temperature difference between the warm FPV modules and colder sea surface, significantly affecting the horizontal distribution of mean wind speed in the ABL. Associated downdrafts between the strips increase entrainment of high-speed momentum from above, thereby increasing the wind speed at these locations. LES of hybrid wind-solar farms reveals that this is beneficial for wind turbines when they are located between the FPV arrays, leading, for the cases that we considered, to a farm-averaged power increase of up to 30% compared to an isolated wind farm. It is shown that the ratio between inertial and buoyancy forces, quantified by a heterogeneity Richardson number $Ri_h$, plays a crucial role in the formation of secondary flows and the resulting wind-farm power enhancement. We further show that no significant power gains, but also no losses emerge in situations when the solar panels are aligned perpendicular to the flow. Although the present results suggest a large potential for wind-solar hybridization, future research should focus on a wider range of scenarios, obtained from a realistic distribution of wind directions and speeds to quantify the potential beneficial impact on real annual power production.</description>

      <title>TCP-Diffusion: A Multi-modal Diffusion Model for Global Tropical Cyclone Precipitation Forecasting with Change Awareness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13175v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Precipitation from tropical cyclones (TCs) can cause disasters such as flooding, mudslides, and landslides. Predicting such precipitation in advance is crucial, giving people time to prepare and defend against these precipitation-induced disasters. Developing deep learning (DL) rainfall prediction methods offers a new way to predict potential disasters. However, one problem is that most existing methods suffer from cumulative errors and lack physical consistency. Second, these methods overlook the importance of meteorological factors in TC rainfall and their integration with the numerical weather prediction (NWP) model. Therefore, we propose Tropical Cyclone Precipitation Diffusion (TCP-Diffusion), a multi-modal model for global tropical cyclone precipitation forecasting. It forecasts TC rainfall around the TC center for the next 12 hours at 3 hourly resolution based on past rainfall observations and multi-modal environmental variables. Adjacent residual prediction (ARP) changes the training target from the absolute rainfall value to the rainfall trend and gives our model the ability of rainfall change awareness, reducing cumulative errors and ensuring physical consistency. Considering the influence of TC-related meteorological factors and the useful information from NWP model forecasts, we propose a multi-model framework with specialized encoders to extract richer information from environmental variables and results provided by NWP models. The results of extensive experiments show that our method outperforms other DL methods and the NWP method from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF).</description>

      <title>The cloud cover and meteorological parameters at the Lenghu site on the Tibetan Plateau</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13306v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The cloud cover and meteorological parameters serve as fundamental criteria for the qualification of an astronomical observatory working in optical and infrared wavelengths. In this paper, we present a systematic assessment of key meteorological parameters at the Lenghu site. The datasets adopted in this study includes the meteorological parameters collected at the local weather stations at the site and in the Lenghu Town, the sky brightness at the local zenith acquired by the Sky Quality Meters and night sky all-sky images from a digital camera, the ERA5 reanalysis database and global climate monitoring data. From 2019 to 2023, the fractional observable time of photometric condition is 69.70%, 74.97%, 70.26%, 74.27% and 65.12%, respectively. The fractional observing time is inversely correlated with surface air temperature, relative humidity, precipitable water vapor, and dew temperature, demonstrating that the observing conditions are influenced by these meteorological parameters. Large-scale air-sea interactions affect the climate at Lenghu site, which in fact delivers a clue to understand the irregularity of 2023. Specifically, precipitable water vapor at Lenghu site is correlated to both the westerly wind index and the summer North Atlantic Oscillation index, the yearly average temperature of Lenghu site is observed to increase significantly during the occurrence of a strong El Ni\~no event and the relative humidity anomaly at Lenghu site is correlated to the Pacific Decadal Oscillation index. The decrease of fractional observing time in 2023 was due to the ongoing strong El Ni\~no event and relevant global climate change. We underscore the substantial role of global climate change in regulating astronomical observing conditions and the necessity for long-term continuous monitoring of the astronomical meteorological parameters at Lenghu site.</description>

      <title>Machine-learning prediction of tipping with applications to the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14877v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Anticipating a tipping point, a transition from one stable steady state to another, is a problem of broad relevance due to the ubiquity of the phenomenon in diverse fields. The steady-state nature of the dynamics about a tipping point makes its prediction significantly more challenging than predicting other types of critical transitions from oscillatory or chaotic dynamics. Exploiting the benefits of noise, we develop a general data-driven and machine-learning approach to predicting potential future tipping in nonautonomous dynamical systems and validate the framework using examples from different fields. As an application, we address the problem of predicting the potential collapse of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC), possibly driven by climate-induced changes in the freshwater input to the North Atlantic. Our predictions based on synthetic and currently available empirical data place a potential collapse window spanning from 2040 to 2065, in consistency with the results in the current literature.</description>

      <title>Estimating Atmospheric Variables from Digital Typhoon Satellite Images via Conditional Denoising Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07961v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study explores the application of diffusion models in the field of typhoons, predicting multiple ERA5 meteorological variables simultaneously from Digital Typhoon satellite images. The focus of this study is taken to be Taiwan, an area very vulnerable to typhoons. By comparing the performance of Conditional Denoising Diffusion Probability Model (CDDPM) with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Squeeze-and-Excitation Networks (SENet), results suggest that the CDDPM performs best in generating accurate and realistic meteorological data. Specifically, CDDPM achieved a PSNR of 32.807, which is approximately 7.9% higher than CNN and 5.5% higher than SENet. Furthermore, CDDPM recorded an RMSE of 0.032, showing a 11.1% improvement over CNN and 8.6% improvement over SENet. A key application of this research can be for imputation purposes in missing meteorological datasets and generate additional high-quality meteorological data using satellite images. It is hoped that the results of this analysis will enable more robust and detailed forecasting, reducing the impact of severe weather events on vulnerable regions.
