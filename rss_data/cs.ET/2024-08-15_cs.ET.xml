      <title>A MAC Protocol with Time Reversal for Wireless Networks within Computing Packages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07421v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wireless Network-on-Chip (WNoC) is a promising concept which provides a solution to overcome the scalability issues in prevailing networks-in-package for many-core processors. However, the electromagnetic propagation inside the chip package leads to energy reverberation, resulting in Inter-Symbol Interference (ISI) with high delay spreads. Time Reversal (TR) is a technique that benefits the unique time-invariant channel with rich multipath effects to focus the energy to the desired transceiver. TR mitigates both ISI and co-channel interference, hence providing parallel communications in both space and time. Thus, TR is a versatile candidate to improve the aggregate bandwidth of wireless on-chip networks provided that a Medium Access Control (MAC) is used to efficiently share the wireless medium. In this paper, we explore a simple yet resilient TR-based MAC protocol (TR-MAC) design for WNoC. We propose to manage multiple parallel transmissions with simultaneous spatial channels in the same time slot with TR precoding and focused energy detection at the transceiver. Our results show that TR-MAC can be employed in massive computing architectures with improved latency and throughput while matching with the stringent requirements of the physical layer.</description>

      <title>Embodied Biocomputing Sequential Circuits with Data Processing and Storage for Neurons-on-a-chip</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07628v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With conventional silicon-based computing approaching its physical and efficiency limits, biocomputing emerges as a promising alternative. This approach utilises biomaterials such as DNA and neurons as an interesting alternative to data processing and storage. This study explores the potential of neuronal biocomputing to rival silicon-based systems. We explore neuronal logic gates and sequential circuits that mimic conventional computer architectures. Through mathematical modelling, optimisation, and computer simulation, we demonstrate the operational capabilities of neuronal sequential circuits. These circuits include a neuronal NAND gate, SR Latch flip-flop, and D flip-flop memory units. Our approach involves manipulating neuron communication, synaptic conductance, spike buffers, neuron types, and specific neuronal network topology designs. The experiments demonstrate the practicality of encoding binary information using patterns of neuronal activity and overcoming synchronization difficulties with neuronal buffers and inhibition strategies. Our results confirm the effectiveness and scalability of neuronal logic circuits, showing that they maintain a stable metabolic burden even in complex data storage configurations. Our study not only demonstrates the concept of embodied biocomputing by manipulating neuronal properties for digital signal processing but also establishes the foundation for cutting-edge biocomputing technologies. Our designs open up possibilities for using neurons as energy-efficient computing solutions. These solutions have the potential to become an alternate to silicon-based systems by providing a carbon-neutral, biologically feasible alternative.</description>

      <title>Comparative Evaluation of Memory Technologies for Synaptic Crossbar Arrays -- Part I: Robustness-driven Device-Circuit Co-Design and System Implications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.04261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.04261v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In-memory computing (IMC) utilizing synaptic crossbar arrays is promising for energy-efficient deep neural network (DNN) accelerators. Various technologies (CMOS and post-CMOS) have been explored as synaptic device candidates, each with its own pros and cons. In this work, we perform a design space exploration and comparative evaluation of four technologies viz. 8T SRAMs, ferroelectric transistors (FeFETs), resistive RAMs (ReRAMs) and spin-orbit torque magnetic RAMs (SOT-MRAMs) in the context of IMC robustness and DNN accuracy. For a fair comparison, we carefully optimize each technology specifically for synaptic crossbar design accounting for device and circuit non-idealities. By integrating different technologies into a cross-layer simulation flow based on physical models of synaptic devices and interconnects, we present insights into various device-circuit interactions. Based on the optimized designs, we obtain inference results for ResNet-20 on CIFAR-10 dataset. Among the four technologies, we show that FeFETs-based DNNs achieve the highest accuracy (followed closely by ReRAMs) and the largest resilience to process variations due to the compactness and high ON/OFF current ratio of FeFET bit-cells. In Part II of this paper, we expand the technology evaluation considering various device-circuit design knobs used for crossbar arrays.</description>

      <title>Demonstration of 3 V Programmable Josephson Junction Arrays Using Non-Integer-Multiple Logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.16072v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article demonstrates a new kind of programmable logic for the representation of an integer that can be used for the programmable Josephson voltage standard. It can enable the numbers of junctions in most bits to be variable integer values, which is different from normal binary logic or ternary logic. Consequently, missing junctions due to superconducting short circuits can be tolerated under this logic. This logic can also have nearly the same segmentation efficiency as ternary logic. The completeness of the sequences using this logic is proven by the recursive method in mathematics in this paper. After that, a new algorithm for the representation of integers is presented according to the proven process, and an analysis of the number of fault-tolerant junctions for each bit is provided. Although the first and second bits are not tolerant to missing junctions, bits beyond these can tolerate one to hundreds of missing junctions. Due to the non-fixed multiples between the bits of the sequence, this logic is called non-integer-multiple logic. Finally, the design and fabrication of a 3 V programmable Josephson junction array using this logic are described, and the measurements and analysis of the characteristic parameters are presented.</description>

      <title>Large Model Strategic Thinking, Small Model Efficiency: Transferring Theory of Mind in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05241v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As the performance of larger, newer Large Language Models continues to improve for strategic Theory of Mind (ToM) tasks, the demand for these state of the art models increases commensurately. However, their deployment is costly both in terms of processing power and time. In this paper, we investigate the feasibility of creating smaller, simulation-ready agents by way of fine-tuning. To do this, we present a large pre-trained model with 20 unique scenarios that combine a social context with a social dilemma, recording its answers, and using them for Q\&amp;A fine-tuning on a smaller model of the same family. Our focus is on in-context game-theoretic decision-making, the same domain within which human interaction occurs and that requires both a theory of mind (or a semblance thereof) and an understanding of social dynamics. We find that the fine-tuned smaller language model exhibited significant performance closer to that of its larger relative, and that their improvements extended in areas and contexts beyond the ones provided in the training examples. On average for all games, through fine-tuning, the smaller model showed a \%46 improvement in aligning with the behavior of the larger model, with \%100 representing complete alignment. This suggests that our pipeline represents an efficient method to transmit some form of theory of mind to smaller models, creating improved and cheaply deployable algorithms in the process. Despite their simplicity and their associated shortcomings and limitations, our findings represent a stepping stone in the pursuit and training of specialized models for strategic and social decision making.</description>

      <title>Decentralized Health Intelligence Network (DHIN)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06240v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Decentralized Health Intelligence Network (DHIN) is a theoretical framework addressing significant challenges of health data sovereignty and AI utilization in healthcare caused by data fragmentation across providers and institutions. It establishes a sovereign architecture for healthcare provision as a prerequisite to a sovereign health network, then facilitates effective AI utilization by overcoming barriers to accessing diverse medical data sources. This comprehensive framework leverages: 1) self-sovereign identity architecture coupled with a personal health record (PHR) as a prerequisite for health data sovereignty; 2) a scalable federated learning (FL) protocol implemented on a public blockchain for decentralized AI training in healthcare, where health data remains with participants and only model parameter updates are shared; and 3) a scalable, trustless rewards mechanism to incentivize participation and ensure fair reward distribution. This framework ensures that no entity can prevent or control access to training on health data offered by participants or determine financial benefits, as these processes operate on a public blockchain with an immutable record and without a third party. It supports effective AI training in healthcare, allowing patients to maintain control over their health data, benefit financially, and contribute to a decentralized, scalable ecosystem that leverages collective AI to develop beneficial healthcare algorithms. Patients receive rewards into their digital wallets as an incentive to opt-in to the FL protocol, with a long-term roadmap to funding decentralized insurance solutions. This approach introduces a novel, self-financed healthcare model that adapts to individual needs, complements existing systems, and redefines universal coverage. It highlights the potential to transform healthcare data management and AI utilization while empowering patients.</description>

      <title>Control-Flow Attestation: Concepts, Solutions, and Open Challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06304v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Control-flow attestation unifies the worlds of control-flow integrity and platform attestation by measuring and reporting a target's run-time behaviour to a verifier. Trust assurances in the target are provided by testing whether its execution follows an authorised control-flow path. The problem has been explored in various settings, such as assessing the trustworthiness of cyber-physical systems, Internet of Things devices, cloud platforms, and many others. Despite a significant number of proposals being made in recent years, the area remains fragmented, addressing different adversarial behaviours, verification paradigms, and deployment challenges. In this paper, we present the first survey of control-flow attestation, examining the core ideas and solutions in state-of-the-art schemes. In total, we survey over 30 papers published between 2016-2024, consolidate and compare their key features, and pose several challenges and recommendations for future research in the area.</description>
