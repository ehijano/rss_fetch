      <title>Integrating Regional Ice Charts and Copernicus Sea Ice Products for Navigation Risk in Alaskan Waters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11083v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As climate change continues to reshape marginal ice zones in the Arctic, accurate and reliable sea ice data are critical for ensuring maritime safety. This study compares regional ice charts from the Alaska Sea Ice Program with satellite derived Copernicus sea ice concentration data to evaluate spatial and temporal discrepancies in ice representation across Alaskan waters from January 2010 to March 2025. Daily Arctic Sea Ice Program polygons were aligned with Copernicus grid points in a common UTM framework, and residuals were computed to quantify systematic differences. Results show that Copernicus consistently underestimates ice concentration relative to Arctic Sea Ice Program, particularly in nearshore and marginal ice zones affected by land-spillover and mixed-pixel effects such as those observed in Cook Inlet. Empirical Orthogonal Function analysis shows that both datasets capture the same dominant physical modes of sea ice variability, with the first mode representing the annual freeze thaw cycle and the second reflecting marginal ice-zone dynamics. To assess operational implications, vessel Automatic Identification System data were combined with Alaska Sea Ice Program ice charts using the IACS POLARIS Risk Index Outcome framework. Approximately 36 percent of AIS observations within ice affected waters corresponded to negative Risk Index Outcome values, indicating that vessels frequently operated under elevated-risk conditions. These findings demonstrate that regional charts and Copernicus provide complementary capabilities that together enable more accurate and operationally meaningful Arctic navigation and risk assessments.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Super-Resolution for Urban Micrometeorology via a Schr\"odinger Bridge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12148v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study employs a neural network that represents the solution to a Schr\"odinger bridge problem to perform super-resolution of 2-m temperature in an urban area. Schr\"odinger bridges generally describe transformations between two data distributions based on diffusion processes. We use a specific Schr\"odinger-bridge model (SM) that directly transforms low-resolution data into high-resolution data, unlike denoising diffusion probabilistic models (simply, diffusion models; DMs) that generate high-resolution data from Gaussian noise. Low-resolution and high-resolution data were obtained from separate numerical simulations with a physics-based model under common initial and boundary conditions. Compared with a DM, the SM attains comparable accuracy at one-fifth the computational cost, requiring 50 neural-network evaluations per datum for the DM and only 10 for the SM. Furthermore, high-resolution samples generated by the SM exhibit larger variance, implying superior uncertainty quantification relative to the DM. Owing to the reduced computational cost of the SM, our results suggest the feasibility of real-time ensemble micrometeorological prediction using SM-based super-resolution.</description>

      <title>Wave energy converters as offshore wind farm guardians: a pathway to resilient ocean systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13898v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Maximizing the durability and reliability of offshore wind farms is essential for the clean energy transition. In this work, we demonstrate how wave energy converter (WEC) farms can shelter offshore wind farms from cyclic wave loading, resulting in significant reductions in turbine fatigue damage. Using experimentally validated hydrodynamic models, we show that WEC arrays can reduce wave-induced fatigue damage on the turbines by up to 25%, potentially lowering required monopile diameters and extending turbine lifetimes. This damage reduction propagates to the levelized cost of energy (LCOE) of the wind farm, targeting cost reductions in nearly 50% of the total system costs. Additionally, WEC farms can benefit from this co-location by sharing siting costs, operation and maintenance teams, and mooring and transmission cables with the offshore wind farm. This work supports resilient, cost-effective offshore renewables for global deployment.</description>
