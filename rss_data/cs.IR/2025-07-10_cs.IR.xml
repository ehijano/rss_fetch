      <title>A Language-Driven Framework for Improving Personalized Recommendations: Merging LLMs with Traditional Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07251v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional recommendation algorithms are not designed to provide personalized recommendations based on user preferences provided through text, e.g., "I enjoy light-hearted comedies with a lot of humor". Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as one of the most promising tools for natural language processing in recent years. This research proposes a novel framework that mimics how a close friend would recommend items based on their knowledge of an individual's tastes. We leverage LLMs to enhance movie recommendation systems by refining traditional algorithm outputs and integrating them with language-based user preference inputs. We employ Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) or SVD++ algorithms to generate initial movie recommendations, implemented using the Surprise Python library and trained on the MovieLens-Latest-Small dataset. We compare the performance of the base algorithms with our LLM-enhanced versions using leave-one-out validation hit rates and cumulative hit rates. Additionally, to compare the performance of our framework against the current state-of-the-art recommendation systems, we use rating and ranking metrics with an item-based stratified 0.75 train, 0.25 test split. Our framework can generate preference profiles automatically based on users' favorite movies or allow manual preference specification for more personalized results. Using an automated approach, our framework overwhelmingly surpassed SVD and SVD++ on every evaluation metric used (e.g., improvements of up to ~6x in cumulative hit rate, ~3.7x in NDCG, etc.), albeit at the cost of a slight increase in computational overhead.</description>

      <title>When Graph Contrastive Learning Backfires: Spectral Vulnerability and Defense in Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL) has demonstrated substantial promise in enhancing the robustness and generalization of recommender systems, particularly by enabling models to leverage large-scale unlabeled data for improved representation learning. However, in this paper, we reveal an unexpected vulnerability: the integration of GCL inadvertently increases the susceptibility of a recommender to targeted promotion attacks. Through both theoretical investigation and empirical validation, we identify the root cause as the spectral smoothing effect induced by contrastive optimization, which disperses item embeddings across the representation space and unintentionally enhances the exposure of target items. Building on this insight, we introduce CLeaR, a bi-level optimization attack method that deliberately amplifies spectral smoothness, enabling a systematic investigation of the susceptibility of GCL-based recommendation models to targeted promotion attacks. Our findings highlight the urgent need for robust countermeasures; in response, we further propose SIM, a spectral irregularity mitigation framework designed to accurately detect and suppress targeted items without compromising model performance. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that, compared to existing targeted promotion attacks, GCL-based recommendation models exhibit greater susceptibility when evaluated with CLeaR, while SIM effectively mitigates these vulnerabilities.</description>

      <title>NLGCL: Naturally Existing Neighbor Layers Graph Contrastive Learning for Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07522v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are widely used in collaborative filtering to capture high-order user-item relationships. To address the data sparsity problem in recommendation systems, Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL) has emerged as a promising paradigm that maximizes mutual information between contrastive views. However, existing GCL methods rely on augmentation techniques that introduce semantically irrelevant noise and incur significant computational and storage costs, limiting effectiveness and efficiency.
  To overcome these challenges, we propose NLGCL, a novel contrastive learning framework that leverages naturally contrastive views between neighbor layers within GNNs. By treating each node and its neighbors in the next layer as positive pairs, and other nodes as negatives, NLGCL avoids augmentation-based noise while preserving semantic relevance. This paradigm eliminates costly view construction and storage, making it computationally efficient and practical for real-world scenarios. Extensive experiments on four public datasets demonstrate that NLGCL outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in effectiveness and efficiency.</description>

      <title>Document Similarity Enhanced IPS Estimation for Unbiased Learning to Rank</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Learning to Rank (LTR) models learn from historical user interactions, such as user clicks. However, there is an inherent bias in the clicks of users due to position bias, i.e., users are more likely to click highly-ranked documents than low-ranked documents. To address this bias when training LTR models, many approaches from the literature re-weight the users' click data using Inverse Propensity Scoring (IPS). IPS re-weights the user's clicks proportionately to the position in the historical ranking that a document was placed when it was clicked since low-ranked documents are less likely to be seen by a user. In this paper, we argue that low-ranked documents that are similar to highly-ranked relevant documents are also likely to be relevant. Moreover, accounting for the similarity of low-ranked documents to highly ranked relevant documents when calculating IPS can more effectively mitigate the effects of position bias. Therefore, we propose an extension to IPS, called IPSsim, that takes into consideration the similarity of documents when estimating IPS. We evaluate our IPSsim estimator using two large publicly available LTR datasets under a number of simulated user click settings, and with different numbers of training clicks. Our experiments show that our IPSsim estimator is more effective than the existing IPS estimators for learning an unbiased LTR model, particularly in top-n settings when n &gt;= 30. For example, when n = 50, our IPSsim estimator achieves a statistically significant ~3% improvement (p &lt; 0.05) in terms of NDCG compared to the Doubly Robust estimator from the literature.</description>

      <title>Measuring Hypothesis Testing Errors in the Evaluation of Retrieval Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07924v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The evaluation of Information Retrieval (IR) systems typically uses query-document pairs with corresponding human-labelled relevance assessments (qrels). These qrels are used to determine if one system is better than another based on average retrieval performance. Acquiring large volumes of human relevance assessments is expensive. Therefore, more efficient relevance assessment approaches have been proposed, necessitating comparisons between qrels to ascertain their efficacy. Discriminative power, i.e. the ability to correctly identify significant differences between systems, is important for drawing accurate conclusions on the robustness of qrels. Previous work has measured the proportion of pairs of systems that are identified as significantly different and has quantified Type I statistical errors. Type I errors lead to incorrect conclusions due to false positive significance tests. We argue that also identifying Type II errors (false negatives) is important as they lead science in the wrong direction. We quantify Type II errors and propose that balanced classification metrics, such as balanced accuracy, can be used to portray the discriminative power of qrels. We perform experiments using qrels generated using alternative relevance assessment methods to investigate measuring hypothesis testing errors in IR evaluation. We find that additional insights into the discriminative power of qrels can be gained by quantifying Type II errors, and that balanced classification metrics can be used to give an overall summary of discriminative power in one, easily comparable, number.</description>

      <title>The Cross-Lingual Cost: Retrieval Biases in RAG over Arabic-English Corpora</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07543v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cross-lingual retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a critical capability for retrieving and generating answers across languages. Prior work in this context has mostly focused on generation and relied on benchmarks derived from open-domain sources, most notably Wikipedia. In such settings, retrieval challenges often remain hidden due to language imbalances, overlap with pretraining data, and memorized content. To address this gap, we study Arabic-English RAG in a domain-specific setting using benchmarks derived from real-world corporate datasets. Our benchmarks include all combinations of languages for the user query and the supporting document, drawn independently and uniformly at random. This enables a systematic study of multilingual retrieval behavior.
  Our findings reveal that retrieval is a critical bottleneck in cross-lingual domain-specific scenarios, with significant performance drops occurring when the user query and supporting document languages differ. A key insight is that these failures stem primarily from the retriever's difficulty in ranking documents across languages. Finally, we propose a simple retrieval strategy that addresses this source of failure by enforcing equal retrieval from both languages, resulting in substantial improvements in cross-lingual and overall performance. These results highlight meaningful opportunities for improving multilingual retrieval, particularly in practical, real-world RAG applications.</description>

      <title>Rethinking the Privacy of Text Embeddings: A Reproducibility Study of "Text Embeddings Reveal (Almost) As Much As Text"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07700v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Text embeddings are fundamental to many natural language processing (NLP) tasks, extensively applied in domains such as recommendation systems and information retrieval (IR). Traditionally, transmitting embeddings instead of raw text has been seen as privacy-preserving. However, recent methods such as Vec2Text challenge this assumption by demonstrating that controlled decoding can successfully reconstruct original texts from black-box embeddings. The unexpectedly strong results reported by Vec2Text motivated us to conduct further verification, particularly considering the typically non-intuitive and opaque structure of high-dimensional embedding spaces. In this work, we reproduce the Vec2Text framework and evaluate it from two perspectives: (1) validating the original claims, and (2) extending the study through targeted experiments. First, we successfully replicate the original key results in both in-domain and out-of-domain settings, with only minor discrepancies arising due to missing artifacts, such as model checkpoints and dataset splits. Furthermore, we extend the study by conducting a parameter sensitivity analysis, evaluating the feasibility of reconstructing sensitive inputs (e.g., passwords), and exploring embedding quantization as a lightweight privacy defense. Our results show that Vec2Text is effective under ideal conditions, capable of reconstructing even password-like sequences that lack clear semantics. However, we identify key limitations, including its sensitivity to input sequence length. We also find that Gaussian noise and quantization techniques can mitigate the privacy risks posed by Vec2Text, with quantization offering a simpler and more widely applicable solution. Our findings emphasize the need for caution in using text embeddings and highlight the importance of further research into robust defense mechanisms for NLP systems.</description>

      <title>DTECT: Dynamic Topic Explorer &amp; Context Tracker</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07910v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The explosive growth of textual data over time presents a significant challenge in uncovering evolving themes and trends. Existing dynamic topic modeling techniques, while powerful, often exist in fragmented pipelines that lack robust support for interpretation and user-friendly exploration. We introduce DTECT (Dynamic Topic Explorer &amp; Context Tracker), an end-to-end system that bridges the gap between raw textual data and meaningful temporal insights. DTECT provides a unified workflow that supports data preprocessing, multiple model architectures, and dedicated evaluation metrics to analyze the topic quality of temporal topic models. It significantly enhances interpretability by introducing LLM-driven automatic topic labeling, trend analysis via temporally salient words, interactive visualizations with document-level summarization, and a natural language chat interface for intuitive data querying. By integrating these features into a single, cohesive platform, DTECT empowers users to more effectively track and understand thematic dynamics. DTECT is open-source and available at https://github.com/AdhyaSuman/DTECT.</description>

Abstract: Explanations play a variety of roles in various recommender systems, from a legally mandated afterthought, through an integral element of user experience, to a key to persuasiveness. A natural and useful form of an explanation is the Counterfactual Explanation (CE). We present a method for generating highly plausible CEs in recommender systems and evaluate it both numerically and with a user study.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Graph Integration for Cross-Domain Recommendation via Heterogeneous Graph Coordinators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11719v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the digital era, users typically interact with diverse items across multiple domains (e.g., e-commerce, streaming platforms, and social networks), generating intricate heterogeneous interaction graphs. Leveraging multi-domain data can improve recommendation systems by enriching user insights and mitigating data sparsity in individual domains. However, integrating such multi-domain knowledge for cross-domain recommendation remains challenging due to inherent disparities in user behavior and item characteristics and the risk of negative transfer, where irrelevant or conflicting information from the source domains adversely impacts the target domain's performance. To tackle these challenges, we propose HAGO, a novel framework with \textbf{H}eterogeneous \textbf{A}daptive \textbf{G}raph co\textbf{O}rdinators, which dynamically integrates multi-domain graphs into a cohesive structure. HAGO adaptively adjusts the connections between coordinators and multi-domain graph nodes to enhance beneficial inter-domain interactions while alleviating negative transfer. Furthermore, we introduce a universal multi-domain graph pre-training strategy alongside HAGO to collaboratively learn high-quality node representations across domains. Being compatible with various graph-based models and pre-training techniques, HAGO demonstrates broad applicability and effectiveness. Extensive experiments show that our framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods in cross-domain recommendation scenarios, underscoring its potential for real-world applications.

      <title>Diffusion Augmented Retrieval: A Training-Free Approach to Interactive Text-to-Image Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15379v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Interactive Text-to-image retrieval (I-TIR) is an important enabler for a wide range of state-of-the-art services in domains such as e-commerce and education. However, current methods rely on finetuned Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), which are costly to train and update, and exhibit poor generalizability. This latter issue is of particular concern, as: 1) finetuning narrows the pretrained distribution of MLLMs, thereby reducing generalizability; and 2) I-TIR introduces increasing query diversity and complexity. As a result, I-TIR solutions are highly likely to encounter queries and images not well represented in any training dataset. To address this, we propose leveraging Diffusion Models (DMs) for text-to-image mapping, to avoid finetuning MLLMs while preserving robust performance on complex queries. Specifically, we introduce Diffusion Augmented Retrieval (DAR), a framework that generates multiple intermediate representations via LLM-based dialogue refinements and DMs, producing a richer depiction of the user's information needs. This augmented representation facilitates more accurate identification of semantically and visually related images. Extensive experiments on four benchmarks show that for simple queries, DAR achieves results on par with finetuned I-TIR models, yet without incurring their tuning overhead. Moreover, as queries become more complex through additional conversational turns, DAR surpasses finetuned I-TIR models by up to 7.61% in Hits@10 after ten turns, illustrating its improved generalization for more intricate queries.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.19108v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Instant messaging with texts and stickers has become a widely adopted communication medium, enabling efficient expression of user semantics and emotions. With the increased use of stickers conveying information and feelings, sticker retrieval and recommendation has emerged as an important area of research. However, a major limitation in existing literature has been the lack of datasets capturing temporal and user-specific sticker interactions, which has hindered further progress in user modeling and sticker personalization. To address this, we introduce User-Sticker, a dataset that includes temporal and user anonymous ID across conversations. It is the largest publicly available sticker dataset to date, containing 22K unique users, 370K stickers, and 8.3M messages. The raw data was collected from a popular messaging platform from 67 conversations over 720 hours of crawling. All text and image data were carefully vetted for safety and privacy checks and modifications. Spanning 10 domains, the U-Sticker dataset captures rich temporal, multilingual, and cross-domain behaviors not previously available in other datasets. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate U-Sticker's practical applications in user behavior modeling and personalized recommendation and highlight its potential to further research areas in personalized retrieval and conversational studies. U-Sticker dataset is publicly available.</description>

      <title>Rankers, Judges, and Assistants: Towards Understanding the Interplay of LLMs in Information Retrieval Evaluation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.19092v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly integral to information retrieval (IR), powering ranking, evaluation, and AI-assisted content creation. This widespread adoption necessitates a critical examination of potential biases arising from the interplay between these LLM-based components. This paper synthesizes existing research and presents novel experiment designs that explore how LLM-based rankers and assistants influence LLM-based judges. We provide the first empirical evidence of LLM judges exhibiting significant bias towards LLM-based rankers. Furthermore, we observe limitations in LLM judges' ability to discern subtle system performance differences. Contrary to some previous findings, our preliminary study does not find evidence of bias against AI-generated content. These results highlight the need for a more holistic view of the LLM-driven information ecosystem. To this end, we offer initial guidelines and a research agenda to ensure the reliable use of LLMs in IR evaluation.</description>

Abstract: Recommender systems powered by generative models (Gen-RecSys) extend beyond classical item ranking by producing open-ended content, which simultaneously unlocks richer user experiences and introduces new risks. On one hand, these systems can enhance personalization and appeal through dynamic explanations and multi-turn dialogues. On the other hand, they might venture into unknown territory-hallucinating nonexistent items, amplifying bias, or leaking private information. Traditional accuracy metrics cannot fully capture these challenges, as they fail to measure factual correctness, content safety, or alignment with user intent.
  This paper makes two main contributions. First, we categorize the evaluation challenges of Gen-RecSys into two groups: (i) existing concerns that are exacerbated by generative outputs (e.g., bias, privacy) and (ii) entirely new risks (e.g., item hallucinations, contradictory explanations). Second, we propose a holistic evaluation approach that includes scenario-based assessments and multi-metric checks-incorporating relevance, factual grounding, bias detection, and policy compliance. Our goal is to provide a guiding framework so researchers and practitioners can thoroughly assess Gen-RecSys, ensuring effective personalization and responsible deployment.</description>

      <title>The Future is Agentic: Definitions, Perspectives, and Open Challenges of Multi-Agent Recommender Systems</title>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are rapidly evolving from passive engines of text generation into agentic entities that can plan, remember, invoke external tools, and co-operate with one another. This perspective paper investigates how such LLM agents (and societies thereof) can transform the design space of recommender systems.
  We introduce a unified formalism that (i) models an individual agent as a tuple comprising its language core, tool set, and hierarchical memory, and (ii) captures a multi-agent recommender as a triple of agents, shared environment, and communication protocol. Within this framework, we present four end-to-end use cases-interactive party planning, synthetic user-simulation for offline evaluation, multi-modal furniture recommendation, and brand-aligned explanation generation-each illustrating a distinct capability unlocked by agentic orchestration.
  We then surface five cross-cutting challenge families: protocol complexity, scalability, hallucination and error propagation, emergent misalignment (including covert collusion), and brand compliance.
  For each, we formalize the problem, review nascent mitigation strategies, and outline open research questions. The result is both a blueprint and an agenda: a blueprint that shows how memory-augmented, tool-using LLM agents can be composed into robust recommendation pipelines, and an agenda inviting the RecSys community to develop benchmarks, theoretical guarantees, and governance tools that keep pace with this new degree of autonomy. By unifying agentic abstractions with recommender objectives, the paper lays the groundwork for the next generation of personalized, trustworthy, and context-rich recommendation services.</description>

      <title>USD: A User-Intent-Driven Sampling and Dual-Debiasing Framework for Large-Scale Homepage Recommendations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06503v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large-scale homepage recommendations face critical challenges from pseudo-negative samples caused by exposure bias, where non-clicks may indicate inattention rather than disinterest. Existing work lacks thorough analysis of invalid exposures and typically addresses isolated aspects (e.g., sampling strategies), overlooking the critical impact of pseudo-positive samples - such as homepage clicks merely to visit marketing portals. We propose a unified framework for large-scale homepage recommendation sampling and debiasing. Our framework consists of two key components: (1) a user intent-aware negative sampling module to filter invalid exposure samples, and (2) an intent-driven dual-debiasing module that jointly corrects exposure bias and click bias. Extensive online experiments on Taobao demonstrate the efficacy of our framework, achieving significant improvements in user click-through rates (UCTR) by 35.4% and 14.5% in two variants of the marketing block on the Taobao homepage, Baiyibutie and Taobaomiaosha.</description>

      <title>Multi-Head RAG: Solving Multi-Aspect Problems with LLMs</title>

Abstract: Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances the abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) by enabling the retrieval of documents into the LLM context to provide more accurate and relevant responses. Existing RAG solutions do not focus on queries that may require fetching multiple documents with substantially different contents. Such queries occur frequently, but are challenging because the embeddings of these documents may be distant in the embedding space, making it hard to retrieve them all. This paper introduces Multi-Head RAG (MRAG), a novel scheme designed to address this gap with a simple yet powerful idea: leveraging activations of Transformer's multi-head attention layer, instead of the decoder layer, as keys for fetching multi-aspect documents. The driving observation is that different attention heads learn to capture different data aspects. Harnessing the corresponding activations results in embeddings that represent various facets of data items and queries, improving the retrieval accuracy for complex queries. We provide an evaluation methodology and metrics, multi-aspect datasets, and real-world use cases to demonstrate MRAG's effectiveness. We show MRAG's design advantages over 18 RAG baselines, empirical improvements of up to 20% in retrieval success ratios, and benefits for downstream LLM generation. MRAG can be seamlessly integrated with existing RAG frameworks and benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Contextual Bandits in Payment Processing: Non-uniform Exploration and Supervised Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00569v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Uniform random exploration in decision-making systems supports off-policy learning via supervision but incurs high regret, making it impractical for many applications. Conversely, non-uniform exploration offers better immediate performance but lacks support for off-policy learning. Recent research suggests that regression oracles can bridge this gap by combining non-uniform exploration with supervised learning. In this paper, we analyze these approaches within a real-world industrial context at Adyen, a large global payments processor characterized by batch logged delayed feedback, short-term memory, and dynamic action spaces under the Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM) framework. Our analysis reveals that while regression oracles significantly improve performance, they introduce challenges due to rigid algorithmic assumptions. Specifically, we observe that as a policy improves, subsequent generations may perform worse due to shifts in the reward distribution and increased class imbalance in the training data. This degradation occurs de spite improvements in other aspects of the training data, leading to decreased performance in successive policy iterations. We further explore the long-term impact of regression oracles, identifying a potential "oscillation effect." This effect arises when regression oracles influence probability estimates and the realizability of subsequent policy models, leading to fluctuations in performance across iterations. Our findings highlight the need for more adaptable algorithms that can leverage the benefits of regression oracles without introducing instability in policy performance over time.</description>

      <title>Affordable AI Assistants with Knowledge Graph of Thoughts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02670v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are revolutionizing the development of AI assistants capable of performing diverse tasks across domains. However, current state-of-the-art LLM-driven agents face significant challenges, including high operational costs and limited success rates on complex benchmarks like GAIA. To address these issues, we propose Knowledge Graph of Thoughts (KGoT), an innovative AI assistant architecture that integrates LLM reasoning with dynamically constructed knowledge graphs (KGs). KGoT extracts and structures task-relevant knowledge into a dynamic KG representation, iteratively enhanced through external tools such as math solvers, web crawlers, and Python scripts. Such structured representation of task-relevant knowledge enables low-cost models to solve complex tasks effectively while also minimizing bias and noise. For example, KGoT achieves a 29% improvement in task success rates on the GAIA benchmark compared to Hugging Face Agents with GPT-4o mini. Moreover, harnessing a smaller model dramatically reduces operational costs by over 36x compared to GPT-4o. Improvements for other models (e.g., Qwen2.5-32B and Deepseek-R1-70B) and benchmarks (e.g., SimpleQA) are similar. KGoT offers a scalable, affordable, versatile, and high-performing solution for AI assistants.</description>

      <title>Shifting from Ranking to Set Selection for Retrieval Augmented Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06838v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Retrieval in Retrieval-Augmented Generation(RAG) must ensure that retrieved passages are not only individually relevant but also collectively form a comprehensive set. Existing approaches primarily rerank top-k passages based on their individual relevance, often failing to meet the information needs of complex queries in multi-hop question answering. In this work, we propose a set-wise passage selection approach and introduce SETR, which explicitly identifies the information requirements of a query through Chain-of-Thought reasoning and selects an optimal set of passages that collectively satisfy those requirements. Experiments on multi-hop RAG benchmarks show that SETR outperforms both proprietary LLM-based rerankers and open-source baselines in terms of answer correctness and retrieval quality, providing an effective and efficient alternative to traditional rerankers in RAG systems.
