      <title>Liquid-fueled oblique detonation waves induced by reactive and non-reactive transverse liquid jets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This computational study demonstrates the formation of liquid-fueled oblique detonation waves (ODWs) induced by a liquid transverse jet, which is either reactive or non-reactive. The study employs an in-house two-phase supersonic reactive flow solver based on the rhocentralfoam framework of OpenFOAM. The findings emphasize the essential role of transverse jets in enabling successful ODW formation under conditions where detonation would otherwise fail. Specifically, the jet-inflow momentum ratio significantly influences the mechanisms of ODW formation. At lower momentum ratios, the oblique shock wave (OSW) induced by the jet is insufficient to directly initiate detonation. Instead, the atomized n-heptane jet increases the local fuel mass fraction, promoting low- and intermediate-temperature chemical reactions, which eventually lead to detonation. At higher momentum ratios, the OSW generated by the transverse jet is sufficiently strong to directly trigger detonation through intermediate-temperature chemistry, with the jet acting primarily as a combustion stabilizer rather than directly enhancing combustion. Comparative studies with non-reactive jets and wedge-strip configurations demonstrate that at higher momentum ratios, the dominant mechanism is the physical blocking effect of the jet, which generates a strong OSW capable of initiating detonation.</description>

      <title>Closure for Microscale Fluctuations in Chaotic Mixing Fronts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15255v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scalar mixing fronts are formed under the stirring and spreading action of a random velocity field. The prediction of concentration statistics below the velocity length scale is an open problem. Here, we show that when fluid agitation is caused by a smooth chaotic flow with weak persistence, the evolution of scalar variance can be uniquely related to the stirring and spreading properties of the flow and the diffusivity of the scalar. Using the spectral description of microscale scalar fluctuations in presence of a large-scale forcing by Kraichnan (1974), we uncover the link between variance production and dissipation in a dispersing front. This provides a universal closure for the scalar fluctuation microscale whenever there exists a clear separation between macroscale dispersive forcing and microscale dissipation. We validate the closure model on high-resolution direct numerical simulation of advection-diffusion in chaotic flows of variable strength and persistence. These findings open a new avenue to predict both conservative and reactive transport in incompletely mixed environments, ranging from porous media flows to engineered flows in microfluidic devices.</description>

      <title>Slip flows of a Bingham fluid in curved channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15303v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the treatment of varicose veins with aqueous foams, we determine the velocity profiles and yield surface positions for pressure-driven flows of a Bingham fluid in curved channels, incorporating Navier wall slip to capture the slip behavior of aqueous foams. Assuming a constant pressure gradient -- consistent with syringe-driven injection in sclerotherapy -- we reproduce a closed-form analytic solution for the flow in a straight channel, and extend this to a uniformly curved channel consisting of a section of an annulus. We find that increasing the slip length in the curved channel moves the unyielded fluid, or plug, towards the inside of the channel and slightly decreases the plug width. Channels with a change in curvature are tackled numerically, with a procedure that is validated against the analytic results. We solve for the flow of a Bingham fluid in the transition region between a straight and a uniformly curved channel and in a non-uniform sinusoidal channel where the wall curvature changes continuously. We find that there is greater yielding of the fluid in curved channels, caused by an increase in the shear stresses. As the slip length increases, there is a reduction in the area of unyielded fluid in regions of high wall curvature. In the context of varicose vein sclerotherapy, our results suggest that slip has both positive and negative consequences: it reduces the possibility of static regions of foam developing in areas of high curvature in the vein, but also reduces the plug width in general, reducing the efficacy with which the foam displaces blood from the vein.</description>

      <title>Predictions of flow distortions inside a serpentine diffuser from large-eddy simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15646v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work examines the flow separation and the resulting pressure distortions at the exit plane of a serpentine diffuser operating at both subsonic and transonic conditions. Wallmodeled large-eddy simulations (WMLES) using the charLES flow solver are performed at three exit-plane Mach numbers, Ma_AIP ~ {0.36, 0.46, 0.54}. First, it is shown that the onset of flow separation inside a serpentine diffuser may likely experience strong, non-local history effects. A grid refinement study consisting of five grids (from 30 million to 3 billion cells) is conducted for all Mach numbers. The recently proposed dynamic tensor-coefficient Smagorinsky subgrid-scale and sensor-aided non-equilibrium wall models compare favorably with experimental measurements for the pressure recovery and azimuthal flow distortion at all Mach numbers. The pressure recovery and azimuthal flow distortion are predicted to within 0.3% and 7%, respectively, which are both within the experimental error bounds. However, the simulations underpredict the maximum azimuthal distortion in comparison to the experiments for all conditions. Statistical comparisons of the dynamic azimuthal flow distortions suggest that the present LES reasonably captures the ring-averaged mean distortions, and the statistical distributions of the distortion around the mean. Extreme events are underestimated by the present simulations, potentially highlighting that significantly longer integration times may be necessary.</description>

      <title>Predicting Onflow Parameters Using Transfer Learning for Domain and Task Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14784v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Determining onflow parameters is crucial from the perspectives of wind tunnel testing and regular flight and wind turbine operations. These parameters have traditionally been predicted via direct measurements which might lead to challenges in case of sensor faults. Alternatively, a data-driven prediction model based on surface pressure data can be used to determine these parameters. It is essential that such predictors achieve close to real-time learning as dictated by practical applications such as monitoring wind tunnel operations or learning the variations in aerodynamic performance of aerospace and wind energy systems. To overcome the challenges caused by changes in the data distribution as well as in adapting to a new prediction task, we propose a transfer learning methodology to predict the onflow parameters, specifically angle of attack and onflow speed. It requires first training a convolutional neural network (ConvNet) model offline for the core prediction task, then freezing the weights of this model except the selected layers preceding the output node, and finally executing transfer learning by retraining these layers. A demonstration of this approach is provided using steady CFD analysis data for an airfoil for i) domain adaptation where transfer learning is performed with data from a target domain having different data distribution than the source domain and ii) task adaptation where the prediction task is changed. Further exploration on the influence of noisy data, performance on an extended domain, and trade studies varying sampling sizes and architectures are provided. Results successfully demonstrate the potential of the approach for adaptation to changing data distribution, domain extension, and task update while the application for noisy data is concluded to be not as effective.</description>

      <title>Moment-enhanced shallow water equations for non-slip boundary conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14785v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The shallow water equations often assume a constant velocity profile along the vertical axis. However, this assumption does not hold in many practical applications. To better approximate the vertical velocity distribution, models such as the shallow water moment expansion models have been proposed. Nevertheless, under non-slip bottom boundary conditions, both the standard shallow water equation and its moment-enhanced models struggle to accurately capture the vertical velocity profile due to the stiff source terms. In this work, we propose modified shallow water equations and corresponding moment-enhanced models that perform well under both non-slip and slip boundary conditions. The primary difference between the modified and original models lies in the treatment of the source term, which allows our modified moment expansion models to be readily generalized, while maintaining compatibility with our previous analysis on the hyperbolicity of the model. To assess the performance of both the standard and modified moment expansion models, we conduct a comprehensive numerical comparison with the incompressible Navier--Stokes equations -- a comparison that is absent from existing literature.</description>

      <title>Dynamic behavior of shear-thickening fluids under harmonic excitation: an experimental investigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15431v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Shear-thickening fluids (STFs) become more viscous under shear stress, which makes them useful for many engineering and scientific applications. However, their behavior under normal forces, especially when these forces are applied harmonically, is less understood. Here, we examine the dynamic response of STFs under harmonic excitation. Our experimental setup features an unbalanced rotor attached to a vibrating plate submerged in an STF-filled container. We monitored the rotor's speed, the system's displacement, and the STF force. Data from experiments without STF were used to identify system parameters, and measurements of the STF force revealed the dynamic nature of the STF force. By comparing responses with and without STF, we identified three regions of behavior: in the pre-resonance region, the STF force is negligible; at resonance, it acts as a significant damping force; and in the post-resonance region, it behaves like an on-off force. Overall, the STF effectively reduces resonance amplitudes. These results can inform the design of complex structures incorporating STFs.</description>

      <title>PCWE for FSAI -- Derivation of scalar wave equations for fluid-structure-acoustics interaction of low Mach number flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.07490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.07490v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel derivation of the perturbed convective wave equation by utilizing the instantaneous velocity field as the foundation for the convective operator. This approach holds particular significance in the context of modeling fluid-structure-acoustic interaction (FSAI) problems, such as those encountered in human phonation or systems involving fans with flexible blades. The derivation is explored through two distinct methodologies: one commencing from the linearized perturbed compressible equations (LPCE) and the other rooted in the acoustic perturbation equations of variant 2 (APE-2). The comparative analysis of these alternative derivations may contribute to a more profound understanding of the underlying physics involved in FSI scenarios and aeroacoustics.</description>

      <title>GLONET: Mercator's end-to-end neural Global Ocean forecasting system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05454v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate ocean forecasting is crucial in different areas ranging from science to decision making. Recent advancements in data-driven models have shown significant promise, particularly in weather forecasting community, but yet no data-driven approaches have matched the accuracy and the scalability of traditional global ocean forecasting systems that rely on physics-driven numerical models and can be very computationally expensive, depending on their spatial resolution or complexity. Here, we introduce GLONET, a global ocean neural network-based forecasting system, developed by Mercator Ocean International. GLONET is trained on the global Mercator Ocean physical reanalysis GLORYS12 to integrate physics-based principles through neural operators and networks, which dynamically capture local-global interactions within a unified, scalable framework, ensuring high small-scale accuracy and efficient dynamics. GLONET's performance is assessed and benchmarked against two other forecasting systems: the global Mercator Ocean analysis and forecasting 1/12 high-resolution physical system GLO12 and a recent neural-based system also trained from GLORYS12. A series of comprehensive validation metrics is proposed, specifically tailored for neural network-based ocean forecasting systems, which extend beyond traditional point-wise error assessments that can introduce bias towards neural networks optimized primarily to minimize such metrics. The preliminary evaluation of GLONET shows promising results, for temperature, sea surface height, salinity and ocean currents. GLONET's experimental daily forecast are accessible through the European Digital Twin Ocean platform EDITO.</description>

      <title>Droplet-on-demand using a positive pressure pulse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01976v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Droplet generation under steady conditions is a common microfluidic method for producing biphasic systems. However, this process works only over a limited range of imposed pressure: beyond a critical value, a stable liquid jet can instead form. Furthermore, for a given geometry the pressure conditions set both the generation rate of droplets and their volume. Here, we report on-demand droplet production using a positive pressure pulse to the dispersed-phase inlet of a flow-focusing geometry. This strategy enables confined droplet generation within and beyond the pressure range observed under steady conditions, and decouples volume and production rate. In particular, elongated plugs not possible under steady conditions may be formed when the maximal pressure during the pulse reaches the jet regime. The measured volume of droplets-on-demand, as well as the onset of droplet generation are both captured with a simple model that considers hydraulic resistances. This work provides a strategy and design rules for processes that require individual droplets or elongated plugs in a simple microfluidic chip design.</description>

      <title>On the intracyclic instability in Stokes layers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21913v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Time-dependent fluid dynamics plays a crucial role in both natural phenomena and industrial applications. Understanding the flow instabilities and transitions within these dynamical systems is essential for predicting and controlling their unsteady behaviour. A classic example of time-dependent flow is the Stokes layer. To study the transition mechanism in this flow, we employ the Finite-Time Lyapunov Exponent (FTLE) to demonstrate that a linear energy amplification mechanism may explain the intracyclic instability in the transitional Stokes layer, supported by favourable comparisons with experimental measurements of axial turbulence intensity. This complements existing theories applied to the Stokes layer in the literature, including the Floquet analysis and the instantaneous/momentary analyses, which have struggled to capture this experimental observation accurately. The FTLE analysis is closely related to the transient growth analysis, formulated as an optimisation problem of the disturbance energy growth over time. We found that the energy amplification weakens as the finite Stokes layer becomes more confined and the oscillating frequency has a non-monotonic effect on the maximum transient growth. Based on these results, we recommend future experimental studies to validate this linear mechanism.</description>

      <title>Discrete vortex-based broadcast mode analysis for modification of dynamic stall</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.01835v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We integrate a discrete vortex method with complex network analysis to strategize dynamic stall mitigation over a pitching airfoil with active flow control. The objective is to inform actuator placement and timing to introduce control inputs during the transient evolution of dynamic stall. To this end, we represent the massively separated flow as a network of discrete vortical elements and quantify the interactions among these vortical nodes by tracking the spread of displacement perturbations between each pair of elements using the discrete vortex method. This enables a network broadcast mode analysis to identify an optimal set of vortices, critical timing, and direction to seed perturbations as control inputs. Motivated by the goal of mitigating dynamic stall, the optimality is defined as minimizing the total circulation of free vortices generated from the leading edge over a prescribed time horizon. We demonstrate the framework on two cases: two-dimensional flow over a flat plate airfoil and three-dimensional turbulent flow over a SD7003 airfoil. The analysis reveals that optimal timing for introducing disturbances occurs just after separation onset, when the shear layer pinches up to form the core of the dynamic stall vortex. Broadcast modes indicate that vortical nodes along the shear layer are optimal for control, guiding actuator placement. Flow simulations validate these insights: placing actuators near the leading edge and triggering them shortly after separation yields a 12% and 30% reduction in peak lift for the flat plate and SD7003 cases, respectively. A corresponding decrease in vorticity injection under control confirms the analysis objective. This study highlights the potential of combining discrete vortex methods with network analysis to guide active flow control in unsteady aerodynamics.</description>

      <title>A Multi-Scale Boltzmann Equation for Complex Systems of Neutral Gases across All Flow Regimes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07038v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A Multi-scale Boltzmann Equation (MBE) is found from the gas-kinetic theory and the direct modeling philosophy as a master equation for complex physical systems of neutral gases across all flow regimes, which locates between the continuum limit and the free-molecular limit, covering a vast range of applications such as hypersonic flows over aerospace crafts and delicate flows around MEMS. The most explicit characteristic of MBE is evolving the variable observation time in the expression, which distinguishes the MBE from the single-scale master or governing equation where a fixed scale is implied in the assumptions. The fundamental properties of MBE, such as the asymptotic property, are proved theoretically, while a concise numerical scheme is developed for MBE to demonstrate its validity by benchmark multi-scale problems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.03567v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mutual information between particle positions before and after mixing provides a universal assumption-free measure of mixing efficiency at low Reynolds number which accounts for the kinematic reversibility of the Stokes equation. For a generic planar shear flow with time-dependent shear rate, we derive a compact expression for the mutual information as a nonlinear functional of the shearing protocol and solve the associated extremisation problem exactly to determine the optimal control under both linear and non-linear constraints, specifically total shear and total dissipation per unit volume. Remarkably, optimal protocols turn out to be universal and time-reversal symmetric in both cases. Our results establish a minimum energetic cost of erasing information in a broad class of non-equilibrium drift-diffusive systems.</description>

Abstract: This article investigates matrix-free higher-order discontinuous Galerkin (DG) discretizations of the Navier-Stokes equations for incompressible flows with variable viscosity. The viscosity field may be prescribed analytically or governed by a rheological law, as often found in biomedical or industrial applications. The DG discretization of the adapted second-order viscous terms is carried out via the symmetric interior penalty Galerkin method, obviating auxiliary variables. Based on this spatial discretization, we compare several linearized variants of saddle point block systems and projection-based splitting time integration schemes in terms of their computational performance. Compared to the velocity-pressure block-system for the former, the splitting scheme allows solving a sequence of simple problems such as mass, convection-diffusion and Poisson equations. We investigate under which conditions the improved temporal stability of fully implicit schemes and resulting expensive nonlinear solves outperform the splitting schemes and linearized variants that are stable under hyperbolic time step restrictions.
  The key aspects of this work are i) a higher-order DG discretization for incompressible flows with variable viscosity, ii) accelerated nonlinear solver variants and suitable linearizations adopting a matrix-free $hp$-multigrid solver, and iii) a detailed comparison of the monolithic and projection-based solvers in terms of their (non-)linear solver performance.
  The presented schemes are evaluated in a series of numerical examples verifying their spatial and temporal accuracy, and the preconditioner performance under increasing viscosity contrasts, while their efficiency is showcased in the backward-facing step benchmark.</description>
