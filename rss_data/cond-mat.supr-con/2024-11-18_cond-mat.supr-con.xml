      <title>Large critical fields in superconducting Ti$_{4}$Ir$_2$O from spin-orbit coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recently synthesized $\eta$-carbide-type superconductors exhibit large critical fields. A notable example is Ti$_4$Ir$_2$O, for which the upper critical field strongly violates the Pauli paramagnetic limit, behavior that is unusual for cubic materials that preserve inversion symmetry. Here, by combining density functional theory (DFT) and analytic modeling, we provide an explanation for this enhanced Pauli limiting field. We show that the nonsymmorphic Fd$\overline{3}$m symmetry implies that the electronic states near the X points exhibit strong spin-orbit coupling (SOC), which leads to a vanishing effective $g$-factor and enables the enhanced Pauli limiting field. Furthermore, our DFT results reveal a Van Hove singularity (VHS) peak near the X points, accounting for $\sim$65\% of the total density of states (DOS), occurring near the chemical potential. We propose that the strong SOC and enhanced DOS in the vicinity of the X points provide the origin of the observed enhanced critical field. This leads to a prediction that the magnetic field will lead to a strongly momentum-dependent gap suppression. The gap due to electronic states away from (near to) the X points will be rapidly (slowly) suppressed by fields.</description>

      <title>Optimal coloring and strain-enhanced superconductivity in Li$_n$B$_{n+1}$C$_{n-1}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09925v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Boron-rich lithium borocarbides are promising candidates for phonon-mediated high-temperature superconductors due to their metallic $\sigma$-bonding electrons. Here, we use the cluster expansion method to identify energetically stable configurations (colorings) of Li$_2$B$_3$C and Li$_3$B$_4$C$_2$, which are characterized by a distinctive pattern of alternating B-B and B-C zigzag chains. Surprisingly, the optimal configuration of Li$_2$B$_3$C exhibits an extremely low superconducting transition temperature of $T_c &lt; 0.03$ K, which is attributed to the suppression of deformation potentials near the Fermi level caused by the specific electron filling of B-B zigzag chains. However, the $\sigma$-bonding electrons at the Fermi level are highly sensitive to external strain or pressure. Specifically, applying a -5\% compressive uniaxial strain can significantly enhance the electron-phonon coupling and the Eliashberg spectral function, boosting up $T_c$ to 37 K. This work not only presents a novel strategy for achieving phonon-mediated high-temperature superconductivity in Li$_n$B$_{n+1}$C$_{n-1}$ compounds but also provides valuable insights into the complex interplay between electronic structure and superconducting interaction.</description>

      <title>Assessing the possible superconductivity in doped perovskite hydride KMgH$_3$: Effects of lattice anharmonicity and spin fluctuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09966v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The superconducting properties of uniformly hole-doped perovskite hydride KMgH$_3$ with varying doping concentration and lattice parameter corresponding to different pressures were investigated from first principles. The superconducting transition temperature ($T_{\mathrm{c}}$) was predicted from the density functional theory for superconductors (SCDFT), where the effects of lattice anharmonicity and spin-fluctuation were considered and examined. Although lattice anharmonicity tends to suppress superconductivity around the edge of dynamical stability, where the phase is stabilized due to anharmonic effects, $T_{\mathrm{c}}$ is enhanced. In the hole-doped \ce{KMgH3}, substantial spin-fluctuation (SF) effects were discovered, which counters the phonon-mediated pairing and decreases $T_{\mathrm{c}}$. Such anomalously strong SF is evaluated for similar hydrides, where the hydrogen 1-$s$ bands are isolated at the Fermi level, and its correlation with the electronics density of states was explored.</description>

      <title>Optical response of edge modes in time-reversal symmetric topological superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09985v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological superconductors and Majorana edge modes at their boundaries have been theoretically predicted. However, their experimental observation remains controversial. Recent theoretical studies suggest that chiral Majorana edge modes exhibit distinct spatially-resolved optical conductivity compared to chiral Dirac edge modes. In this work, we investigate the optical conductivity and spatially-resolved optical conductivity induced by Majorana edge modes and Dirac edge modes under time-reversal symmetry and crystalline symmetry. We conduct numerical calculations and analytical calculations with edge effective theory for two-dimensional ${\mathbb Z}_2$ topological insulators, strong topological superconductors, and topological crystalline superconductors. Our results show that even under time-reversal symmetry and crystalline symmetry, Majorana edge modes and Dirac edge modes exhibit different optical responses.</description>

      <title>Oxidation Kinetics of Superconducting Niobium and a-Tantalum in Atmosphere at Short and Intermediate Time Scales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The integration of superconducting niobium and tantalum into superconducting quantum devices has been increasingly explored over the past few years. Recent developments have shown that two-level-systems (TLS) in the surface oxides of these superconducting films are a leading source of decoherence in quantum circuits, and understanding the surface oxidation kinetics of these materials is key to enabling scalability of these technologies. We analyze the nature of atmospheric oxidation of both niobium and a-tantalum surfaces at time scales relevant to fabrication, from sub-minute to two-week atmospheric exposure, employing a combination of x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy to monitor the growth of the surface oxides. The oxidation kinetics are modeled according to the Cabrera-Mott model of surface oxidation, and the model growth parameters are reported for both films. Our results indicate that niobium surface oxidation follows a consistent regime of inverse logarithmic growth for the entire time scale of the study, whereas a-Ta surface oxidation shows a clear transition between two inverse logarithmic growth regimes at time t = 1 hour, associated with the re-coordination of the surface oxide as determined by x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis. Our findings provide a more complete understanding of the differences in atmospheric surface oxidation between Nb and a-Ta, particularly at short time scales, paving the way for the development of more robust fabrication control for quantum computing architectures.</description>

      <title>Density-wave like behavior in a new Kagome material Ce$_{2}$Ru$_{3}$Si</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09907v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Kagome materials with inherent geometric frustration can produce many interesting physical properties, such as flat bands, quantum spin liquid, chiral magnetism, superconductivity and density-wave orders. Sometimes, the localized 4$f$ electrons from Ce atoms coupled with other conduction electrons would also give rise to the flat bands near the Fermi level, and results in the formation of heavy fermion. Thus, it is highly probable that kagome material incorporating Ce element will display nontrivial physical properties. In this study, we present a new Kagome material belonging to the trinary Laves phase, Ce$_{2}$Ru$_{3}$Si, in which kagome plane is formed by Ru atoms. Electrical transport and specific heat measurements reveal a density-wave like transition. A Curie-Weiss behavior is observed in low-temperature region. Meanwhile we also find a relatively large specific coefficient $\gamma_{n}(0)$. The calculated Wilson ratio $R_\mathrm{W}\propto{\chi(0)/\gamma_{n}}$ is approximately 3.1, indicating a moderate electron correlation effect. Chemical doping of Ir at the Ru site rapidly suppresses this density-wave like transition, while Mo doping leads to a gradual decrease in transition temperature. Theoretical calculation indicates both the Ce-4$f$ and Ru-4$d$ electronic bands cross the Fermi level, forming a Mexican-hat-shape Fermi surface close to the Fermi energy, potentially accounting for the observed density-wave like transition. Our findings provide an useful platform for investigating how hybridization between 4$f$ and 4$d$ electrons influences the electronic transport, and the relationship between the density-wave transition and kagome structure.</description>

      <title>A facile route to synthesize cubic gauche polymeric nitrogen</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10331v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, the long-sought cg-N with N-N single bond has been synthesized for the first time by a thermal-driven-only chemical route at ambient conditions. The successful synthesis of cg-N was achieved by first creating a solution of azides, which was then pretreated under vacuum conditions. Following the pretreatment, the resultant concentrated azide was heated at temperatures ranging from 260{\deg}C to 330{\deg}C for a reaction time of 3 hours, ultimately leading to the formation of cg-N. The emergent intense Raman peak characterized of cg-N provides solid evidence that the double bonded nitrogen-nitrogen transforms into a single bond form, which agrees well with cg-N structure. To date, this is the only work achieving the quantity of cg-N synthesized at ambient conditions by a facile route that can be further developed for the scalable synthesis and applications of polymerized nitrogen-based materials as high energy density materials.</description>

      <title>Topological vortices in planar S-TI-S Josephson junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10335v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss the Josephson vortices in planar superconductor-topological insulator-superconductor (S-TI-S) junctions, where the TI section is narrow and long. We are motivated by recent experiments, especially by those in junctions of Corbino ring geometry, where non-zero critical current was observed at low temperatures even if a non-zero phase winding number (fluxoid) was enforced in the ring by the perpendicular magnetic field. In this paper we focus on the "atomic" limit in which the low-energy bound states of different vortices do not overlap. In this limit we can associate the non-vanishing critical current with the irregularities (disorder) in the junction's width. We also discuss the microwave spectroscopy of the Josephson vortices in the atomic limit and observe particularly simple selection rules for the allowed transitions.</description>

      <title>Detecting Topological Superconductivity via Berry Curvature Effects in Spectral Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.02165v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Experimental efforts on topological superconductivity (TSC) have primarily focused on the detection of Majorana boundary modes, while the bulk properties of TSC - particularly in two dimensions (2D) - remain relatively underexplored. In this work, we theoretically propose a distinctive signature in the spectral function away from the boundaries, capable of detecting 2D chiral p-wave TSC induced in a Rashba spin-orbit-coupled (SOC) heterostructure. This signature can be probed experimentally through angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) or momentum- and energy-resolved tunneling spectroscopy (MERTS) under a weak magnetic field B. We show that within the topological phase, the spectral intensity of the lowest superconducting band at small momenta k~0 brightens linearly with increasing B, whereas it darkens in the trivial phase. This sharp contrast arises from the phase-space Berry curvature (BC) of Bogoliubov quasiparticles, a novel quantum geometric property that generalizes the conventional momentum-space BC. The effect of this phase-space BC can also be detected by the differential conductance away from the boundaries. Our falsifiable prediction provides a new experimental avenue for detecting Rashba-induced chiral p-wave TSC without relying on Majorana mode detection, addressing a key challenge in the realization of 2D TSC.</description>

      <title>Extremely weak sub-kelvin electron-phonon coupling in InAs On Insulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15040v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We are proposing, as an ideal candidate for caloritronic devices operating at subKelvin temperatures, a hybrid superconductor-semiconductor platform named InAs on insulator (InAsOI). This heterostructure is made by doped InAs grown on an insulating buffer of InAlAs on a GaAs substrate. Caloritronic devices aim to heat or cool electrons out of equilibrium with respect to the phonon degree of freedom. However, their performances are usually limited by the strength of the electron-phonon (e-ph) coupling and the associated power loss. Our work discusses the advantages of the InAsOI platform, which are based on the significantly low e-ph coupling measured compared to all-metallic state-of-the-art caloritronic devices. Our structure demonstrates values of the e-ph coupling constant up to two orders of magnitude smaller than typical values in metallic structures.</description>

      <title>Superconducting memory and trapped magnetic flux in ternary lanthanum polyhydrides</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.08730v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Superconducting memory is a promising technology for data storage because of its speed, high energy efficiency, non-volatility, and compatibility with quantum computing devices. However, the need for cryogenic temperatures makes superconducting memory an extremely expensive and specialized device. Ternary lanthanum polyhydrides, due to their high critical temperatures of 240-250 K, represent a convenient platform for studying effects associated with superconductivity in disordered granular systems. In this work, we investigate a trapped magnetic flux and memory effects in recently discovered lanthanum-neodymium (La,Nd)H$_{10}$ and lanthanum-scandium (La,Sc)H$_{12}$ superhydrides at a pressure of 175-196 GPa. We use a steady magnetic field of a few Tesla (T) and strong pulsed fields up to 68 T to create the trapped flux state in the compressed superhydrides. We find a clockwise hysteresis of magnetoresistance in cerium CeH$_{9-10}$ and lanthanum-cerium (La,Ce)H$_{10+x}$ polyhydrides, a characteristic feature of granular superconductors. A study of the current-voltage characteristics and voltage-temperature curves of the samples with frozen magnetic flux indicates a significant memory effect in La-Sc polyhydrides already at 225-230 K.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07608v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The two-dimensional Yukawa-Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (2d-YSYK) model provides a universal theory of quantum phase transitions in metals in the presence of quenched random spatial fluctuations in the local position of the quantum critical point. It has a Fermi surface coupled to a scalar field by spatially random Yukawa interactions. We present full numerical solutions of a self-consistent disorder averaged analysis of the 2d-YSYK model in both the normal and superconducting states, obtaining electronic spectral functions, frequency-dependent conductivity, and superfluid stiffness. Our results reproduce key aspects of observations in the cuprates as analyzed by Michon et al. (arXiv:2205.04030). We also find a regime of increasing zero temperature superfluid stiffness with decreasing superconducting critical temperature, as is observed in bulk cuprates.</description>
