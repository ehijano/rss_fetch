      <title>Varying-constant cosmology from hyperlight, coupled scalars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The fundamental constants at recombination can differ from their present-day values due to degeneracies in cosmological parameters, raising the possibility of yet-undiscovered physics coupled directly to the Standard Model. We study the cosmology of theories in which a new, hyperlight scalar field modulates the electron mass and fine-structure constant at early times. We find new degeneracies in cosmologies that pair early recombination with a new contribution to the matter density arising at late times, whose predictions can be simultaneously consistent with CMB and low-redshift distance measurements. Such "late dark matter" already exists in the Standard Model in the form of massive neutrinos, but is necessarily realized by the scalar responsible for shifting the early-time fundamental constants. After detailing the physical effects of varying constants and hyperlight scalar fields on cosmology, we find that variations of the electron mass and fine structure constant are constrained at the percent and permille level, respectively, and a hyperlight scalar in the mass range $10^{-32}~\mathrm{eV} \lesssim m_\phi \lesssim 10^{-28}~\mathrm{eV}$ can impact what variations are allowed while composing up to a percent of the present dark matter density. We comment on the potential for models with a varying electron mass to reconcile determinations of the Hubble constant from cosmological observations and distance-ladder methods, and we show that parameter inference varies significantly between recent baryon acoustic oscillation and type Ia supernova datasets.</description>

      <title>$k$-e$\mu$lator: emulating clustering effects of the $k$-essence dark energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10424v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We build an emulator based on the polynomial chaos expansion (PCE) technique to efficiently model the non-linear effects associated with the clustering of the $k$-essence dark energy in the effective field theory (EFT) framework. These effects can be described through a modification of Poisson's equation, denoted by the function $\mu(k,z)$, which in general depends on wavenumber $k$ and redshift $z$. To emulate this function, we perform $200$ high-resolution $N$-body simulations sampled from a seven-dimensional parameter space with the Latin hypercube method. These simulations are executed using the $\texttt{k-evolution}$ code on a fixed mesh, containing $1200^3$ dark matter particles within a box size of $400~\text{Mpc}/ h$. The emulation process has been carried out within $\texttt{UQLab}$, a $\texttt{MATLAB}$-based software specifically dedicated to emulation and uncertainty quantification tasks. Apart from its role in emulation, the PCE method also facilitates the measurement of Sobol indices, enabling us to assess the relative impact of each cosmological parameter on the $\mu$ function. Our results show that the PCE-based emulator efficiently and accurately reflects the behavior of the $k$-essence dark energy for the cosmological parameter space defined by $w_0 c_s^2 \text{CDM} +\sum m_{\nu}$. Compared against actual simulations, the emulator achieves sub-percent accuracy up to the wavenumber $k \approx 9.4 ~h \text{Mpc}^{-1} $ for redshifts $z \leq 3$. Our emulator provides an efficient and reliable tool for Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis, and its capability to closely mimic the properties of the $k$-essence dark energy makes it a crucial component in Bayesian parameter estimations. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/anourizo/k-emulator .</description>

      <title>Double Inflation in Classically Conformal $B-L$ Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10537v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It has recently been shown in Ref. [1] that the double-inflation scenario based on the Coleman-Weinberg potential can successfully generate primordial black holes (PBHs) with the inflationary predictions consistent with the Planck measurements. These PBHs can play the role of dark matter in our universe. In this paper, we propose the classically conformal minimal $B-L$ model as an ultra-violet (UV) completion of the scenario. In our model, the $B-L$ Higgs field is identified with the inflaton and the electroweak symmetry breaking is triggered by the radiative $B-L$ symmetry breaking with the Coleman-Weinberg potential. We show that this UV completion leads to a viable cosmological history after the double inflaton: the universe is reheated via inflaton decay into right-handed neutrinos whose mass is determined consistently by a relation between the number of e-folds and reheating temperature. Using the general parameterization for neutrino Dirac Yukawa couplings through the seesaw mechanism and the neutrino oscillation data, we also show that the observed baryon asymmetry of the universe is successfully reproduced by either resonant leptogenesis or non-thermal leptogenesis. Based on the scalar power spectrum shown in Ref. [1], we evaluate the scalar induced gravitational wave spectrum, which can be tested by various proposed gravitational wave observatories like BBO, DECIGO etc.</description>

      <title>STOLAS: STOchastic LAttice Simulation of cosmic inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a C++ package of the STOchastic LAttice Simulation (STOLAS) of cosmic inflation. It performs the numerical lattice simulation in the application of the stochastic-$\delta N$ formalism. STOLAS can directly compute the three-dimensional map of the observable curvature perturbation without estimating its statistical properties. In its application to two toy models of inflation, chaotic inflation and Starobinsky's linear-potential inflation, we confirm that STOLAS is well-consistent with the standard perturbation theory. Furthermore, by introducing the importance sampling technique, we have success in numerically sampling the current abundance of primordial black holes in a non-perturbative way. The package is available at https://github.com/STOchasticLAtticeSimulation/STOLAS_dist.</description>

      <title>A Cohesive Deep Drilling Field Strategy for LSST Cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Vera C. Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) will image billions of astronomical objects in the wide-fast-deep primary survey and in a set of minisurveys including intensive observations of a group of deep drilling fields (DDFs). The DDFs are a critical piece of three key aspects of the LSST Dark Energy Science Collaboration (DESC) cosmological measurements: they provide a required calibration for photometric redshifts and weak gravitational lensing measurements and they directly contribute to cosmological constraints from the most distant type Ia supernovae. We present a set of cohesive DDF strategies fulfilling science requirements relevant to DESC and following the guidelines of the Survey Cadence Optimization Committee. We propose a method to estimate the observing strategy parameters and we perform simulations of the corresponding surveys. We define a set of metrics for each of the science case to assess the performance of the proposed observing strategies. We show that the most promising results are achieved with deep rolling surveys characterized by two sets of fields: ultradeep fields (z&lt;1.1) observed at a high cadence with a large number of visits over a limited number of seasons; deep fields (z&lt;0.7), observed with a cadence of ~3 nights for ten years. These encouraging results should be confirmed with realistic simulations using the LSST scheduler. A DDF budget of ~8.5% is required to design observing strategies satisfying all the cosmological requirements. A lower DDF budget lead to surveys that either do not fulfill photo-z/WL requirements or are not optimal for SNe Ia cosmology.</description>

      <title>Dark Energy Survey Year 3 results: simulation-based cosmological inference with wavelet harmonics, scattering transforms, and moments of weak lensing mass maps II. Cosmological results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10881v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a simulation-based cosmological analysis using a combination of Gaussian and non-Gaussian statistics of the weak lensing mass (convergence) maps from the first three years (Y3) of the Dark Energy Survey (DES). We implement: 1) second and third moments; 2) wavelet phase harmonics; 3) the scattering transform. Our analysis is fully based on simulations, spans a space of seven $\nu w$CDM cosmological parameters, and forward models the most relevant sources of systematics inherent in the data: masks, noise variations, clustering of the sources, intrinsic alignments, and shear and redshift calibration. We implement a neural network compression of the summary statistics, and we estimate the parameter posteriors using a simulation-based inference approach. Including and combining different non-Gaussian statistics is a powerful tool that strongly improves constraints over Gaussian statistics (in our case, the second moments); in particular, the Figure of Merit $\textrm{FoM}(S_8, \Omega_{\textrm{m}})$ is improved by 70 percent ($\Lambda$CDM) and 90 percent ($w$CDM). When all the summary statistics are combined, we achieve a 2 percent constraint on the amplitude of fluctuations parameter $S_8 \equiv \sigma_8 (\Omega_{\textrm{m}}/0.3)^{0.5}$, obtaining $S_8 = 0.794 \pm 0.017$ ($\Lambda$CDM) and $S_8 = 0.817 \pm 0.021$ ($w$CDM). The constraints from different statistics are shown to be internally consistent (with a $p$-value&gt;0.1 for all combinations of statistics examined). We compare our results to other weak lensing results from the DES Y3 data, finding good consistency; we also compare with results from external datasets, such as \planck{} constraints from the Cosmic Microwave Background, finding statistical agreement, with discrepancies no greater than $&lt;2.2\sigma$.</description>

      <title>Gravitational waves from low-scale cosmic strings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10937v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cosmic strings are a common prediction in many grand unified theories and a promising source of stochastic gravitational waves (GWs) from the early Universe. In this paper, we point out that the GW signal from cosmic strings produced at a comparatively low energy scale, $v \lesssim 10^9 \textrm{GeV}$, exhibits several novel features that are not present in the case of high-scale cosmic strings. Our findings notably include (i) a sharp cutoff frequency $f_{\rm cut}$ in the GW spectrum from the fundamental oscillation mode on closed string loops and (ii) an oscillating pattern in the total GW spectrum from all oscillation modes whose local minima are located at integer multiples of $f_{\rm cut}$. These features reflect the fact that string loops produced in the early Universe fail to shrink to zero size because of GW emission within the age of the Universe, if their tension is low enough. In addition, they offer an exciting opportunity to directly probe the discrete spectrum of oscillation modes on closed string loops in GW observations. For strings produced at a scale $v \sim 10^9\textrm{GeV}$, the novel features in the GW spectrum are within the sensitivity reach of future experiments such as BBO and DECIGO.</description>

      <title>Interacting dark sector: a dynamical system perspective</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10604v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the interaction between the dark sectors from a dynamical systems perspective. A general setup for interacting dark energy models that incorporates both quintessence and phantom fields through a switch parameter, allowing an interaction in the dark sectors has been considered. In the first part of our analysis, we have not assumed any specific form of the interaction and in the second part, we invoked examples in general framework of the interaction. The potentials of the scalar field are classified into two broad classes of potentials: exponential and non-exponential. We identify the potential late-time attractors of the system which have a complete dark energy domination. From our analysis, it is evident there could be an interaction between the dark sector. The interaction, if any, weakens over time. We find for the quintessence field the transfer of energy from dark matter to dark energy can flip the direction and on the contrary, for the phantom field, it is only from dark matter to dark energy.</description>

      <title>Instability of Circumnuclear Gas Supply as An Origin of "Changing-look" Phenomenon of Supermassive Blackholes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10663v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The origin of the "Changing-look" (CL) phenomenon in supermassive black holes (SMBHs) remains an open issue. This study aims to shed light on this phenomenon by focusing on a sample that encompasses all known repeating CL active galactic nuclei (AGNs). Through the identification of a characteristic time scale for the CL phenomenon, it was observed that larger SMBHs possess shorter characteristic timescales, while smaller SMBHs exhibit longer timescales. These findings reveal a significant contrast to the traditional AGN variability that has been adequately explained by the AGN's disk instability model. This stark discrepancy highlights a distinct origin of the CL phenomenon, distinguishing it from traditional AGN variability. By properly predicting the characteristic time scale and its dependence on SMBH mass, we propose that the CL phenomenon is likely a result of a variation in accretion rate caused by a sudden change in the supply of circumnuclear gas during the transition between active and passive SMBH fueling stages.</description>

      <title>A Novel Model for the MeV Emission Line in GRB 221009A</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10775v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) have long been considered potential sources of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs; with energy $\gtrsim 10^{18} {\rm~eV}$). In this work, we propose a novel model generating MeV emission lines in GRB, which can constrain the properties of heavy nuclei that potentially exist in GRB jets. Specifically, we find that relativistic hydrogen-like high-atomic-number ions originating from the $\beta$ decay of unstable nuclei and/or the recombination entrained in the GRB jet can generate narrow MeV emission lines through the de-excitation of excited-electrons. This model can successfully explain the MeV emission line observed in the most luminous GRB ever recorded, GRB~221009A, with suitable parameters including a Lorentz factor $\gamma \sim 820-1700$ and a total mass of heavy nuclei $M_{\rm tot} \sim 10^{23} - 10^{26}$~g. Especially, the emission line broadening can be reasonably attributed to both the expansion of the jet shell and the thermal motion of nuclei, naturally resulting in a narrow width ($\sigma_{\rm line} / E_{\rm line} \lesssim 0.2$) consistent with the observation. Furthermore, we predict that different GRBs can exhibit lines in different bands with various evolving behaviors, which might be confirmed with further observations. Finally, our model provides indirect evidence that GRBs may be one of the sources of UHECRs.</description>

      <title>Light from darkness: history of a hot dark sector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10792v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a scenario in which the expansion of the early universe is driven by a hot hidden sector (HS) with an initial temperature $T'$ that is significantly higher than that of a visible sector (VS), $T' \gg T$. The latter is assumed to be made of Standard Model (SM) particles and our main focus is on the possibility that dark matter (DM) is part of the hot HS and that its abundance is set by secluded freeze-out. In particular, we study the subsequent evolution and fate of its companion particle after DM freeze-out. To be concrete, we work within a framework in which the DM is a Dirac fermion and its companion a massive dark photon. Coupling between the SM and HS is through kinetic mixing. We provide a comprehensive analytical and numerical analysis, including the subsequent process of thermalization of the two sectors. We use these results to explore the viable parameter space of both the DM matter particle and its companion. Assuming that the DM annihilation cross section is bounded by unitarity, the mass of the DM could be as large as $\sim 10^{11}$ GeV.</description>

      <title>Galaxy And Mass Assembly (GAMA): Stellar-to-Dynamical Mass Relation II. Peculiar Velocities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10866v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Empirical correlations connecting starlight to galaxy dynamics (e.g., the fundamental plane (FP) of elliptical/quiescent galaxies and the Tully--Fisher relation of spiral/star-forming galaxies) provide cosmology-independent distance estimation and are central to local Universe cosmology. In this work, we introduce the mass hyperplane (MH), which is the stellar-to-dynamical mass relation $(M_\star/M_\mathrm{dyn})$ recast as a linear distance indicator. Building on recent FP studies, we show that both star-forming and quiescent galaxies follow the same empirical MH, then use this to measure the peculiar velocities (PVs) for a sample of 2496 galaxies at $z&lt;0.12$ from GAMA. The limiting precision of MH-derived distance/PV estimates is set by the intrinsic scatter in size, which we find to be $\approx$0.1~dex for both quiescent and star-forming galaxies (when modeled independently) and $\approx$0.11~dex when all galaxies are modeled together; showing that the MH is as good as the FP. To empirically validate our framework and distance/PV estimates, we compare the inferred distances to groups as derived using either quiescent or star-forming galaxies. A good agreement is obtained with no discernible bias or offset, having a scatter of $\approx$0.05~dex $\approx$12\% in distance. Further, we compare our PV measurements for the quiescent galaxies to the previous PV measurements of the galaxies in common between GAMA and the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), which shows similarly good agreement. Finally, we provide comparisons of PV measurements made with the FP and the MH, then discuss possible improvements in the context of upcoming surveys such as the 4MOST Hemisphere Survey (4HS).</description>

      <title>FLAME: Fitting Ly$\alpha$ Absorption lines using Machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07498v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce FLAME, a machine-learning algorithm designed to fit Voigt profiles to HI Lyman-alpha (Ly$\alpha$) absorption lines using deep convolutional neural networks. FLAME integrates two algorithms: the first determines the number of components required to fit Ly$\alpha$ absorption lines, and the second calculates the Doppler parameter $b$, the HI column density N$_{\rm HI}$, and the velocity separation of individual components. For the current version of FLAME, we trained it on low-redshift Ly$\alpha$ forests observed with the far-ultraviolet gratings of the Cosmic Origin Spectrograph (COS) on board the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). Using these data, we trained FLAME on $\sim$ $10^6$ simulated Voigt profiles which we forward-modeled to mimic Ly$\alpha$ absorption lines observed with HST-COS in order to classify lines as either single or double components and then determine Voigt profile-fitting parameters. FLAME shows impressive accuracy on the simulated data, identifying more than 98\% (90\%) of single (double) component lines. It determines $b$ values within $\approx \pm{8}~(15)$ km s$^{-1}$ and log $N_{\rm HI}/ {\rm cm}^2$ values within $\approx \pm 0.3~(0.8)$ for 90\% of the single (double) component lines. However, when applied to real data, FLAME's component classification accuracy drops by $\sim$ 10\%. Nevertheless, there is reasonable agreement between the $b$ and N$_{\rm HI}$ distributions obtained from traditional Voigt profile-fitting methods and FLAME's predictions. Our mock HST-COS data analysis, designed to emulate real data parameters, demonstrates that FLAME is able to achieve consistent accuracy comparable to its performance with simulated data. This finding suggests that the drop in FLAME's accuracy when used on real data primarily arises from the difficulty in replicating the full complexity of real data in the training sample.</description>

      <title>Improving flux ratio anomaly precision by measuring gravitational lens multipole moments with extended arcs</title>

Abstract: In a strong gravitational lens, perturbations by low-mass dark matter halos can be detected by differences between the measured image fluxes relative to the expectation from a smooth model for the mass distribution which contains only the gravitational effects of the main deflector. The abundance of these low-mass structures can be used to constrain the properties of dark matter. Traditionally only the lensed quasar positions have been to predict the smooth-model flux ratios. We demonstrate that significant additional information can be gained by using the lensed quasar host galaxy which appears as an extended arc and constrains the smooth-model over a much larger angular area. We simulate Hubble Space Telescope-quality mock observations based on the lensing system WGD2038-4008 and we compare the model-predicted flux ratio precision and accuracy for two cases; one of which the inference is based only on the lensed quasar image positions, and the other based on the extended arcs as well as lensed quasar image positions. For our mock lens systems we include both elliptical, and higher order m=3 and m=4 multipole terms in the smooth-mass distributions with amplitudes based on the optically measured shapes of massive elliptical galaxies. We find that the extended arcs improve the precision of the model-predicted flux ratios by a factor of 6-8, depending on the strength of the multipole terms. Furthermore, with the extended arcs, we are also able to accurately recover the m=3, 4 mass multipole strengths and angles $a_3/a$, $a_4/a$, $\phi_3-\phi_0$, and $\phi_4-\phi_0$ to a precision of 0.002, 0.002, $3^\circ$ and $3^\circ$, respectively. This work implies that lensed arcs can constrain deviations from ellipticity in strong lens systems, and potentially lead to more robust constraints on substructure properties from flux ratios.</description>

      <title>Evolution of central galaxy alignments in simulations</title>

Abstract: Observations suggest that red central galaxies align closely with their group galaxies and the large-scale environment.This finding was also replicated in simulations, which added information about the alignment of the stars that form the galaxies with the dark matter in the halo they inhabit. These results were obtained for the present universe. Our study aims to build upon previous findings by examining the evolution of central galaxy alignment with their environment, as well as the alignment between their stellar and dark matter components. Based on previous studies, in this work, we describe the evolution of the alignment of bright central galaxies over time and try to understand the process leading to the current observed alignment. By employing the merger trees from the simulation, we track the alignment evolution of the central galaxy sample at z=0 used in a previous study, whose results correspond to the observations. In particular, we exploit the anisotropic correlation function to study the alignment of the central galaxies with the environment and the probability distribution of the angle between the axes of the shape tensor calculated for each component to deepen the analysis of the stellar and dark matter components. A description was given of the evolution of alignment in bright central galaxies with a focus on the distinctions between red and blue galaxies. Furthermore, it was found that the alignment of the dark matter halo differs from that of the stellar material within it. According to the findings, the assembly process and mergers influenced the evolution of alignment</description>

      <title>Frequency- and polarization-dependent lensing of gravitational waves in strong gravitational fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.06459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.06459v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The propagation of gravitational waves can be described in terms of null geodesics by using the geometrical optics approximation. However, at large but finite frequencies the propagation is affected by the spin-orbit coupling corrections to geometrical optics, known as the gravitational spin Hall effect. Consequently, gravitational waves follow slightly different frequency- and polarization-dependent trajectories, leading to dispersive and birefringent phenomena. We study the potential for detecting the gravitational spin Hall effect in hierarchical triple black hole systems, consisting of an emitting binary orbiting a more massive body acting as a gravitational lens. We calculate the difference in time of arrival with respect to the geodesic propagation and find that it follows a simple power-law dependence on frequency with a fixed exponent. We calculate the gravitational spin Hall-corrected waveform and its mismatch with respect to the original waveform. The waveform carries a measurable imprint of the strong gravitational field if the source, lens, and observer are sufficiently aligned, or for generic observers if the source is close enough to the lens. We present constraints on dispersive time delays from GWTC-3, translated from limits on Lorentz invariance violation. Finally, we address the sensitivity of current and future ground detectors to dispersive lensing. Our results demonstrate that the gravitational spin Hall effect can be detected, providing a novel probe of general relativity and the environments of compact binary systems.</description>

      <title>Forecasts for Galaxy Formation and Dark Matter Constraints from Dwarf Galaxy Surveys</title>

Abstract: The abundance of faint dwarf galaxies is determined by the underlying population of low-mass dark matter (DM) halos and the efficiency of galaxy formation in these systems. Here, we quantify potential galaxy formation and DM constraints from future dwarf satellite galaxy surveys. We generate satellite populations using a suite of Milky Way (MW)--mass cosmological zoom-in simulations and an empirical galaxy--halo connection model, and assess sensitivity to galaxy formation and DM signals when marginalizing over galaxy--halo connection uncertainties. We find that a survey of all satellites around one MW-mass host can constrain a galaxy formation cutoff at peak virial masses of $M_{50}=10^8~M_{\mathrm{\odot}}$ at the $1\sigma$ level; however, a tail toward low $M_{50}$ prevents a $2\sigma$ measurement. In this scenario, combining hosts with differing bright satellite abundances significantly reduces uncertainties on $M_{50}$ at the $1\sigma$ level, but the $2\sigma$ tail toward low $M_{50}$ persists. We project that observations of one (two) complete satellite populations can constrain warm DM models with $m_{\mathrm{WDM}}\approx 10~\mathrm{keV}$ ($20~\mathrm{keV}$). Subhalo mass function (SHMF) suppression can be constrained to $\approx 70\%$, $60\%$, and $50\%$ that in cold dark matter (CDM) at peak virial masses of $10^8$, $10^9$, and $10^{10}~M_{\mathrm{\odot}}$, respectively; SHMF enhancement constraints are weaker ($\approx 20$, $4$, and $2$ times that in CDM, respectively) due to galaxy--halo connection degeneracies. These results motivate searches for faint dwarf galaxies beyond the MW and indicate that ongoing missions like Euclid and upcoming facilities including the Vera C. Rubin Observatory and Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope will probe new galaxy formation and DM physics.</description>

      <title>Temperature evolution in the Early Universe and freeze-in at stronger coupling</title>

Abstract: Dark matter freeze-in at stronger coupling is operative when the Standard Model (SM) bath temperature never exceeds the dark matter mass. An attractive feature of this scenario is that it can be probed by direct detection experiments as well as at the LHC. In this work, we show how the mechanism can be realized in a simple UV complete framework, emphasizing the role of the maximal temperature of the SM thermal bath. We demonstrate that the maximal temperature can coincide with the reheating temperature or be close to it such that dark matter production is always Boltzmann-suppressed. This possibility is realized, for example, if the inflaton decays primarily into feebly interacting right-handed neutrinos, which subsequently generate the SM thermal bath. In this case, the SM sector temperature remains constant over cosmological times prior to reheating.</description>

      <title>Double-well instantons in finite volume</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.09863v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Assuming a toroidal space with finite volume, we derive analytically the full one-loop vacuum energy for a scalar field tunnelling between two degenerate vacua, taking into account discrete momentum. The Casimir energy is computed for an arbitrary number of dimensions using the Abel-Plana formula, while the one-loop instanton functional determinant is evaluated using the Green's functions for the fluctuation operators. The resulting energetic properties are non-trivial: both the Casimir effect and tunnelling contribute to the Null Energy Condition violation, arising from a non-extensive true vacuum energy. We discuss the relevance of this mechanism to induce a cosmic bounce, requiring no modified gravity or exotic matter.</description>
