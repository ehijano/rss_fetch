      <title>On Model Theory of Second-Order Objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03785v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by team semantics and existential second-order logic, we develop a model-theoretic framework for studying second-order objects such as sets and relations. We introduce a notion of abstract elementary team categories that generalizes the standard notion of abstract elementary class, and show that it is an example of an accessible category. We apply our framework to show that the logic $\mathsf{FOT}$ introduced by Kontinen and Yang satisfies a version of Lindstr\"om's Theorem. Finally, we consider the problem of transferring categoricity between different cardinalities for complete theories in existential second-order logic (or independence logic) and prove both a downwards and an upwards categoricity transfer result.</description>

      <title>On the representation of C-recursive integer sequences by arithmetic terms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04083v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that, if an integer sequence is given by a linear recurrence of constant rational coefficients, then it can be represented as the difference of two arithmetic terms with exponentiation, which do not contain any irrational constant. We apply our methods to various Lucas sequences including the classical Fibonacci sequence, to the sequence of solutions of the Pell equation and to some natural C-recursive sequences of degree 3.</description>

      <title>The computational content of multidimensional discontinuity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Weihrauch degrees are a tool to gauge the computational difficulty of mathematical problems. Often, what makes these problems hard is their discontinuity. We look at discontinuity in its purest form, that is, at otherwise constant functions that make a single discontinuous step along each dimension of their underlying space. This is an extension of previous work of Kihara, Pauly, Westrick from a single dimension to multiple dimensions. Among other results, we obtain strict hierarchies in the Weihrauch degrees, one of which orders mathematical problems by the richness of the truth-tables determining how discontinuous steps influence the output.</description>

      <title>Two-dimensional Kripke Semantics I: Presheaves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04157v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study of modal logic has witnessed tremendous development following the introduction of Kripke semantics. However, recent developments in programming languages and type theory have led to a second way of studying modalities, namely through their categorical semantics. We show how the two correspond.</description>

      <title>Cardinality of Real Numbers and Set Axiomatization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.12859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2112.12859v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The cardinality of real numbers depends on the chosen axiomatic system and specific models of set theory. Under the ZF framework, real numbers are nondenumerable, but their exact cardinality remains debated due to possible extensions of the ZF axioms. We explored this issue by analyzing sets within the ZFC model and Wang's $\Sigma$ model. Set $S'$, within the ZFC framework, includes all pairs of algebraic numbers with a transcendental number inserted between each pair by a function $f$, which inserts an arbitrarily chosen transcendental number into every interval bounded by algebraic endpoints. This approach enables the representation of any number using these intervals. By employing the AC, one can identify intervals from any Cauchy sequence within $S'$. As each interval contains at least one number due to the function $f$, the intersections of these intervals contain numbers defined by these sequences, making a complete and countable set $S'$.
  The second set, created by inserting specifically defined transcendental numbers between algebraic numbers, starts with the sequence of algebraic numbers as the 0-th layer in Wang's $\Sigma$ model. A diagonal procedure applied to that layer generates a set of transcendental numbers which, combined with the 0-th layer, forms the $\Sigma_1$ layer. Continuing this recursive process results in a set equivalent to $S'$. This suggests that all constructive real numbers are countable, challenging the traditional diagonal argument. The AC is crucial for selecting transcendental numbers and identifying intervals and sequences, making the set $S'$. This might resonate with constructivists who oppose the AC. However, further analysis revealed conflicts between proofs of non-denumerability and the Nested Interval Property, indicating a need to reevaluate the countability of real numbers.</description>

      <title>Indivisibility and uniform computational strength</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.03919v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A countable structure is indivisible if for every coloring with finite range there is a monochromatic isomorphic subcopy of the structure. Each indivisible structure naturally corresponds to an indivisibility problem which outputs such a subcopy given a presentation and coloring. We investigate the Weihrauch complexity of the indivisibility problems for two structures: the rational numbers $\mathbb{Q}$ as a linear order, and the equivalence relation $\mathscr{E}$ with countably many equivalence classes each having countably many members. We separate the Weihrauch degrees of both corresponding indivisibility problems from several benchmarks, showing in particular that the indivisibility problem for $\mathbb{Q}$ cannot solve the problem of finding a monochromatic rational interval given a coloring for which there is one; and that the Weihrauch degree of the indivisibility problem for $\mathscr{E}$ is strictly between those of $\mathsf{RT}^2$ and $\mathsf{SRT}^2$, two widely studied variants of Ramsey's theorem for pairs whose reverse-mathematical separation was open until recently.</description>

      <title>The proof-theoretic strength of Constructive Second-order set theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.12854v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we define constructive analogues of second-order set theories, which we will call $\mathsf{IGB}$, $\mathsf{CGB}$, $\mathsf{IKM}$, and $\mathsf{CKM}$. Each of them can be viewed as $\mathsf{IZF}$- and $\mathsf{CZF}$-analogues of G\"odel-Bernays set theory $\mathsf{GB}$ and Kelley-Morse set theory $\mathsf{KM}$. We also provide their proof-theoretic strengths in terms of classical theories, and we especially prove that $\mathsf{CKM}$ and full Second-Order Arithmetic have the same proof-theoretic strength.</description>

      <title>An order analysis of hyperfinite Borel equivalence relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17516v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we first consider hyperfinite Borel equivalence relations with a pair of Borel $\mathbb{Z}$-orderings. We define a notion of compatibility between such pairs, and prove a dichotomy theorem which characterizes exactly when a pair of Borel $\mathbb{Z}$-orderings are compatible with each other. We show that, if a pair of Borel $\mathbb{Z}$-orderings are incompatible, then a canonical incompatible pair of Borel $\mathbb{Z}$-orderings of $E_0$ can be Borel embedded into the given pair. We then consider hyperfinite-over-finite equivalence relations, which are countable Borel equivalence relations admitting Borel $\mathbb{Z}^2$-orderings. We show that if a hyperfinite-over-hyperfinite equivalence relation $E$ admits a Borel $\mathbb{Z}^2$-ordering which is self-compatible, then $E$ is hyperfinite.</description>

      <title>On the Walsh and Fourier-Hadamard Supports of Boolean Functions From a Quantum Viewpoint</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.09222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.09222v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we focus on the links between Boolean function theory and quantum computing. In particular, we study the notion of what we call fully-balanced functions and analyse the Fourier--Hadamard and Walsh supports of those functions having such property. We study the Walsh and Fourier supports of other relevant classes of functions, using what we call balancing sets. This leads us to revisit and complete certain classic results and to propose new ones.
  We complete our study by extending the previous results to pseudo-Boolean functions (in relation to vectorial functions) and giving an insight on its applications in the analysis of the possibilities that a certain family of quantum algorithms can offer.</description>
