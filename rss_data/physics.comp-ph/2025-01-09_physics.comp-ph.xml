      <title>Scalable Discovery of Fundamental Physical Laws: Learning Magnetohydrodynamics from 3D Turbulence Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04094v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discovery of dynamical models from data represents a crucial step in advancing our understanding of physical systems. Library-based sparse regression has emerged as a powerful method for inferring governing equations directly from spatiotemporal data, but current model-agnostic implementations remain computationally expensive, limiting their applicability to data that lack substantial complexity. To overcome these challenges, we introduce a scalable framework that enables efficient discovery of complex dynamical models across a wide range of applications. We demonstrate the capabilities of our approach, by ``discovering'' the equations of magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) from synthetic data generated by high-resolution simulations of turbulent MHD flows with viscous and Ohmic dissipation. Using a library of candidate terms that is $\gtrsim 10$ times larger than those in previous studies, we accurately recover the full set of MHD equations, including the subtle dissipative terms that are critical to the dynamics of the system. Our results establish sparse regression as a practical tool for uncovering fundamental physical laws from complex, high-dimensional data without assumptions on the underlying symmetry or the form of any governing equation.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Expertise of Large Language Models in Materials Science and Metallurgical Engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The integration of artificial intelligence into various domains is rapidly increasing, with Large Language Models (LLMs) becoming more prevalent in numerous applications. This work is included in an overall project which aims to train an LLM specifically in the field of materials science. To assess the impact of this specialized training, it is essential to establish the baseline performance of existing LLMs in materials science. In this study, we evaluated 15 different LLMs using the MaScQA question answering (Q&amp;A) benchmark. This benchmark comprises questions from the Graduate Aptitude Test in Engineering (GATE), tailored to test models' capabilities in answering questions related to materials science and metallurgical engineering. Our results indicate that closed-source LLMs, such as Claude-3.5-Sonnet and GPT-4, perform the best with an overall accuracy of ~84%, while the open-source models, Llama3-70b and Phi3-14b, top at ~56% and ~43%, respectively. These findings provide a baseline for the raw capabilities of LLMs on Q&amp;A tasks applied to materials science, and emphasize the substantial improvement that could be brought to open-source models via prompt engineering and fine-tuning strategies. We anticipate that this work could push the adoption of LLMs as valuable assistants in materials science, demonstrating their utility in this specialized domain and related sub-domains.</description>

      <title>Red blood cell partitioning and segregation through vascular bifurcations in a model of sickle cell disease</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04017v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The impact of cell segregation and margination in blood disorders on microcirculatory hemodynamics within bifurcated vessels are physiologically significant, yet poorly understood. This study presents a comprehensive computational investigation of red blood cell (RBC) suspension dynamics, with a focus on a model of sickle cell disease (SCD) as an example of a disorder associated with subpopulations of aberrant RBCs. The findings reveal how cell margination influences cellular partitioning and distributions as well as vessel wall shear stress (WSS) at vascular bifurcations. Normal RBCs, which migrate toward the channel center, exhibit the Zweifach-Fung effect, preferentially entering high-flow-rate branches. In contrast, sickle cells, which marginate near the vessel wall, demonstrate an anti-Zweifach-Fung effect, favoring lower-flow-rate branches due to their position within the cell-free layer (CFL). The upstream segregation of cells remains downstream through the bifurcation, where sickle cells accumulate along the outer branch walls. This accumulation of sickle cells increases the frequency of high WSS events via direct physical interactions, particularly on the outer side of high-velocity branches, potentially contributing to the vascular damage and endothelial disruption observed in many disorders that affect RBCs. In geometrically asymmetric bifurcations, cells preferentially enter branches with larger radii, underscoring the influence of geometric complexity on microcirculatory blood flow. These findings provide insights into microvascular hemodynamics in SCD and other blood disorders.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional DtN-FEM scattering analysis of Lamb and SH guided waves by a symmetric cavity defect in an isotropic infinite plate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04039v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, a three-dimensional Dirichlet-to-Neumann (DtN) finite element method (FEM) is developed to analyze the scattering of Lamb and SH guided waves due to a symmetric cavity defect in an isotropic infinite plate. During the finite element analysis, it is necessary to determine the far-field DtN conditions at virtual boundaries where both displacements and tractions are unknown. In this study, firstly, the scattered waves at the virtual boundaries are represented by a superposition of guided waves with unknown scattered coefficients. Secondly, utilizing the mode orthogonality, the unknown tractions at virtual boundaries are expressed in terms of the unknown scattered displacements at virtual boundaries via scattered coefficients. Thirdly, this relationship at virtual boundaries can be finally assembled into the global DtN-FEM matrix to solve the problem. This method is simple and elegant, which has advantages on dimension reduction and needs no absorption medium or perfectly matched layer to suppress the reflected waves compared to traditional FEM. Furthermore, the reflection and transmission coefficients of each guided mode can be directly obtained without post-processing. This proposed 3D DtN-FEM will be compared with boundary element method (BEM) and finally validated for several benchmark problems.</description>

      <title>Automatic partitioning for the low-rank integration of stochastic Boolean reaction networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04157v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Boolean reaction networks are an important tool in biochemistry for studying mechanisms in the biological cell. However, the stochastic formulation of such networks requires the solution of a master equation which inherently suffers from the curse of dimensionality. In the past, the dynamical low-rank (DLR) approximation has been repeatedly used to solve high-dimensional reaction networks by separating the network into smaller partitions. However, the partitioning of these networks was so far only done by hand. In this paper, we present a heuristic, automatic partitioning scheme based on two ingredients: the Kernighan-Lin algorithm and information entropy. Our approach is computationally inexpensive and can be easily incorporated as a preprocessing step into the existing simulation workflow. We test our scheme by partitioning Boolean reaction networks on a single level and also in a hierarchical fashion with tree tensor networks. The resulting accuracy of the scheme is superior to both partitionings chosen by human experts and those found by simply minimizing the number of reaction pathways between partitions.</description>

      <title>Anomalous Reversal of Stability in Mo-containing Oxides: A Difficult Case Exhibiting Sensitivity to DFT+U and Distortion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04434v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate predictions of the properties of transition metal oxides using density functional theory (DFT) calculations are essential for the computational design of energy materials. In this work, we investigate the anomalous reversal of the stability of structural distortions (where distorted structures go from being energetically favorable to sharply unfavorable relative to undistorted ones) induced by DFT+U on Mo d-orbitals in layered AMoO$_2$ (A = Li, Na, K) and rutile-like MoO$_2$. We highlight the significant impact of varying U$_{\text{eff}}$ values on the structural stability, convex hull, and thermodynamic stability predictions, noting that deviations can reach up to the order of 100 meV/atom across these energetic quantities. We find the transitions in stability are coincident with changes in the electron localization and magnetic behavior. The anomalous reversal persists across PBE, r$^2$SCAN functionals, and also with vdW-dispersion energy corrections (PBE+D3). In Mo-containing oxide systems, high U$_{\text{eff}}$ leads to inaccurate descriptions of physical quantities and structural relaxations under artificial symmetry constraints, as demonstrated by the phonon band structures, the Heyd-Scuseria-Ernzerhof (HSE06) hybrid functional results, and comparisons with experimental structural data. We conclude that high U$_{\text{eff}}$ values (around 4 eV and above, depending on the specific structures and compositions) might be unsuitable for energetic predictions in A-Mo-O chemical spaces. Our results suggest that the common practice of applying DFT+U to convex hull constructions, especially with high U$_{\text{eff}}$ values derived from fittings, should be carefully evaluated to ensure that ground states are correctly reproduced, with careful consideration of dynamic stability and possible energetically favorable distortions.</description>

      <title>A numerical toy model of Langevin dynamics provides real-time visualization of colloidal microdroplet evaporation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04456v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have developed and tested a simplified but versatile numerical model of nanoparticles' aggregation using Langevin dynamics. The model is particularly capable of simulating aggregation in an evaporating (or condensing) microdroplet. It runs on a graphics processing unit (GPU), which makes it sufficiently fast for real-time conceptualization tasks. We have verified the results of modeling against the findings from two types of experiments we conducted in electrodynamic traps. Firstly, our model helped us to elucidate the phenomenon of scattering `revival', often observed during the evaporation of composite microdroplets. Further on, we were able to mimic our experiments, in which the microdroplets were dried up to form nanoparticle (NP) aggregates, and then soft-landed. Thus we could compare model predictions with SEM imaging. The model was tested for up to $2.5\times 10^5$ nanoparticles of several coexisting types. Several types of interactions can be accounted for: inter-particle: Lennard-Jones and Coulomb; external: dispersion medium viscosity, centrifugal force, gravity, surface tension, and interface movement. Brownian motion of nanoparticles can be freely controlled. The core program is accompanied by scripts extracting statistical NP aggregates properties in post-processing -- fractal dimension and radial distribution functions. The codes are made available in public repositories. Several diverse evolution scenarios are presented.</description>

      <title>Efficient Online Quantum Circuit Learning with No Upfront Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04636v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a surrogate-based method for optimizing parameterized quantum circuits which is designed to operate with few calls to a quantum computer. We employ a computationally inexpensive classical surrogate to approximate the cost function of a variational quantum algorithm. An initial surrogate is fit to data obtained by sparse sampling of the true cost function using noisy quantum computers. The surrogate is iteratively refined by querying the true cost at the surrogate optima, then using radial basis function interpolation with existing and new true cost data. The use of radial basis function interpolation enables surrogate construction without hyperparameters to pre-train. Additionally, using the surrogate as an acquisition function focuses hardware queries in the vicinity of the true optima. For 16-qubit random 3-regular Max-Cut problems solved using the QAOA ansatz, we find that our method outperforms the prior state of the art. Furthermore, we demonstrate successful optimization of QAOA circuits for 127-qubit random Ising models on an IBM quantum processor using measurement counts of the order of $10^4-10^5$. The strong empirical performance of this approach is an important step towards the large-scale practical application of variational quantum algorithms and a clear demonstration of the effectiveness of classical-surrogate-based learning approaches.</description>

      <title>A Novel Highly Parallelizable Machine-Learning Based Method for the Fast Solution of Integral Equations for Electromagnetic Scattering Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04684v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel method for the efficient and accurate iterative solution of frequency domain integral equations (IEs) that are used for large/multi-scale electromagnetic scattering problems. The proposed method uses a novel group-by-group interaction strategy to accurately evaluate far-zone interactions within the framework of the one-box-buffer scheme during the matrix-vector multiplication at each iteration. Briefly, subdomain basis functions that are used to model the scatterer at each box are represented by a fixed number of uniformly distributed and arbitrarily oriented Hertzian dipoles (referred to as uniform basis functions), and then the dipole-to-dipole interactions are predicted in a group-wise manner by employing machine learning algorithms, thereby showcasing efficiency, strong scalability for parallelization and accuracy without the low-frequency breakdown (LFB) problem. Since the dipole representation is independent of the underlying material properties of the scatterer, the proposed method is valid for all types of IEs (surface or volume). Moreover, because the training is performed offline, the resulting networks can be used for any scatterer under any IE, without extra training, as long as the size of, and the distances among the boxes are preserved. The efficiency and accuracy of the proposed method are assessed by comparing our results with those obtained from the conventional multilevel fast multipole algorithm for various scattering problems. The proposed method's parallelization performance is showcased through scalability tests, and its resilience to LFB is demonstrated.</description>

      <title>Non-Markovian dynamics of BIC generation via single-photon scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04691v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The excitation of bound states in the continuum (BICs) in two- or multi-qubit systems lies at the heart of entanglement generation and harnessing in waveguide quantum electrodynamics platforms. However, the generation of qubit pair BICs through single-photon scattering is hindered by the fact that these states are effectively decoupled from propagating photons. We prove that scattering of a parity-invariant single photon on a qubit pair, combined with a properly engineered time variation of the qubit detuning, is not only feasible, but also more effective than strategies based on the relaxation of the excited states of the qubits. The use of tensor network methods to simulate the proposed scheme enables to include photon delays in collision models, thus opening the possibility to follow the time evolution of the full quantum system, including qubits and field, and to efficiently implement and characterize the dynamics in non-ideal cases, which turn out to be optimal for the BIC generation strategy.</description>

      <title>Classifying acoustic cavitation with machine learning trained on multiple physical models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16142v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Acoustic cavitation threshold charts are used to map between acoustic parameters (mainly intensity and frequency) and different regimes of acoustic cavitation. The two main regimes are transient cavitation, where a bubble collapses, and stable cavitation, where a bubble undergoes periodic oscillations without collapse. The cavitation charts strongly depend on the physical model used to compute the bubble dynamics and the algorithm for classifying the cavitation threshold. The differences between modeling approaches become especially noticeable for resonant bubbles and when sonication parameters result in large-amplitude oscillations. This paper proposes a machine learning approach that integrates three physical models, i.e., the Rayleigh-Plesset, Keller-Miksis and Gilmore equations, and multiple cavitation classification techniques. Specifically, we classify the cavitation regimes based on the maximum radius, the acoustic Mach number, the kurtosis factor of acoustic emissions, and the Flynn criterion on the inertial and pressure functions. Four machine learning strategies were developed to predict the likelihood of the transient and stable cavitation, using equally weighted contributions from classification techniques. By solving the differential equations for bubble dynamics across a range of sonication and material parameters and applying cross-validation on held-out test data, our framework demonstrates high predictive accuracy for cavitation regimes. This physics-informed machine-learning approach offers probabilistic insights into cavitation likelihood, combining diverse physical models and classification strategies, each contributing different levels of physical rigor and interpretability.</description>

Abstract: Numerical modeling of fermionic many-body quantum systems presents similar challenges across various research domains, necessitating universal tools, including state-of-the-art machine learning techniques. Here, we introduce SOLAX, a Python library designed to compute and analyze fermionic quantum systems using the formalism of second quantization. SOLAX provides a modular framework for constructing and manipulating basis sets, quantum states, and operators, facilitating the simulation of electronic structures and determining many-body quantum states in finite-size Hilbert spaces. The library integrates machine learning capabilities to mitigate the exponential growth of Hilbert space dimensions in large quantum clusters. The core low-level functionalities are implemented using the recently developed Python library JAX. Demonstrated through its application to the Single Impurity Anderson Model, SOLAX offers a flexible and powerful tool for researchers addressing the challenges of many-body quantum systems across a broad spectrum of fields, including atomic physics, quantum chemistry, and condensed matter physics.</description>

      <title>A Sinking Approach to Explore Arbitrary Areas in Free Energy Landscapes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09385v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To address the time-scale limitations in molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, numerous enhanced sampling methods have been developed to expedite the exploration of complex free energy landscapes. A commonly employed approach accelerates the sampling of degrees of freedom associated with pre-defined collective variables (CVs), which typically tends to traverse the entire CV range. However, in many scenarios, the focus of interest is on specific regions within the CV space. This paper introduces a novel "sinking" approach that enables enhanced sampling of arbitrary areas within the CV space. We begin by proposing a gridded convolutional approximation that productively replicates the effects of metadynamics, a powerful CV-based enhanced sampling technique. Building on this, we present the SinkMeta method, which "sinks" the interior bias potential to create restraining potential "cliffs" at the grid edges. This technique can confine the exploration of CVs in MD simulations to a preset area. Our experimental results demonstrate that SinkMeta requires minimal sampling steps to estimate the free energy landscape for CV subspaces of various shapes and dimensions, including irregular two-dimensional regions and one-dimensional pathways between metastable states. We believe that SinkMeta will pioneer a new paradigm for sampling partial phase spaces, especially offering an efficient and flexible solution for sampling minimum free energy paths in high-dimensional spaces.</description>

Abstract: This paper studies inverse problems in quantitative photoacoustic tomography with additional optical current data supplemented from diffuse optical tomography. We propose a three-stage image reconstruction method for the simultaneous recovery of the absorption, diffusion, and Gr\"uneisen coefficients. We demonstrate, through numerical simulations, that: (i) when the Gr\"uneisen coefficient is known, the addition of the optical measurements allows a more accurate reconstruction of the scattering and absorption coefficients; and (ii) when the Gr\"uneisen coefficient is not known, the addition of optical current measurements allows us to reconstruct uniquely the Gr\"uneisen, the scattering and absorption coefficients. Numerical simulations based on synthetic data are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed idea.</description>

      <title>CrystalFlow: A Flow-Based Generative Model for Crystalline Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11693</link>

Abstract: Deep learning-based generative models have emerged as powerful tools for modeling complex data distributions and generating high-fidelity samples, offering a transformative approach to efficiently explore the configuration space of crystalline materials. In this work, we present CrystalFlow, a flow-based generative model specifically developed for the generation of crystalline materials. CrystalFlow constructs Continuous Normalizing Flows to model lattice parameters, atomic coordinates, and/or atom types, which are trained using Conditional Flow Matching techniques. Through an appropriate choice of data representation and the integration of a graph-based equivariant neural network, the model effectively captures the fundamental symmetries of crystalline materials, which ensures data-efficient learning and enables high-quality sampling. Our experiments demonstrate that CrystalFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance across standard generation benchmarks, and exhibits versatile conditional generation capabilities including producing structures optimized for specific external pressures or desired material properties. These features highlight the model's potential to address realistic crystal structure prediction challenges, offering a robust and efficient framework for advancing data-driven research in condensed matter physics and material science.</description>

      <title>N\'eel vector-dependent anomalous transport in altermagnetic metal CrSb</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12882v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Altermagnetism is a recently proposed class of collinear magnetism that combines the characteristics of both ferromagnetism and antiferromagnetism. Altermagnets are predicted to exhibit anomalous transport phenomena, such as the anomalous Hall and Nernst effects, as observed in ferromagnets but with a vanishing net magnetic moment, akin to antiferromagnets. Despite the promising potential of altermagnetic materials for realizing these unique transport properties, progress has been limited due to the scarcity of metallic altermagnets. Motivated by the recent discovery of the altermagnetic metal CrSb, we conducted a systematic study of its electrical and thermoelectric transport properties, including the anomalous Hall and Nernst effects, using first-principles calculations. Our findings indicate that CrSb exhibits low magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy, allowing for the manipulation of the N\'eel vector through an external electric field. We explored the anomalous Hall and Nernst conductivities as functions of the N\'eel vector orientation, finding that both effects reach their maximum when the N\'eel vector is aligned along $\frac{1}{2}$\textbf{\textit{a}}+\textbf{\textit{b}}. The origins of both conductivities were analyzed in terms of Berry curvature distribution in the Brillouin zone. Our results illustrate the N\'eel vector-dependent anomalous Hall and Nernst effects in an altermagnetic metal, offering an additional metallic altermagnetic platform to investigate anomalous transport properties, thereby complementing the widely studied RuO$_2$.</description>
