      <title>Wafer-scale Integration of Single-Crystalline MoS$_2$ for Flexible Electronics Enabled by Oxide Dry-transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Atomically thin, single-crystalline transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) grown via chemical vapor deposition (CVD) on sapphire substrates exhibit exceptional mechanical and electrical properties, positioning them as excellent channel materials for flexible electronics. However, conventional wet-transfer processes for integrating these materials onto flexible substrates often introduce surface contamination, significantly degrading device performance. Here, we present a wafer-scale dry-transfer technique using a high-dielectric oxide as the transfer medium, enabling the integration of 4-inch single-crystalline MoS$_2$ onto flexible substrates. This method eliminates contact with polymers or solvents, thus preserving the intrinsic electronic properties of MoS$_2$. As a result, the fabricated flexible field-effect transistor (FET) arrays exhibit remarkable performance, with a mobility of 117 cm$^2$/Vs, a subthreshold swing of 68.8 mV dec$^{-1}$, and an ultra-high current on/off ratio of $10^{12}$-values comparable to those achieved on rigid substrates. Leveraging the outstanding electrical characteristics, we demonstrated MoS$_2$-based flexible inverters operating in the subthreshold regime, achieving both a high gain of 218 and ultra-low power consumption of 1.4 pW/$\mu$m. Additionally, we integrated a flexible tactile sensing system driven by active-matrix MoS$_2$ FET arrays onto a robotic gripper, enabling real-time object identification. These findings demonstrate the simultaneous achievement of high electrical performance and flexibility, highlighting the immense potential of single-crystalline TMDC-based flexible electronics for real-world applications.</description>

      <title>Comprehensive Analog Signal Processing Platform Enabled with Acoustic Charge Transport in Two-dimensional Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14213v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional Acoustic Charge Transport (2D-ACT) devices, which integrate two dimensional semiconductor EFT with high-frequency surface acoustic wave (SAW) device provide a potential compact platform for the processing of analog signals in a wireless, non-contact, low-loss and real-time way. It is expected to be used in long distance space communication and sensing. However, current investigations into 2D ACT devices are still limited to the observation of DC acoustoelectric currents, and have yet to achieve real-time electronic signal processing capabilities. In this paper, we have designed a hybrid acoustoelectric platform composed of two-dimensional semiconductor EFT and SAW device. The platform is capable of processing DC signals, exhibiting ambipolar transport behavior. The sub-wavelength channel length of the FET within the platform allows for the real-time observation of carrier distribution at a microscopic scale in conjunction with the SAW potential, and facilitating the reproduction and intensity regulation of AC signals. By adjusting the relative phase and intensity ratio of two counter-propagating SAWs, the platform also enables the addition and subtraction of AC signals.</description>

      <title>Isolation of Pu-isotopes from environmental samples using ion chromatography for accelerator mass spectrometry and alpha spectrometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13995v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A radiochemical method for the isolation of plutonium isotopes from environmental samples, based on the use of specific chromatography resins for actinides (TEVA, Eichrom Industries), has been set up in our laboratory and optimised for their posterior determination by alpha spectrometry (AS) or accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS). The proposed radiochemical method has replaced in our lab a well established one based on the use of a relatively un-specific anion-exchange resin (AG1X8, Biorad), because it is clearly less time consuming, reduces the amounts and molarities of acid wastes produced, and reproducibly gives high radiochemical yields.
  In order to check the reliability of the proposed radiochemical method for the determination of plutonium isotopes in different environmental matrixes, twin aliquots of a set of samples were prepared with TEVA and with AG 1X8 resins and measured by AS. Some samples prepared with TEVA resins were measured as well by AMS. As it is shown in the text, there is a comfortable agreement between AS and AMS, which adequately validates the method.</description>

      <title>Self-configuring high-speed multi-plane light conversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14129v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-plane light converters (MPLCs) - also known as linear diffractive neural networks - are an emerging optical technology, capable of converting an orthogonal set of optical fields into any other orthogonal set via a unitary transformation. MPLC design is a non-linear problem typically solved by optimising a digital model of the optical system. However, inherently high levels of design complexity mean that even a minor mismatch between this digital model and the physically realised MPLC leads to a severe reduction in real-world performance. Here we address this challenge by creating a self-configuring free-space MPLC. Despite the large number of parameters to be optimised (typically tens of thousands or more), our proof-of-principle device converges in minutes using a method in which light only needs to be transmitted in one direction through the MPLC. Two innovations make this possible. Firstly, we devise an in-situ optimisation algorithm combining wavefront shaping with the principles of wavefront matching that would conventionally be used to inverse-design MPLCs offline in simulation. Secondly, we introduce a new MPLC platform incorporating a microelectromechanical system (MEMS) phase-only light modulator - allowing rapid MPLC switching at up to kiloHertz rates. Our scheme automatically accounts for the physical characteristics of all system components and absorbs any unknown misalignments and aberrations into the final design. We demonstrate self-configured MPLCs capable of mapping random orthogonal speckle input fields to well-defined Laguerre-Gaussian and Hermite-Gaussian output modes, as well as universal mode sorters. Our work paves the way towards large-scale ultra-high-fidelity fast-switching MPLCs and diffractive neural networks, which promises to unlock new applications in areas ranging from optical communications to optical computing and imaging.</description>

      <title>An Inverse Design Wavelength Demultiplexer for On-Chip Photoluminescence Sorting in TMDC Heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14261v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Emerging two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) offer a promising platform for on-chip integrated photonics because of their unique optical and electronic properties. Their naturally passivated surfaces make them highly tolerant to lattice mismatch, enabling seamless heterogeneous integration by stacking different van der Waals materials, a crucial step in the development of advanced photonic devices. Here, we demonstrate the use of an inverse design wavelength demultiplexing waveguides for on-chip sorting and routing of distinct photoluminescence from the heterojunction formed by WS2 and WSe2 monolayers. The integrated nanophotonic chip splits and sorts excitonic emission into individual waveguides at room temperature. Our demonstration opens up new perspectives for integrating light sources in van der Waals materials with functional integrated photonics, offering a versatile platform for both fundamental research and practical applications.</description>

      <title>Snapshot multi-spectral imaging through defocusing and a Fourier imager network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14287v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-spectral imaging, which simultaneously captures the spatial and spectral information of a scene, is widely used across diverse fields, including remote sensing, biomedical imaging, and agricultural monitoring. Here, we introduce a snapshot multi-spectral imaging approach employing a standard monochrome image sensor with no additional spectral filters or customized components. Our system leverages the inherent chromatic aberration of wavelength-dependent defocusing as a natural source of physical encoding of multi-spectral information; this encoded image information is rapidly decoded via a deep learning-based multi-spectral Fourier Imager Network (mFIN). We experimentally tested our method with six illumination bands and demonstrated an overall accuracy of 92.98% for predicting the illumination channels at the input and achieved a robust multi-spectral image reconstruction on various test objects. This deep learning-powered framework achieves high-quality multi-spectral image reconstruction using snapshot image acquisition with a monochrome image sensor and could be useful for applications in biomedicine, industrial quality control, and agriculture, among others.</description>

      <title>A high-resolution discourse on seismic tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14301v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Advances in data acquisition and numerical wave simulation have improved tomographic imaging techniques and results, but non-experts may find it difficult to understand which model is best for their needs. This paper is intended for these users. We argue that our notion of best is influenced by the extent to which models satisfy our biases. We explain how the basic types of seismic waves see Earth structure, illustrate the essential strategy of seismic tomography, discuss advanced adaptations such as full-waveform inversion, and emphasize the artistic components of tomography. The compounding effect of a plethora of reasonable, yet subjective choices is a range of models that differ more than their individual uncertainty analyses may suggest. Perhaps counter-intuitively, we argue producing similar tomographic models should not be the goal of seismic tomography. Instead, we promote a Community Monte Carlo effort to assemble a range of dissimilar models based on different modeling approaches and subjective choices, but which explain the seismic data. This effort could serve as input for geodynamic inferences with meaningful seismic uncertainties.</description>

      <title>Additive Manufacturing Processes Protocol Prediction by Artificial Intelligence using X-ray Computed Tomography data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14306v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The quality of the part fabricated from the Additive Manufacturing (AM) process depends upon the process parameters used, and therefore, optimization is required for apt quality. A methodology is proposed to set these parameters non-iteratively without human intervention. It utilizes Artificial Intelligence (AI) to fully automate the process, with the capability to self-train any apt AI model by further assimilating the training data.This study includes three commercially available 3D printers for soft material printing based on the Material Extrusion (MEX) AM process. The samples are 3D printed for six different AM process parameters obtained by varying layer height and nozzle speed. The novelty part of the methodology is incorporating an AI-based image segmentation step in the decision-making stage that uses quality inspected training data from the Non-Destructive Testing (NDT) method. The performance of the trained AI model is compared with the two software tools based on the classical thresholding method. The AI-based Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model is trained from NDT-assessed and AI-segmented data to automate the selection of optimized process parameters. The AI-based model is 99.3 % accurate, while the best available commercial classical image method is 83.44 % accurate. The best value of overall R for training ANN is 0.82. The MEX process gives a 22.06 % porosity error relative to the design. The NDT-data trained two AI models integrated into a series pipeline for optimal process parameters are proposed and verified by classical optimization and mechanical testing methods.</description>

      <title>Natural and Intrinsic Vacancies in two-dimensional g-C$_3$N$_4$ for Trapping Isolated B and C Atoms as Color Centers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14318v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Color centers are vital for quantum information processing, but traditional ones often suffer from instability, difficulty in realization, and precise control of locations. In contrast, natural intrinsic vacancy-based color centers in two-dimensional systems offer enhanced stability and tunability. In this work, we demonstrate that g-C$_3$N$_4$ with natural intrinsic vacancies is highly suitable for trapping B/C atoms to form stable color centers as qubits. With easily identifiable vacancies, B/C atoms are expectable to be placed at the vacancy sites in g-C$_3$N$_4$ through STM manipulation. The vacancy sites are confirmed as the most stable adsorption positions, and once atoms are adsorbed, they are protected by diffusion barriers from thermal diffusions. The most stable charge states are C$_V^{+2}$/B$_V^{+2}$, C$_V^{+1}$/B$_V^{+1}$, and C$_V^0$/B$_V^0$ in turn, with charge transition levels of 0.39 eV and 2.49 eV, respectively. Specifically, the defect levels and net spin of C$_V$/B$_V$ can be adjusted by charge states. C$_V$, C$_V^{+1}$, C$_V^{+2}$, B$_V^{+1}$, and B$_V^{+2}$ exhibit optically allowable defect transition levels. The zero-phonon lines suggest fluorescence wavelengths fall within the mid-infrared band, ideal for qubit operations of stable initialization and readout. Furthermore, the Zero-field splitting (ZFS) parameter and the characteristic hyperfine tensor are provided as potential fingerprints for electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) experiments.</description>

      <title>Crowding Effects during DNA Translocation in Nanopipettes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14347v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quartz nanopipettes are an important emerging class of electric single-molecule sensors for DNA, proteins, their complexes as well as other biomolecular targets. However, in comparison to other resistive pulse sensors, nanopipettes constitute a highly asymmetric environment and the transport of ions and biopolymers can become strongly direction-dependent. For double-stranded DNA, this can include the characteristic translocation time and its tertiary structure, but as we show here, nanoconfinement can not only lead to unexplored features in the transport characteristics of the sensor, but also unlock new capabilities for biophysical and bioanalytical studies at the single-molecule level. To this end, we show how the accummulation of DNA inside the nanochannel leads to crowding effects, and in some cases reversible blocking of DNA entry, and provide a detailed analysis based on a range of different DNA samples and experimental conditions. Moreover, using biotin-functionalised DNA and streptavidin-modified gold nanoparticles as target, we demonstrate in a proof-of-concept study how the crowding effect, and the resulting increased residence time in nanochannel, can be exploited in a new analytical paradigm, involving DNA injection into the nanochannel, incubation with the nanoparticle target and analysis of the complex by reverse translocation. We thereby integrate elements of sample processing and detection into the nanopipette, as an important conceptual advance, and make a case for the wider applicability of this device concept.</description>

      <title>On Measures in Ion Trap Quantum Information</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.14359v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate quantum information measures in ion traps by utilizing the harmonic oscillator model to characterize trapped potentials and ion dynamics. Our findings confirm that, in the steady-state case, mutual information and synchronization measures exhibit similar behaviors. Additionally, we explore how these measures change in the quench model and how they are influenced by coupling and external noise, such as an external magnetic field. Moreover, for a proposed target ground state, we determine the circuit depth and analyze the effects of the external magnetic field and coupling constant, highlighting their dynamic evolution over time. We also discuss the coherent state of a single ion in a trap, noting an inverse relationship between complexity and fidelity-where increased fidelity corresponds to decreased system complexity, indicating a more ordered state with improved control and optimization. However, at higher system frequencies, complexity increases due to intricate interactions and rapid state changes, necessitating advanced control mechanisms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.14468v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The excellent mechanical properties make graphene promising for realizing nanomechanical resonators with high resonant frequencies, large quality factors, strong nonlinearities, and the capability to effectively interface with various physical systems. Equipped with gate electrodes, it has been demonstrated that these exceptional device properties can be electrically manipulated, leading to a variety of nanomechanical/acoustic applications. Here, we review the recent progress of graphene nanomechanical resonators with a focus on their electrical tunability. First, we provide an overview of different graphene nanomechanical resonators, including their device structures, fabrication methods, and measurement setups. Then, the key mechanical properties of these devices, for example, resonant frequencies, nonlinearities, dissipations, and mode coupling mechanisms, are discussed, with their behaviors upon electrical gating being highlighted. After that, various potential classical/quantum applications based on these graphene nanomechanical resonators are reviewed. Finally, we briefly discuss challenges and opportunities in this field to offer future prospects of the ongoing studies on graphene nanomechanical resonators.</description>

      <title>Design of Silicon Slab Waveguides based all-optical Logic Gates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14572v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Logic gates are an indispensable part of digital circuits, and therefore such devices with fast operating speeds and simple designs are vital for all kinds of electronic applications. This paper proposes simple Y-shaped designs of all-optical AND, OR, and NOT logic gates in two dimensions that are operational in both TE and TM modes. These gates are designed using silicon slab waveguides, which makes them relatively easy to fabricate. The logic gates are designed, analyzed, and optimized at 1.55 $\mu$m using the finite difference time domain method. The truth table of the proposed all-optical logic gates is realized for every input case. The propagation delay time is determined to be of the order of femtoseconds ($10^{-15}$ s), which is very fast compared to the response time of the currently existing all-optical logic gates ($10^{-9}$ s - $10^{-12}$ s).</description>

Abstract: The non-Hermitian skin effect is an intriguing physical phenomenon, in which all eigen-modes of a non-Hermitian lattice become localized at boundary regions. While such an exotic behavior has been demonstrated in various physical platforms, most realizations have been so far restricted to the linear regime. Here, we explore the cooperation between nonlinearity and the non-Hermitian skin effect, revealing extraordinary amplitude-driven skin localization dynamics. By introducing an extension to the Hatano-Nelson model where couplings inherent nonlinear behavior, we demonstrate the existence of unique amplitude-driven non-Hermitian skin modes capable of concentrating the energy of a source at any point of space, depending on the power level. Our theoretical model is supported by numerical simulations and experimental realization via a highly configurable acoustic metamaterial composed of active electroacoustic resonators. In all, our findings open up exciting paths for a new generation of non-reciprocal systems, in which nonlinearities serve as a strategic tuning knob to manipulate the guiding process.</description>

      <title>Waste Heat and Habitability: Constraints from Technological Energy Consumption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06737</link>

Abstract: Waste heat production represents an inevitable consequence of energy conversion as per the laws of thermodynamics. Based on this fact, by using simple theoretical models, we analyze constraints on the habitability of Earth-like terrestrial planets hosting putative technological species and technospheres characterized by persistent exponential growth of energy consumption and waste heat generation. In particular, we quantify the deleterious effects of rising surface temperature on biospheric processes and the eventual loss of liquid water. Irrespective of whether these sources of energy are ultimately stellar or planetary (e.g., nuclear, fossil fuels) in nature, we demonstrate that the loss of habitable conditions on such terrestrial planets may be expected to occur on timescales of $\lesssim 1000$ years, as measured from the start of the exponential phase, provided that the annual growth rate of energy consumption is of order $1\%$. We conclude with a discussion of the types of evolutionary trajectories that might be feasible for industrialized technological species, and we sketch the ensuing implications for technosignature searches.</description>
