      <title>Rationally warranted promise: the virtue-economic account of pursuit-worthiness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pursuing a scientific idea is often justified by the promise associated with it. Philosophers of science have proposed a variety of approaches to such promise, including more specific indicators. Economic models in particular emphasise the trade-off between an idea's benefits and its costs. Taking up this Peirce-inspired idea, we spell out the metaphor of such a cost-benefit analysis of scientific ideas. We show that it fruitfully urges a set of salient meta-methodological questions that accounts of scientific pursuit-worthiness ought to address. In line with such a meta-methodological framework, we articulate and explore an appealing and auspicious concretisation -- what we shall dub "the virtue-economic account of pursuit-worthiness": cognitive benefits and costs of an idea, we suggest, should be characterised in terms of an idea's theoretical virtues, such as empirical adequacy, explanatory power, or coherence. Assessments of pursuit-worthiness are deliberative judgements in which scientifically competent evaluators weigh and compare the prospects of such virtues, subject to certain rationality constraints that ensure historical and contemporary scientific circumspection, coherence and systematicity. The virtue-economic account, we show, sheds new light on the normativity of scientific pursuit, methodological pluralism in science, and the rationality of historical science.</description>

      <title>Large Physics Models: Towards a collaborative approach with Large Language Models and Foundation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05382v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper explores ideas and provides a potential roadmap for the development and evaluation of physics-specific large-scale AI models, which we call Large Physics Models (LPMs). These models, based on foundation models such as Large Language Models (LLMs) - trained on broad data - are tailored to address the demands of physics research. LPMs can function independently or as part of an integrated framework. This framework can incorporate specialized tools, including symbolic reasoning modules for mathematical manipulations, frameworks to analyse specific experimental and simulated data, and mechanisms for synthesizing theories and scientific literature. We begin by examining whether the physics community should actively develop and refine dedicated models, rather than relying solely on commercial LLMs. We then outline how LPMs can be realized through interdisciplinary collaboration among experts in physics, computer science, and philosophy of science. To integrate these models effectively, we identify three key pillars: Development, Evaluation, and Philosophical Reflection. Development focuses on constructing models capable of processing physics texts, mathematical formulations, and diverse physical data. Evaluation assesses accuracy and reliability by testing and benchmarking. Finally, Philosophical Reflection encompasses the analysis of broader implications of LLMs in physics, including their potential to generate new scientific understanding and what novel collaboration dynamics might arise in research. Inspired by the organizational structure of experimental collaborations in particle physics, we propose a similarly interdisciplinary and collaborative approach to building and refining Large Physics Models. This roadmap provides specific objectives, defines pathways to achieve them, and identifies challenges that must be addressed to realise physics-specific large scale AI models.</description>

      <title>Observation as Physication. A single-world unitary no-conspiracy interpretation of quantum mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09669v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The physical meaning of the operators is not reducible to the intrinsic relations of the quantum system, since unitary transformations can find other operators satisfying the exact same relations. The physical meaning is determined empirically. I propose that the assignment of physical meaning to operators spreads through observation, along with the values of the observables, from the already observed degrees of freedom to the newly observed ones. I call this process "physication". I propose that quantum observations are nothing more than this assignment, which can be done unitarily. This approach doesn't require collapse, many-worlds, or a conspiratorial fine tuning of the initial conditions.</description>
