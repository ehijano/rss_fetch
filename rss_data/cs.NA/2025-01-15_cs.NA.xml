      <title>When is the Resolvent Like a Rank One Matrix?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07686v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a square matrix $A$, the resolvent of $A$ at a point $z \in \mathbb{C}$ is defined as $(A-zI )^{-1}$. We consider the set of points $z \in \mathbb{C}$ where the relative difference in 2-norm between the resolvent and the nearest rank one matrix is less than a given number $\epsilon \in (0,1)$. We establish a relationship between this set and the $\epsilon$-pseudospectrum of $A$, and we derive specific results about this set for Jordan blocks and for a class of large Toeplitz matrices. We also derive disks about the eigenvalues of $A$ that are contained in this set, and this leads to some new results on disks about the eigenvalues that are contained in the $\epsilon$-pseudospectrum of $A$. In addition, we consider the set of points $z \in \mathbb{C}$ where the absolute value of the inner product of the left and right singular vectors corresponding to the largest singular value of the resolvent is less than $\epsilon$. We demonstrate numerically that this set can be almost as large as the one where the relative difference between the resolvent and the nearest rank one matrix is less than $\epsilon$ and we give a partial explanation for this. Some possible applications are discussed.</description>

      <title>Convergence of Multi-Level Hybrid Monte Carlo Methods for 1-D Particle Transport Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07702v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present in this paper a hybrid, Multi-Level Monte Carlo (MLMC) method for solving the neutral particle transport equation. MLMC methods, originally developed to solve parametric integration problems, work by using a cheap, low fidelity solution as a base solution and then solves for additive correction factors on a sequence of computational grids. The proposed algorithm works by generating a scalar flux sample using a Hybrid Monte Carlo method based on the low-order Quasidiffusion equations. We generate an initial number of samples on each grid and then calculate the optimal number of samples to perform on each level using MLMC theory. Computational results are shown for a 1-D slab model to demonstrate the weak convergence of considered functionals. The analyzed functionals are integrals of the scalar flux solution over either the whole domain or over a specific subregion. We observe the variance of the correction factors decreases faster than increase in the cost of generating a MLMC sample grows. The variance and costs of the MLMC solution are driven by the coarse grid calculations. Therefore, we should be able to add additional computational levels at minimal cost since fewer samples would be needed to converge estimates of the correction factors on subsequent levels.</description>

      <title>A Low-Rank QTT-based Finite Element Method for Elasticity Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07778v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an efficient and robust numerical algorithm for solving the two-dimensional linear elasticity problem that combines the Quantized Tensor Train format and a domain partitioning strategy. This approach makes it possible to solve the linear elasticity problem on a computational domain that is more general than a square. Our method substantially decreases memory usage and achieves a notable reduction in rank compared to established Finite Element implementations like the FEniCS platform. This performance gain, however, requires a fundamental rethinking of how core finite element operations are implemented, which includes changes to mesh discretization, node and degree of freedom ordering, stiffness matrix and internal nodal force assembly, and the execution of algebraic matrix-vector operations. In this work, we discuss all these aspects in detail and assess the method's performance in the numerical approximation of three representative test cases.</description>

      <title>Effective algorithms for tensor train decomposition via the UTV framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07904v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The tensor train (TT) decomposition is used to compress large tensors into a more compact form by exploiting their inherent data structures. A fundamental approach for constructing the TT format is the TT-SVD, which extracts the TT-cores by the singular value decompositions (SVDs) sequentially. But in practical applications, it is often not necessary to compute full SVDs. In this article, we therefore propose a new method called the TT-UTV. It utilizes the virtues of rank-revealing UTV decomposition to compute the TT format for a large-scale tensor, hence requires less computational cost. We analyze the error bounds on the accuracy of these algorithms both in the URV and ULV cases, then recommend different sweep patterns for these two cases. We perform numerical experiments on some applications, including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data completion, to illustrate their good performance in practice.</description>

      <title>Using curved meshes to derive a priori error estimates for a linear elasticity problem with Robin boundary conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07914v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work concerns the numerical analysis of the linear elasticity problem with a Robin boundary condition on a smooth domain. A finite element discretization is presented using high-order curved meshes in order to accurately discretize the physical domain. The primary objective is to conduct a detailed error analysis for the elasticity problem using the vector lift operator, which maps vector-valued functions from the mesh domain to the physical domain. Error estimates are established, both in terms of the finite element approximation error and the geometric error, respectively associated to the finite element degree and to the mesh order. These theoretical a priori error estimates are validated by numerical experiments in 2D and 3D.</description>

      <title>Computing the $p$-Laplacian eigenpairs of signed graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07929v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As a nonlinear extension of the graph Laplacian, the graph $p$-Laplacian has various applications in many fields. Due to the nonlinearity, it is very difficult to compute the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of graph $p$-Laplacian. In this paper, we establish the equivalence between the graph $p$-Laplacian eigenproblem and the tensor eigenproblem when $p$ is even. Building on this result, algorithms designed for tensor eigenproblems can be adapted to compute the eigenpairs of the graph $p$-Laplacian. For general $p&gt;1$, we give a fast and convergent algorithm to compute the largest eigenvalue and the corresponding eigenfunction of the signless graph $p$-Laplacian. As an application, we provide a new criterion to determine when a graph is not a subgraph of another one, which outperforms existing criteria based on the linear Laplacian and adjacency matrices. Our work highlights the deep connections and numerous similarities between the spectral theories of tensors and graph $p$-Laplacians.</description>

      <title>Monotonicity and convergence of two-relaxation-times lattice Boltzmann schemes for a non-linear conservation law</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address the convergence analysis of lattice Boltzmann methods for scalar non-linear conservation laws, focusing on two-relaxation-times (TRT) schemes. Unlike Finite Difference/Finite Volume methods, lattice Boltzmann schemes offer exceptional computational efficiency and parallelization capabilities. However, their monotonicity and $L^{\infty}$-stability remain underexplored. Extending existing results on simpler BGK schemes, we derive conditions ensuring that TRT schemes are monotone and stable by leveraging their unique relaxation structure. Our analysis culminates in proving convergence of the numerical solution to the weak entropy solution of the conservation law. Compared to BGK schemes, TRT schemes achieve reduced numerical diffusion while retaining provable convergence. Numerical experiments validate and illustrate the theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>A semi-implicit exactly fully well-balanced relaxation scheme for the Shallow Water Linearized Moment Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07946v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When dealing with shallow water simulations, the velocity profile is often assumed to be constant along the vertical axis. However, since in many applications this is not the case, modeling errors can be significant. Hence, in this work, we deal with the Shallow Water Linearized Moment Equations (SWLME), in which the velocity is no longer constant in the vertical direction, where a polynomial expansion around the mean value is considered. The linearized version implies neglecting the non-linear terms of the basis coefficients in the higher order equations. As a result, the model is always hyperbolic and the stationary solutions can be more easily computed. Then, our objective is to propose an efficient, accurate and robust numerical scheme for the SWLME model, specially adapted for low Froude number situations. Hence, we describe a semi-implicit second order exactly fully well-balanced method. More specifically, a splitting is performed to separate acoustic and material phenomena. The acoustic waves are treated in an implicit manner to gain in efficiency when dealing with subsonic flow regimes, whereas the second order of accuracy is achieved thanks to a polynomial reconstruction and Strang-splitting method. We also exploit a reconstruction operator to achieve the fully well-balanced character of the method. Extensive numerical tests demonstrate the well-balanced properties and large speed-up compared to traditional methods.</description>

      <title>Rectangular polar quadrature in 1D and its error analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07962v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a one-dimensional analog of the Rectangular-Polar (RP) integration strategy and its convergence analysis for weakly singular convolution integrals. The key idea of this method is to break the whole integral into integral over non-overlapping patches (subdomains) and achieve convergence by increasing the number of patches while approximating the integral on patches accurately using a fixed number of quadrature points. The non-singular integrals are approximated to high-order using Fej\'er first quadrature, and a specialized integration strategy is designed and incorporated for singular integrals where the kernel singularity is resolved by mean of Polynomial Change of Variable (PCV). We prove that for high-order convergence, it is essential to compute integral weights accurately, and the method's convergence rate depends critically on the degree of the PCV and the singularity of the integral kernel. Specifically, for kernels of the form $|x-y|^{-\alpha}(\alpha&gt;-1)$, the method achieves high-order convergence if and only if $p(1-\alpha) \in \mathbb{N}$. This relationship highlights the importance of choosing an appropriate degree $p$ for the PCV. A new error estimate in a framework where convergence is achieved by reducing the approximating domain size while keeping the number of discretization points fixed is derived for the Fej\'er first quadrature, decay rate of Chebyshev coefficients, and the error in approximating continuous Chebyshev coefficients with discrete ones. Numerical experiments corroborate the theoretical findings, showcasing the effectiveness of the RP strategy for accurately solving singular integral equations. As an application of the method, numerical solutions of the surface scattering problem in the two dimensions are computed for complex domains, and the algorithm's efficacy is demonstrated for large-scale problems.</description>

      <title>BIAN: A boundary-informed Alone Neural Network for solving PDE-constrained Inverse Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08006v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the past years, inverse problems in partial differential equations have garnered increasing interest among scientists and engineers. However, due to the lack of conventional stability, nonlinearity and non-convexity, these problems are quite challenging and difficult to solve. In this work, we propose a new kind of neural network to solve the coefficient identification problems with only the boundary information. In this work, three networks has been utilized as an approximator, a generator and a discriminator, respectively. This method is particularly useful in scenarios where the coefficients of interest have a complicated structure or are difficult to represent with traditional models. Comparative analysis against traditional coefficient estimation techniques demonstrates the superiority of our approach, not only handling highdimensional data and complex coefficient distributions adeptly by incorporating neural networks but also eliminating the necessity for extensive internal information due to the relationship between the energy distribution within the domain to the energy flux on the boundary. Several numerical examples have been presented to substantiate the merits of this algorithm including solving the Poisson equation and Helmholtz equation with spatially varying and piecewise uniform medium.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.08166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel Asymptotic-Preserving Neural Network (APNN) approach utilizing even-odd decomposition to tackle the nonlinear gray radiative transfer equations (GRTEs). Our AP loss demonstrates consistent stability concerning the small Knudsen number, ensuring the neural network solution uniformly converges to the macro solution. This APNN method alleviates the rigorous conservation requirements while simultaneously incorporating an auxiliary deep neural network, distinguishing it from the APNN method based on micro-macro decomposition for GRTE. Several numerical problems are examined to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed APNN technique.</description>

      <title>A New Fick-Jacobs Derivation with Applications to Computational Branched Diffusion Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Fick-Jacobs equation is a classical model reduction of 3-dimensional diffusion in a tube of varying radius to a 1-dimensional problem with radially scaled derivatives. This model has been shown to be unstable when the radial gradient is too steep. In this work, we present a new derivation of the Fick-Jacobs equation that results in the addition of higher order spatial derivative terms that provide additional stability in a wide variety of cases and improved solution convergence. We also derive new numerical schemes for branched nodes within networks and provide stability conditions for these schemes. The computational accuracy, efficiency, and stability of our method is demonstrated through a variety of numerical examples.</description>

      <title>Coverage errors for Student's t confidence intervals comparable to those in Hall (1988)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07645v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Table 1 of Hall (1988) contains asymptotic coverage error formulas for some nonparametric approximate 95% confidence intervals for the mean based on $n$ IID samples. The table includes an entry for an interval based on the central limit theorem using Gaussian quantiles and the Gaussian maximum likelihood variance estimate. It is missing an entry for the very widely used Student $t$ confidence intervals. This note makes a mild numerical correction for the Gaussian entry and provides an entry for the Student $t$ intervals. For skewness $\gamma$ and kurtosis $\kappa$, the corrected Gaussian formula is $0.14\kappa -2.16\gamma^2-3.42$ and the formula for the $t$ intervals is $0.14\kappa -2.16\gamma^2$. The impetus to revisit this estimate arose from the surprisingly robust performance of Student's t statistic in randomized quasi-Monte Carlo sampling.</description>

      <title>An Adaptive Collocation Point Strategy For Physics Informed Neural Networks via the QR Discrete Empirical Interpolation Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07700v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have gained significant attention for solving forward and inverse problems related to partial differential equations (PDEs). While advancements in loss functions and network architectures have improved PINN accuracy, the impact of collocation point sampling on their performance remains underexplored. Fixed sampling methods, such as uniform random sampling and equispaced grids, can fail to capture critical regions with high solution gradients, limiting their effectiveness for complex PDEs. Adaptive methods, inspired by adaptive mesh refinement from traditional numerical methods, address this by dynamically updating collocation points during training but may overlook residual dynamics between updates, potentially losing valuable information. To overcome this limitation, we propose an adaptive collocation point selection strategy utilizing the QR Discrete Empirical Interpolation Method (QR-DEIM), a reduced-order modeling technique for efficiently approximating nonlinear functions. Our results on benchmark PDEs, including the wave, Allen-Cahn, and Burgers' equations, demonstrate that our QR-DEIM-based approach improves PINN accuracy compared to existing methods, offering a promising direction for adaptive collocation point strategies.</description>

      <title>An accelerated gradient method with adaptive restart for convex multiobjective optimization problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07863v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, based on the continuous time approach, we propose an accelerated gradient method with adaptive residual restart for convex multiobjective optimization problems. For the first, we derive rigorously the continuous limit of the multiobjective accelerated proximal gradient method by Tanabe et al. [Comput. Optim. Appl., 2023]. It is a second-order ordinary differential equation (ODE) that involves a special projection operator and can be viewed as an extension of the ODE by Su et al. [J. Mach. Learn. Res., 2016] for Nesterov's accelerated gradient method. Then, we introduce a novel accelerated multiobjective gradient (AMG) flow with tailored time scaling that adapts automatically to the convex case and the strongly convex case, and the exponential decay rate of a merit function along with the solution trajectory of AMG flow is established via the Lyapunov analysis. After that, we consider an implicit-explicit time discretization and obtain an accelerated multiobjective gradient method with a convex quadratic programming subproblem. The fast sublinear rate and linear rate are proved respectively for convex and strongly convex problems. In addition, we present an efficient residual based adaptive restart technique to overcome the oscillation issue and improve the convergence significantly. Numerical results are provided to validate the practical performance of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>A decoupled, convergent and fully linear algorithm for the Landau--Lifshitz--Gilbert equation with magnetoelastic effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.00605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.00605v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the coupled system of the Landau--Lifshitz--Gilbert equation and the conservation of linear momentum law to describe magnetic processes in ferromagnetic materials including magnetoelastic effects in the small-strain regime. For this nonlinear system of time-dependent partial differential equations, we present a decoupled integrator based on first-order finite elements in space and an implicit one-step method in time. We prove unconditional convergence of the sequence of discrete approximations towards a weak solution of the system as the mesh size and the time-step size go to zero. Compared to previous numerical works on this problem, for our method, we prove a discrete energy law that mimics that of the continuous problem and, passing to the limit, yields an energy inequality satisfied by weak solutions. Moreover, our method does not employ a nodal projection to impose the unit length constraint on the discrete magnetisation, so that the stability of the method does not require weakly acute meshes. Furthermore, our integrator and its analysis hold for a more general setting, including body forces and traction, as well as a more general representation of the magnetostrain. Numerical experiments underpin the theory and showcase the applicability of the scheme for the simulation of the dynamical processes involving magnetoelastic materials at submicrometer length scales.</description>

      <title>Convergence and stability of randomized implicit two-stage Runge-Kutta schemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19059v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We randomize the implicit two-stage Runge-Kutta scheme in order to improve the rate of convergence (with respect to a deterministic scheme) and stability of the approximate solution (with respect to the solution generated by the explicit scheme). For stability analysis, we use Dahlquist's concept of A-stability, adopted to randomized schemes by considering three notions of stability: asymptotic, mean-square, and in probability. The randomized implicit RK2 scheme proves to be A-stable asymptotically and in probability but not in the mean-square sense.</description>

      <title>Some New Convergence Analysis and Applications of POD-Greedy Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09933v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we derive a novel convergence estimate for the weak POD-Greedy method with multiple POD modes and variable greedy thresholds in terms of the entropy numbers of the parametric solution manifold. Combining the POD with the Empirical Interpolation Method (EIM), we also propose an EIM-POD-Greedy method with entropy-based convergence analysis for simultaneously approximating parametrized target functions by separable approximants. Several numerical experiments are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm compared to traditional methods.</description>

      <title>Error estimates for full discretization of Cahn--Hilliard equation with dynamic boundary conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20698v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A proof of optimal-order error estimates is given for the full discretization of the Cahn--Hilliard equation with Cahn--Hilliard-type dynamic boundary conditions in a smooth domain. The numerical method combines a linear bulk--surface finite element discretization in space and linearly implicit backward difference formulae of order 1 to 5 in time. Optimal-order error estimates are proven. The error estimates are based on a consistency and stability analysis in an abstract framework, based on energy estimates exploiting the anti-symmetric structure of the second-order system.</description>

      <title>Approximation Rates in Fr\'echet Metrics: Barron Spaces, Paley-Wiener Spaces, and Fourier Multipliers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04023v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Operator learning is a recent development in the simulation of Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) by means of neural networks. The idea behind this approach is to learn the behavior of an operator, such that the resulting neural network is an (approximate) mapping in infinite-dimensional spaces that is capable of (approximately) simulating the solution operator governed by the PDE. In our work, we study some general approximation capabilities for linear differential operators by approximating the corresponding symbol in the Fourier domain. Analogous to the structure of the class of H\"ormander-Symbols, we consider the approximation with respect to a topology that is induced by a sequence of semi-norms. In that sense, we measure the approximation error in terms of a Fr\'echet metric, and our main result identifies sufficient conditions for achieving a predefined approximation error. Secondly, we then focus on a natural extension of our main theorem, in which we manage to reduce the assumptions on the sequence of semi-norms. Based on existing approximation results for the exponential spectral Barron space, we then present a concrete example of symbols that can be approximated well.</description>

      <title>Extracting Manifold Information from Point Clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00427v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A kernel based method is proposed for the construction of signature (defining) functions of subsets of $\mathbb{R}^d$. The subsets can range from full dimensional manifolds (open subsets) to point clouds (a finite number of points) and include bounded smooth manifolds of any codimension. The interpolation and analysis of point clouds are the main application. Two extreme cases in terms of regularity are considered, where the data set is interpolated by an analytic surface, at the one extreme, and by a H\"older continuous surface, at the other. The signature function can be computed as a linear combination of translated kernels, the coefficients of which are the solution of a finite dimensional linear problem. Once it is obtained, it can be used to estimate the dimension as well as the normal and the curvatures of the interpolated surface. The method is global and does not require explicit knowledge of local neighborhoods or any other structure present in the data set. It admits a variational formulation with a natural ``regularized'' counterpart, that proves to be useful in dealing with data sets corrupted by numerical error or noise. The underlying analytical structure of the approach is presented in general before it is applied to the case of point clouds.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Nonparametric Inference in McKean-Vlasov models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16742v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider nonparametric statistical inference on a periodic interaction potential $W$ from noisy discrete space-time measurements of solutions $\rho=\rho_W$ of the nonlinear McKean-Vlasov equation, describing the probability density of the mean field limit of an interacting particle system. We show how Gaussian process priors assigned to $W$ give rise to posterior mean estimators that exhibit fast convergence rates for the implied estimated densities $\bar \rho$ towards $\rho_W$. We further show that if the initial condition $\phi$ is not too smooth and satisfies a standard deconvolvability condition, then one can consistently infer Sobolev-regular potentials $W$ at convergence rates $N^{-\theta}$ for appropriate $\theta&gt;0$, where $N$ is the number of measurements. The exponent $\theta$ can be taken to approach $1/2$ as the regularity of $W$ increases corresponding to `near-parametric' models.</description>
