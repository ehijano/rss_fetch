      <title>Symbol-Level Precoding for Near-Field ISAC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08983v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The forthcoming 6G and beyond wireless networks are anticipated to introduce new groundbreaking applications, such as Integrated Sensing and Communications (ISAC), potentially leveraging much wider bandwidths at higher frequencies and using significantly larger antenna arrays at base stations. This puts the system operation in the radiative near-field regime of the BS antenna array, characterized by spherical rather than flat wavefronts. In this paper, we refer to such a system as near-field ISAC. Unlike the far-field regime, the near-field regime allows for precise focusing of transmission beams on specific areas, making it possible to simultaneously determine a target's direction and range from a single base station and resolve targets located in the same direction. This work designs the transmit symbol vector in near-field ISAC to maximize a weighted combination of sensing and communication performances subject to a total power constraint using symbol-level precoding (SLP). The formulated optimization problem is convex, and the solution is used to estimate the angle and range of the considered targets using the 2D MUSIC algorithm. The simulation results suggest that the SLP-based design outperforms the block-level-based counterpart. Moreover, the 2D MUSIC algorithm accurately estimates the targets' parameters.</description>

      <title>FAS vs. ARIS: Which Is More Important for FAS-ARIS Communication Systems?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the question of which technology, fluid antenna systems (FAS) or active reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (ARIS), plays a more crucial role in FAS-ARIS wireless communication systems. To address this, we develop a comprehensive system model and explore the problem from an optimization perspective. We introduce an alternating optimization (AO) algorithm incorporating majorization-minimization (MM), successive convex approximation (SCA), and sequential rank-one constraint relaxation (SRCR) to tackle the non-convex challenges inherent in these systems. Specifically, for the transmit beamforming of the BS optimization, we propose a closed-form rank-one solution with low-complexity. For the optimization the positions of fluid antennas (FAs) of the BS, the Taylor expansions and MM algorithm are utilized to construct the effective lower bounds and upper bounds of the objective function and constraints, transforming the non-convex optimization problem into a convex one. Furthermore, we use the SCA and SRCR to optimize the reflection coefficient matrix of the ARIS and effectively solve the rank-one constraint. Simulation results reveal that the relative importance of FAS and ARIS varies depending on the scenario: FAS proves more critical in simpler models with fewer reflecting elements or limited transmission paths, while ARIS becomes more significant in complex scenarios with a higher number of reflecting elements or transmission paths. Ultimately, the integration of both FAS and ARIS creates a win-win scenario, resulting in a more robust and efficient communication system. This study underscores the importance of combining FAS with ARIS, as their complementary use provides the most substantial benefits across different communication environments.</description>

      <title>RIS-based Over-the-air Diffractional Channel Coding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS) are programmable metasurfaces utilizing sub-wavelength meta-atoms and a controller for precise electromagnetic wave manipulation. This work introduces an innovative channel coding scheme, termed RIS-based diffractional channel coding (DCC), which capitalizes on diffraction between two RIS layers for signal-level encoding. Contrary to traditional methods, DCC expands signal dimensions through diffraction, presenting a novel countermeasure to channel effects. This paper focuses on the operational principles of DCC, including encoder and decoder designs, and explores its possibilities to construct block and trellis codes, demonstrating its potential as both an alternative and a supplementary conventional coding scheme. Key advantages of DCC include eliminating extra power requirements for encoding, achieving computation at the speed of light, and enabling adjustable code distance, making it a progressive solution for efficient wireless communication, particularly in systems with large-scale data or massive MIMO.</description>

      <title>Interference-Free Backscatter Communications for OFDM-Based Symbiotic Radio</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09192v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study proposes an orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) based scheme to achieve interference-free backscatter communications (BC) in a symbiotic radio system. In specific, we propose three frequency shift keying (FSK) based backscatter modulation schemes to shift the primary signal, i.e., the OFDM symbols transmitted from a base station (BS), in the frequency domain to transmit its information. Symbiotically, the BS empties specific subcarriers within the band so that the received frequency-shifted signals from the backscatter device and the primary signal are always orthogonal. The first scheme relies on the combination of on-off keying (OOK) within the FSK modulation while the second and the third schemes are based on the conventional FSK modulation with different in-band null-subcarrier allocation. These schemes allow the use of non-coherent detection at the receiver which addresses the channel estimation challenge for the signals arriving from a backscatter device. We derive the bit-error rate performance of the detector theoretically. The comprehensive simulations show that the proposed approach achieves a lower bit-error rate up to 10-4 at 30 dB with BC by eliminating direct link interference.</description>

      <title>Zak-OTFS with Interleaved Pilots to Extend the Region of Predictable Operation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When the delay period of the Zak-OTFS carrier is greater than the delay spread of the channel, and the Doppler period of the carrier is greater than the Doppler spread of the channel, the effective channel filter taps can simply be read off from the response to a single pilot carrier waveform. The input-output (I/O) relation can then be reconstructed for a sampled system that operates under finite duration and bandwidth constraints. We introduce a framework for pilot design in the delay-Doppler (DD) domain which makes it possible to support users with very different delay-Doppler characteristics when it is not possible to choose a single delay and Doppler period to support all users. The method is to interleave single pilots in the DD domain, and to choose the pilot spacing so that the I/O relation can be reconstructed by solving a small linear system of equations.</description>

      <title>Channel Estimation, Interpolation and Extrapolation in Doubly-dispersive Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09381v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The OTFS (Orthogonal Time Frequency Space) is widely acknowledged for its ability to combat Doppler spread in time-varying channels. In this paper, another advantage of OTFS over OFDM (Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing) will be demonstrated: much reduced channel training overhead. Specifically, the sparsity of the channel in delay-Doppler (D-D) domain implies strong correlation of channel gains in time-frequency (T-F) domain, which can be harnessed to reduce channel training overhead through interpolation. An immediate question is how much training overhead is needed in doubly-dispersive channels? A conventional belief is that the overhead is only dependent on the product of delay and Doppler spreads, but we will show that it's also dependent on the T-F window size. The finite T-F window leads to infinite spreading in D-D domain, and aliasing will be inevitable after sampling in T-F domain. Two direct consequences of the aliasing are increased channel training overhead and interference. Another factor contributing to channel estimation error is the inter-symbol-carrier-interference (ISCI), resulting from the uncertainty principle. Both aliasing and ISCI are considered in channel modelling, a low-complexity algorithm is proposed for channel estimation and interpolation through FFT. A large T-F window is necessary for reduced channel training overhead and aliasing, but increases processing delay. Fortunately, we show that the proposed algorithm can be implemented in a pipeline fashion. Further more, we showed that data-aided channel tracking is possible in D-D domain to further reduce the channel estimation frequency, i.e., channel extrapolation. The impacts of aliasing and ISCI on channel interpolation error are analyzed.</description>

      <title>Design and Development of Paper-based Spirometry Device and its Smart-phone based Lung Condition Monitoring and Analysis Software</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09389v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe the design, construction and characterisation of paper based devices to perform spirometry, a standard test for lung function assessment. In this device the instantaneous flowrate of the incoming breath from a person gets transformed to a specific acoustic frequency. In this manner, the time course of the persons breath profile is mapped to a time varying acoustic signal. The captured acoustic signal can be converted to standard spirometry curves and relevant parameters can be extracted as we describe in this paper. We compared our device with commercially available devices and showed that these paper based devices provide similar performance. These devices have advantage of low cost and simplicity of operation compared to currently available commercial products.</description>

      <title>Near-Field Sensing: A Low-Complexity Wavenumber-Domain Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09592v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A novel low-complexity wavenumber-domain method is proposed for near-field sensing (NISE). Specifically, the power-concentrated region of the wavenumber-domain channels is related to the target position in a non-linear manner. Based on this observation, a bi-directional convolutional neural network (BiCNN)-based approach is proposed to capture such a relationship, thereby facilitating low-complexity target localization. This method enables direct and gridless target localization using only a limited bandwidth and a single antenna array. Simulation results demonstrate that: 1) during the offline training phase, the proposed BiCNN method can learn to localize the target with fewer trainable parameters compared to the naive neural network architectures; and 2) during the online implementation phase, the BiCNN method can spend 100x less time while maintaining comparable performance to the conventional two-dimensional multiple signal classification (MUSIC) algorithms.</description>

      <title>Convolutional Neural Network Approach for Emitter Association using Channel Identification in a MIMO System based on Propagation Features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09616v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, an application of a 1D deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) and 4x4 1D DCNN Multi-channel Model (DCNN-MCM) was developed to predict the probability of a channel being associated with a given transmitter for each emitter in a 4x4 multi-input multi-output (MIMO) system. Counterintuitively, compared to the traditional approach to emitter association (EA), this research argues for the identification of received RF signals based on channel features (CFs) such as the channel impulse response (CIR) and transfer function (TF). Based on the CFs there are unique properties per transmit and receive pair that can be used to identify the different transmitters. More specifically, CFs are often defined by a wide sense stationary (WSS) stochastic process which gives them unique properties such as, being statistically independent and reciprocal for emitter association. Given these CFs, the received RF signals can be used to measure the clutter and objects surrounding the emitters. Safely assuming the surrounding clutter and objects are unique to each emitter, the estimation and tracking of this clutter provides a way of identifying what emitter is transmitting the observed signal. This method successfully classifies and identifies the emitters at 97.22% and 88.89% accuracy for the DCNN and DCNN-MCM respectively. This method was further compared with the accuracy of previous methods to test the validity of the approach and future improvements.</description>

      <title>Exploring Wavelet Transformations for Deep Learning-based Machine Condition Diagnosis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09644v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning (DL) strategies have recently been utilized to diagnose motor faults by simply analyzing motor phase current signals, offering a less costly and non-intrusive alternative to vibration sensors. This research transforms these time-series current signals into time-frequency 2D representations via Wavelet Transform (WT). The dataset for motor current signals includes 3,750 data points across five categories: one representing normal conditions and four representing artificially induced faults, each under five different load conditions: 0, 25, 50, 75, and 100%. The study employs five WT-based techniques: WT-Amor, WT-Bump, WT-Morse, WSST-Amor, and WSST-Bump. Subsequently, five DL models adopting prior Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture were developed and tested using the transformed 2D plots from each method. The DL models for WT-Amor, WT-Bump, and WT-Morse showed remarkable effectiveness with peak model accuracy of 90.93, 89.20, and 93.73%, respectively, surpassing previous 2D-image-based methods that recorded accuracy of 80.25, 74.80, and 82.80% respectively using the identical dataset and validation protocol. Notably, the WT-Morse approach slightly exceeded the formerly highest ML technique, achieving a 93.20% accuracy. However, the two WSST methods that utilized synchrosqueezing techniques faced difficulty accurately classifying motor faults. The performance of Wavelet-based deep learning methods offers a compelling alternative for machine condition monitoring.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning-based Machine Condition Diagnosis using Short-time Fourier Transformation Variants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09649v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In motor condition diagnosis, electrical current signature serves as an alternative feature to vibration-based sensor data, which is a more expensive and invasive method. Machine learning (ML) techniques have been emerging in diagnosing motor conditions using only motor phase current signals. This study converts time-series motor current signals to time-frequency 2D plots using Short-time Fourier Transform (STFT) methods. The motor current signal dataset consists of 3,750 sample points with five classes - one healthy and four synthetically-applied motor fault conditions, and with five loading conditions: 0, 25, 50, 75, and 100%. Five transformation methods are used on the dataset: non-overlap and overlap STFTs, non-overlap and overlap realigned STFTs, and synchrosqueezed STFT. Then, deep learning (DL) models based on the previous Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture are trained and validated from generated plots of each method. The DL models of overlap-STFT, overlap R-STFT, non-overlap STFT, non-overlap R-STFT, and synchrosqueezed-STFT performed exceptionally with an average accuracy of 97.65, 96.03, 96.08, 96.32, and 88.27%, respectively. Four methods outperformed the previous best ML method with 93.20% accuracy, while all five outperformed previous 2D-plot-based methods with accuracy of 80.25, 74.80, and 82.80%, respectively, using the same dataset, same DL architecture, and validation steps.</description>

      <title>Joint Beamforming and Power Control for D2D-Assisted Integrated Sensing and Communication Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09844v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) is an emerging technology in next-generation communication networks. However, the communication performance of the ISAC system may be severely affected by interference from the radar system if the sensing task has demanding performance requirements. In this paper, we exploit device-to-device communication (D2D) to improve system communication capacity. The ISAC system in a single cell D2D assisted-network is investigated, where the base station (BS) performs target sensing and communication with multiple celluar user equipments (CUEs) as well as D2D user equipments (DUEs) simultaneously communicating with other DUEs by multiplexing the same frequency resource. To achieve the optimal communication performance in the D2D-assisted ISAC system, a joint beamforming and power control problem is formulated with the goal to maximize the sum rate of the system while guaranteeing the performance requirements of radar sensing. Due to the non-convexity of the problem, we propose the algorithm to transform the origin problem into a relaxation form and obtain the solution. We also proposed the zero-forcing (ZF) beamforming scheme to acquire the solution that can eliminate the interference of the BS on DUEs. Extensive numerical simulations demonstrated that with the assistance of the D2D communications, our proposed algorithm significantly outperforms the baseline schemes in the system sum rate.</description>

      <title>Sensing in NLOS: a Stroboscopic Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09883v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sensing in non-line-of-sight (NLOS) is a well-known issue that limits the effective range of radar-like sensors. Existing approaches for NLOS sensing consider the usage of either metallic mirrors, that only work under specular reflection, or dynamically-reconfigurable metasurfaces that steer the signal to cover a desired area in NLOS, with the drawback of cost and control signaling. This paper proposes a novel sensing system, that allows a source to image a desired region of interest (ROI) in NLOS, using the combination of a proper beam sweeping (by the source) as well as a passive reflection plane configured as a periodic angular deflecting function (that allows illuminating the ROI). \textit{Stroboscopic sensing} is obtained by sweeping over a sufficiently large portion of the reflection plane, the source covers the ROI \textit{and} enhance the spatial resolution of the image, thanks to multiple diverse observation angles of ROI. Remarkably, the proposed system achieves a near-field imaging with a sequence of far-field acquisitions, thus limiting the implementation complexity. We detail the system design criteria and trade-offs, demonstrating the remarkable benefits of such a stroboscopic sensing system, where a possibly moving source can observe a ROI through multiple points of view as if it were static.</description>

      <title>Beyond Diagonal RIS: Passive Maximum Ratio Transmission and Interference Nulling Enabler</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09887v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Beyond diagonal reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (BD-RIS) generalizes and goes beyond conventional diagonal reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (D-RIS) by interconnecting elements to generate beyond diagonal scattering matrices, which significantly strengthen the wireless channels. In this work, we use BD-RIS for passive multiuser beamforming in multiuser multiple-input-single-output (MU-MISO) systems. Specifically, we design the scattering matrix of BD-RIS to either maximize the sum received signal power at the users following maximum ratio transmission (MRT), or to nullify the interference at the users following zero forcing (ZF). Furthermore, we investigate uniform/optimized power allocation and ZF precoding at the base station (BS). Numerical results show that BD-RIS improves the interference nulling capability and sum rate with fewer reflecting elements (REs) compared to D-RIS. In addition, at moderate to high signal to noise ratios (SNRs), passive interference nulling reduces the complexity at the BS by relaxing the need for precoding or water-filling power allocation design. Furthermore, the passive MRT with ZF precoding achieves a tight sum rate performance to the joint design considering MU-MISO scenarios with many REs while maintaining low computational complexity and simplifying the channel estimation.</description>

      <title>Parseval Convolution Operators and Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09981v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We first establish a kernel theorem that characterizes all linear shift-invariant (LSI) operators acting on discrete multicomponent signals. This result naturally leads to the identification of the Parseval convolution operators as the class of energy-preserving filterbanks. We then present a constructive approach for the design/specification of such filterbanks via the chaining of elementary Parseval modules, each of which being parameterized by an orthogonal matrix or a 1-tight frame. Our analysis is complemented with explicit formulas for the Lipschitz constant of all the components of a convolutional neural network (CNN), which gives us a handle on their stability. Finally, we demonstrate the usage of those tools with the design of a CNN-based algorithm for the iterative reconstruction of biomedical images. Our algorithm falls within the plug-and-play framework for the resolution of inverse problems. It yields better-quality results than the sparsity-based methods used in compressed sensing, while offering essentially the same convergence and robustness guarantees.</description>

      <title>On the Optimal Radius and Subcarrier Mapping for Binary Modulation on Conjugate-Reciprocal Zeros</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the radius maximizing reliability for binary modulation on conjugate-reciprocal zeros (BMOCZ) implemented with both maximum likelihood (ML) and direct zero-testing (DiZeT) decoders. We first show that the optimal radius for BMOCZ is a function of the employed decoder and that the radius maximizing the minimum distance between polynomial zeros does not maximize the minimum distance of the final code. While maximizing zero separation offers an almost optimal solution with the DiZeT decoder, simulations show that the ML decoder outperforms the DiZeT decoder in both additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) and fading channels when the radius is chosen to maximize codeword separation. Finally, we analyze different sequence-to-subcarrier mappings for BMOCZ-based orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM). We highlight a flexible time-frequency OFDM waveform that avoids distortion introduced by a frequency-selective channel at the expense of a higher peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR).</description>

      <title>An optimal pairwise merge algorithm improves the quality and consistency of nonnegative matrix factorization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09013v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) is a key technique for feature extraction and widely used in source separation. However, existing algorithms may converge to poor local minima, or to one of several minima with similar objective value but differing feature parametrizations. Additionally, the performance of NMF greatly depends on the number of components, but choosing the optimal count remains a challenge. Here we show that some of these weaknesses may be mitigated by performing NMF in a higher-dimensional feature space and then iteratively combining components with an analytically-solvable pairwise merge strategy. Experimental results demonstrate our method helps NMF achieve better local optima and greater consistency of the solutions. Iterative merging also provides an efficient and informative framework for choosing the number of components. Surprisingly, despite these extra steps, our approach often improves computational performance by reducing the occurrence of ``convergence stalling'' near saddle points. This can be recommended as a preferred approach for most applications of NMF.</description>

      <title>A Spatio-temporal Prediction Methodology Based on Deep Learning and Real Wi-Fi Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09423v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid development of Wi-Fi technologies in recent years has caused a significant increase in the traffic usage. Hence, knowledge obtained from Wi-Fi network measurements can be helpful for a more efficient network management. In this paper, we propose a methodology to predict future values of some specific network metrics (e.g. traffic load, transmission failures, etc.). These predictions may be useful for improving the network performance. After data collection and preprocessing, the correlation between each target access point (AP) and its neighbouring APs is estimated. According to these correlations, either an only-temporal or a spatio-temporal based prediction is done. To evaluate the proposed methodology, real measurements are collected from 100 APs deployed in different university buildings for 3 months. Deep Learning (DL) methods (i.e. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Simple Recurrent Neural Network (SRNN), Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Transformer) are evaluated and compared for both temporal and spatio-temporal based predictions. Moreover, a hybrid prediction methodology is proposed using a spatial processing based on CNN and a temporal prediction based on RNN. The proposed hybrid methodology provides an improvement in the prediction accuracy at expenses of a slight increase in the Training Computational Time (TCT) and negligible in Prediction Computational Time (PCT).</description>

      <title>Confirmation Bias in Gaussian Mixture Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09718v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Confirmation bias, the tendency to interpret information in a way that aligns with one's preconceptions, can profoundly impact scientific research, leading to conclusions that reflect the researcher's hypotheses even when the observational data do not support them. This issue is especially critical in scientific fields involving highly noisy observations, such as cryo-electron microscopy.
  This study investigates confirmation bias in Gaussian mixture models. We consider the following experiment: A team of scientists assumes they are analyzing data drawn from a Gaussian mixture model with known signals (hypotheses) as centroids. However, in reality, the observations consist entirely of noise without any informative structure. The researchers use a single iteration of the K-means or expectation-maximization algorithms, two popular algorithms to estimate the centroids. Despite the observations being pure noise, we show that these algorithms yield biased estimates that resemble the initial hypotheses, contradicting the unbiased expectation that averaging these noise observations would converge to zero. Namely, the algorithms generate estimates that mirror the postulated model, although the hypotheses (the presumed centroids of the Gaussian mixture) are not evident in the observations. Specifically, among other results, we prove a positive correlation between the estimates produced by the algorithms and the corresponding hypotheses. We also derive explicit closed-form expressions of the estimates for a finite and infinite number of hypotheses. This study underscores the risks of confirmation bias in low signal-to-noise environments, provides insights into potential pitfalls in scientific methodologies, and highlights the importance of prudent data interpretation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09947v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this manuscript, a novelty principle driven fiber transmission model for short-distance transmission with parameterized inputs is put forward. By taking into the account of the previously proposed principle driven fiber model, the reduced basis expansion method and transforming the parameterized inputs into parameterized coefficients of the Nonlinear Schrodinger Equations, universal solutions with respect to inputs corresponding to different bit rates can all be obtained without the need of re-training the whole model. This model, once adopted, can have prominent advantages in both computation efficiency and physical background. Besides, this model can still be effectively trained without the needs of transmitted signals collected in advance. Tasks of on-off keying signals with bit rates ranging from 2Gbps to 50Gbps are adopted to demonstrate the fidelity of the model.</description>

      <title>Principle Driven Parameterized Fiber Model based on GPT-PINN Neural Network</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09951v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In cater the need of Beyond 5G communications, large numbers of data driven artificial intelligence based fiber models has been put forward as to utilize artificial intelligence's regression ability to predict pulse evolution in fiber transmission at a much faster speed compared with the traditional split step Fourier method. In order to increase the physical interpretabiliy, principle driven fiber models have been proposed which inserts the Nonlinear Schodinger Equation into their loss functions. However, regardless of either principle driven or data driven models, they need to be re-trained the whole model under different transmission conditions. Unfortunately, this situation can be unavoidable when conducting the fiber communication optimization work. If the scale of different transmission conditions is large, then the whole model needs to be retrained large numbers of time with relatively large scale of parameters which may consume higher time costs. Computing efficiency will be dragged down as well. In order to address this problem, we propose the principle driven parameterized fiber model in this manuscript. This model breaks down the predicted NLSE solution with respect to one set of transmission condition into the linear combination of several eigen solutions which were outputted by each pre-trained principle driven fiber model via the reduced basis method. Therefore, the model can greatly alleviate the heavy burden of re-training since only the linear combination coefficients need to be found when changing the transmission condition. Not only strong physical interpretability can the model posses, but also higher computing efficiency can be obtained. Under the demonstration, the model's computational complexity is 0.0113% of split step Fourier method and 1% of the previously proposed principle driven fiber model.</description>

      <title>Experiment-based Models for Air Time and Current Consumption of LoRaWAN LR-FHSS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09954v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Long Range - Frequency Hopping Spread Spectrum (LR-FHSS) is an emerging and promising technology recently introduced into the LoRaWAN protocol specification for both terrestrial and non-terrestrial networks, notably satellites. The higher capacity, long-range and robustness to Doppler effect make LR-FHSS a primary candidate for direct-to-satellite (DtS) connectivity for enabling Internet-of-things (IoT) in remote areas. The LR-FHSS devices envisioned for DtS IoT will be primarily battery-powered. Therefore, it is crucial to investigate the current consumption characteristics and Time-on-Air (ToA) of LR-FHSS technology. However, to our knowledge, no prior research has presented the accurate ToA and current consumption models for this newly introduced scheme. This paper addresses this shortcoming through extensive field measurements and the development of analytical models. Specifically, we have measured the current consumption and ToA for variable transmit power, message payload, and two new LR-FHSS-based Data Rates (DR8 and DR9). We also develop current consumption and ToA analytical models demonstrating a strong correlation with the measurement results exhibiting a relative error of less than 0.3%. Thus, it confirms the validity of our models. Conversely, the existing analytical models exhibit a higher relative error rate of -9.2 to 3.4% compared to our measurement results. The presented in this paper results can be further used for simulators or in analytical studies to accurately model the on-air time and energy consumption of LR-FHSS devices.</description>

      <title>Stacked Intelligent Metasurfaces for Integrated Sensing and Communications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10043v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stacked intelligent metasurfaces (SIM) have recently emerged as a promising technology, which can realize transmit precoding in the wave domain. In this paper, we investigate a SIM-aided integrated sensing and communications system, in which SIM is capable of generating a desired beam pattern for simultaneously communicating with multiple downlink users and detecting a radar target. Specifically, we formulate an optimization problem of maximizing the spectrum efficiency, while satisfying the power constraint of the desired direction. This requires jointly designing the phase shifts of the SIM and the power allocation at the base station. By incorporating the sensing power constraint into the objective functions as a penalty term, we further simplify the optimization problem and solve it by customizing an efficient gradient ascent algorithm. Finally, extensive numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed wave-domain precoder for automatically mitigating the inter-user interference and generating a desired beampattern for the sensing task, as multiple separate data streams transmit through the SIM.</description>

      <title>Electrically Reconfigurable Non-Volatile On-Chip Bragg Filter with Multilevel Operation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10110v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Photonic integrated circuits (PICs) demand tailored spectral responses for various applications. On-chip Bragg filters offer a promising solution, yet their static nature hampers scalability. Current tunable filters rely on volatile switching mechanisms plagued by high static power consumption and thermal crosstalk. Here, we introduce, for the first time, a non-volatile, electrically programmable on-chip Bragg filter. This device incorporates a nanoscale layer of wide-bandgap phase change material (Sb2S3) atop a periodically structured silicon waveguide. The reversible phase transitions and drastic refractive index modulation of Sb2S3 enable dynamic spectral tuning via foundry-compatible microheaters. Our design surpasses traditional passive Bragg gratings and active volatile filters by offering electrically controlled, reconfigurable spectral responses in a non-volatile manner. The proposed filter achieves a peak reflectivity exceeding 99% and a high tuning range ($\Delta\lambda$=20 nm) when transitioning between the amorphous and crystalline states of Sb2S3. Additionally, we demonstrate quasi-continuous spectral control of the filter stopband by modulating the amorphous/crystalline distribution within Sb2S3. Our approach offers substantial benefits for low-power, programmable PICs, thereby laying the groundwork for prospective applications in optical communications, optical interconnects, microwave photonics, optical signal processing, and adaptive multi-parameter sensing.</description>

Abstract: As the demand for wireless connectivity continues to soar, the fifth generation and beyond wireless networks are exploring new ways to efficiently utilize the wireless spectrum and reduce hardware costs. One such approach is the integration of sensing and communications (ISAC) paradigms to jointly access the spectrum. Recent ISAC studies have focused on upper millimeter-wave and low terahertz bands to exploit ultrawide bandwidths. At these frequencies, hybrid beamformers that employ fewer radio-frequency chains are employed to offset expensive hardware but at the cost of lower multiplexing gains. Wideband hybrid beamforming also suffers from the beam-split effect arising from the subcarrier-independent (SI) analog beamformers. To overcome these limitations, this paper introduces a spatial path index modulation (SPIM) ISAC architecture, which transmits additional information bits via modulating the spatial paths between the base station and communications users. We design the SPIM-ISAC beamformers by first estimating both radar and communications parameters by developing beam-split-aware algorithms. Then, we propose to employ a family of hybrid beamforming techniques such as hybrid, SI, and subcarrier-dependent analog-only, and beam-split-aware beamformers. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed SPIM-ISAC approach exhibits significantly improved spectral efficiency performance in the presence of beam-split than that of even fully digital non-SPIM beamformers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.12534v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By incorporating reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) into communication-assisted localization systems, the issue of signal blockage caused by obstacles can be addressed, and passive beamforming can be employed to enhance localization accuracy. However, existing works mainly consider ideal channels and do not account for the effects of realistic impairments like carrier frequency offset (CFO) and phase noise (PN) on localization. This paper proposes an iterative joint estimation algorithm for CFO, PN, and user position based on maximum a posteriori (MAP) criterion and gradient descent (GD) algorithm. Closed-form expressions for CFO and PN updates are provided. The hybrid Cram\'{e}r-Rao lower bound (HCRLB) for the estimation parameters is derived, and the ambiguity in CFO and PN estimation is analyzed. To minimize the HCRLB, a non-convex RIS shift optimization problem is formulated and is transformed into a convex semidefinite programming (SDP) problem using the technique of semidefinite relaxation (SDR) and Schur complement. After optimizing the RIS phase shift, the theoretical positioning accuracy within the area of interest (AOI) can be improved by two orders of magnitude, with a maximum positioning root mean square error (RMSE) lower than $\rm 10^{-2}m$.</description>

Abstract: Low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites and reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) have recently drawn significant attention as two transformative technologies, and the synergy between them emerges as a promising paradigm for providing cross-environment communication and positioning services. This paper investigates an integrated terrestrial and non-terrestrial wireless network that leverages LEO satellites and RISs to achieve simultaneous tracking of the three-dimensional (3D) position, 3D velocity, and 3D orientation of user equipment (UE). To address inherent challenges including nonlinear observation function, constrained UE state, and unknown observation statistics, we develop a Riemannian manifold-based unscented Kalman filter (UKF) method. This method propagates statistics over nonlinear functions using generated sigma points and maintains state constraints through projection onto the defined manifold space. Additionally, by employing Fisher information matrices (FIMs) of the sigma points, a belief assignment principle is proposed to approximate the unknown observation covariance matrix, thereby ensuring accurate measurement updates in the UKF procedure. Numerical results demonstrate a substantial enhancement in tracking accuracy facilitated by RIS integration, despite urban signal reception challenges from LEO satellites. In addition, extensive simulations underscore the superior performance of the proposed tracking method and FIM-based belief assignment over the adopted benchmarks. Furthermore, the robustness of the proposed UKF is verified across various uncertainty levels.</description>

      <title>Minimum Description Feature Selection for Complexity Reduction in Machine Learning-based Wireless Positioning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15374v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, deep learning approaches have provided solutions to difficult problems in wireless positioning (WP). Although these WP algorithms have attained excellent and consistent performance against complex channel environments, the computational complexity coming from processing high-dimensional features can be prohibitive for mobile applications. In this work, we design a novel positioning neural network (P-NN) that utilizes the minimum description features to substantially reduce the complexity of deep learning-based WP. P-NN's feature selection strategy is based on maximum power measurements and their temporal locations to convey information needed to conduct WP. We improve P-NN's learning ability by intelligently processing two different types of inputs: sparse image and measurement matrices. Specifically, we implement a self-attention layer to reinforce the training ability of our network. We also develop a technique to adapt feature space size, optimizing over the expected information gain and the classification capability quantified with information-theoretic measures on signal bin selection. Numerical results show that P-NN achieves a significant advantage in performance-complexity tradeoff over deep learning baselines that leverage the full power delay profile (PDP). In particular, we find that P-NN achieves a large improvement in performance for low SNR, as unnecessary measurements are discarded in our minimum description features.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we present a unique $\text {2D}$ high resolution, compact, low-cost, low-weight, and highly accurate millimeter wave imagery system capable of operating in all weather conditions. We describe millimeter wave imaging process in detail and present several novel signal processing methods with their applications. To create the array, we utilize the Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) concept. The imagery system presented in this paper, can strongly compete with Lidar systems as the resolution limit is at the same level. Furthermore, in contrast to the Lidar systems, our imagery system can operate in heavy rain and dense fog and produce high quality images.
  Finally, we utilize our wide-band custom-made Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave (FMCW) radar, which operates at W-band with $\text {33 GHz}$ bandwidth, for data collection and present the results.</description>

Abstract: Accurate localization is crucial for various applications, including autonomous vehicles and next-generation wireless networks. However, the reliability and precision of Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS), such as the Global Positioning System (GPS), are compromised by multi-path errors and non-line-of-sight scenarios. This paper presents a novel approach to enhance GPS accuracy by combining visual data from RGB cameras with wireless signals captured at millimeter-wave (mmWave) and sub-terahertz (sub-THz) basestations. We propose a sensing-aided framework for (i) site-specific GPS data characterization and (ii) GPS position de-noising that utilizes multi-modal visual and wireless information. Our approach is validated in a realistic Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) scenario using a comprehensive real-world dataset, demonstrating a substantial reduction in localization error to sub-meter levels. This method represents a significant advancement in achieving precise localization, particularly beneficial for high-mobility applications in 5G and beyond networks.</description>

      <title>Improving EEG Classification Through Randomly Reassembling Original and Generated Data with Transformer-based Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20253v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electroencephalogram (EEG) classification has been widely used in various medical and engineering applications, where it is important for understanding brain function, diagnosing diseases, and assessing mental health conditions. However, the scarcity of EEG data severely restricts the performance of EEG classification networks, and generative model-based data augmentation methods have emerged as potential solutions to overcome this challenge. There are two problems with existing methods: (1) The quality of the generated EEG signals is not high; (2) The enhancement of EEG classification networks is not effective. In this paper, we propose a Transformer-based denoising diffusion probabilistic model and a generated data-based augmentation method to address the above two problems. For the characteristics of EEG signals, we propose a constant-factor scaling method to preprocess the signals, which reduces the loss of information. We incorporated Multi-Scale Convolution and Dynamic Fourier Spectrum Information modules into the model, improving the stability of the training process and the quality of the generated data. The proposed augmentation method randomly reassemble the generated data with original data in the time-domain to obtain vicinal data, which improves the model performance by minimizing the empirical risk and the vicinal risk. We verify the proposed augmentation method on four EEG datasets for four tasks and observe significant accuracy performance improvements: 14.00% on the Bonn dataset; 6.38% on the SleepEDF-20 dataset; 9.42% on the FACED dataset; 2.5% on the Shu dataset. We will make the code of our method publicly accessible soon.</description>

      <title>Inferring directed spectral information flow between mixed-frequency time series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06109v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Identifying directed spectral information flow between multivariate time series is important for many applications in finance, climate, geophysics and neuroscience. Spectral Granger causality (SGC) is a prediction-based measure characterizing directed information flow at specific oscillatory frequencies. However, traditional vector autoregressive (VAR) approaches are insufficient to assess SGC when time series have mixed frequencies (MF) or are coupled by nonlinearity. Here we propose a time-frequency canonical correlation analysis approach ("MF-TFCCA") to assess the strength and driving frequency of spectral information flow. We validate the approach with intensive computer simulations on MF time series under various interaction conditions and assess statistical significance of the estimate with surrogate data. We further apply MF-TFCCA to real-life finance, climate and neuroscience data. Our analysis framework provides an exploratory and computationally efficient approach to quantify directed information flow between MF time series in the presence of complex and nonlinear interactions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06425v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The ubiquity of multiscale interactions in complex systems is well-recognized, with development and heredity serving as a prime example of how processes at different temporal scales influence one another. This work introduces a novel multiscale state-space model to explore the dynamic interplay between systems interacting across different time scales, with feedback between each scale. We propose a Bayesian learning framework to estimate unknown states by learning the unknown process noise covariances within this multiscale model. We develop a Particle Gibbs with Ancestor Sampling (PGAS) algorithm for inference and demonstrate through simulations the efficacy of our approach.</description>

      <title>Joint Source-Channel Optimization for UAV Video Coding and Transmission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06667v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) video coding and transmission in scenarios such as emergency rescue and environmental monitoring. Unlike existing methods of modeling UAV video source coding and channel transmission separately, we investigate the joint source-channel optimization issue for video coding and transmission. Particularly, we design eight-dimensional delay-power-rate-distortion models in terms of source coding and channel transmission and characterize the correlation between video coding and transmission, with which a joint source-channel optimization problem is formulated. Its objective is to minimize end-to-end distortion and UAV power consumption by optimizing fine-grained parameters related to UAV video coding and transmission. This problem is confirmed to be a challenging sequential-decision and non-convex optimization problem. We therefore decompose it into a family of repeated optimization problems by Lyapunov optimization and design an approximate convex optimization scheme with provable performance guarantees to tackle these problems. Based on the theoretical transformation, we propose a Lyapunov repeated iteration (LyaRI) algorithm. Both objective and subjective experiments are conducted to comprehensively evaluate the performance of LyaRI. The results indicate that, compared to its counterparts, LyaRI achieves better video quality and stability performance, with a 47.74% reduction in the variance of the obtained encoding bitrate.</description>

      <title>Textless Unit-to-Unit training for Many-to-Many Multilingual Speech-to-Speech Translation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.01831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.01831v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a textless training method for many-to-many multilingual speech-to-speech translation that can also benefit the transfer of pre-trained knowledge to text-based systems, text-to-speech synthesis and text-to-speech translation. To this end, we represent multilingual speech with speech units that are the discretized representations of speech features derived from a self-supervised speech model. By treating the speech units as pseudo-text, we can focus on the linguistic content of the speech, which can be easily associated with both speech and text modalities at the phonetic level information. By setting both the inputs and outputs of our learning problem as speech units, we propose to train an encoder-decoder model in a many-to-many spoken language translation setting, namely Unit-to-Unit Translation (UTUT). Specifically, the encoder is conditioned on the source language token to correctly understand the input spoken language, while the decoder is conditioned on the target language token to generate the translated speech in the target language. Therefore, during the training, the model can build the knowledge of how languages are comprehended and how to relate them to different languages. Since speech units can be easily associated from both audio and text by quantization and phonemization respectively, the trained model can easily transferred to text-related tasks, even if it is trained in a textless manner. We demonstrate that the proposed UTUT model can be effectively utilized not only for Speech-to-Speech Translation (S2ST) but also for multilingual Text-to-Speech Synthesis (T2S) and Text-to-Speech Translation (T2ST), requiring only minimal fine-tuning steps on text inputs. By conducting comprehensive experiments encompassing various languages, we validate the efficacy of the proposed method across diverse multilingual tasks.</description>

      <title>Wilcoxon Nonparametric CFAR Scheme for Ship Detection in SAR Image</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18579v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The parametric constant false alarm rate (CFAR) detection algorithms which are based on various statistical distributions, such as Gaussian, Gamma, Weibull, log-normal, G0 distribution, alpha-stable distribution, etc, are most widely used to detect the ship targets in SAR image at present. However, the clutter background in SAR images is complicated and variable. When the actual clutter background deviates from the assumed statistical distribution, the performance of the parametric CFAR detector will deteriorate. In addition to the parametric CFAR schemes, there is another class of nonparametric CFAR detectors which can maintain a constant false alarm rate for the target detection without the assumption of a known clutter distribution. In this work, the Wilcoxon nonparametric CFAR scheme for ship detection in SAR image is proposed and analyzed, and a closed form of the false alarm rate for the Wilcoxon nonparametric detector to determine the decision threshold is presented. By comparison with several typical parametric CFAR schemes on Radarsat-2, ICEYE-X6 and Gaofen-3 SAR images, the robustness of the Wilcoxon nonparametric detector to maintain a good false alarm performance in different detection backgrounds is revealed, and its detection performance for the weak ship in rough sea surface is improved to some extent. Moreover, the Wilcoxon nonparametric detector can suppress the false alarms resulting from the sidelobes at some degree and its detection speed is fast.</description>

      <title>Sim2Real in Reconstructive Spectroscopy: Deep Learning with Augmented Device-Informed Data Simulation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.12354v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work proposes a deep learning (DL)-based framework, namely Sim2Real, for spectral signal reconstruction in reconstructive spectroscopy, focusing on efficient data sampling and fast inference time. The work focuses on the challenge of reconstructing real-world spectral signals under the extreme setting where only device-informed simulated data are available for training. Such device-informed simulated data are much easier to collect than real-world data but exhibit large distribution shifts from their real-world counterparts. To leverage such simulated data effectively, a hierarchical data augmentation strategy is introduced to mitigate the adverse effects of this domain shift, and a corresponding neural network for the spectral signal reconstruction with our augmented data is designed. Experiments using a real dataset measured from our spectrometer device demonstrate that Sim2Real achieves significant speed-up during the inference while attaining on-par performance with the state-of-the-art optimization-based methods.</description>

      <title>An Efficient Sum-Rate Maximization Algorithm for Fluid Antenna-Assisted ISAC System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06516v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This letter investigates a fluid antenna (FA)-assisted integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system, with joint antenna position optimization and waveform design. We consider enhancing the sum-rate maximization (SRM) and sensing performance with the aid of FAs. Although the introduction of FAs brings more degrees of freedom for performance optimization, its position optimization poses a non-convex programming problem and brings great computational challenges. This letter contributes to building an efficient design algorithm by the block successive upper bound minimization and majorization-minimization principles, with each step admitting closed-form update for the ISAC waveform design. In addition, the extrapolation technique is exploited further to speed up the empirical convergence of FA position design. Simulation results show that the proposed design can achieve state-of-the-art sum-rate performance with at least 60% computation cutoff compared to existing works with successive convex approximation (SCA) and particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02161v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Maintaining consistent uncertainty estimates in localization systems is crucial as the perceived uncertainty commonly affects high-level system components, such as control or decision processes. A method for constructing an observability-constrained magnetic field-aided inertial navigation system is proposed to address the issue of erroneous yaw observability, which leads to inconsistent estimates of yaw uncertainty. The proposed method builds upon the previously proposed observability-constrained extended Kalman filter and extends it to work with a magnetic field-based odometry-aided inertial navigation system. The proposed method is evaluated using simulation and real-world data, showing that (i) the system observability properties are preserved, (ii) the estimation accuracy increases, and (iii) the perceived uncertainty calculated by the EKF is more consistent with the true uncertainty of the filter estimates.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05913v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Downlink (DL) Multi-User (MU) Multiple Input Multiple Output (MU-MIMO) is a key technology that allows multiple concurrent data transmissions from an Access Point (AP) to a selected sub-set of clients for higher network efficiency in IEEE 802.11ax. However, DL MU-MIMO feature is typically turned off as the default setting in AP vendors' products, that is, turning on the DL MU-MIMO may not help increase the network efficiency, which is counter-intuitive. In this article, we provide a sufficiently deep understanding of the interplay between the various underlying factors, i.e., CSI overhead and spatial correlation, which result in negative results when turning on the DL MU-MIMO. Furthermore, we provide a fundamental guideline as a function of operational scenarios to address the fundamental question "when the DL MU-MIMO should be turned on/off".</description>

      <title>Fluid Antenna Grouping Index Modulation Design for MIMO Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11651v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Index modulation (IM) significantly enhances the spectral efficiency of fluid antennas (FAs) enabled multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, which is named FA-IM. However, due to the dense distribution of ports on the FA, the wireless channel exhibits a high spatial correlation, leading to severe performance degradation in the existing FA-IM-assisted MIMO systems. To tackle this issue, this paper proposes a novel fluid antenna grouping index modulation (FA-GIM) scheme to mitigate the high correlation between the activated ports. Specifically, considering the characteristics of the FA two-dimensional (2D) surface structure and the spatially correlated channel model in FA-assisted MIMO systems, a block grouping method is adopted, where adjacent ports are assigned to the same group. Consequently, different groups independently perform port index selection and constellation symbol mapping, with only one port being activated within each group during each transmission interval. Then, a closed-form average bit error probability (ABEP) upper bound for the proposed scheme is derived. Numerical results show that, compared to state-of-the-art schemes, the proposed FA-GIM scheme consistently achieves significant bit error rate (BER) performance gains under various conditions. The proposed scheme is both efficient and robust, enhancing the performance of FA-assisted MIMO systems.</description>

      <title>Wireless MAC Protocol Synthesis and Optimization with Multi-Agent Distributed Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05884v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this letter, we propose a novel Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning (MADRL) framework for Medium Access Control (MAC) protocol design. Unlike centralized approaches, which rely on a single entity for decision-making, MADRL empowers individual network nodes to autonomously learn and optimize their MAC based on local observations. Leveraging ns3-ai and RLlib, as far as we are aware of, our framework is the first of a kind that enables distributed multi-agent learning within the ns-3 environment, facilitating the design and synthesis of adaptive MAC protocols tailored to specific environmental conditions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the MADRL MAC framework through extensive simulations, showcasing superior performance compared to legacy protocols across diverse scenarios. Our findings highlight the potential of MADRL-based MAC protocols to significantly enhance Quality of Service (QoS) requirements for future wireless applications.</description>
