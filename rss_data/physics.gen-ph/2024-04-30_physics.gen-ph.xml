      <title>On spatial electron-photon entanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18936v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Free electron beams and their quantum coupling with photons is attracting a rising interest due to the basic questions it addresses and the cutting-edge technology these particles are involved in, such as microscopy, spectroscopy, and quantum computation. This work investigates theoretically the concept of electron-photon coupling in the spatial domain. Their interaction is discussed as a thought experiment of spontaneous photon emission from a dual-path free-electron (free-e) beam. We discuss a retro-causal paradox that may emerge from naively extending perceptions of single-path e-photon coupling to transversely separated paths, and its resolution through the physics of two-particle interference. The precise spatial control of electrons and photons within e-microscopes enables manipulation of their respective states, thus, such instruments can harness position-encoded free-e qubits for novel quantum sensing and the transfer of quantum information.</description>

      <title>Unification of the Gauge Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18937v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We take the Christoffel coefficients as an operator and introduce new mappings for quaternionic products to reach the theory of electrodynamics in general spacetime. With the help of the directional operator of the covariant derivative, we generalize the quaternioic mechanism to the theory of gravity and show that the Einstein equation has the freedom to choose the constant term in agreement with the covariant derivative.</description>

      <title>On the embedding of $C_3$ in $E_8$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I investigate the structure of $E_8$ under the action of the subalgebra/subgroup $A_1+G_2+C_3$, as a potential route to unification of the fundamental forces of nature into a single algebraic structure. The particular real form $E_{8(-24)}$ supports a decomposition into compact $G_2$ plus split $A_1+C_3$, which allows a restriction from $G_2$ to $SU(3)$ for QCD, together with split $SL_2(\mathbb R)$ to break the symmetry of the weak interaction and give mass to the bosons. The factor $C_3$ contains a copy of the Lorentz group $SL_2(\mathbb C)$ and extends the `spacetime' symmetries to the full group of symplectic symmetries of $3+3$-dimensional phase space.</description>

      <title>Photon frequency variation in non-linear electro-magnetism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We set a generalised non-linear Lagrangian, encompassing Born-Infeld and Heisenberg-Euler theories among others. The Lagrangian reduces to the Maxwell Lagrangian at lowest order. The field is composed by a propagating light-wave in an electro-magnetic background. The wave exhibits energy variation when the background is space-time dependent. In the photon description, this implies a red or a blue shift, like what we obtained in massive theories, as the de Broglie-Proca or effective mass theories as the Standard-Model Extension under Lorentz symmetry violation. The two results, photon energy-conservation and the frequency shift are instead new for non-linear electro-magnetism. We conclude by discussing how these static frequency shifts when added to the expansion red shift allow new interpretations in cosmology or for atomic spectra. We finally consider the consequences on the Poincar\'e symmetry.</description>

      <title>The Classical Point Particle Singularity: An Illusion in GR and Elsewhere!</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18954v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Singularities in Newton's gravity, in general relativity, GR, in Coulomb's law, and elsewhere in classical physics, stem from two ill conceived assumptions that, a) there are point-like entities with finite masses, charges, etc., packed in zero volumes, and b) the non-quantum assumption that these point-like entities can be assigned precise coordinates and momenta. In the case of GR, we argue that the classical energy-momentum tensor in Einstein's field equation is that of a collection of point particles and is prone to singularity. In compliance with Heisenberg's uncertainty principle, we propose replacing each constituent of the gravitating matter with a suitable quantum mechanical equivalent, here a Yukawa-ameliorated Klein-Gordon (YKG) field. YKG fields are spatially distributed entities. They do not end up in singular spacetime points nor predict singular blackholes. On the other hand, YKG waves reach infinity as $\frac{1}{r}e^{-(\kappa\pm i k)r}$. They create non-Newtonian and non-GR gravity forces that die out as $r^{-1}$ as opposed to $r^{-2}$. This feature alone is capable of explaining the observed flat rotation curves of spiral galaxies, and one may interpret them as alternative gravities, dark matter paradigms, etc. There are ample observational data encapsulated in the Tully-Fisher relation to support these conclusions.</description>

      <title>Space-Time Entropy, Space of Singularities and Gravity Origin: A Case Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.15335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.15335v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A new definition of entropy is introduced using a model that simulates an expanding space-time compatible with the fundamental principle of cosmology. The entropy is obtained by mean of a state function that measures the variation of the space-time normal curvature, from a highly compressed space to a lower compressed space. The defined entropy leads to work out a new understanding of the earliest conditions that last for a period estimated to 380 000 years after the Big Bang. It leads to understand via a short period of inflation the process that generates the uniform distribution of matter and energy at the surface of the last scattering. It involves gravitational singularities in a process of gradual decompression propitious to the incubation of matter recombination, and it allows to trace back gravity origin.</description>

      <title>(Pseudo-)Synthetic BRST quantisation of the bosonic string and the higher quantum origin of dualities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06522v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article I am arguing in favour of the hypothesis that the origin of gauge and string dualities in general can be found in a higher-categorical interpretation of basic quantum mechanics. It is interesting to observe that the Galilei group has a non-trivial cohomology, while the Lorentz/Poincare group has trivial cohomology. When we constructed quantum mechanics, we noticed the non-trivial cohomology structure of the Galilei group and hence, we required for a proper quantisation procedure that would be compatible with the symmetry group of our theory, to go to a central extension of the Galilei group universal covering by co-cycle. This would be the Bargmann group. However, Nature didn't choose this path. Instead in nature, the Galilei group is not realised, while the Lorentz group is. The fact that the Galilei group has topological obstructions leads to a central charge, the mass, and a superselection rule, required to implement the Galilei symmetry, that forbids transitions between states of different mass. The topological structure of the Lorentz group however lacks such an obstruction, and hence allows for transitions between states of different mass. The connectivity structure of the Lorentz group as opposed to that of the Galilei group can be interpreted in the sense of an ER=EPR duality for the topological space associated to group cohomology. In string theory we started with the Witt algebra, and due to similar quantisation issues, we employed the central extension by co-cycle to obtain the Virasoro algebra. This is a unique extension for orientation preserving diffeomorphisms on a circle, but there is no reason to believe that, at the high energy domain in physics where this would apply, we do not have a totally different structure altogether and the degrees of freedom present there would require something vastly more general and global.</description>
