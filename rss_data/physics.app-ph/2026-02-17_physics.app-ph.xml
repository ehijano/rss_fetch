      <title>Characterizing Secondary Neutrons at BLIP for Isotope Production Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13254v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fast secondary neutrons created at the Brookhaven Linac Isotope Producer (BLIP) facility following proton irradiation were characterized by the foil activation technique and compared with FLUKA Monte Carlo simulations. The FLUKA-simulated neutron flux was spectrally adjusted following the maximum entropy formalism using the International Reactor Dosimetry and Fusion File (IRDFF-II), with predictions agreeing with experimental measurements to within 9% following the adjustment procedure. A multitude of degrader configurations were simulated to assess the feasibility of improving the fast (En &gt; 20 MeV) secondary neutron yield at the proposed neutron target position (N-slot). A configuration where the N-slot is closest to the proton degrader produced the highest fast neutron yield, with tungsten degraders achieving the best performance. Assuming the optimized target-degrader configuration proposed in this work, we discuss potential isotope production opportunities with secondary neutrons. In most cases the yields are in the order of several mCi.</description>

      <title>The effect of graphene orientation on permeability and corrosion initiation under composite coatings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The unique anisotropic properties of graphene, particularly impermeability, have made it a promising candidate for further advances in corrosion prevention applications. Despite the large number of experimental works divulging the use of graphene in anticorrosion coatings, there is no report on the numerical modelling and simulation of the relationships between the orientation of graphene sheets in composite coatings and the introduced corrosion protection efficiency, to our knowledge. Herein, it is tried to model the influence of the orientation of graphene sheets dispersed in organic coatings on the diffusivity and flux of corrosive substances besides the corrosion initiation time of the protected substrates. To discover the relationship between the graphene orientation and corrosion-related phenomena, this study introduces a novel model consisting of a trigonometric factor named unprotected projected surface area proportion, which calculates corrosion-related parameters based on the principal Fick's laws. The model reveals that the decrease in the angle between graphene sheets and the substrate is highly beneficial for postponing the corrosion onset. It is accordingly estimated that a mismatch angle of 10 degree can slow down the diffusion process significantly and delay the corrosion initiation by around 65 times in a 100 micron thick epoxy/graphene composite coating in comparison to the counterpart with the perpendicular alignment. The predicted corrosion parameters were in a good agreement with the experimental data, indicating the merit of the proposed model. Thus, this model can be further employed as the fundamental of future research on the optimum graphene orientation in anticorrosion composite coatings.</description>

      <title>A Multi-Fidelity Bayesian Neural Operator for Mechanics of Spinodal Metamaterial</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13257v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cellular metamaterials offer a vast design space for tailoring nonlinear mechanical responses, yet exploring this space with conventional modeling approaches is often infeasible or not scalable. To fully exploit their nonlinear behavior for inverse design, it is essential to learn the full stress-strain response rather than relying on bulk quantities, motivating the use of neural operators for function-to-function mapping. However, data-driven modeling of nonlinear response for metamaterials is severely constrained by the limited availability of costly experimental data. Here, we propose a Bayesian multi-fidelity deep operator network that aggregates abundant low-fidelity finite element simulations with sparse high-fidelity experimental data from in-situ nanomechanical experiments on spinodal metamaterials, enabling heterogeneous information aggregation. A hybrid Bayesian active learning strategy is introduced to select informative samples by jointly maximizing epistemic uncertainty and geometric diversity of the microstructure, substantially reducing the cost of 3D nonlinear simulations. This approach adaptively trains the low-fidelity operator, which is then augmented by a high-fidelity Bayesian residual learner. We demonstrate that only 22 strategically selected samples from a design pool of 3000 are sufficient to achieve an 84.1 percent reduction in MSE compared to the high-fidelity baseline. The framework significantly outperforms single-fidelity baselines, providing superior predictions for full nonlinear stress-strain responses as well as stiffness, strength, and energy absorption. This work provides a robust, data-efficient pathway for the inverse design and constitutive modeling of cellular metamaterials.</description>

      <title>A Low-Dispersion Depressed Core Waveguide for Dielectric Waveguide Interconnects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14491v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dielectric waveguide (DWG) interconnects frequently utilize multimode waveguides due to their low dispersion in the fundamental mode. However, these links are more vulnerable to cross-modal coupling that significantly impacts their overall performance. This study presents a technique aimed at minimizing the coupling of energy into higher-order modes within weakly coupled rectangular dielectric waveguides that are excited by a linear taper. The approach involves wrapping the waveguide with a material of a higher dielectric constant than both the core and the cladding of the waveguide. The added material significantly improves the modal confinement factor of the fundamental mode to the core, leading to a much smaller coupling to the parasitic higher-order cladding modes. The new waveguide with the additional material cladding is analyzed, and semi-analytical approximate expressions are derived to predict the mode profiles and cutoffs. Design equations are given to choose the thickness of the wrapping material. The waveguide is fabricated and compared against a similar cross-section waveguide without the additional wrapping material. Unlike the unwrapped waveguide, the group delay (GD) results of the proposed (wrapped) waveguide closely match the EM-simulated GD of the fundamental mode, confirming the significant isolation of higher-order modes. The measured GD of the proposed DWG is 50 ps/m, while the expected fundamental mode GD from EM simulations is 35 ps/m. On the contrary, the unwrapped DWG shows a measured GD of 200 ps/m with significant oscillations, while the expected fundamental mode GD from EM simulations is 25 ps/m, demonstrating that wrapping the waveguide significantly improves the GD by reducing the higher-order mode propagation.</description>

      <title>Non-Hermitian Complex Coupling for Magnetic Resonance Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13260v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Strong coupling in wave-based systems often causes level repulsion, leading to mode splitting and reduced response at the target frequency. This problem is pronounced in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), where strong mutual inductance between a receive coil (RC) and a metamaterial (MM) degrades B1 performance. Here, we introduce a non-Hermitian complex-coupling decoupling strategy based on a dual-resonator model. By engineering a phase delay in the coupling pathway, an imaginary coupling component is created, driving the system from the PT-symmetric to the anti-PT-symmetric phase and enabling eigenmode degeneracy without added dissipation. Implemented through a high-permittivity ceramic layer, this mechanism restores single-mode resonance in the MM - RC system and suppresses frequency splitting. Simulations show a ~14-fold B1 enhancement compared with the strongly repulsive regime. This passive, compact, and hardware-compatible approach offers a general route for coupling control in electromagnetic, acoustic, optical, and quantum systems.</description>

      <title>A Minimal Nonlocal Theory of Thixotropic Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13464v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dense amorphous materials exhibit both nonlocal flow cooperativity and pronounced history dependence, yet existing continuum models capture only one of these features at a time. Nonlocal rheologies are intrinsically memoryless, while thixotropic models remain local. Here we introduce a coupling between structural memory and nonlocal fluidity to include aging and rejuvenation in nonlocal granular fluidity. The resulting model reproduces hysteresis in shear-rate sweeps and delayed yielding in creep, while preserving nonlocal flow profiles. By introducing memory augmented non local granular fluidity, MNGF, we show that nonlocality alone cannot encode history, and memory alone cannot encode spatial cooperativity, but their coupling is essential and minimal. These results demonstrate that memory and nonlocality must be treated jointly to describe history dependent flows, and provide a unified framework for modeling time-dependent rheology in dense amorphous materials.</description>

      <title>Josephson-like magnetic tunnel junction -- transition from classical to quantum regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13593v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We theoretically propose and analyze a Josephson-like magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ) structure that exhibits quantum spin dynamics analogous to those in superconducting Josephson junctions. By exploiting the isomorphism between the equations of motion for low-dissipation MTJs with easy-plane anisotropy and the Josephson phase dynamics, we construct a theoretical framework for realizing spintronic qubits. Within this framework, we identify the physical parameters -- such as anisotropy constants, Gilbert damping, spin current amplitude, and geometric factors -- that govern the transition from classical to quantum behavior. We show that different types of spintronic qubits, including analogs of charge, flux, and transmon superconducting qubits, can be implemented depending on the hierarchy of energy scales. A Hamiltonian formalism is developed for each regime, enabling an analytical treatment of the two-level quantum dynamics and estimation of coherence times. In particular, we demonstrate that the spin current can be used not only to excite but also to stabilize the qubit states through dissipation control. These findings provide a route toward integrating spintronic qubits into CMOS-compatible architectures and lay the groundwork for a fully spintronic platform for quantum computation.</description>

      <title>Surface defects in carbon-doped hexagonal boron nitride for negative-contrast direct laser writing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13657v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Radiative defects in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) are active in a broad spectral range from deep ultraviolet to near-infrared wavelengths. Representatives of these defects act as bright single photon sources, spin-1 systems, and multiproperty atomic-scale sensors. They are predominantly investigated in bulk hBN films, where defects are decoupled from surface and interfacial effects. Here, we demonstrate a novel class of surface defects optically active in the green/yellow visible spectral range, which exhibit photophysical properties distinct from their bulk counterparts. High-power resonant laser illumination quenched the emission from the ensemble of such defects, which was attributed to a light-driven structural reconfiguration. The quenched defects were found to recover their emissive capabilities via a thermal cycling process, revealing an activation energy of 24.5 meV for the structural transition. Alternatively, permanent quenching of the defects was triggered by surface chemistry, involving lithiation-enabled attachment of functional groups. These mechanisms were utilized to realize negative-contrast direct laser writing, designing arbitrary geometric emissive patterns on demand in a microscopic configuration. The surface-active radiative centers in hBN appear particularly attractive for exploring environmental sensitivity, surface science, and coupling to photonic structures or electronic devices by taking unique advantage of the two-dimensional characteristics of the host lattice.</description>

      <title>Quantitative models for excess carrier diffusion and recombination in STEM-EBIC experiments on semiconductor nanostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13711v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The increased complexity and reduced size of (opto-)electronic devices demands for quantitative descriptions of excess carrier transport and recombination via various mechanisms. In addition, experimental methods capable of resolving carrier dynamics on the nanometer scale are required. In this paper, we present a quantitative model of a confined geometry including recombination at two surfaces, which is very generic for electron beam induced current measurements in a scanning transmission electron microscope - a method which offers atomic scale spatial resolution. The model is based on analytical considerations as well as finite element simulations and underlying assumptions are subjected to an in-depth discussion. Finally, the successfull application to experimental data obtained on the complex oxide SrTi0.995Nb0.005O3 demonstrates the practicality and robustness of the approach, which enables the precise determination of its bulk diffusion length of L = 10.2 +- 0.1 nm.</description>

      <title>High-Fidelity Spatial Photonic Ising Machines via Precise Wavefront Shaping</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.13714v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ising machines are emerging as a powerful physical alternative to digital processors for solving combinatorial optimization problems. Among them, spatial photonic Ising machines (SPIMs) offer compact, room-temperature hardware with inherently parallel, energy efficient, single-shot optical evaluation of the Ising Hamiltonian. However, scalability has been fundamentally limited by optical aberrations and non-uniform illumination, which corrupt phase-based spin encoding and distort coupling representation, forcing operation to a restricted spatial light modulator (SLM) region. Here we introduce a high-precision full-aperture calibration scheme that overcomes these constraints. By implementing wavefront retrieval and correction with &lt; {\lambda}/40 accuracy, we restore faithful phase encoding across the entire SLM area. Furthermore, we introduce a novel interaction-normalization method, which compensates for amplitude curvature and enables uniform coupling representation. Together, these advances establish a high-fidelity, full-area SPIM architecture that unlocks true scalability and enables larger and more reliable photonic Ising computations.</description>

      <title>Implementation and Performance Evaluation of CMOS-integrated Memristor-driven Flip-flop Circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.13825v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we report implementation and performance evaluation of memristor-driven fundamental logic gates, including NOT, AND, NAND, OR, NOR, and XOR, and novel and optimized design of the sequential logic circuits, such as D flip-flop, T-flip-flop, JK-flip-flop, and SR-flip-flop. The design, implementation, and optimization of these logic circuits were performed in SPECTRE in Cadence Virtuoso and integrated with 90 nm CMOS technology node. Additionally, we discuss an optimized design of memristor-driven logic gates and sequential logic circuits, and draw a comparative analysis with the other reported state-of-the-art work on sequential circuits. Moreover, the utilized memristor framework was experimentally pre-validated with the experimental data of Y2O3-based memristive devices, which shows significantly low values of variability during switching in both device-to-device (D2D) and cycle-to-cycle (C2C) operation. The performance metrics were calculated in terms of area, power, and delay of these sequential circuits and were found to be reduced by more than ~24%, 60%, and 58%, respectively, as compared to the other state-of-the-art work on sequential circuits. Therefore, the implemented memristor-based design significantly improves the performance of various logic designs, which makes it more area and power-efficient and shows the potential of memristor in designing various low-power, low-cost, ultrafast, and compact circuits.</description>

      <title>Prompt-to-prescription: towards generative design of diffraction-limited refractive optics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.13893v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The design of high-performance optical systems remains a specialized domain gated by the limited availability of expert engineers, creating a bottleneck that stalls innovation despite the growing demand for imaging hardware. While deep learning has improved parameter optimization, it has yet to address the fundamental challenge of conceptualizing valid optical architectures from functional requirements. Here, we present an end-to-end generative framework that couples the semantic reasoning of Large Language Models (LLMs) with a differentiable ray-tracing engine to democratize the synthesis of diffraction-limited optical prescriptions. By treating optical design as a semantic-to-physical translation task, the system autonomously interprets prompts ranging from high-level end-user requests to rigorous technical specifications. We demonstrate the framework's versatility across three distinct regimes: (1) finite-conjugate industrial metrology systems, where the model autonomously enforces application-specific constraints such as telecentricity to achieve diffraction-limited performance; (2) a suite of infrared objectives (NIR, SWIR, and LWIR), demonstrating the framework's ability to synthesize valid topologies and optical prescriptions for non-visible spectral bands, and (3) complex aspheric mobile lenses, where the system successfully navigates the high-dimensional optimization landscape to produce high-resolution designs suitable for modern sensors. Validated against industry-standard simulation tools, these results establish a new paradigm for automated optical engineering, bridging the gap between semantic intent and physical realization.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic Bounds on Realizing Targeted MIMO Transfer Functions in Real-World Systems with Wave-Domain Programmability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14152v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A key question for most applications involving reconfigurable linear wave systems is how accurately a desired linear operator can be realized by configuring the system's tunable elements. The relevance of this question spans from hybrid-MIMO analog combiners via computational meta-imagers to programmable wave-domain signal processing. Yet, no electromagnetically consistent bounds have been derived for the fidelity with which a desired operator can be realized in a real-world reconfigurable wave system. Here, we derive such bounds based on an electromagnetically consistent multiport-network model (capturing mutual coupling between tunable elements) and accounting for real-world hardware constraints (lossy, 1-bit-programmable elements). Specifically, we formulate the operator-synthesis task as a quadratically constrained fractional-quadratic problem and compute rigorous fidelity upper bounds based on semidefinite relaxation. We apply our technique to three distinct experimental setups. The first two setups are, respectively, a free-space and a rich-scattering $4\times 4$ MIMO channel at 2.45 GHz parameterized by a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) comprising 100 1-bit-programmable elements. The third setup is a $4\times 4$ MIMO channel at 19 GHz from four feeds of a dynamic metasurface antenna (DMA) to four users. We systematically study how the achievable fidelity scales with the number of tunable elements, and we probe the tightness of our bounds by trying to find optimized configurations approaching the bounds with standard discrete-optimization techniques. We observe a strong influence of the coupling strength between tunable elements on our fidelity bound. For the two RIS-based setups, our bound attests to insufficient wave-domain flexibility for the considered operator synthesis.</description>

      <title>Competition for attention predicts good-to-bad tipping in AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14370v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: More than half the global population now carries devices that can run ChatGPT-like language models with no Internet connection and minimal safety oversight -- and hence the potential to promote self-harm, financial losses and extremism among other dangers. Existing safety tools either require cloud connectivity or discover failures only after harm has occurred. Here we show that a large class of potentially dangerous tipping originates at the atomistic scale in such edge AI due to competition for the machinery's attention. This yields a mathematical formula for the dynamical tipping point n*, governed by dot-product competition for attention between the conversation's context and competing output basins, that reveals new control levers. Validated against multiple AI models, the mechanism can be instantiated for different definitions of 'good' and 'bad' and hence in principle applies across domains (e.g. health, law, finance, defense), changing legal landscapes (e.g. EU, UK, US and state level), languages, and cultural settings.</description>

      <title>Convergent-Beam X-ray Crystallography</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.14402v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Molecular and polymeric crystals show a wide range of functional properties that arise from the interplay between the atomic-scale structure of their constituent molecules and the organization of these molecules within the crystal lattice at macroscopic length scales. X-ray diffraction can provide structural information at these disparate length scales, but usually only through experiments that address one or the other of molecular (or unit-cell) structure versus crystal structure. Consequently, the accuracy of determined molecular or polymer structures may be limited by unaccounted crystal inhomogeneities of the crystal lattice and the characterization of crystalline materials might not reveal the underlying causes of crystal morphology. Here we introduce X-ray convergent-beam diffraction to obtain spatially-resolved structural information from crystals by projection topographic imaging. Using highly focusing X-ray multilayer Laue lenses, we show that Bragg reflections can be mapped into tomographic images of the crystal, for the characterization of strain and defects at high resolution. We demonstrate how the crystal morphology obtained this way can be accounted for when determining structure factors as a function of position in the crystal. The approach may assist in studies such as diffusion and binding in MOFS, protein-drug binding, crystal growth, and the mechanical responses of photo-reactive or thermally driven dynamic crystals.</description>

      <title>Self-Viscophoresis: Autonomous Motion by Biasing Thermal Fluctuations via Self-Generated Viscosity Asymmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14475v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Microscale transport often relies on ubiquitous yet intrinsically random thermal fluctuations. Understanding how such fluctuations can be biased into directed motion has long been a central theme of nonequilibrium physics. Here, we introduce self-viscophoresis, a mechanism of autonomous motion based on the rectification of thermal fluctuations in a self-generated nonequilibrium viscosity field. Asymmetric colloidal particles dispersed in a thermoresponsive polymer solution induce local heating under uniform illumination, producing a spatially asymmetric viscosity profile around the particle and resulting in persistent directed motion. To elucidate the physical origin of this behavior, we develop a minimal Langevin model coupling isotropic thermal fluctuations to a dynamically updating temperature-viscosity field. The model shows that viscosity asymmetry anisotropically damps stochastic dynamics, effectively biasing thermal fluctuations into a net drift. It thus reproduces the observed directed motion without invoking deterministic propulsion terms associated with effective potentials or environmental fluid flows. Our results distinguish self-viscophoresis from conventional self-propulsion mechanisms and establish it as a general framework enabling reversible control of both the direction and dimensionality of motion.</description>

      <title>Exact Multi-Valley Envelope Function Theory of Valley Splitting in Si/SiGe Nanostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14787v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Valley splitting in strained Si/SiGe quantum wells is a central parameter for silicon spin qubits and is commonly described with envelope-function and effective-mass theories. These models provide a computationally efficient continuum description and have been shown to agree well with atomistic approaches when the confinement potential is slowly varying on the lattice scale. In modern Si/SiGe heterostructures with atomically sharp interfaces and engineered Ge concentration profiles, however, the slowly varying potential approximation underlying conventional (local) envelope-function theory is challenged. We formulate an exact multi-valley envelope-function model by combining Burt-Foreman-type envelope-function theory, which does not rely on the assumption of a slowly varying potential, with a valley-sector decomposition of the Brillouin zone. This construction enforces band-limited envelopes, which satisfy a set of coupled integro-differential equations with a non-local potential energy operator. Using degenerate perturbation theory, we derive the intervalley coupling matrix element within this non-local model and prove that it is strictly invariant under global shifts of the confinement potential (choice of reference energy). We then show that the conventional local envelope model generically violates this invariance due to spectral leakage between valley sectors, leading to an unphysical energy-reference dependence of the intervalley coupling. The resulting ambiguity is quantified by numerical simulations of various engineered Si/SiGe heterostructures. Finally, we propose a simple spectrally filtered local approximation that restores the energy-reference invariance exactly and provides a good approximation to the exact non-local theory.</description>

      <title>Split-Post Microwave Displacement Transducer with Quadratic Readout</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07305v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate a microwave cavity-based displacement readout employing a split-post geometry for measuring the motion of a dielectric membrane. The cavity response to membrane displacement is predominantly quadratic when the membrane is positioned at the centre of the posts. We characterise this behaviour by driving the membrane piezo electrically at both central and off-centre positions and calibrating the displacement using an independent interferometric measurement. The calibration reveals a linear coupling between the membrane displacement and the applied drive voltage, while the microwave response follows the static displacement dependence. When the membrane is driven at the centre, the system exhibits the highest displacement-to-voltage sensitivity and the largest quadratic output. As the membrane is moved away from the centre, the response gradually transitions from quadratic to linear. There is a difference of ~ 97 $\%$ in the quadratic coefficient from the central position and a difference of ~ 92 $\%$ in the linear coefficient from the off-centre position. This controllable crossover between quadratic and linear coupling is a key requirement for sensors capable of resolving energy quantisation. It establishes this platform as a promising candidate for a microwave-mechanical quantum transducer.</description>

      <title>Non-Hermitian curved space via inverted wave equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10937v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inverting design method of solving passive graded materials from predefined amplitude and phase was developed along the line of transformation optics (TO), which however precluded the presence of source and sink in the pragmatic world. So in this Letter we extend such an inverse method to non-Hermitian media, offering more freedom to manipulate the wave flows. Our principle of a curved-space analogue picture powered with gain and loss, is exemplified by three types: amplitude controlling, phase conversion, and direction shunting. These examples showcase precise wave manipulation in a surprisingly simple manner, which goes beyond convectional paradigms of TO and is readily implementable in realistic photonic platform.</description>
