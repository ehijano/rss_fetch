      <title>Observation of Young's double-slit phenomenon in anti-PT-symmetric electrical circuits</title>

Abstract: In the last few decades, interference has been extensively studied in both the quantum and classical fields, which reveals light volatility and is widely used for high-precision measurements. We have put forward the phenomenon in which the discrete diffraction and interference phenomena, presented by the time-varying voltage of a Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) circuit model with an anti-PT symmetry (APT) symmetry. To demonstrate Young's double-slit phenomenon in an APT circuit, we initially explore the coupled mode theory (CMT) of voltage in the broken phase, observe discrete diffraction under single excitation and interference under double excitations. Furthermore, we design a phase-shifting circuit to observe the effects of phase difference and distance on discrete interference. Our work combines the effects in optics with condensed matter physics, show the Young's double-slit phenomenon in electrical circuits theoretically and experimentally.</description>

      <title>Complexity of Supersymmetric Systems and the Cohomology Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.00011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2107.00011v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the complexity of the local Hamiltonian problem in the context of fermionic Hamiltonians with $\mathcal N=2 $ supersymmetry and show that the problem remains $\mathsf{QMA}$-complete. Our main motivation for studying this is the well-known fact that the ground state energy of a supersymmetric system is exactly zero if and only if a certain cohomology group is nontrivial. This opens the door to bringing the tools of Hamiltonian complexity to study the computational complexity of a large number of algorithmic problems that arise in homological algebra, including problems in algebraic topology, algebraic geometry, and group theory. We take the first steps in this direction by introducing the $k$-local Cohomology problem and showing that it is $\mathsf{QMA}_1$-hard and, for a large class of instances, is contained in $\mathsf{QMA}$. We then consider the complexity of estimating normalized Betti numbers and show that this problem is hard for the quantum complexity class $\mathsf{DQC}1$, and for a large class of instances is contained in $\mathsf{BQP}$. In light of these results, we argue that it is natural to frame many of these homological problems in terms of finding ground states of supersymmetric fermionic systems. As an illustration of this perspective we discuss in some detail the model of Fendley, Schoutens, and de Boer consisting of hard-core fermions on a graph, whose ground state structure encodes $l$-dimensional holes in the independence complex of the graph. This offers a new perspective on existing quantum algorithms for topological data analysis and suggests new ones.</description>

      <title>Theory of superconductivity in thin films under an external electric field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.13059v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The supercurrent field effect is experimentally realized in various nano-scale devices, based on the superconductivity suppression by external electric fields being effective for confined systems. In spite of intense research, a microscopic theory and explanation of this effect is missing. Here, a microscopic theory of phonon-mediated superconductivity in thin films is presented, which accounts for the effect of quantum confinement on the electronic density of states, on the Fermi energy, and on the topology of allowed states in momentum space. By further accounting for the interplay between quantum confinement, the external static electric field, the Thomas-Fermi screening in the electron-phonon matrix element, and the effect of confinement on the Coulomb repulsion parameter, the theory predicts the critical value of the external electric field as a function of the film thickness, above which superconductivity is suppressed. In particular, this critical value of the electric field is the lower the thinner the film, in agreement with recent experimental observations. Crucially, this effect is predicted by the theory when both Thomas-Fermi screening and the Coulomb pseudopotential are taken into account, along with the respective dependence on thin film thickness. This microscopic theory of the supercurrent field-effect opens up new possibilities for electric-field gated quantum materials.</description>

      <title>He-4 monolayer on Graphene: a Quantum Monte Carlo study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02033v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit the problem of adsorption of a single He-4 layer on graphene, focusing on the commensurate C1/3 crystalline phase, specifically on whether it may possess a nonzero superfluid response, and on the existence of superfluid phases, either (metastable) liquid or vacancy-doped crystalline. We make use of canonical Quantum Monte Carlo simulations at zero and finite temperature, based on a realistic microscopic model of the system. Our results confirm the absence of any superfluid response in the commensurate crystal, and that no thermodynamically stable uniform phase exists at lower coverage. No evidence of a possibly long-lived, metastable superfluid phase at C1/3 coverage is found. Altogether, the results of ground-state projection methods and finite-temperature simulations are entirely consistent.</description>

      <title>Doped stabilizer states in many-body physics and where to find them</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14912v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work uncovers a fundamental connection between doped stabilizer states, a concept from quantum information theory, and the structure of eigenstates in perturbed many-body quantum systems. We prove that for Hamiltonians consisting of a sum of commuting Pauli operators (i.e., stabilizer Hamiltonians) and a perturbation composed of a limited number of arbitrary Pauli terms, the eigenstates can be represented as doped stabilizer states with small stabilizer nullity. This result enables the application of stabilizer techniques to a broad class of many-body systems, even in highly entangled regimes. Building on this, we develop efficient classical algorithms for tasks such as finding low-energy eigenstates, simulating quench dynamics, preparing Gibbs states, and computing entanglement entropies in these systems. Our work opens up new possibilities for understanding the robustness of topological order and the dynamics of many-body systems under perturbations, paving the way for novel insights into the interplay of quantum information, entanglement, and many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Revealing the spatial nature of sublattice symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11398v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The sublattice symmetry on a bipartite lattice is commonly regarded as the chiral symmetry in the AIII class of the tenfold Altland-Zirnbauer classification. Here, we reveal the spatial nature of sublattice symmetry, and show that this assertion holds only if the periodicity of primitive unit cells agrees with that of the sublattice labeling. In cases where the periodicity does not agree, sublattice symmetry is represented as a glide reflection in energy-momentum space, which inverts energy and simultaneously translates some $k$ by $\pi$, leading to substantially different physics. Particularly, it introduces novel constraints on zero modes in semimetals and completely alters the classification table of topological insulators compared to class AIII. Notably, the dimensions corresponding to trivial and nontrivial classifications are switched, and the nontrivial classification becomes $\mathbb{Z}_2$ instead of $\mathbb{Z}$. We have applied these results to several models, including the Hofstadter model both with and without dimerization.</description>
