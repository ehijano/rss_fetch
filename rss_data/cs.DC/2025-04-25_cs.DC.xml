      <title>Sailor: Automating Distributed Training over Dynamic, Heterogeneous, and Geo-distributed Clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The high GPU demand of ML training makes it hard to allocate large homogeneous clusters of high-end GPUs in a single availability zone. Leveraging heterogeneous GPUs available within and across zones can improve throughput at a reasonable cost. However, training ML models on heterogeneous resources introduces significant challenges, such as stragglers and a large search space of possible job configurations. Current systems lack support for efficiently training models on heterogeneous resources. We present Sailor, a system that automates distributed training over heterogeneous, geo-distributed, and dynamically available resources. Sailor combines an efficient search space exploration algorithm, accurate runtime and memory footprint simulation, and a distributed training framework that supports different types of heterogeneity to optimize training throughput and cost.</description>

      <title>Parallelizing the Approximate Minimum Degree Ordering Algorithm: Strategies and Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The approximate minimum degree algorithm is widely used before numerical factorization to reduce fill-in for sparse matrices. While considerable attention has been given to the numerical factorization process, less focus has been placed on parallelizing the approximate minimum degree algorithm itself. In this paper, we explore different parallelization strategies, and introduce a novel parallel framework that leverages multiple elimination on distance-2 independent sets. Our evaluation shows that parallelism within individual elimination steps is limited due to low computational workload and significant memory contention. In contrast, our proposed framework overcomes these challenges by parallelizing the work across elimination steps. To the best of our knowledge, our implementation is the first scalable shared memory implementation of the approximate minimum degree algorithm. Experimental results show that we achieve up to an 8.30x speedup using 64 threads over the state-of-the-art sequential implementation in SuiteSparse.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Approximate Maximum Matching in the Distributed Vertex Partition Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We initiate the study of approximate maximum matching in the vertex partition model, for graphs subject to dynamic changes. We assume that the $n$ vertices of the graph are partitioned among $k$ players, who execute a distributed algorithm and communicate via message passing. An adaptive adversary may perform dynamic updates to the graph topology by inserting or removing edges between the nodes, and the algorithm needs to respond to these changes by adapting the output of the players, with the goal of maintaining an approximate maximum matching. The main performance metric in this setting is the algorithm's update time, which corresponds to the number of rounds required for updating the solution upon an adversarial change. For the standard setting of single-edge insertions and deletions, we obtain the following results:
  We give a randomized Las Vegas algorithm with an expected update time of $O( \frac{\sqrt{m}}{\beta k} )$ rounds that maintains a $\frac{2}{3}$-approximate maximum matching that is also maximal, where $m$ is the number of edges of the graph. We also show that any algorithm has a worst case update time of $\Omega( \frac{n}{\beta k^2\log n} )$, assuming a link bandwidth of $O(\beta\log n)$ bits per round, if it maintains a matching that is maximal and does not have any 3-augmenting paths. For batch-dynamic updates, where the adversary may modify up to $\ell\ge 1$ edges at once, we prove the following: There is a randomized algorithm that succeeds with high probability in maintaining a $\frac{2}{3}$-approximate maximum matching and has a worst case update time of $\Omega( \frac{\ell\log n}{\sqrt{\beta k}} )$ rounds. We show that $\Omega( \frac{\ell}{\beta k \log n} )$ poses a lower bound for maintaining a maximal matching without 3-augmenting paths.</description>

      <title>Shared Randomness in Locally Checkable Problems: The Role of Computational Assumptions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17583v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Shared randomness is a valuable resource in distributed computing, but what happens when the shared random string can affect the inputs to the system?
  Consider the class of distributed graph problems where the correctness of solutions can be checked locally, known as Locally Checkable Labelings (LCL). LCL problems have been extensively studied in the LOCAL model, where nodes operate in synchronous rounds and have access only to local information. This has led to intriguing insights regarding the power of private randomness. E.g., for certain round complexity classes, derandomization does not incur an overhead (asymptotically).
  This work considers a setting where the randomness is public. Recently, an LCL problem for which shared randomness can reduce the round complexity was discovered by Balliu et al. (2024). This result applies to inputs set obliviously of the shared randomness, which may not always be a plausible assumption.
  We define a model where the inputs can be adversarially chosen, even based on the shared randomness, which we now call preset public coins. We study LCL problems in the preset public coins model, under assumptions regarding the computational power of the adversary that selects the input. We show connections to hardness in the class TFNP. Our results are:
  1. Assuming the existence of a hard-on-average problem in TFNP (which follows from fairly benign cryptographic assumptions), we show an LCL problem that, in the preset public coins model, demonstrates a gap in the round complexity between polynomial-time adversaries and unbounded ones.
  2. If there exists an LCL problem for which the error probability is significantly higher when facing unbounded adversaries, then a hard-on-average problem in TFNP/poly must exist.</description>

      <title>TSUE: A Two-Stage Data Update Method for an Erasure Coded Cluster File System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17598v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Compared to replication-based storage systems, erasure-coded storage incurs significantly higher overhead during data updates. To address this issue, various parity logging methods have been pro- posed. Nevertheless, due to the long update path and substantial amount of random I/O involved in erasure code update processes, the resulting long latency and low throughput often fail to meet the requirements of high performance applications. To this end, we propose a two-stage data update method called TSUE. TSUE divides the update process into a synchronous stage that records updates in a data log, and an asynchronous stage that recycles the log in real-time. TSUE effectively reduces update latency by transforming random I/O into sequential I/O, and it significantly reduces recycle overhead by utilizing a three-layer log and the spatio-temporal locality of access patterns. In SSDs cluster, TSUE significantly im- proves update performance, achieving improvements of 7.6X under Ali-Cloud trace, 5X under Ten-Cloud trace, while it also extends the SSD's lifespan by up to 13X through reducing the frequencies of reads/writes and of erase operations.</description>

      <title>Cross-region Model Training with Communication-Computation Overlapping and Delay Compensation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17672v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) requires massive computational resources, often necessitating the aggregation of geographically distributed data centers (\ie, cross-region training). However, the high communication latency in wide-area networks severely degrades the efficiency of traditional distributed training. While methods like DiLoCo reduce communication frequency, they suffer from blocking synchronization. Streaming DiLoCo alleviates this issue via communication-computation overlapping but introduces update staleness and model inconsistency due to delayed global updates and partial synchronization. These factors impair convergence, especially when aggressive overlap is needed to mask high latency. We propose CoCoDC, a novel distributed training framework with communication-computation overlapping and delay compensation, to explicitly tackle these challenges. Within the CoCoDC framework, we specifically develop a novel Delay Compensation strategy based on Taylor expansion to effectively mitigate the staleness and an Adaptive Transmission strategy that dynamically schedules model fragment synchronization to optimize bandwidth usage and accelerate convergence. Extensive experiments highlight the superior performance of CoCoDC over both DiLoCo and Streaming DiLoCo regarding final accuracy and training speed. Specifically, CoCoDC reduces the training steps needed to reach a comparable perplexity by up to 21.0% compared to Streaming DiLoCo. Our work provides an effective solution for scalable and efficient cross-region LLM training.</description>

      <title>Optimized Cloud Resource Allocation Using Genetic Algorithms for Energy Efficiency and QoS Assurance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17675v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cloud computing environments demand dynamic and efficient resource management to ensure optimal performance, reduced energy consumption, and adherence to Service Level Agreements (SLAs). This paper presents a Genetic Algorithm (GA)-based approach for Virtual Machine (VM) placement and consolidation, aiming to minimize power usage while maintaining QoS constraints. The proposed method dynamically adjusts VM allocation based on real-time workload variations, outperforming traditional heuristics such as First Fit Decreasing (FFD) and Best Fit Decreasing (BFD). Experimental results show notable reductions in energy consumption, VM migrations, SLA violation rates, and execution time. A correlation heatmap further illustrates strong relationships among these key performance indicators, confirming the effectiveness of our approach in optimizing cloud resource utilization.</description>

      <title>Developing a Blockchain-Based Secure Digital Contents Distribution System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17194v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As digital content distribution expands rapidly through online platforms, securing digital media and protecting intellectual property has become increasingly complex. Traditional centralized systems, while widely adopted, suffer from vulnerabilities such as single points of failure and limited traceability of unauthorized access. This paper presents a blockchain-based secure digital content distribution system that integrates Sia, a decentralized storage network, and Skynet, a content delivery network, to enhance content protection and distribution. The proposed system employs a dual-layer architecture: off-chain for user authentication and on-chain for transaction validation using smart contracts and asymmetric encryption. By introducing a license issuance and secret block mechanism, the system ensures content authenticity, privacy, and controlled access. Experimental results demonstrate the feasibility and scalability of the system in securely distributing multimedia files. The proposed platform not only improves content security but also paves the way for future enhancements with decentralized applications and integrated royalty payment mechanisms.</description>

      <title>CHASe: Client Heterogeneity-Aware Data Selection for Effective Federated Active Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17448v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Active learning (AL) reduces human annotation costs for machine learning systems by strategically selecting the most informative unlabeled data for annotation, but performing it individually may still be insufficient due to restricted data diversity and annotation budget. Federated Active Learning (FAL) addresses this by facilitating collaborative data selection and model training, while preserving the confidentiality of raw data samples. Yet, existing FAL methods fail to account for the heterogeneity of data distribution across clients and the associated fluctuations in global and local model parameters, adversely affecting model accuracy. To overcome these challenges, we propose CHASe (Client Heterogeneity-Aware Data Selection), specifically designed for FAL. CHASe focuses on identifying those unlabeled samples with high epistemic variations (EVs), which notably oscillate around the decision boundaries during training. To achieve both effectiveness and efficiency, \model{} encompasses techniques for 1) tracking EVs by analyzing inference inconsistencies across training epochs, 2) calibrating decision boundaries of inaccurate models with a new alignment loss, and 3) enhancing data selection efficiency via a data freeze and awaken mechanism with subset sampling. Experiments show that CHASe surpasses various established baselines in terms of effectiveness and efficiency, validated across diverse datasets, model complexities, and heterogeneous federation settings.</description>

      <title>GRANITE : a Byzantine-Resilient Dynamic Gossip Learning Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17471v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gossip Learning (GL) is a decentralized learning paradigm where users iteratively exchange and aggregate models with a small set of neighboring peers. Recent GL approaches rely on dynamic communication graphs built and maintained using Random Peer Sampling (RPS) protocols. Thanks to graph dynamics, GL can achieve fast convergence even over extremely sparse topologies. However, the robustness of GL over dy- namic graphs to Byzantine (model poisoning) attacks remains unaddressed especially when Byzantine nodes attack the RPS protocol to scale up model poisoning. We address this issue by introducing GRANITE, a framework for robust learning over sparse, dynamic graphs in the presence of a fraction of Byzantine nodes. GRANITE relies on two key components (i) a History-aware Byzantine-resilient Peer Sampling protocol (HaPS), which tracks previously encountered identifiers to reduce adversarial influence over time, and (ii) an Adaptive Probabilistic Threshold (APT), which leverages an estimate of Byzantine presence to set aggregation thresholds with formal guarantees. Empirical results confirm that GRANITE maintains convergence with up to 30% Byzantine nodes, improves learning speed via adaptive filtering of poisoned models and obtains these results in up to 9 times sparser graphs than dictated by current theory.</description>

      <title>Communication-Efficient Personalized Distributed Learning with Data and Node Heterogeneity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17520v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To jointly tackle the challenges of data and node heterogeneity in decentralized learning, we propose a distributed strong lottery ticket hypothesis (DSLTH), based on which a communication-efficient personalized learning algorithm is developed. In the proposed method, each local model is represented as the Hadamard product of global real-valued parameters and a personalized binary mask for pruning. The local model is learned by updating and fusing the personalized binary masks while the real-valued parameters are fixed among different agents. To further reduce the complexity of hardware implementation, we incorporate a group sparse regularization term in the loss function, enabling the learned local model to achieve structured sparsity. Then, a binary mask aggregation algorithm is designed by introducing an intermediate aggregation tensor and adding a personalized fine-tuning step in each iteration, which constrains model updates towards the local data distribution. The proposed method effectively leverages the relativity among agents while meeting personalized requirements in heterogeneous node conditions. We also provide a theoretical proof for the DSLTH, establishing it as the foundation of the proposed method. Numerical simulations confirm the validity of the DSLTH and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.</description>

      <title>Aegis: Tethering a Blockchain with Primary-Chain Stake</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05904v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Blockchains implement decentralized monetary systems and applications. Recent advancements enable what we call tethering a blockchain to a primary blockchain, securing the tethered chain by nodes that post primary-chain tokens as collateral. The collateral ensures nodes behave as intended, until they withdraw it. Unlike a Proof of Stake blockchain which uses its own token as collateral, using primary-chain tokens shields the tethered chain from the volatility of its own token.
  State-of-the-art tethered blockchains either rely on centralization, or make extreme assumptions: that all communication is synchronous, that operators remain correct even post-withdrawal, or that withdrawals can be indefinitely delayed by tethered-chain failures.
  We prove that with partial synchrony, there is no solution to the problem. However, under the standard assumptions that communication with the primary chain is synchronous and communication among the tethered chain nodes is partially synchronous, there is a solution. We present a tethered-chain protocol called Aegis. Aegis uses references from its blocks to primary blocks to define committees, checkpoints on the primary chain to perpetuate decisions, and resets to establish new committees when previous ones become obsolete. It ensures safety at all times and rapid progress when latency among Aegis nodes is low.</description>

      <title>ReaL: Efficient RLHF Training of Large Language Models with Parameter Reallocation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14088v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is a pivotal technique for empowering large language model (LLM) applications. Compared with the supervised training process of LLMs, the RLHF training process is much more sophisticated, requiring a diverse range of computation workloads with intricate dependencies between multiple LLM instances. Therefore, simply adopting the fixed parallelization strategies from supervised training for LLMs can be insufficient for RLHF and result in low training efficiency. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel technique named parameter ReaLlocation, which dynamically adapts the parallelization strategies for different workloads during training by redistributing LLM parameters across the training cluster. Building upon this idea, we introduce ReaL, a pioneering system for efficient RLHF training. ReaL introduces the concept of an execution plan, which defines a fine-grained resource allocation and parallelization strategy particularly designed for RLHF training. Based on this concept, ReaL employs a tailored search algorithm with a lightweight run-time estimator to automatically discover an efficient execution plan for an instance of RLHF experiment. Subsequently, the runtime engine deploys the selected plan by effectively parallelizing computations and redistributing parameters. We evaluate ReaL on the LLaMA models with up to 70 billion parameters and 128 GPUs. The experimental results demonstrate that ReaL achieves speedups of up to $3.58\times$ compared to baseline methods. Furthermore, the execution plans generated by ReaL exhibit an average of $81\%$ performance improvement over heuristic approaches based on Megatron-LM in the long-context scenario. The source code of ReaL is publicly available at https://github.com/openpsi-project/ReaLHF .</description>

      <title>MEV Capture Through Time-Advantaged Arbitrage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10797v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As blockchains begin processing significant economic activity, the ability to include and order transactions inevitably becomes highly valuable, a concept known as Maximal Extractable Value (MEV). This makes effective mechanisms for transaction inclusion and ordering, and thereby the extraction of MEV, a key aspect of blockchain design. Beyond traditional approaches such as ordering in a first-come-first-serve manner or using priority fees, a recent proposal suggests auctioning off a time advantage for transaction inclusion. In this paper, we investigate this time advantage mechanism, focusing specifically on arbitrage opportunities on Automated Market Makers (AMMs), one of the largest sources of MEV today. We analyze the optimal strategy for a time-advantaged arbitrageur and compare the profits generated by various MEV extraction methods. Finally, we explore how AMMs can be adapted in the time advantage setting to capture a portion of the MEV.</description>

      <title>EPOCH: Enabling Preemption Operation for Context Saving in Heterogeneous FPGA Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16205v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: FPGAs are increasingly used in multi-tenant cloud environments to offload compute-intensive tasks from the main CPU. The operating system (OS) plays a vital role in identifying tasks suitable for offloading and coordinating between the CPU and FPGA for seamless task execution. The OS leverages preemption to manage CPU efficiently and balance CPU time; however, preempting tasks running on FPGAs without context loss remains challenging. Despite growing reliance on FPGAs, vendors have yet to deliver a solution that fully preserves and restores task context.
  This paper presents EPOCH, the first out-of-the-box framework to seamlessly preserve the state of tasks running on multi-tenant cloud FPGAs. EPOCH enables interrupting a tenant's execution at any arbitrary clock cycle, capturing its state, and saving this 'state snapshot' in off-chip memory with fine-grain granularity. Subsequently, when task resumption is required, EPOCH can resume execution from the saved 'state snapshot', eliminating the need to restart the task from scratch. EPOCH automates intricate processes, shields users from complexities, and synchronizes all underlying logic in a common clock domain, mitigating timing violations and ensuring seamless handling of interruptions.
  EPOCH proficiently captures the state of fundamental FPGA elements, such as look-up tables, flip-flops, block--RAMs, and digital signal processing units. On real hardware, ZynQ-XC7Z020 SoC, the proposed solution achieves context save and restore operations per frame in 62.2us and 67.4us, respectively.</description>

      <title>Honeybee: Byzantine Tolerant Decentralized Peer Sampling with Verifiable Random Walks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.16201v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Popular blockchains today have hundreds of thousands of nodes and need to be able to support sophisticated scaling solutions$\unicode{x2013}$such as sharding, data availability sampling, and layer-2 methods. Designing secure and efficient peer-to-peer (p2p) networking protocols at these scales to support the tight demands of the upper layer crypto-economic primitives is a highly non-trivial endeavor. We identify decentralized, uniform random sampling of nodes as a fundamental capability necessary for building robust p2p networks in emerging blockchain networks. Sampling algorithms used in practice today (primarily for address discovery) rely on either distributed hash tables (e.g., Kademlia) or sharing addresses with neighbors (e.g., GossipSub), and are not secure in a Sybil setting. We present Honeybee, a decentralized algorithm for sampling nodes that uses verifiable random walks and table consistency checks. Honeybee is secure against attacks even in the presence of an overwhelming number of Byzantine nodes (e.g., $\geq50\%$ of the network). We evaluate Honeybee through experiments and show that the quality of sampling achieved by Honeybee is significantly better compared to the state-of-the-art. Our proposed algorithm has implications for network design in both full nodes and light nodes.</description>

      <title>THEMIS: Time, Heterogeneity, and Energy Minded Scheduling for Fair Multi-Tenant Use in FPGAs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00507v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using correct design metrics and understanding the limitations of the underlying technology is critical to developing effective scheduling algorithms. Unfortunately, existing scheduling techniques used \emph{incorrect} metrics and had \emph{unrealistic} assumptions for fair scheduling of multi-tenant FPGAs where each tenant is aimed to share approximately the same number of resources both spatially and temporally.
  This paper introduces an enhanced fair scheduling algorithm for multi-tenant FPGA use, addressing previous metric and assumption issues, with three specific improvements claimed First, our method ensures spatiotemporal fairness by considering both spatial and temporal aspects, addressing the limitation of prior work that assumed uniform task latency. Second, we incorporate energy considerations into fairness by adjusting scheduling intervals and accounting for energy overhead, thereby balancing energy efficiency with fairness. Third, we acknowledge overlooked aspects of FPGA multi-tenancy, including heterogeneous regions and the constraints on dynamically merging/splitting partially reconfigurable regions. We develop and evaluate our improved fair scheduling algorithm with these three enhancements. Inspired by the Greek goddess of law and personification of justice, we name our fair scheduling solution THEMIS: \underline{T}ime, \underline{H}eterogeneity, and \underline{E}nergy \underline{Mi}nded \underline{S}cheduling.
  We used the Xilinx Zedboard XC7Z020 to quantify our approach's savings. Compared to previous algorithms, our improved scheduling algorithm enhances fairness between 24.2--98.4\% and allows a trade-off between 55.3$\times$ in energy vs. 69.3$\times$ in fairness. The paper thus informs cloud providers about future scheduling optimizations for fairness with related challenges and opportunities.</description>

      <title>DDU-Net: A Domain Decomposition-Based CNN for High-Resolution Image Segmentation on Multiple GPUs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21266v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The segmentation of ultra-high resolution images poses challenges such as loss of spatial information or computational inefficiency. In this work, a novel approach that combines encoder-decoder architectures with domain decomposition strategies to address these challenges is proposed. Specifically, a domain decomposition-based U-Net (DDU-Net) architecture is introduced, which partitions input images into non-overlapping patches that can be processed independently on separate devices. A communication network is added to facilitate inter-patch information exchange to enhance the understanding of spatial context. Experimental validation is performed on a synthetic dataset that is designed to measure the effectiveness of the communication network. Then, the performance is tested on the DeepGlobe land cover classification dataset as a real-world benchmark data set. The results demonstrate that the approach, which includes inter-patch communication for images divided into $16\times16$ non-overlapping subimages, achieves a $2-3\,\%$ higher intersection over union (IoU) score compared to the same network without inter-patch communication. The performance of the network which includes communication is equivalent to that of a baseline U-Net trained on the full image, showing that our model provides an effective solution for segmenting ultra-high-resolution images while preserving spatial context. The code is available at https://github.com/corne00/DDU-Net.</description>

      <title>SPAARC: Spatial Proximity and Association based prefetching for Augmented Reality in edge Cache</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15192v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mobile Augmented Reality (MAR) applications face performance challenges due to their high computational demands and need for low-latency responses. Traditional approaches like on-device storage or reactive data fetching from the cloud often result in limited AR experiences or unacceptable lag. Edge caching, which caches AR objects closer to the user, provides a promising solution. However, existing edge caching approaches do not consider AR-specific features such as AR object sizes, user interactions, and physical location. This paper investigates how to further optimize edge caching by employing AR-aware prefetching techniques. We present SPAARC, a Spatial Proximity and Association-based Prefetching policy specifically designed for MAR Caches. SPAARC intelligently prioritizes the caching of virtual objects based on their association with other similar objects and the user's proximity to them. It also considers the recency of associations and uses a lazy fetching strategy to efficiently manage edge resources and maximize Quality of Experience (QoE).
  Through extensive evaluation using both synthetic and real-world workloads, we demonstrate that SPAARC significantly improves cache hit rates compared to standard caching algorithms, achieving gains ranging from 3% to 40% while reducing the need for on-demand data retrieval from the cloud. Further, we present an adaptive tuning algorithm that automatically tunes SPAARC parameters to achieve optimal performance. Our findings demonstrate the potential of SPAARC to substantially enhance the user experience in MAR applications by ensuring the timely availability of virtual objects.</description>
