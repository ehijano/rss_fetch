      <title>Boundedness for maximal operators over hypersurfaces in $\mathbb{R}^3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06876v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we study maximal functions related to hypersurfaces with vanishing Gaussian curvature in $\mathbb{R}^3$. Firstly, we characterize the $L^p\rightarrow L^q$ boundedness of local maximal operators along homogeneous hypersurfaces. Moreover, weighted $L^p$-estimates are obtained for the corresponding global operators. Secondly, for a class of hypersurfaces that lack a homogeneous structure and pass through the origin, we attempt to look for other geometric properties instead of height of hypersurfaces to characterize the optimal $L^p$-boundedness of the corresponding global maximal operators.</description>

      <title>On the extension for Toeplitz matrices of certain Markov inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Starting from a doubly infinite sequence of complex numbers, the aim of this paper is to extend certain Markov inequalities for the determinant of Hankel matrices and the zeros of the corresponding orthogonal polynomials on the real line (A. Markov in Notes of the Imperial Academy of Sciences, St. Petersburg, 74 (Appendix n. 2) (1894) 1-30. English translation, by J. Shohat, Duke Math. J. 7 (1940), 85-96) to the Toeplitz case, where the central role is played by CD kernels and paraorthogonal polynomials on the unit circle. In particular, we consider the case in which the starting sequence is a two-sided P\'olya frequency sequence.</description>

      <title>Semiclassical orthogonal polynomials on the unit circle: A Riemann-Hilbert perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we apply Riemann-Hilbert problem to study two families of orthogonal polynomials on the unit circle, named of modified Jacobi and Bessel. We derive first and second order differential equations, for these families of orthogonal polynomials and functions of second kind, as well as nonlinear equations that the Verblunsky coefficients satisfy.</description>

      <title>On eventually greedy best underapproximations by Egyptian fractions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07218v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Erd\H{o}s and Graham found it conceivable that the best $n$-term Egyptian underapproximation of almost every positive number for sufficiently large $n$ gets constructed in a greedy manner, i.e., from the best $(n-1)$-term Egyptian underapproximation. We show that the opposite is true: the set of real numbers with this property has Lebesgue measure zero. [This note solves Problem 206 on Bloom's website "Erd\H{o}s problems".]</description>

      <title>Interpolating between Hausdorff and box dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07527v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hausdorff and box dimension are two familiar notions of fractal dimension. Box dimension can be larger than Hausdorff dimension, because in the definition of box dimension, all sets in the cover have the same diameter, but for Hausdorff dimension there is no such restriction. This thesis focuses on a family of dimensions parameterised by $\theta \in (0,1)$, called the intermediate dimensions, which are defined by requiring that $\mbox{diam}(U) \leq (\mbox{diam}(V))^{\theta}$ for all sets $U,V$ in the cover.
  We begin by generalising the intermediate dimensions to allow for greater refinement in how the relative sizes of the covering sets are restricted. These new dimensions can recover the interpolation between Hausdorff and box dimension for compact sets whose intermediate dimensions do not tend to the Hausdorff dimension as $\theta \to 0$. We also use a Moran set construction to prove a necessary and sufficient condition, in terms of Dini derivatives, for a given function to be realised as the intermediate dimensions of a set.
  We proceed to prove that the intermediate dimensions of limit sets of infinite conformal iterated function systems are given by the maximum of the Hausdorff dimension of the limit set and the intermediate dimensions of the set of fixed points of the contractions. This applies to sets defined using continued fraction expansions, and has applications to dimensions of projections, fractional Brownian images, and general H\"older images.
  Finally, we determine a formula for the intermediate dimensions of all self-affine Bedford-McMullen carpets. The functions display features not witnessed in previous examples, such as having countably many phase transitions. We deduce that two carpets have equal intermediate dimensions if and only if the multifractal spectra of the corresponding uniform Bernoulli measures coincide.</description>

      <title>On $L^{p}$-improving bounds for maximal operators associated with curves of finite type in the plane</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.02897v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the $L^{p}$-improving property for the maximal operators along a large class of curves of finite type in the plane with dilation set $E \subset [1,2]$. The $L^{p}$-improving region depends on the order of finite type and the fractal dimension of $E$. In particular, various impacts of non-isotropic dilations are also considered.</description>

      <title>Inequalities involving a measure of Marcell\'{a}n class and zeros of corresponding orthogonal polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.16014v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\tilde{\Phi}_n$ be a quasi-orthogonal polynomial of order 1 on the unit circle, obtained from an orthogonal polynomial $\Phi_n$ with measure $\mu$, which is in the Marcell\'{a}n class, if there exist another measure $\tilde{\mu}$ such that $\tilde{\Phi}_n$ is a monic orthogonal polynomial. This article aims to investigate various properties related to the Marcell\'{a}n class. At first, we study the behaviour of the zeros between $\Phi_n$ and $\tilde{\Phi}_n$. Along with numerical examples, we analyze the zeros of $\Phi_n$, its POPUC and the linear combination of the POPUC. Further, comparison of the norm inequalities among $\Phi_n$ and $\tilde{\Phi}_n$ are obtained by involving their measures. This leads to the study of the Lubinsky type inequality between the measures $\mu$ and $\tilde{\mu}$, without using the ordering relation between $\mu$ and $\tilde{\mu}$. Additionally, similar type of inequalities for the kernel type polynomials related to $\mu$ and $\tilde{\mu}$ are obtained.</description>

      <title>On gamma functions with respect to the alternating Hurwitz zeta functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02854v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In 1730, Euler defined the Gamma function $\Gamma(x)$ by the integral representation. It possesses many interesting properties and has wide applications in various branches of mathematics and sciences. According to Lerch, the Gamma function $\Gamma(x)$ can also be defined by the derivative of the Hurwitz zeta function $$\zeta(z,x)=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{1}{(n+x)^{z}}$$ at $z=0$. Recently, Hu and Kim defined the corresponding Stieltjes constants $\widetilde{\gamma}_{k}(x)$ and Euler constant $\widetilde{\gamma}_{0}$ from the Taylor series of the alternating Hurwitz zeta function $\zeta_{E}(z,x)$ $$\zeta_{E}(z,x)=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{(-1)^n}{(n+x)^z}.$$ And they also introduced the corresponding Gamma function $\widetilde{\Gamma}(x)$ which has the following Weierstrass--Hadamard type product $$\widetilde{\Gamma}(x)=\frac{1}{x}e^{\widetilde{\gamma}_{0}x}\prod_{k=1}^{\infty}\left(e^{-\frac{x}{k}}\left(1+\frac{x}{k}\right)\right)^{(-1)^{k+1}}.$$
  In this paper, we shall further investigate the function $\widetilde{\Gamma}(x)$, that is, we obtain several properties in analogy to the classical Gamma function $\Gamma(x)$, including the integral representation, the limit representation, the recursive formula, the special values, the log-convexity, the duplication formula and the reflection equation. Furthermore, we also prove a Lerch-type formula, which shows that the derivative of $\zeta_{E}(z,x)$ can be representative by $\widetilde\Gamma(x)$. As an application to Stark's conjecture in algebraic number theory, we will explicit calculate the derivatives of the partial zeta functions for the maximal real subfield of cyclotomic fields at $z=0$.</description>
