      <title>Unravelling inter-channel quantum interference in below-threshold nonsequential double ionization with statistical measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16135v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a systematic study of interchannel quantum interference in laser-induced nonsequential double ionization (NSDI) within the strong-field approximation. Focusing on the below-threshold intensity regime where the recollision-excitation with subsequent ionization (RESI) pathway dominates, we derive analytical phase conditions governing interference between distinct excitation channels for arbitrary driving fields. To quantify the interplay between channels resulting from a vast number of interfering processes, we introduce statistical metrics based on the Earth Mover's Distance, allowing us to assess the relative weight of each channel's contribution to the two-electron photoelectron momentum distributions (PMDs). We identify key factors that determine whether interchannel interference is appreciable such as comparable channel intensities, strong spatial overlap between the excited-state wavefunctions and the energy difference between contributing channels. We demonstrate that for linearly polarized few-cycle pulses, the typical intrachannel interference features associated with exchange, temporal shifts and combined exchange-temporal interference are retained with interchannel interference. Our findings establish a hierarchy of interference mechanisms in RESI and may provide practical guidelines for enhancing or suppressing interference in different regions of the momentum plane.</description>

      <title>Light shift suppression in a CPT magnetometer using linear polarization and double frequency interrogation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate a suppression of the light shift in a Coherent-Population-Trapping (CPT) atomic magnetometer by using linearly polarized light and a differential measurement between magnetic resonances. The radio frequency that creates the optical sidebands for CPT quickly switches between two magnetic sensitive transitions and the magnetic field is extrapolated from the difference of the center frequencies of the magnetic resonances. Light shifts and common drifts like collisional shifts can be suppressed through careful choice of measured resonances and we show the light shift reduction by more than a factor of 20 compared to excitation with circular polarized light. Various limitations to the method are discussed.</description>

      <title>Numerical modeling of laser cooling in molecules: From simple diatomics to polyatomics and radioactive species</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16203v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical Bloch equations and rate equations serve as powerful tools to model light-matter interactions from textbook-like two-level atoms to the complex internal dynamics of molecules. A particular challenge in this context is posed by molecular laser cooling, where many dozens or hundreds of levels need to be taken into account for a comprehensive modeling. Here, we present MoleCool, a numerically efficient Python toolbox to implement and solve the corresponding differential equation systems. We illustrate both the capabilities of the toolbox and some of the intricacies of molecular laser cooling by educational examples, which range from simple Rabi oscillations to spontaneous and coherent cooling schemes for various currently studied or considered molecular species. This includes, in particular, a comprehensive modeling of laser cooling dynamics with full hyperfine structure resolution in radioactive radium monofluoride (RaF), as well as studies of other complex species such as barium monofluoride (BaF) and ytterbium monohydroxide (YbOH).</description>

      <title>Perturbation-assisted Observation of the Lowest Vibrational Level of the $\mathrm{b}^{3}\Pi_{0}$ State of Ultracold LiK Molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The narrow transition from the lowest rovibrational level of the $\mathrm{X}^{1}\Sigma^{+}$ electronic ground state to the lowest vibrational level of the $\mathrm{b}^{3}\Pi_{0}$ potential provides opportunities for achieving magic-wavelength trapping of ultracold bialkali molecules for enhancing their rotational coherence times. Guided by existing spectroscopic data of several perturbed and deeply-bound rovibrational states of the $\mathrm{A}^{1}\Sigma^{+}$ potential [Grochola et al., Chem. Phys. Lett., 2012, 535, 17-20], we conducted a targeted spectroscopic search and report the first observation of the lowest vibrational level of the $\mathrm{b}^{3}\Pi_{0}$ state in $^{6}\mathrm{Li}^{40}\mathrm{K}$. The transition frequency from $|\mathrm{X}^{1}\Sigma^{+},\,v=0,\,J=0&gt;$ to $|\mathrm{b}^{3}\Pi_{0},\,v'=0,\,J'=1&gt;$ is determined to be 314,230.5(5)GHz. Assisted by microwave spectroscopy, we resolved the rotational structure of $|\mathrm{b}^{3}\Pi_{0},\,v'=0&gt;$ and extracted a rotational constant of $h\times8.576(44)$ GHz for the $\mathrm{b}^{3}\Pi_{0}$ state. From this, we deducted an energy separation between $|\mathrm{b}^{3}\Pi_{0},v'=0,J'=0&gt;$ and $|\mathrm{X}^{1}\Sigma^{+},v=0,J=0&gt;$ of $hc\times$10,481.03(2) $\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$. Our work provides timely and precise information on the deeply-bound region of the $\mathrm{b}^{3}\Pi_{0}$ triplet excited potential of LiK, and benefits future applications of ultracold LiK isotopologues in quantum simulation and quantum computation that demand long coherence times.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of Quantum Offset in Velocity Imaging-Based Electron Spectrometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17204v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Velocity-map imaging of electrons is a pivotal technique in chemical physics. A recent study reported a quantum offset as large as 0.2 cm-1 in velocity imaging-based electron spectrometry [Phys. Rev. Lett. 134, 043001 (2025)]. In this work, we assess the existence this offset through a combination of simulations and experiments. Our simulations reveal that the velocity imaging results reconstructed using the maximum entropy velocity Legendre reconstruction (MEVELER) method exhibit no such offset. Furthermore, experimental measurements of the electron affinity of oxygen conducted at various imaging voltages show no discernible offset attributable to the electric field in the photodetachment region. Therefore, we conclude that there is no evidence for the claimed quantum offset in properly analyzed velocity imaging-based electron spectrometry.</description>

      <title>Theory for the Rydberg states of helium: Results for $2 \le n \le 35$ and comparison with experiment for the singlet and triplet $P$-states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17495v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High precision variational calculations in Hylleraas coordinates are presented for all singlet and triplet $P$-states of helium up to principal quantum number $n = 35$ with a uniform accuracy of 1 part in $10^{22}$ for the nonrelativistic energy. Mass polarization, relativistic and quantum electrodynamic effects are included to achieve a final accuracy of $\pm$1 kHz or better for the ionization energy of the Rydberg states of $^4$He in the range $24\le n \le 35$. The results are combined with 11 transition frequency measurements of Clausen et al.\ Phys.\ Rev. A {\bf 111}, 012817 (2025) to obtain complementary measurements of the ionization energy of the $1s2s\;^3S_1$ state that do not depend on quantum defect extrapolations to the series limit. The result from the triplet spectrum yields an ionization energy of 1152\,842\,742.728(6) MHz, which agrees with but is larger than the experimental value by 14 $\pm$17 kHz. However, it confirms a much larger 9$\sigma$ discrepancy of $0.468\pm0.055$ MHz with the theoretical ionization energy of Patk\'o\v{s} et al.\ Phys.\ Rev.\ A {\bf 103}, 042809 (2021). The results provide a test of the quantum defect extrapolation method at the level of $\pm$17 kHz. (11 pages, 1 figure).</description>

      <title>Infrared Absorption and Laser Spectroscopy of Ho$^{3+}$ Doped K$_2$YF$_5$ Microparticles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16345v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-resolution absorption and laser spectroscopy are used to determine electronic energy levels for Ho$^{3+}$ ions in K$_2$YF$_5$ microparticles. A total of 72 crystal-field energy levels, distributed among 8 multiplets, are assigned. This optical data is used for crystal-field modelling of the electronic structure of Ho$^{3+}$ in K$_2$YF$_5$. Partially-resolved hyperfine splittings are accurately reproduced by the model. The temperature dependence of the fluorescent lifetime of the $^5$F$_5$ multiplet is measured and the temperature dependence of the non-radiative relaxation is modelled by a five-phonon process. Preliminary measurements of infra-red to visible upconversion in microparticles co-doped with Ho$^{3+}$ and Yb$^{3+}$ is reported.</description>

      <title>Triphoton generation near atomic resonance via SSWM: Harmonic expansion for accurate optical response</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16519v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum correlations of time-frequency-entangled photon pairs generated via parametric processes are critically influenced by both the linear and nonlinear optical responses of the medium. This sensitivity is especially significant in schemes utilizing atomic ensembles with well-defined energy level structures near resonance. However, conventional theoretical approaches often fall short in accurately calculating the optical responses--particularly when a single atomic transition is simultaneously driven by multiple light fields with (significantly) different intensities. To address this limitation, we generalize the harmonic expansion method originally introduced by Wen for biphoton generation near atomic resonance. As a case study, we apply this generalized approach to the reliable direct generation of time-energy-entangled W-state triphotons via spontaneous six-wave mixing in a five-level asymmetric-M atomic system. Our results demonstrate the method's superior accuracy and self-consistency, offering clear advantages over traditional calculation techniques.</description>

      <title>Fractatomic Physics: An Invitation with Atomic Stability and Rydberg States in Fractal Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16979v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the physical quantum properties of atoms in fractal spaces, both as a theoretical generalization of normal integer-dimensional Euclidean spaces and as an experimentally realizable setting. We identify the threshold of fractality at which Ehrenfest atomic instability emerges, where the Schr\"{o}dinger equation describing the wave-function of a single electron orbiting around an atom becomes scale-free, and discuss the potential of observing this phenomena in laboratory settings. We then study the Rydberg states of stable atoms using the Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin approximation, along with a proposed extension for the Langer modification, in general fractal dimensionalities. We show that fractal space atoms near instability explode in size even at low-number excited state, making them highly suitable to induce strong entanglements and foster long-range many-body interactions. We argue that atomic physics in fractal spaces -- ``fractatomic physics'' -- is a rich research avenue deserving of further theoretical and experimental investigations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.17020v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss the influence of collisions on the dynamics of an ultracold gas whose constituents interact via dipolar forces. This dynamics is governed by the elastic scattering cross section of the molecules, which is to some extent under the experimentalist's control. We compare side-by-side several different situations, highlighting their similarities and differences. These situations are collisions between: 1) point dipoles; 2) electric-field-shielded polar molecules; and 3) microwave-shielded polar molecules, including the effect of microwave ellipticity.</description>

      <title>Kinetically-induced bound states in a frustrated Rydberg tweezer array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17183v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding how particles bind into composite objects is a ubiquitous theme in physics, from the formation of molecules to hadrons in quantum chromodynamics and the pairing of charge carriers in superconductors. The formation of bound states usually originates from attractive interactions between particles. However, the binding can also arise purely from the motion of dopants due to kinetic frustration, which is potentially related to unconventional pairing in moir\'e materials. Here, we report the first direct observation of kinetically-induced bound states between holes and magnons using a Rydberg atom array quantum simulator of the bosonic $t$-$J$ model in frustrated ladders and 2D lattices. First, we demonstrate the formation of mobile one-hole-one-magnon bound states. We then construct three-particle one-hole-two-magnon bound states and reveal the underlying binding mechanism by observing kinetically-induced singlet correlations. Finally, we investigate how mobile dopants structure their magnetic environment in a spin-balanced 2D triangular lattice, showing that a hole induces $120^\circ$ antiferromagnetic order, while a doublon dopant generates in-plane ferromagnetic correlations. Our results demonstrates compelling evidence of kinetically-induced binding, opening a new avenue to understand novel pairing mechanisms in correlated quantum materials like superconductors in moir\'e superlattices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.17286v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the 'smooth gate', an entangling method for trapped-ion qubits where residual spin-motion entanglement errors are adiabatically eliminated by ramping the gate detuning. We demonstrate electronically controlled two-qubit gates with an estimated error of $8.4(7)\times10^{-5}$ without ground-state cooling. We further show that the error remains $\lesssim 5\times10^{-4}$ for ions with average phonon occupation up to $\bar{n}=9.4(3)$ on the gate mode. These results indicate that trapped-ion quantum computation can achieve high fidelity at temperatures above the Doppler limit, which enables faster and simpler device operation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.17461v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Light-matter coupled Hamiltonians are central to cavity materials engineering and polaritonic chemistry, but are challenging to simulate with classical hardware due to the scaling of the Hilbert space with the number of quantum photon modes and matter complexity. Leveraging the fact that quantum computers naturally represent photonic modes efficiently, we present a novel approach to simulate quantum-electrodynamical (QED) systems on near-term quantum hardware. After developing the bosonic and mixed operators in the Qiskit Nature framework, we employ them to simulate a first-order Trotterized Hamiltonian for a spontaneous-emission problem of a two-level system in an optical cavity. We find that using a standing-waves photonic basis approach leads to fidelity issues due to hardware connectivity constraints and two-qubits gates errors. Hence, we propose using a localized photonic basis approach that enforces nearest-neighbor couplings, thanks to which we can map the Hamiltonian as a 1D qubit chain. We significantly reduce the noise and, by applying the zero-noise extrapolation error mitigation technique, we recover the accurate quantum dynamics. Finally, we also show that this approach is resilient when relaxing the 1D qubit chain approximation.</description>

      <title>Fault-tolerant dynamically-decoupled hyper-Ramsey spectroscopy of ultra-narrow clock transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23091v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hyper-Ramsey protocols effectively reduce AC-Stark shifts in probing ultra-narrow optical clock transitions but they remain sensitive to laser intensity noise, decoherence, frequency drifts, and low-frequency perturbations. We address these limitations by incorporating dynamical decoupling, using sequences of rotary Hahn-echo pulses that toggle the probe frequency detuning and phase between opposite signs. Implementing time-optimized Eulerian cycling circuits of multiple refocusing pulses, we generate high-contrast hyper-Ramsey interferences that are completely free from AC-Stark shifts and robust against environmental noise and laser probe parameters imperfections. Fault- tolerant dynamically-decoupled SU(2) hyper-clocks are a significant step toward universal, noise-resilient quantum sensors, enabling fault-tolerant metrology for searches about new physics beyond the Standard Model.</description>

Abstract: We investigate resonance-enhanced high harmonic generation (rHHG) in Cr+ by comparing a 1D shape-resonant model, time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT), and independent particle approximation (IPA) simulations. Previous studies linked rHHG to the 3p -&gt; 3d giant resonance, suggesting a modified four-step model where recolliding electrons are first captured in the autoionizing state before recombining into the ground state, potentially leading to an emission delay associated with the resonance lifetime. While both the 1D-model and TDDFT reproduce experimental spectra, TDDFT reveals that rHHG counterintuitively originates from spin-down 3p states, while spin-up 3d electrons negligibly contribute. The IPA fails to reproduce rHHG, highlighting the significance of electron correlations. Furthermore, TDDFT revealed a correlation induced ~480 attosecond time delay, accompanied by a strong phase shift across the resonance, potentially explaining earlier RABBIT measurements. Our work sheds light on long-standing open questions in rHHG and should advance novel ultrafast spectroscopies of electron correlations and resonances.</description>

      <title>Controlling few-body reaction pathways using a Feshbach resonance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14922v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gaining control over chemical reactions on the quantum level is a central goal of the modern field of cold and ultracold chemistry. Here, we demonstrate a novel method to coherently steer reaction flux of a three-body recombination process across different product spin channels. For this, we employ a magnetically-tunable Feshbach resonance to admix, in a controlled way, a specific spin state to the reacting collision complex. This allows for the control of the reaction flux into the admixed spin channel, which can be used to significantly change the reaction products. Furthermore, we also investigate the influence of an Efimov resonance on the reaction dynamics. We find that while the Efimov resonance can be used to globally enhance three-body recombination, the relative flux between the reaction channels remains unchanged. Our control scheme is general and can be extended to other reaction processes. It also provides new opportunities in combination with other control schemes, such as quantum interference of reaction paths.</description>

      <title>Observable Resonances in Efimov-unfavored Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16374v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Three-body loss resonances associated with heavy-heavy-light Efimov states have been observed for over a decade in ultracold mixtures tuned near interspecies Feshbach resonances. For light-light-heavy systems, observing such resonances has been far more challenging due to the substantially large Efimov spacing. In these Efimov-unfavored systems, the intraspecies scattering length $a_\text{BB}$ has been shown to significantly affect the overall Efimov scenario, namely, the positions of the Efimov resonances $a_{-}^{(n)}$ and the three-body parameter (3BP) $a_{-}^{(0)}$. The present article explains the origin behind this influence by highlighting two primary mechanisms via which both the magnitude and sign of $a_\text{BB}$ govern the Efimov spectrum and set the resulting 3BP $a_{-}^{(0)}$. By employing van der Waals interactions for $^{23}$Na$_2{}^{40}$K, we attribute the vital role of $a_\text{BB}$ in Efimov-unfavored systems to the large difference between the Efimov scaling parameters for two and three resonant interactions, $s_0$ and $s_0^*$. In particular, we account for the unusually large $a_{-}^{(0)}$ obtained in light-light-heavy systems with $a_\text{BB}&gt;0$ (e.g., $^{41}$K$_2{}^{87}$Rb), and show that the first Efimov resonance can still occur at an experimentally accessible value when $a_\text{BB}&lt;0$.</description>

      <title>Observation of modulation-induced Feshbach resonance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06871v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we observe a novel resonant mechanism, namely the modulation-induced Feshbach resonance. By applying a far-detuned laser to the cesium D2 transition with intensity modulation, we periodically shake the energy levels of atomic collisional states. This periodic shaking connects the free-scattering states to shallow molecular states. At specific frequencies, we observe significant atom loss, which corresponds to the resonant coupling between these two types of states. This precisely corresponds to a form of Feshbach resonance, yet in the frequency domain rather than the magnetic-field domain. Using this method, we can directly scan the energy spectrum of molecular bound states without synthesizing any molecules. In addition to these bound states, we can also probe the molecular states embedded in the continuum, which are typically very difficult to detect by the conventional methods based on molecular synthesis. Moreover, by using a far-detuned laser instead of a magnetic field coil, it enables spatially dependent control over atomic interactions, coupling multiple levels simultaneously, and inducing new Feshbach resonances for those atoms that do not have conventional magnetic resonances. Therefore, we believe that this new resonant mechanism offers new opportunities for controlling atomic and molecular interactions in quantum simulations.</description>

      <title>Nucleon Electric Dipole Moments in Paramagnetic Molecules through Effective Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14933v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Electric dipole moment (EDM) measurements using paramagnetic molecules have significantly advanced over the last decade. Traditionally, these experiments have been analyzed in terms of the electron EDM. However, paramagnetic molecules are also sensitive to hadronic sources of charge-parity (CP) violation, highlighting the need for a new framework to interpret the experimental results. In this Letter, we introduce an effective field theory framework to relate molecular EDMs to the EDMs of neutrons and protons. We identify the dominant contributions through power counting and pinpoint the necessary nuclear matrix elements. As a practical application, we employ the nuclear shell model to calculate these nuclear matrix elements for the polar molecule BaF. Finally, we estimate the limits on the nucleon EDMs set by current molecular EDM experiments.</description>
