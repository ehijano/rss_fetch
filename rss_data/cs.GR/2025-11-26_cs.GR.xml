      <title>DOGE: Differentiable Bezier Graph Optimization for Road Network Extraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19850v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Automatic extraction of road networks from aerial imagery is a fundamental task, yet prevailing methods rely on polylines that struggle to model curvilinear geometry. We maintain that road geometry is inherently curve-based and introduce the B\'ezier Graph, a differentiable parametric curve-based representation. The primary obstacle to this representation is to obtain the difficult-to-construct vector ground-truth (GT). We sidestep this bottleneck by reframing the task as a global optimization problem over the B\'ezier Graph. Our framework, DOGE, operationalizes this paradigm by learning a parametric B\'ezier Graph directly from segmentation masks, eliminating the need for curve GT. DOGE holistically optimizes the graph by alternating between two complementary modules: DiffAlign continuously optimizes geometry via differentiable rendering, while TopoAdapt uses discrete operators to refine its topology. Our method sets a new state-of-the-art on the large-scale SpaceNet and CityScale benchmarks, presenting a new paradigm for generating high-fidelity vector maps of road networks. We will release our code and related data.</description>

      <title>VibraVerse: A Large-Scale Geometry-Acoustics Alignment Dataset for Physically-Consistent Multimodal Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20422v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the physical world requires perceptual models grounded in physical laws rather than mere statistical correlations. However, existing multimodal learning frameworks, focused on vision and language, lack physical consistency and overlook the intrinsic causal relationships among an object's geometry, material, vibration modes, and the sounds it produces. We introduce VibraVerse, a large-scale geometry-acoustics alignment dataset that explicitly bridges the causal chain from 3D geometry -&gt; physical attributes -&gt; modal parameters -&gt; acoustic signals. Each 3D model has explicit physical properties (density, Young's modulus, Poisson's ratio) and volumetric geometry, from which modal eigenfrequencies and eigenvectors are computed for impact sound synthesis under controlled excitations. To establish this coherence, we introduce CLASP, a contrastive learning framework for cross-modal alignment that preserves the causal correspondence between an object's physical structure and its acoustic response. This framework enforces physically consistent alignment across modalities, ensuring that every sample is coherent, traceable to the governing equations, and embedded within a unified representation space spanning shape, image, and sound. Built upon VibraVerse, we define a suite of benchmark tasks for geometry-to-sound prediction, sound-guided shape reconstruction, and cross-modal representation learning. Extensive validations on these tasks demonstrate that models trained on VibraVerse exhibit superior accuracy, interpretability, and generalization across modalities. These results establish VibraVerse as a benchmark for physically consistent and causally interpretable multimodal learning, providing a foundation for sound-guided embodied perception and a deeper understanding of the physical world. The dataset will be open-sourced.</description>

      <title>MotionV2V: Editing Motion in a Video</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20640v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While generative video models have achieved remarkable fidelity and consistency, applying these capabilities to video editing remains a complex challenge. Recent research has explored motion controllability as a means to enhance text-to-video generation or image animation; however, we identify precise motion control as a promising yet under-explored paradigm for editing existing videos. In this work, we propose modifying video motion by directly editing sparse trajectories extracted from the input. We term the deviation between input and output trajectories a "motion edit" and demonstrate that this representation, when coupled with a generative backbone, enables powerful video editing capabilities. To achieve this, we introduce a pipeline for generating "motion counterfactuals", video pairs that share identical content but distinct motion, and we fine-tune a motion-conditioned video diffusion architecture on this dataset. Our approach allows for edits that start at any timestamp and propagate naturally. In a four-way head-to-head user study, our model achieves over 65 percent preference against prior work.

      <title>MAMM: Motion Control via Metric-Aligning Motion Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19976v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a novel method for controlling a motion sequence using an arbitrary temporal control sequence using temporal alignment. Temporal alignment of motion has gained significant attention owing to its applications in motion control and retargeting. Traditional methods rely on either learned or hand-craft cross-domain mappings between frames in the original and control domains, which often require large, paired, or annotated datasets and time-consuming training. Our approach, named Metric-Aligning Motion Matching, achieves alignment by solely considering within-domain distances. It computes distances among patches in each domain and seeks a matching that optimally aligns the two within-domain distances. This framework allows for the alignment of a motion sequence to various types of control sequences, including sketches, labels, audio, and another motion sequence, all without the need for manually defined mappings or training with annotated data. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through applications in efficient motion control, showcasing its potential in practical scenarios.</description>

      <title>MeshSplat: Generalizable Sparse-View Surface Reconstruction via Gaussian Splatting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17811v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Surface reconstruction has been widely studied in computer vision and graphics. However, existing surface reconstruction works struggle to recover accurate scene geometry when the input views are extremely sparse. To address this issue, we propose MeshSplat, a generalizable sparse-view surface reconstruction framework via Gaussian Splatting. Our key idea is to leverage 2DGS as a bridge, which connects novel view synthesis to learned geometric priors and then transfers these priors to achieve surface reconstruction. Specifically, we incorporate a feed-forward network to predict per-view pixel-aligned 2DGS, which enables the network to synthesize novel view images and thus eliminates the need for direct 3D ground-truth supervision. To improve the accuracy of 2DGS position and orientation prediction, we propose a Weighted Chamfer Distance Loss to regularize the depth maps, especially in overlapping areas of input views, and also a normal prediction network to align the orientation of 2DGS with normal vectors predicted by a monocular normal estimator. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our proposed improvement, demonstrating that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in generalizable sparse-view mesh reconstruction tasks.

      <title>High Resolution UDF Meshing via Iterative Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17212v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Unsigned Distance Fields (UDFs) are a natural implicit representation for open surfaces but, unlike Signed Distance Fields (SDFs), are challenging to triangulate into explicit meshes. This is especially true at high resolutions where neural UDFs exhibit higher noise levels, which makes it hard to capture fine details. Most current techniques perform within single voxels without reference to their neighborhood, resulting in missing surface and holes where the UDF is ambiguous or noisy. We show that this can be remedied by performing several passes and by reasoning on previously extracted surface elements to incorporate neighborhood information. Our key contribution is an iterative neural network that does this and progressively improves surface recovery within each voxel by spatially propagating information from increasingly distant neighbors. Unlike single-pass methods, our approach integrates newly detected surfaces, distance values, and gradients across multiple iterations, effectively correcting errors and stabilizing extraction in challenging regions. Experiments on diverse 3D models demonstrate that our method produces significantly more accurate and complete meshes than existing approaches, particularly for complex geometries, enabling UDF surface extraction at higher resolutions where traditional methods fail.</description>

      <title>Controllable Layer Decomposition for Reversible Multi-Layer Image Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16249v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work presents Controllable Layer Decomposition (CLD), a method for achieving fine-grained and controllable multi-layer separation of raster images. In practical workflows, designers typically generate and edit each RGBA layer independently before compositing them into a final raster image. However, this process is irreversible: once composited, layer-level editing is no longer possible. Existing methods commonly rely on image matting and inpainting, but remain limited in controllability and segmentation precision. To address these challenges, we propose two key modules: LayerDecompose-DiT (LD-DiT), which decouples image elements into distinct layers and enables fine-grained control; and Multi-Layer Conditional Adapter (MLCA), which injects target image information into multi-layer tokens to achieve precise conditional generation. To enable a comprehensive evaluation, we build a new benchmark and introduce tailored evaluation metrics. Experimental results show that CLD consistently outperforms existing methods in both decomposition quality and controllability. Furthermore, the separated layers produced by CLD can be directly manipulated in commonly used design tools such as PowerPoint, highlighting its practical value and applicability in real-world creative workflows.

      <title>Temporally Compressed 3D Gaussian Splatting for Dynamic Scenes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05700v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in high-fidelity dynamic scene reconstruction have leveraged dynamic 3D Gaussians and 4D Gaussian Splatting for realistic scene representation. However, to make these methods viable for real-time applications such as AR/VR, gaming, and rendering on low-power devices, substantial reductions in memory usage and improvements in rendering efficiency are required. While many state-of-the-art methods prioritize lightweight implementations, they struggle in handling {scenes with complex motions or long sequences}. In this work, we introduce Temporally Compressed 3D Gaussian Splatting (TC3DGS), a novel technique designed specifically to effectively compress dynamic 3D Gaussian representations. TC3DGS selectively prunes Gaussians based on their temporal relevance and employs gradient-aware mixed-precision quantization to dynamically compress Gaussian parameters. In addition, TC3DGS exploits an adapted version of the Ramer-Douglas-Peucker algorithm to further reduce storage by interpolating Gaussian trajectories across frames. Our experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that TC3DGS achieves up to 67$\times$ compression with minimal or no degradation in visual quality. More results and videos are provided in the supplementary. Project Page: https://ahmad-jarrar.github.io/tc-3dgs/</description>

      <title>RLZero: Direct Policy Inference from Language Without In-Domain Supervision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05718v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The reward hypothesis states that all goals and purposes can be understood as the maximization of a received scalar reward signal. However, in practice, defining such a reward signal is notoriously difficult, as humans are often unable to predict the optimal behavior corresponding to a reward function. Natural language offers an intuitive alternative for instructing reinforcement learning (RL) agents, yet previous language-conditioned approaches either require costly supervision or test-time training given a language instruction. In this work, we present a new approach that uses a pretrained RL agent trained using only unlabeled, offline interactions--without task-specific supervision or labeled trajectories--to get zero-shot test-time policy inference from arbitrary natural language instructions. We introduce a framework comprising three steps: imagine, project, and imitate. First, the agent imagines a sequence of observations corresponding to the provided language description using video generative models. Next, these imagined observations are projected into the target environment domain. Finally, an agent pretrained in the target environment with unsupervised RL instantly imitates the projected observation sequence through a closed-form solution. To the best of our knowledge, our method, RLZero, is the first approach to show direct language-to-behavior generation abilities on a variety of tasks and environments without any in-domain supervision. We further show that components of RLZero can be used to generate policies zero-shot from cross-embodied videos, such as those available on YouTube, even for complex embodiments like humanoids.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.23738v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a framework for generating music-synchronized, choreography aware animal dance videos. Our framework introduces choreography patterns -- structured sequences of motion beats that define the long-range structure of a dance -- as a novel high-level control signal for dance video generation. These patterns can be automatically estimated from human dance videos. Starting from a few keyframes representing distinct animal poses, generated via text-to-image prompting or GPT-4o, we formulate dance synthesis as a graph optimization problem that seeks the optimal keyframe structure to satisfy a specified choreography pattern of beats. We also introduce an approach for mirrored pose image generation, essential for capturing symmetry in dance. In-between frames are synthesized using an video diffusion model. With as few as six input keyframes, our method can produce up to 30 seconds dance videos across a wide range of animals and music tracks.</description>
