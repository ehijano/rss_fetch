      <title>Experimental Demonstration of a Superconductor SFQ-Based ADC for High-Frequency Signal Acquisition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14191v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDs) are among the most sensitive sensors, offering high precision through their well-defined flux-voltage characteristics. Building on this sensitivity, we designed, fabricated, and experimentally demonstrated a superconducting single flux quantum (SFQ)-based analog-to-digital converter (ADC) capable of detecting small variations in input current signals at high frequencies and converting them into SFQ pulse trains. To improve robustness and reduce errors, the design incorporates a majority circuit and two types of counters: asynchronous toggle flip-flop-based and synchronous cumulative-based, at the cryogenic stage. The counter collects the SFQ pulse train and converts it into a binary number, simplifying downstream digital readout. The circuits were implemented using the AIST CRAVITY (QuFab) HSTP process and successfully tested in our cryocooler system, validating both the design methodology and operation. This approach helps build a fully integrated system that combines digital SQUID functionality with cryogenic readout circuits on a single chip.</description>

      <title>Superconductivity in UTe$_2$ from local noncentrosymmetricity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14259v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superconductivity in UTe$_{2}$ has garnered significant attention, as it is widely recognized as a promising candidate for a spin-triplet superconductor. However, the symmetry of superconductivity and the microscopic origin of spin-triplet pairing remain subjects of debate. Nevertheless, various experiments imply an intimate coupling between magnetism and superconductivity. In this paper, we analyze a multi-sublattice periodic Anderson model that incorporates a spin-orbit coupling allowed in locally noncentrosymmetric crystals to discuss magnetic fluctuations and superconductivity in UTe$_2$. Due to the sublattice-dependent spin-orbit coupling, magnetic fluctuations become anisotropic, and the spin degeneracy of superconducting states is lifted. Our calculations reveal anisotropic antiferromagnetic fluctuations along the $b$- and $c$-axes, anisotropic ferromagnetic fluctuations along the $a$-axis, and their coexistence. These can be tuned by the $f$-electron's level. Superconductivity in the $A_u$ representation is predominant for a wide range of parameters, whereas the $B_{2u}$ representation is almost degenerate and can be stabilized. The direction of the $d$-vector changes as we increase the spin-orbit coupling. We discuss the consistency between our results and several experiments.</description>

      <title>Multi-orbital Dirac superconductors and their realization of higher-order topology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological nodal superconductors (SCs) have attracted considerable interest due to their gapless bulk excitations and exotic surface states. In this paper, by establishing a general framework of the effective theory for multi-orbital SCs, we realize a class of three-dimensional (3D) time-reversal (T )-invariant Dirac SCs, with their topologically protected gapless Dirac nodes being located at general positions in the Brillouin zone. By introducing T -breaking pairing perturbations, we demonstrate the existence of Majorana hinge modes in these Dirac SCs as evidence of their realization of higher-order topology. We also propose a new kind of T -breaking Dirac SCs, whose Dirac nodes possess nonzero even chiralities and so are characterized by surface Majorana arcs.</description>

      <title>Effect of decorating NiO nanoparticles on superconducting properties of YBCO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14322v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The influence of adding 23 nm NiO nanoparticles on the magnetic hysteresis loops and critical current density of the high-temperature superconductor YBa2Cu3O7-d has been investigated. The samples were prepared using a fast annealing method that prevents chemical interaction between the components and does not reduce the critical temperature of the superconductor. Compared to the undoped YBCO sample, the critical current density increases in the samples doped with NiO nanoparticles in magnetic fields greater than 6 kOe. The sample containing 0.5 weight percent of NiO nanoparticles exhibits the greatest enhancement in critical current density at 10 kOe (1.36 times greater than the undoped sample).</description>

      <title>Quasiclassical theory of vortex states in locally non-centrosymmetric superconductors: application to CeRh$_{2}$As$_{2}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14452v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: CeRh$_{2}$As$_{2}$, a heavy fermion superconductor discovered in 2021, exhibits two distinct superconducting phases under a $c$-axis magnetic field. This unconventional phase diagram has been attributed to the local inversion symmetry breaking at the Ce sites. At low magnetic fields, a conventional even-parity spin-singlet superconducting state is realized, whereas at higher fields, an odd-parity spin-singlet superconducting state, in which the order parameter alternates sign between neighboring Ce layers, becomes stabilized. In this study, we employ a quasiclassical approach to investigate the vortex states of bilayer superconductors with locally broken inversion symmetry. We calculate the local density of states (LDOS) in the vortex lattice state and find that the pairing symmetry of different superconducting states is clearly manifested in the peak structure of LDOS at the vortex core. Since LDOS is experimentally observable, our work provides a pathway for experimental verification of the superconducting parity transition in CeRh$_{2}$As$_{2}$.</description>

      <title>Crossed surface flat bands in three-dimensional superconducting altermagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superconducting altermagnets have proven to be a promising ground for emergent phenomena but their study has involved two dimensional systems. In this work, we investigate three-dimensional $d$- and $g$-wave altermagnets with chiral $d$-wave superconductivity and show the formation of crossed surface flat bands due to the underlying symmetries. We find that these crossed flat bands appear at zero energy in the surface along $z$ due to the superconducting nodal lines in the $xy$-plane, while the number of corners is determined by the crystal symmetry of altermagnets. We also show that the superconducting nodal lines give rise to Bogoliubov-Fermi surfaces, which then affect the appearance of zero-energy arcs in the surface along $x$. Moreover, we demonstrate that the crossed surface flat bands, surface arcs, and Bogoliubov-Fermi surfaces give rise to distinct signals in charge conductance, hence offering a solid way for their detection and paving the way for realizing higher dimensional topological phases using altermagnets.</description>

      <title>Josephson diode effect via a non-equilibrium Rashba system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05671v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A non-equilibrium state in a Rashba system under an in-plane magnetic field is identified as the origin of the Josephson diode effect. This state is induced by a current bias--necessary for measuring the current-voltage characteristics--which shifts the Fermi momentum away from equilibrium. This essential mechanism has been overlooked in previous studies. This oversight stems from the implicit assumption that the equilibrium-based formulations are sufficient to describe Josephson effect. We formulate the Josephson coupling via the non-equilibrium Rashba system under current bias using a tunneling Hamiltonian, where the Rashba system is modeled as one-dimensional. When the magnetic field is applied perpendicular to the current, the Josephson coupling becomes asymmetric, giving rise to the diode effect. The magnitude and sign of this effect depend on the distance between the superconducting electrodes $d$, the in-plane magnetic field, and the spin-orbit coupling strength. Our results clarify the microscopic origin of the Josephson diode effect, which can be optimized by tuning $d$.</description>

      <title>Synthetic fractional flux quanta in a ring of superconducting qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06511v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A ring of capacitively coupled transmons threaded by a synthetic magnetic field is studied as a realization of a strongly interacting bosonic system. The synthetic flux is imparted through a specific Floquet modulation scheme based on a suitable periodic sequence of Lorentzian pulses that are known as 'Levitons'. Such scheme has the advantage to preserve the translation invariance of the system and to work at the qubit sweet spots. We employ this system to demonstrate the concept of fractional values of flux quanta. Although such fractionalization phenomenon was originally predicted for bright solitons in cold atoms, it may be in fact challenging to access with that platform. Here, we show how fractional flux quanta can be read out in the absorption spectrum of a suitable 'scattering experiment' in which the qubit ring is driven by microwaves.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking the quality of multiplexed qubit readout beyond assignment fidelity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08589v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The accurate measurement of quantum two-level objects (qubits) is crucial for developing quantum computers. Over the last decade, the measure of choice for benchmarking readout routines for superconducting qubits has been assignment fidelity. However, this method only focuses on the preparation of computational basis states and therefore does not provide a complete characterization of the readout. Here, we expand the focus to the use of detector tomography to fully characterize multiqubit readout of superconducting transmon qubits. The impact of different readout parameters on the rate of information extraction is studied using quantum state reconstruction infidelity as a proxy. The results are then compared with assignment fidelities, showing good agreement for separable two-qubit states. We therefore propose the rate of infidelity convergence as a validation tool for assignment fidelity and a more comprehensive benchmark for single- and multiqubit readout optimization. To make the best use of experimental resources, we investigate the most efficient distribution of a limited shot budget between detector tomography and state reconstruction within the context of single- and two-qubit experiments. To address the growing interest in three-qubit gates and test scalability of the validation tool, we perform three-qubit quantum state tomography that goes beyond conventional readout-error-mitigation methods and find a factor of 30 reduction in quantum infidelity. Our results demonstrate that qubit readout correlations are not induced by a significantly reduced state distinguishability. Consequently, correlation coefficients can serve as a valuable tool in qubit readout optimization.</description>
