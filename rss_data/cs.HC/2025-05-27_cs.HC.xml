      <title>The Relational Origins of Rules in Online Communities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18318v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Where do rules come from in online communities? While prior studies of online community governance in social computing have sought to characterize rules by their functions within communities and documented practices of rule enforcement, they have largely overlooked rule adoption and change. This study investigates how and why online communities adopt and change their rules. We conducted a grounded theory-based analysis of 40 in-depth interviews with community leaders from subreddits, Fandom wikis, and Fediverse servers, and identified seven processes involved in the adoption of online community rules. Our findings reveal that, beyond regulating behavior and solving functional intra-community problems, rules are also adopted and changed for relational reasons, such as signaling or reinforcing community legitimacy and identity to other communities. While rule change was often prompted by challenges during community growth or decline, change also depended on volunteer leaders' work capacity, the presence of member feedback mechanisms, and relational dynamics between leaders and members. The findings extend prior theories from social computing and organizational research, illustrating how institutionalist and ecological explanations of the relational origins of rules complement more functional accounts. The results also support design recommendations that integrate the relational aspects of rules and rulemaking to facilitate successful governance across communities' lifecycles.</description>

      <title>Human-Centered AI Communication in Co-Creativity: An Initial Framework and Insights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18385v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Effective communication between AI and humans is essential for successful human-AI co-creation. However, many current co-creative AI systems lack effective communication, which limits their potential for collaboration. This paper presents the initial design of the Framework for AI Communication (FAICO) for co-creative AI, developed through a systematic review of 107 full-length papers. FAICO presents key aspects of AI communication and their impact on user experience, offering preliminary guidelines for designing human-centered AI communication. To improve the framework, we conducted a preliminary study with two focus groups involving skilled individuals in AI, HCI, and design. These sessions sought to understand participants' preferences for AI communication, gather their perceptions of the framework, collect feedback for refinement, and explore its use in co-creative domains like collaborative writing and design. Our findings reveal a preference for a human-AI feedback loop over linear communication and emphasize the importance of context in fostering mutual understanding. Based on these insights, we propose actionable strategies for applying FAICO in practice and future directions, marking the first step toward developing comprehensive guidelines for designing effective human-centered AI communication in co-creation.</description>

      <title>From Reddit to Generative AI: Evaluating Large Language Models for Anxiety Support Fine-tuned on Social Media Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18464v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growing demand for accessible mental health support, compounded by workforce shortages and logistical barriers, has led to increased interest in utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs) for scalable and real-time assistance. However, their use in sensitive domains such as anxiety support remains underexamined. This study presents a systematic evaluation of LLMs (GPT and Llama) for their potential utility in anxiety support by using real user-generated posts from the r/Anxiety subreddit for both prompting and fine-tuning. Our approach utilizes a mixed-method evaluation framework incorporating three main categories of criteria: (i) linguistic quality, (ii) safety and trustworthiness, and (iii) supportiveness. Results show that fine-tuning LLMs with naturalistic anxiety-related data enhanced linguistic quality but increased toxicity and bias, and diminished emotional responsiveness. While LLMs exhibited limited empathy, GPT was evaluated as more supportive overall. Our findings highlight the risks of fine-tuning LLMs on unprocessed social media content without mitigation strategies.</description>

      <title>Applying Ontologies and Knowledge Augmented Large Language Models to Industrial Automation: A Decision-Making Guidance for Achieving Human-Robot Collaboration in Industry 5.0</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18553v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has resulted in interest in their potential applications within manufacturing systems, particularly in the context of Industry 5.0. However, determining when to implement LLMs versus other Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, ontologies or knowledge graphs, remains an open question. This paper offers decision-making guidance for selecting the most suitable technique in various industrial contexts, emphasizing human-robot collaboration and resilience in manufacturing. We examine the origins and unique strengths of LLMs, ontologies, and knowledge graphs, assessing their effectiveness across different industrial scenarios based on the number of domains or disciplines required to bring a product from design to manufacture. Through this comparative framework, we explore specific use cases where LLMs could enhance robotics for human-robot collaboration, while underscoring the continued relevance of ontologies and knowledge graphs in low-dependency or resource-constrained sectors. Additionally, we address the practical challenges of deploying these technologies, such as computational cost and interpretability, providing a roadmap for manufacturers to navigate the evolving landscape of Language based AI tools in Industry 5.0. Our findings offer a foundation for informed decision-making, helping industry professionals optimize the use of Language Based models for sustainable, resilient, and human-centric manufacturing. We also propose a Large Knowledge Language Model architecture that offers the potential for transparency and configuration based on complexity of task and computing resources available.</description>

      <title>SPIRAL integration of generative AI in an undergraduate creative media course: effects on self-efficacy and career outcome expectations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18771v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Computing education and computing students are rapidly integrating generative AI, but we know relatively little about how different pedagogical strategies for intentionally integrating generative AI affect students' self-efficacy and career interests. This study investigates a SPIRAL integration of generative AI (Skills Practiced Independently, Revisited with AI Later), implemented in an introductory undergraduate creative media and technology course in Fall 2023 (n=31). Students first developed domain skills for half the semester, then revisited earlier material integrating using generative AI, with explicit instruction on how to use it critically and ethically. We contribute a mixed methods quantitative and qualitative analysis of changes in self-efficacy and career interests over time, including longitudinal qualitative interviews (n=9) and thematic analysis. We found positive changes in both students' creative media self-efficacy and generative AI use self-efficacy, and mixed changes for ethical generative AI use self-efficacy. We also found students experienced demystification, transitioning from initial fear about generative AI taking over their fields and jobs, to doubting AI capability to do so and/or that society will push back against AI, through personal use of AI and observing others' use of AI vicariously. For career interests, our SPIRAL integration of generative AI use appeared to have either a neutral or positive influence on students, including widening their perceived career options, depending on their view of how AI would influence the career itself. These findings suggest that careful pedagogical sequencing can mitigate some potential negative impacts of AI, while promoting ethical and critical AI use that supports or has a neutral effect on students' career formation. To our knowledge our SPIRAL integration strategy applied to generative AI integration is novel.</description>

      <title>Literature review on assistive technologies for people with Parkinson's disease</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18862v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Parkinson's Disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that significantly impacts motor and non-motor functions. There is currently no treatment that slows or stops neurodegeneration in PD. In this context, assistive technologies (ATs) have emerged as vital tools to aid people with Parkinson's and significantly improve their quality of life. This review explores a broad spectrum of ATs, including wearable and cueing devices, exoskeletons, robotics, virtual reality, voice and video-assisted technologies, and emerging innovations such as artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), and the Internet of Things (IoT). The review highlights ATs' significant role in addressing motor symptoms such as freezing of gait (FOG) and gait and posture disorders. However, it also identifies significant gaps in addressing non-motor symptoms such as sleep dysfunction and mental health. Similarly, the research identifies substantial potential in the further implementation of deep learning, AI, IOT technologies. Overall, this review highlights the transformative potential of AT in PD management while identifying gaps that future research should address to ensure personalized, accessible, and effective solutions.</description>

      <title>Toward Human Centered Interactive Clinical Question Answering System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18928v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unstructured clinical notes contain essential patient information but are challenging for physicians to search and interpret efficiently. Although large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in question answering (QA), most existing systems lack transparency, usability, and alignment with clinical workflows. This work introduces an interactive QA system that enables physicians to query clinical notes via text or voice and receive extractive answers highlighted directly in the note for traceability.
  The system was built using OpenAI models with zero-shot prompting and evaluated across multiple metrics, including exact string match, word overlap, SentenceTransformer similarity, and BERTScore. Results show that while exact match scores ranged from 47 to 62 percent, semantic similarity scores exceeded 87 percent, indicating strong contextual alignment even when wording varied.
  To assess usability, the system was also evaluated using simulated clinical personas. Seven diverse physician and nurse personas interacted with the system across scenario-based tasks and provided structured feedback. The evaluations highlighted strengths in intuitive design and answer accessibility, alongside opportunities for enhancing explanation clarity.</description>

      <title>Agentic Visualization: Extracting Agent-based Design Patterns from Visualization Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19101v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autonomous agents powered by Large Language Models are transforming AI, creating an imperative for the visualization field to embrace agentic frameworks. However, our field's focus on a human in the sensemaking loop raises critical questions about autonomy, delegation, and coordination for such \textit{agentic visualization} that preserve human agency while amplifying analytical capabilities. This paper addresses these questions by reinterpreting existing visualization systems with semi-automated or fully automatic AI components through an agentic lens. Based on this analysis, we extract a collection of design patterns for agentic visualization, including agentic roles, communication and coordination. These patterns provide a foundation for future agentic visualization systems that effectively harness AI agents while maintaining human insight and control.</description>

      <title>What do Blind and Low-Vision People Really Want from Assistive Smart Devices? Comparison of the Literature with a Focus Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19325v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the last decade there has been considerable research into how artificial intelligence (AI), specifically computer vision, can assist people who are blind or have low-vision (BLV) to understand their environment. However, there has been almost no research into whether the tasks (object detection, image captioning, text recognition etc.) and devices (smartphones, smart-glasses etc.) investigated by researchers align with the needs and preferences of BLV people. We identified 646 studies published in the last two and a half years that have investigated such assistive AI techniques. We analysed these papers to determine the task, device and participation by BLV individuals. We then interviewed 24 BLV people and asked for their top five AI-based applications and to rank the applications found in the literature. We found only a weak positive correlation between BLV participants' perceived importance of tasks and researchers' focus and that participants prefer conversational agent interface and head-mounted devices.</description>

      <title>Knoll: Creating a Knowledge Ecosystem for Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19335v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models are designed to encode general purpose knowledge about the world from Internet data. Yet, a wealth of information falls outside this scope -- ranging from personal preferences to organizational policies, from community-specific advice to up-to-date news -- that users want models to access but remains unavailable. In this paper, we propose a knowledge ecosystem in which end-users can create, curate, and configure custom knowledge modules that are utilized by language models, such as ChatGPT and Claude. To support this vision, we introduce Knoll, a software infrastructure that allows users to make modules by clipping content from the web or authoring shared documents on Google Docs and GitHub, add modules that others have made, and rely on the system to insert relevant knowledge when interacting with an LLM. We conduct a public deployment of Knoll reaching over 200 users who employed the system for a diverse set of tasks including personalized recommendations, advice-seeking, and writing assistance. In our evaluation, we validate that using Knoll improves the quality of generated responses.</description>

      <title>It's Not Just Labeling" -- A Research on LLM Generated Feedback Interpretability and Image Labeling Sketch Features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19419v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quality of training data is critical to the performance of machine learning applications in domains like transportation, healthcare, and robotics. Accurate image labeling, however, often relies on time-consuming, expert-driven methods with limited feedback. This research introduces a sketch-based annotation approach supported by large language models (LLMs) to reduce technical barriers and enhance accessibility. Using a synthetic dataset, we examine how sketch recognition features relate to LLM feedback metrics, aiming to improve the reliability and interpretability of LLM-assisted labeling. We also explore how prompting strategies and sketch variations influence feedback quality. Our main contribution is a sketch-based virtual assistant that simplifies annotation for non-experts and advances LLM-driven labeling tools in terms of scalability, accessibility, and explainability.</description>

      <title>Fairness Practices in Industry: A Case Study in Machine Learning Teams Building Recommender Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid proliferation of recommender systems necessitates robust fairness practices to address inherent biases. Assessing fairness, though, is challenging due to constantly evolving metrics and best practices. This paper analyzes how industry practitioners perceive and incorporate these changing fairness standards in their workflows. Through semi-structured interviews with 11 practitioners from technical teams across a range of large technology companies, we investigate industry implementations of fairness in recommendation system products. We focus on current debiasing practices, applied metrics, collaborative strategies, and integrating academic research into practice. Findings show a preference for multi-dimensional debiasing over traditional demographic methods, and a reliance on intuitive rather than academic metrics. This study also highlights the difficulties in balancing fairness with both the practitioner's individual (bottom-up) roles and organizational (top-down) workplace constraints, including the interplay with legal and compliance experts. Finally, we offer actionable recommendations for the recommender system community and algorithmic fairness practitioners, underlining the need to refine fairness practices continually.</description>

      <title>SACM: SEEG-Audio Contrastive Matching for Chinese Speech Decoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19652v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Speech disorders such as dysarthria and anarthria can severely impair the patient's ability to communicate verbally. Speech decoding brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) offer a potential alternative by directly translating speech intentions into spoken words, serving as speech neuroprostheses. This paper reports an experimental protocol for Mandarin Chinese speech decoding BCIs, along with the corresponding decoding algorithms. Stereo-electroencephalography (SEEG) and synchronized audio data were collected from eight drug-resistant epilepsy patients as they conducted a word-level reading task. The proposed SEEG and Audio Contrastive Matching (SACM), a contrastive learning-based framework, achieved decoding accuracies significantly exceeding chance levels in both speech detection and speech decoding tasks. Electrode-wise analysis revealed that a single sensorimotor cortex electrode achieved performance comparable to that of the full electrode array. These findings provide valuable insights for developing more accurate online speech decoding BCIs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.20068v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Shared understanding plays a key role in the effective communication in and performance of human-human interactions. With the increasingly common integration of AI into human contexts, the future of personal and workplace interactions will likely see human-AI interaction (HAII) in which the perception of shared understanding is important. Existing literature has addressed the processes and effects of PSU in human-human interactions, but the construal remains underexplored in HAII. To better understand PSU in HAII, we conducted an online survey to collect user reflections on interactions with a large language model when it sunderstanding of a situation was thought to be similar to or different from the participant's. Through inductive thematic analysis, we identified eight dimensions comprising PSU in human-AI interactions: Fluency, aligned operation, fluidity, outcome satisfaction, contextual awareness, lack of humanlike abilities, computational limits, and suspicion.</description>

      <title>Understanding and Supporting Co-viewing Comedy in VR with Embodied Expressive Avatars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Co-viewing videos with family and friends remotely has become prevalent with the support of communication channels such as text messaging or real-time voice chat. However, current co-viewing platforms often lack visible embodied cues, such as body movements and facial expressions. This absence can reduce emotional engagement and the sense of co-presence when people are watching together remotely. Although virtual reality (VR) is an emerging technology that allows individuals to participate in various social activities while embodied as avatars, we still do not fully understand how this embodiment in VR affects co-viewing experiences, particularly in terms of engagement, emotional contagion, and expressive norms. In a controlled experiment involving eight triads of three participants each (N=24), we compared the participants' perceptions and reactions while watching comedy in VR using embodied expressive avatars that displayed visible laughter cues. This was contrasted with a control condition where no such embodied expressions were presented. With a mixed-method analysis, we found that embodied laughter cues shifted participants' engagement from individual immersion to socially coordinated participation. Participants reported heightened self-awareness of emotional expression, greater emotional contagion, and the development of expressive norms surrounding co-viewers' laughter. The result highlighted the tension between individual engagement and interpersonal emotional accommodation when co-viewing with embodied expressive avatars.</description>

      <title>Explanation User Interfaces: A Systematic Literature Review</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.20085v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) is one of the major technological advancements of this century, bearing incredible potential for users through AI-powered applications and tools in numerous domains. Being often black-box (i.e., its decision-making process is unintelligible), developers typically resort to eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques to interpret the behaviour of AI models to produce systems that are transparent, fair, reliable, and trustworthy. However, presenting explanations to the user is not trivial and is often left as a secondary aspect of the system's design process, leading to AI systems that are not useful to end-users. This paper presents a Systematic Literature Review on Explanation User Interfaces (XUIs) to gain a deeper understanding of the solutions and design guidelines employed in the academic literature to effectively present explanations to users. To improve the contribution and real-world impact of this survey, we also present a framework for Human-cEnteRed developMent of Explainable user interfaceS (HERMES) to guide practitioners and academics in the design and evaluation of XUIs.</description>

      <title>FairTalk: Facilitating Balanced Participation in Video Conferencing by Implicit Visualization of Predicted Turn-Grabbing Intention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Creating fair opportunities for all participants to contribute is a notable challenge in video conferencing. This paper introduces FairTalk, a system that facilitates the subconscious redistribution of speaking opportunities. FairTalk predicts participants' turn-grabbing intentions using a machine learning model trained on web-collected videoconference data with positive-unlabeled learning, where turn-taking detection provides automatic positive labels. To subtly balance speaking turns, the system visualizes predicted intentions by mimicking natural human behaviors associated with the desire to speak. A user study suggests that FairTalk may help improve speaking balance, though subjective feedback indicates no significant perceived impact. We also discuss design implications derived from participant interviews.</description>

      <title>InjectLab: A Tactical Framework for Adversarial Threat Modeling Against Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18156v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are changing the way people interact with technology. Tools like ChatGPT and Claude AI are now common in business, research, and everyday life. But with that growth comes new risks, especially prompt-based attacks that exploit how these models process language. InjectLab is a security framework designed to address that problem. This paper introduces InjectLab as a structured, open-source matrix that maps real-world techniques used to manipulate LLMs. The framework is inspired by MITRE ATT&amp;CK and focuses specifically on adversarial behavior at the prompt layer. It includes over 25 techniques organized under six core tactics, covering threats like instruction override, identity swapping, and multi-agent exploitation. Each technique in InjectLab includes detection guidance, mitigation strategies, and YAML-based simulation tests. A Python tool supports easy execution of prompt-based test cases. This paper outlines the framework's structure, compares it to other AI threat taxonomies, and discusses its future direction as a practical, community-driven foundation for securing language models.</description>

      <title>Evaluation in EEG Emotion Recognition: State-of-the-Art Review and Unified Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18175v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electroencephalography-based Emotion Recognition (EEG-ER) has become a growing research area in recent years. Analyzing 216 papers published between 2018 and 2023, we uncover that the field lacks a unified evaluation protocol, which is essential to fairly define the state of the art, compare new approaches and to track the field's progress. We report the main inconsistencies between the used evaluation protocols, which are related to ground truth definition, evaluation metric selection, data splitting types (e.g., subject-dependent or subject-independent) and the use of different datasets. Capitalizing on this state-of-the-art research, we propose a unified evaluation protocol, EEGain (https://github.com/EmotionLab/EEGain), which enables an easy and efficient evaluation of new methods and datasets. EEGain is a novel open source software framework, offering the capability to compare - and thus define - state-of-the-art results. EEGain includes standardized methods for data pre-processing, data splitting, evaluation metrics, and the ability to load the six most relevant datasets (i.e., AMIGOS, DEAP, DREAMER, MAHNOB-HCI, SEED, SEED-IV) in EEG-ER with only a single line of code. In addition, we have assessed and validated EEGain using these six datasets on the four most common publicly available methods (EEGNet, DeepConvNet, ShallowConvNet, TSception). This is a significant step to make research on EEG-ER more reproducible and comparable, thereby accelerating the overall progress of the field.</description>

      <title>Pragmatic Disengagement and Culturally Situated Non Use Older Korean Immigrants Strategies for Navigating Digital Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18326v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Older immigrant adults often face layered barriers to digital participation, including language exclusion, generational divides, and emotional fatigue. This study examines how older Korean immigrants in the greater NYC area selectively engage with digital tools such as smartphones, YouTube, and AI platforms. Using a community-based participatory research (CBPR) framework and 22 semi-structured interviews, we identify two key practices: pragmatic disengagement, where users avoid emotionally taxing or culturally misaligned content, and interdependent navigation, where digital use is shaped through reliance on family or community support. These strategies challenge deficit-oriented narratives of non-use, showing how disengagement can be thoughtful, protective, and culturally situated. We contribute to CSCW by expanding theories of non-use and algorithmic resistance and by offering design and policy recommendations to support more dignified, culturally attuned digital engagement for aging immigrant populations.</description>

      <title>Military AI Needs Technically-Informed Regulation to Safeguard AI Research and its Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18371v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Military weapon systems and command-and-control infrastructure augmented by artificial intelligence (AI) have seen rapid development and deployment in recent years. However, the sociotechnical impacts of AI on combat systems, military decision-making, and the norms of warfare have been understudied. We focus on a specific subset of lethal autonomous weapon systems (LAWS) that use AI for targeting or battlefield decisions. We refer to this subset as AI-powered lethal autonomous weapon systems (AI-LAWS) and argue that they introduce novel risks -- including unanticipated escalation, poor reliability in unfamiliar environments, and erosion of human oversight -- all of which threaten both military effectiveness and the openness of AI research. These risks cannot be addressed by high-level policy alone; effective regulation must be grounded in the technical behavior of AI models. We argue that AI researchers must be involved throughout the regulatory lifecycle. Thus, we propose a clear, behavior-based definition of AI-LAWS -- systems that introduce unique risks through their use of modern AI -- as a foundation for technically grounded regulation, given that existing frameworks do not distinguish them from conventional LAWS. Using this definition, we propose several technically-informed policy directions and invite greater participation from the AI research community in military AI policy discussions.</description>

      <title>Rehabilitation Exercise Quality Assessment and Feedback Generation Using Large Language Models with Prompt Engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18412v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Exercise-based rehabilitation improves quality of life and reduces morbidity, mortality, and rehospitalization, though transportation constraints and staff shortages lead to high dropout rates from rehabilitation programs. Virtual platforms enable patients to complete prescribed exercises at home, while AI algorithms analyze performance, deliver feedback, and update clinicians. Although many studies have developed machine learning and deep learning models for exercise quality assessment, few have explored the use of large language models (LLMs) for feedback and are limited by the lack of rehabilitation datasets containing textual feedback. In this paper, we propose a new method in which exercise-specific features are extracted from the skeletal joints of patients performing rehabilitation exercises and fed into pre-trained LLMs. Using a range of prompting techniques, such as zero-shot, few-shot, chain-of-thought, and role-play prompting, LLMs are leveraged to evaluate exercise quality and provide feedback in natural language to help patients improve their movements. The method was evaluated through extensive experiments on two publicly available rehabilitation exercise assessment datasets (UI-PRMD and REHAB24-6) and showed promising results in exercise assessment, reasoning, and feedback generation. This approach can be integrated into virtual rehabilitation platforms to help patients perform exercises correctly, support recovery, and improve health outcomes.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of Affective States During Takeover Requests in Conditionally Automated Driving Among Older Adults with and without Cognitive Impairment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18416v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Driving is a key component of independence and quality of life for older adults. However, cognitive decline associated with conditions such as mild cognitive impairment and dementia can compromise driving safety and often lead to premature driving cessation. Conditionally automated vehicles, which require drivers to take over control when automation reaches its operational limits, offer a potential assistive solution. However, their effectiveness depends on the driver's ability to respond to takeover requests (TORs) in a timely and appropriate manner. Understanding emotional responses during TORs can provide insight into drivers' engagement, stress levels, and readiness to resume control, particularly in cognitively vulnerable populations. This study investigated affective responses, measured via facial expression analysis of valence and arousal, during TORs among cognitively healthy older adults and those with cognitive impairment. Facial affect data were analyzed across different road geometries and speeds to evaluate within- and between-group differences in affective states. Within-group comparisons using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test revealed significant changes in valence and arousal during TORs for both groups. Cognitively healthy individuals showed adaptive increases in arousal under higher-demand conditions, while those with cognitive impairment exhibited reduced arousal and more positive valence in several scenarios. Between-group comparisons using the Mann-Whitney U test indicated that cognitively impaired individuals displayed lower arousal and higher valence than controls across different TOR conditions. These findings suggest reduced emotional response and awareness in cognitively impaired drivers, highlighting the need for adaptive vehicle systems that detect affective states and support safe handovers for vulnerable users.</description>

Abstract: This study evaluates the integration of AI-powered robots in early childhood education, focusing on their impact on emotional self-regulation, engagement, and collaborative skills. A ten-week experimental design involving two groups of children assessed the robot's effectiveness through progress assessments, parental surveys, and teacher feedback. Results demonstrated that early exposure to the robot significantly enhanced emotional recognition, while sustained interaction further improved collaborative and social engagement. Parental and teacher feedback highlighted high acceptance levels, emphasizing the robot's ease of integration and positive influence on classroom dynamics. This research underscores the transformative potential of AI and robotics in education. The findings advocate for the broader adoption of AI-powered interventions, carefully examining equitable access, ethical considerations, and sustainable implementation. This work sets a foundation for exploring long-term impacts and expanding applications of AI in inclusive and impactful educational settings.</description>

      <title>Usability of Token-based and Remote Electronic Signatures: A User Experience Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18814v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As electronic signatures (e-signatures) become increasingly integral to secure digital transactions, understanding their usability and security perception from an end-user perspective has become crucial. This study empirically evaluates and compares two major e-signature systems -- token-based and remote signatures -- through a controlled user experience study with 20 participants. Participants completed tasks involving acquisition, installation, and document signing using both methods, followed by structured surveys and qualitative feedback. Statistical analyses revealed that remote e-signatures were perceived as significantly more usable than token-based ones, due to their minimal setup and platform-independent accessibility. In contrast, token-based signatures were rated as significantly more secure, highlighting users' trust in hardware-based protection. Although more participants preferred remote e-signatures for document signing, the preference did not reach statistical significance, indicating a trend toward favoring convenience in real-world scenarios. These findings underline the fundamental trade-off between usability and perceived security in digital signing systems. By bridging the gap between theoretical frameworks and real user experience, this study contributes valuable insights to the design and policymaking of qualified electronic signature solutions.</description>

      <title>LiteCUA: Computer as MCP Server for Computer-Use Agent on AIOS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18829v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present AIOS 1.0, a novel platform designed to advance computer-use agent (CUA) capabilities through environmental contextualization. While existing approaches primarily focus on building more powerful agent frameworks or enhancing agent models, we identify a fundamental limitation: the semantic disconnect between how language models understand the world and how computer interfaces are structured. AIOS 1.0 addresses this challenge by transforming computers into contextual environments that language models can natively comprehend, implementing a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server architecture to abstract computer states and actions. This approach effectively decouples interface complexity from decision complexity, enabling agents to reason more effectively about computing environments. To demonstrate our platform's effectiveness, we introduce LiteCUA, a lightweight computer-use agent built on AIOS 1.0 that achieves a 14.66% success rate on the OSWorld benchmark, outperforming several specialized agent frameworks despite its simple architecture. Our results suggest that contextualizing computer environments for language models represents a promising direction for developing more capable computer-use agents and advancing toward AI that can interact with digital systems. The source code of LiteCUA is available at https://github.com/agiresearch/LiteCUA, and it is also integrated into the AIOS main branch as part of AIOS at https://github.com/agiresearch/AIOS.</description>

      <title>Towards Reliable Large Audio Language Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19294v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in large audio language models (LALMs) have demonstrated impressive results and promising prospects in universal understanding and reasoning across speech, music, and general sound. However, these models still lack the ability to recognize their knowledge boundaries and refuse to answer questions they don't know proactively. While there have been successful attempts to enhance the reliability of LLMs, reliable LALMs remain largely unexplored. In this paper, we systematically investigate various approaches towards reliable LALMs, including training-free methods such as multi-modal chain-of-thought (MCoT), and training-based methods such as supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Besides, we identify the limitations of previous evaluation metrics and propose a new metric, the Reliability Gain Index (RGI), to assess the effectiveness of different reliable methods. Our findings suggest that both training-free and training-based methods enhance the reliability of LALMs to different extents. Moreover, we find that awareness of reliability is a "meta ability", which can be transferred across different audio modalities, although significant structural and content differences exist among sound, music, and speech.</description>

      <title>Effort-aware Fairness: Incorporating a Philosophy-informed, Human-centered Notion of Effort into Algorithmic Fairness Metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19317v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although popularized AI fairness metrics, e.g., demographic parity, have uncovered bias in AI-assisted decision-making outcomes, they do not consider how much effort one has spent to get to where one is today in the input feature space. However, the notion of effort is important in how Philosophy and humans understand fairness. We propose a philosophy-informed way to conceptualize and evaluate Effort-aware Fairness (EaF) based on the concept of Force, or temporal trajectory of predictive features coupled with inertia. In addition to our theoretical formulation of EaF metrics, our empirical contributions include: 1/ a pre-registered human subjects experiment, which demonstrates that for both stages of the (individual) fairness evaluation process, people consider the temporal trajectory of a predictive feature more than its aggregate value; 2/ pipelines to compute Effort-aware Individual/Group Fairness in the criminal justice and personal finance contexts. Our work may enable AI model auditors to uncover and potentially correct unfair decisions against individuals who spent significant efforts to improve but are still stuck with systemic/early-life disadvantages outside their control.</description>

      <title>ScienceBoard: Evaluating Multimodal Autonomous Agents in Realistic Scientific Workflows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19897v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have extended their impact beyond Natural Language Processing, substantially fostering the development of interdisciplinary research. Recently, various LLM-based agents have been developed to assist scientific discovery progress across multiple aspects and domains. Among these, computer-using agents, capable of interacting with operating systems as humans do, are paving the way to automated scientific problem-solving and addressing routines in researchers' workflows. Recognizing the transformative potential of these agents, we introduce ScienceBoard, which encompasses two complementary contributions: (i) a realistic, multi-domain environment featuring dynamic and visually rich scientific workflows with integrated professional software, where agents can autonomously interact via different interfaces to accelerate complex research tasks and experiments; and (ii) a challenging benchmark of 169 high-quality, rigorously validated real-world tasks curated by humans, spanning scientific-discovery workflows in domains such as biochemistry, astronomy, and geoinformatics. Extensive evaluations of agents with state-of-the-art backbones (e.g., GPT-4o, Claude 3.7, UI-TARS) show that, despite some promising results, they still fall short of reliably assisting scientists in complex workflows, achieving only a 15% overall success rate.

      <title>The Many Challenges of Human-Like Agents in Virtual Game Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20011v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Human-like agents are an increasingly important topic in games and beyond. Believable non-player characters enhance the gaming experience by improving immersion and providing entertainment. They also offer players the opportunity to engage with AI entities that can function as opponents, teachers, or cooperating partners. Additionally, in games where bots are prohibited -- and even more so in non-game environments -- there is a need for methods capable of identifying whether digital interactions occur with bots or humans. This leads to two fundamental research questions: (1) how to model and implement human-like AI, and (2) how to measure its degree of human likeness.
  This article offers two contributions. The first one is a survey of the most significant challenges in implementing human-like AI in games (or any virtual environment featuring simulated agents, although this article specifically focuses on games). Thirteen such challenges, both conceptual and technical, are discussed in detail. The second is an empirical study performed in a tactical video game that addresses the research question: "Is it possible to distinguish human players from bots (AI agents) based on empirical data?" A machine-learning approach using a custom deep recurrent convolutional neural network is presented. We hypothesize that the more challenging it is to create human-like AI for a given game, the easier it becomes to develop a method for distinguishing humans from AI-driven players.</description>

      <title>AgentClinic: a multimodal agent benchmark to evaluate AI in simulated clinical environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07960v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Evaluating large language models (LLM) in clinical scenarios is crucial to assessing their potential clinical utility. Existing benchmarks rely heavily on static question-answering, which does not accurately depict the complex, sequential nature of clinical decision-making. Here, we introduce AgentClinic, a multimodal agent benchmark for evaluating LLMs in simulated clinical environments that include patient interactions, multimodal data collection under incomplete information, and the usage of various tools, resulting in an in-depth evaluation across nine medical specialties and seven languages. We find that solving MedQA problems in the sequential decision-making format of AgentClinic is considerably more challenging, resulting in diagnostic accuracies that can drop to below a tenth of the original accuracy. Overall, we observe that agents sourced from Claude-3.5 outperform other LLM backbones in most settings. Nevertheless, we see stark differences in the LLMs' ability to make use of tools, such as experiential learning, adaptive retrieval, and reflection cycles. Strikingly, Llama-3 shows up to 92% relative improvements with the notebook tool that allows for writing and editing notes that persist across cases. To further scrutinize our clinical simulations, we leverage real-world electronic health records, perform a clinical reader study, perturb agents with biases, and explore novel patient-centric metrics that this interactive environment firstly enables.</description>

      <title>How do Observable Users Decompose D3 Code? A Qualitative Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14341v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many toolkit developers seek to streamline the visualization programming process for their users through structured support such as prescribed templates and example galleries. However, few projects examine how users organize their own visualization programs, how their coding choices may deviate from the intents of toolkit developers, and how these differences may impact visualization prototyping and design. Further, is it possible to infer users' reasoning indirectly through their code, even when users copy code from other sources? Understanding these patterns can reveal opportunities to align toolkit design with actual user behavior, improving usability and supporting more flexible workflows. We explore this question through a qualitative analysis of 715 D3 programs on Observable. We identify three levels of program organization based on how users decompose their code into smaller blocks: Program-, Chart-, and Component-Level code decomposition, with a strong preference for Component-Level reasoning. In a series of interviews, we corroborate that these levels reflect how Observable users reason about visualization programs. We compare common user-made components with those theorized in the Grammar of Graphics to assess overlap in user and toolkit developer reasoning. We find that, while the Grammar of Graphics covers basic visualizations well, it falls short in describing complex visualization types, especially those with animation, interaction, and parameterization components. Our findings highlight how user practices differ from formal grammars and suggest opportunities for rethinking visualization toolkit support, including augmenting learning tools and AI assistants to better reflect real-world coding strategies.</description>

      <title>An Empirical Study to Understand How Students Use ChatGPT for Writing Essays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10551v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) advance and become widespread, students increasingly turn to systems like ChatGPT for assistance with writing tasks. Educators are concerned with students' usage of ChatGPT beyond cheating; using ChatGPT may reduce their critical engagement with writing, hindering students' learning processes. The negative or positive impact of using LLM-powered tools for writing will depend on how students use them; however, how students use ChatGPT remains largely unknown, resulting in a limited understanding of its impact on learning. To better understand how students use these tools, we conducted an online study $(n=70)$ where students were given an essay-writing task using a custom platform we developed to capture the queries they made to ChatGPT. To characterize their ChatGPT usage, we categorized each of the queries students made to ChatGPT. We then analyzed the relationship between ChatGPT usage and a variety of other metrics, including students' self-perception, attitudes towards AI, and the resulting essay itself. We found that factors such as gender, race, and perceived self-efficacy can help predict different AI usage patterns. Additionally, we found that different usage patterns were associated with varying levels of enjoyment and perceived ownership over the essay. The results of this study contribute to discussions about how writing education should incorporate generative AI-powered tools in the classroom.</description>

      <title>Trust-Enabled Privacy: Social Media Designs to Support Adolescent User Boundary Regulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19082v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Adolescents heavily rely on social media to build and maintain close relationships, yet current platform designs often make self-disclosure feel risky or uncomfortable. Through a three-part study involving 19 teens aged 13-18, we identify key barriers to meaningful self-disclosure on social media. Our findings reveal that while these adolescents seek casual, frequent sharing to strengthen relationships, existing platform norms often discourage such interactions. Based on our co-design interview findings, we propose platform design ideas to foster a more dynamic and nuanced privacy experience for teen social media users. We then introduce \textbf{\textit{trust-enabled privacy}} as a framework that recognizes trust -- whether building or eroding -- as central to boundary regulation, and foregrounds the role of platform design in shaping the very norms and interaction patterns that influence how trust unfolds. When trust is supported, boundary regulation becomes more adaptive and empowering; when it erodes, users resort to self-censorship or disengagement. This work provides empirical insights and actionable guidelines for designing social media spaces where teens feel empowered to engage in meaningful relationship-building processes.</description>

      <title>Design for Hope: Cultivating Deliberate Hope in the Face of Complex Societal Challenges</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.07586v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Design has the potential to cultivate hope in the face of complex societal challenges. These challenges are often addressed through efforts aimed at harm reduction and prevention -- essential but sometimes limiting approaches that can unintentionally narrow our collective sense of what is possible. This one-day, in-person workshop builds on the first Positech Workshop at CSCW 2024 by offering practical ways to move beyond reactive problem-solving toward building capacity for proactive goal setting and generating pathways forward. We explore how collaborative and reflective design methodologies can help research communities navigate uncertainty, expand possibilities, and foster meaningful change. By connecting design thinking with hope theory, which frames hope as the interplay of ``goal-directed,'' ``pathways,'' and ``agentic'' thinking, we will examine how researchers might chart new directions in the face of complexity and constraint. Through hands-on activities including problem reframing, building a shared taxonomy of design methods that align with hope theory, and reflecting on what it means to sustain hopeful research trajectories, participants will develop strategies to embed a deliberately hopeful approach into their research.</description>

Abstract: The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in modern society is transforming how individuals perform tasks. In high-risk domains, ensuring human control over AI systems remains a key design challenge. This article presents a novel End-User Development (EUD) approach for black-box AI models, enabling users to edit explanations and influence future predictions through targeted interventions. By combining explainability, user control, and model adaptability, the proposed method advances Human-Centered AI (HCAI), promoting a symbiotic relationship between humans and adaptive, user-tailored AI systems.</description>

      <title>A Taxonomy of Questions for Critical Reflection in Machine-Assisted Decision-Making</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12830v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Decision-makers run the risk of relying too much on machine recommendations, which is associated with lower cognitive engagement. Reflection has been shown to increase cognitive engagement and improve critical thinking and reasoning and therefore decision-making. However, there is currently no approach to support reflection in machine-assisted decision-making. We therefore present a taxonomy that serves to systematically create questions related to machine-assisted decision-making that promote reflection and thus cognitive engagement and ultimately a deliberate decision-making process. Our taxonomy builds on a taxonomy of Socratic questions and a question bank for human-centred explainable AI (XAI), and illustrates how XAI techniques can be utilised and repurposed to formulate questions. As a use case, we focus on clinical decision-making. An evaluation in education confirms the applicability and expected benefits of our taxonomy. Our work contributes to the growing research on human-AI interaction that goes beyond the paradigm of machine recommendations and explanations and aims to enable effective human oversight as required by the European AI Act.</description>

      <title>Towards user-centered interactive medical image segmentation in VR with an assistive AI agent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07214v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Crucial in disease analysis and surgical planning, manual segmentation of volumetric medical scans (e.g. MRI, CT) is laborious, error-prone, and challenging to master, while fully automatic algorithms can benefit from user feedback. Therefore, with the complementary power of the latest radiological AI foundation models and virtual reality (VR)'s intuitive data interaction, we propose SAMIRA, a novel conversational AI agent for medical VR that assists users with localizing, segmenting, and visualizing 3D medical concepts. Through speech-based interaction, the agent helps users understand radiological features, locate clinical targets, and generate segmentation masks that can be refined with just a few point prompts. The system also supports true-to-scale 3D visualization of segmented pathology to enhance patient-specific anatomical understanding. Furthermore, to determine the optimal interaction paradigm under near-far attention-switching for refining segmentation masks in an immersive, human-in-the-loop workflow, we compare VR controller pointing, head pointing, and eye tracking as input modes. With a user study, evaluations demonstrated a high usability score (SUS=90.0 $\pm$ 9.0), low overall task load, as well as strong support for the proposed VR system's guidance, training potential, and integration of AI in radiological segmentation tasks.</description>

      <title>Reassessing Collaborative Writing Theories and Frameworks in the Age of LLMs: What Still Applies and What We Must Leave Behind</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16254v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we conduct a critical review of existing theories and frameworks on human-human collaborative writing to assess their relevance to the current human-AI paradigm in professional contexts, and draw seven insights along with design implications for human-AI collaborative writing tools. We found that, as LLMs nudge the writing process more towards an empirical "trial and error" process analogous to prototyping, the non-linear cognitive process of writing will stay the same, but more rigor will be required for revision methodologies. This shift would shed further light on the importance of coherence support, but the large language model (LLM)'s unprecedented semantic capabilities can bring novel approaches to this ongoing challenge. We argue that teamwork-related factors such as group awareness, consensus building and authorship - which have been central in human-human collaborative writing studies - should not apply to the human-AI paradigm due to excessive anthropomorphism. With the LLM's text generation capabilities becoming essentially indistinguishable from human-written ones, we are entering an era where, for the first time in the history of computing, we are engaging in collaborative writing with AI at workplaces on a daily basis. We aim to bring theoretical grounding and practical design guidance to the interaction designs of human-AI collaborative writing, with the goal of enhancing future human-AI writing software.</description>

      <title>Novobo: Supporting Teachers' Peer Learning of Instructional Gestures by Teaching a Mentee AI-Agent Together</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17557v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Instructional gestures are essential for teaching, as they enhance communication and support student comprehension. However, existing training methods for developing these embodied skills can be time-consuming, isolating, or overly prescriptive. Research suggests that developing these tacit, experiential skills requires teachers' peer learning, where they learn from each other and build shared knowledge. This paper introduces Novobo, an apprentice AI-agent stimulating teachers' peer learning of instructional gestures through verbal and bodily inputs. Positioning the AI as a mentee employs the learning-by-teaching paradigm, aiming to promote deliberate reflection and active learning. Novobo encourages teachers to evaluate its generated gestures and invite them to provide demonstrations. An evaluation with 30 teachers in 10 collaborative sessions showed Novobo prompted teachers to share tacit knowledge through conversation and movement. This process helped teachers externalize, exchange, and internalize their embodied knowledge, promoting collaborative learning and building a shared understanding of instructional gestures within the local teaching community. This work advances understanding of how teachable AI agents can enhance collaborative learning in teacher professional development, offering valuable design insights for leveraging AI to promote the sharing and construction of embodied and practical knowledge.</description>

      <title>FERGI: Automatic Scoring of User Preferences for Text-to-Image Generation from Spontaneous Facial Expression Reaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.03187v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Researchers have proposed to use data of human preference feedback to fine-tune text-to-image generative models. However, the scalability of human feedback collection has been limited by its reliance on manual annotation. Therefore, we develop and test a method to automatically score user preferences from their spontaneous facial expression reaction to the generated images. We collect a dataset of Facial Expression Reaction to Generated Images (FERGI) and show that the activations of multiple facial action units (AUs) are highly correlated with user evaluations of the generated images. We develop an FAU-Net (Facial Action Units Neural Network), which receives inputs from an AU estimation model, to automatically score user preferences for text-to-image generation based on their facial expression reactions, which is complementary to the pre-trained scoring models based on the input text prompts and generated images. Integrating our FAU-Net valence score with the pre-trained scoring models improves their consistency with human preferences. This method of automatic annotation with facial expression analysis can be potentially generalized to other generation tasks. The code is available at https://github.com/ShuangquanFeng/FERGI, and the dataset is also available at the same link for research purposes.</description>

      <title>Think Outside the Data: Colonial Biases and Systemic Issues in Automated Moderation Pipelines for Low-Resource Languages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13836v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Most social media users come from non-English speaking countries in the Global South, where much of harmful content appears in local languages. Yet, current AI-driven moderation systems struggle with low-resource languages spoken in these regions. This work examines the systemic challenges in building automated moderation tools for these languages. We conducted semi-structured interviews with 22 AI experts working on detecting harmful content in four low-resource languages: Tamil (South Asia), Swahili (East Africa), Maghrebi Arabic (North Africa), and Quechua (South America). Our findings show that beyond the well-known data scarcity in local languages, technical issues--such as outdated machine translation systems, sentiment and toxicity models grounded in Western values, and unreliable language detection technologies--undermine moderation efforts. Even with more data, current language models and preprocessing pipelines--primarily designed for English--struggle with the morphological richness, linguistic complexity, and code-mixing. As a result, automated moderation in Tamil, Swahili, Arabic, and Quechua remains fraught with inaccuracies and blind spots. Based on our findings, we argue that these limitations are not just technical gaps but reflect deeper structural inequities that continue to reproduce historical power imbalances. We conclude by discussing multi-stakeholder approaches to improve automated moderation for low-resource languages.</description>

      <title>Expert-Agnostic Learning to Defer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.10533v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Learning to Defer (L2D) trains autonomous systems to handle straightforward cases while deferring uncertain ones to human experts. Recent advancements in this field have introduced methods that offer flexibility to unseen experts at test time. However, we find these approaches struggle to generalise to experts with behaviours not seen during training, require extensive human annotation, and lack mechanisms for incorporating prior knowledge of expert capabilities. To address these challenges, we introduce Expert-Agnostic Learning to Defer (EA-L2D), a novel L2D framework that employs a Bayesian approach to model expert behaviour in an \textit{expert-agnostic} fashion. Across benchmark medical imaging datasets (HAM10000, Blood Cells, Retinal OCT, and Liver Tumours), EA-L2D significantly outperforms prior methods on unseen experts, achieving up to a 28\% relative improvement, while also matching or exceeding state-of-the-art performance on seen experts.</description>

      <title>Architectural Vulnerability and Reliability Challenges in AI Text Annotation: A Survey-Inspired Framework with Independent Probability Assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19679v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models, despite their power, have a fundamental architectural vulnerability stemming from their causal transformer design -- order sensitivity. This architectural constraint may distorts classification outcomes when prompt elements like label options are reordered, revealing a theoretical gap between accuracy metrics and true model reliability. The paper conceptualizes this vulnerability through the lens of survey methodology, where respondent biases parallel LLM positional dependencies. Empirical evidence using the F1000 biomedical dataset across three scales of LLaMA3.1 models (8B, 70B, 405B) demonstrates that these architectural constraints produce inconsistent annotations under controlled perturbations. The paper advances a practical solution for social science - Independent Probability Assessment - which decouples label evaluation to circumvent positional bias inherent in sequential processing. This approach yields an information-theoretic reliability measure (R-score) that quantifies annotation robustness at the case level. The findings establish that architectural vulnerabilities in causal transformers require methodological innovations beyond accuracy metrics to ensure valid social science inference, as demonstrated through downstream regression analyses where order-sensitive annotations significantly alter substantive conclusions about scientific impact.</description>

      <title>IRIS: Interactive Research Ideation System for Accelerating Scientific Discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16728v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rapid advancement in capabilities of large language models (LLMs) raises a pivotal question: How can LLMs accelerate scientific discovery? This work tackles the crucial first stage of research, generating novel hypotheses. While recent work on automated hypothesis generation focuses on multi-agent frameworks and extending test-time compute, none of the approaches effectively incorporate transparency and steerability through a synergistic Human-in-the-loop (HITL) approach. To address this gap, we introduce IRIS: Interactive Research Ideation System, an open-source platform designed for researchers to leverage LLM-assisted scientific ideation. IRIS incorporates innovative features to enhance ideation, including adaptive test-time compute expansion via Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), fine-grained feedback mechanism, and query-based literature synthesis. Designed to empower researchers with greater control and insight throughout the ideation process. We additionally conduct a user study with researchers across diverse disciplines, validating the effectiveness of our system in enhancing ideation. We open-source our code at https://github.com/Anikethh/IRIS-Interactive-Research-Ideation-System</description>

      <title>Regulating Algorithmic Management: A Multi-Stakeholder Study of Challenges in Aligning Software and the Law for Workplace Scheduling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02329v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Algorithmic management (AM)'s impact on worker well-being has led to calls for regulation. However, little is known about the effectiveness and challenges in real-world AM regulation across the regulatory process -- rule operationalization, software use, and enforcement. Our multi-stakeholder study addresses this gap within workplace scheduling, one of the few AM domains with implemented regulations. We interviewed 38 stakeholders across the regulatory process: regulators, defense attorneys, worker advocates, managers, and workers. Our findings suggest that the efficacy of AM regulation is influenced by: (i) institutional constraints that challenge efforts to encode law into AM software, (ii) on-the-ground use of AM software that shapes its ability to facilitate compliance, (iii) mismatches between software and regulatory contexts that hinder enforcement, and (iv) unique concerns that software introduces when used to regulate AM. These findings underscore the importance of a sociotechnical approach to AM regulation, which considers organizational and collaborative contexts alongside the inherent attributes of software. We offer future research directions and implications for technology policy and design.</description>

      <title>Which Demographic Features Are Relevant for Individual Fairness Evaluation of U.S. Recidivism Risk Assessment Tools?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09868v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite its constitutional relevance, the technical ``individual fairness'' criterion has not been operationalized in U.S. state or federal statutes/regulations. We conduct a human subjects experiment to address this gap, evaluating which demographic features are relevant for individual fairness evaluation of recidivism risk assessment (RRA) tools. Our analyses conclude that the individual similarity function should consider age and sex, but it should ignore race.</description>

      <title>ViEEG: Hierarchical Neural Coding with Cross-Modal Progressive Enhancement for EEG-Based Visual Decoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12408v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding and decoding brain activity into visual representations is a fundamental challenge at the intersection of neuroscience and artificial intelligence. While EEG-based visual decoding has shown promise due to its non-invasive, low-cost nature and millisecond-level temporal resolution, existing methods are limited by their reliance on flat neural representations that overlook the brain's inherent visual hierarchy. In this paper, we introduce ViEEG, a biologically inspired hierarchical EEG decoding framework that aligns with the Hubel-Wiesel theory of visual processing. ViEEG decomposes each visual stimulus into three biologically aligned components-contour, foreground object, and contextual scene-serving as anchors for a three-stream EEG encoder. These EEG features are progressively integrated via cross-attention routing, simulating cortical information flow from V1 to IT to the association cortex. We further adopt hierarchical contrastive learning to align EEG representations with CLIP embeddings, enabling zero-shot object recognition. Extensive experiments on the THINGS-EEG dataset demonstrate that ViEEG achieves state-of-the-art performance, with 40.9% Top-1 accuracy in subject-dependent and 22.9% Top-1 accuracy in cross-subject settings, surpassing existing methods by over 45%. Our framework not only advances the performance frontier but also sets a new paradigm for biologically grounded brain decoding in AI.</description>

      <title>MoRE-Brain: Routed Mixture of Experts for Interpretable and Generalizable Cross-Subject fMRI Visual Decoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15946v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Decoding visual experiences from fMRI offers a powerful avenue to understand human perception and develop advanced brain-computer interfaces. However, current progress often prioritizes maximizing reconstruction fidelity while overlooking interpretability, an essential aspect for deriving neuroscientific insight. To address this gap, we propose MoRE-Brain, a neuro-inspired framework designed for high-fidelity, adaptable, and interpretable visual reconstruction. MoRE-Brain uniquely employs a hierarchical Mixture-of-Experts architecture where distinct experts process fMRI signals from functionally related voxel groups, mimicking specialized brain networks. The experts are first trained to encode fMRI into the frozen CLIP space. A finetuned diffusion model then synthesizes images, guided by expert outputs through a novel dual-stage routing mechanism that dynamically weighs expert contributions across the diffusion process. MoRE-Brain offers three main advancements: First, it introduces a novel Mixture-of-Experts architecture grounded in brain network principles for neuro-decoding. Second, it achieves efficient cross-subject generalization by sharing core expert networks while adapting only subject-specific routers. Third, it provides enhanced mechanistic insight, as the explicit routing reveals precisely how different modeled brain regions shape the semantic and spatial attributes of the reconstructed image. Extensive experiments validate MoRE-Brain's high reconstruction fidelity, with bottleneck analyses further demonstrating its effective utilization of fMRI signals, distinguishing genuine neural decoding from over-reliance on generative priors. Consequently, MoRE-Brain marks a substantial advance towards more generalizable and interpretable fMRI-based visual decoding. Code will be publicly available soon: https://github.com/yuxiangwei0808/MoRE-Brain.</description>

      <title>Ocular Authentication: Fusion of Gaze and Periocular Modalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17343v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the feasibility of fusing two eye-centric authentication modalities-eye movements and periocular images-within a calibration-free authentication system. While each modality has independently shown promise for user authentication, their combination within a unified gaze-estimation pipeline has not been thoroughly explored at scale. In this report, we propose a multimodal authentication system and evaluate it using a large-scale in-house dataset comprising 9202 subjects with an eye tracking (ET) signal quality equivalent to a consumer-facing virtual reality (VR) device. Our results show that the multimodal approach consistently outperforms both unimodal systems across all scenarios, surpassing the FIDO benchmark. The integration of a state-of-the-art machine learning architecture contributed significantly to the overall authentication performance at scale, driven by the model's ability to capture authentication representations and the complementary discriminative characteristics of the fused modalities.</description>
