      <title>Observation of mechanical kink control and generation via phonons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kinks (or domain walls) are localized transitions between distinct ground states associated with a topological invariant, and are central to many phenomena across physics, from condensed matter to cosmology. While phonon (i.e., small-amplitude vibration) wave packets have been theorized to deterministically interact with kinks and initiate their movement, this interaction has remained elusive in experiments, where only uncontrollable stochastic kink motion generated by thermal phonons or dislocation glide by low-frequency quasi-static loading have been observed. This is partly because all physical systems that support kinks are, at some level, discrete, making deterministic phonon control of kinks extremely challenging due to the existence of Peierls-Nabarro (PN) barrier. Here, we demonstrate, for the first time, experimental observation of phonon-mediated control and generation of mechanical kinks, which we enable using a topological metamaterial that constitutes an elastic realization of the Kane-Lubensky chain model. Our metamaterial overcomes the PN barrier by supporting a single, topologically protected kink that requires zero energy to form and move. Using simulations that show close agreement with our experimental observations, we also reveal unique dynamics of phonon interplay with highly discrete kinks, including long-duration motion and a continuous family of internal modes, features absent in other discrete nonlinear systems. This work introduces a new paradigm for topological kink control, with potential applications in material stiffness tuning, shape morphing, locomotion, and robust signal transmission.</description>

      <title>Peakons and pseudo-peakons of higher order b-family equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17211v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The peakon equations have garnered significant attention due to their rich mathematical structure and potential applications in various physical contexts. In this study, we extend the well-known b-family system, $m_t+m_xv+bv_xm=0,\quad m=(1-\partial_x^2)v,$ to a more general higher-order one with $m=(1-\partial_x^2)^Jv$ for an arbitrary positive integer $J$. We conjecture the existence of a b-independent pseudo-peakon solution of the form, $v=c\left(1+\left|x-ct\right|+\sum_{i=1}^{J-2}a_i\left|x-ct\right|^{i+1}\right)\mbox{\rm e}^{-\left|x-ct\right|}$ which includes $J-1$ arbitrary constants $a_1,\ a_2,\ \cdots,\ a_{J-1}$ for all $J\geq 2$. In additional to the b-independent psudo-peakon solution, we conclude that there are one b-independent peakon, one b-dependent peakon (for odd J) or two b-dependent peakons (for even J), and $J-3$ (for odd J) or $J-4$ (for even J) complex peakons. This comprehensive analysis provides deeper insights into the structure and behavior of peakons and pseudo-peakons within the extended b-family framework.</description>

      <title>Advanced Differential Equations: Asymptotics &amp; Perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.14591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2012.14591v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Approximation techniques have been historically important for solving differential equations, both as initial value problems and boundary value problems. The integration of numerical, analytic and perturbation methods and techniques can help produce meaningful approximate solutions for many modern problems in the engineering and physical sciences. An overview of such methods is given here, focusing on the use of perturbation techniques for revealing many key properties and behaviors exhibited in practice across diverse scientific disciplines.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear stage of modulational instability in repulsive two-component Bose-Einstein condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17083v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modulational instability (MI) is a fundamental phenomenon in the study of nonlinear dynamics, spanning diverse areas such as shallow water waves, optics, and ultracold atomic gases. In particular, the nonlinear stage of MI has recently been a topic of intense exploration, and has been shown to manifest, in many cases, in the generation of dispersive shock waves (DSWs). In this work, we experimentally probe the MI dynamics in an immiscible two-component ultracold atomic gas with exclusively repulsive interactions, catalyzed by a hard-wall-like boundary produced by a repulsive optical barrier. We analytically describe the expansion rate of the DSWs in this system, generalized to arbitrary inter-component interaction strengths and species ratios. We observe excellent agreement among the analytical results, an effective 1D numerical model, full 3D numerical simulations, and experimental data. Additionally, we extend this scenario to the interaction between two counterpropagating DSWs, which leads to the production of Peregrine soliton structures. These results further demonstrate the versatility of atomic platforms towards the controlled realization of DSWs and rogue waves.</description>

      <title>On-chip multi-timescale spatiotemporal optical synchronization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15671v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mode-locking mechanisms are key resources in nonlinear optical phenomena, such as micro-ring solitonic states, and have transformed metrology, precision spectroscopy, and optical communication. However, despite significant efforts, mode-locking has not been demonstrated in the independently tunable multi-timescale regime. Here, we vastly expand the nonlinear mode-locking toolbox into multi-timescale synchronization on a chip. We use topological photonics to engineer a 2D lattice of hundreds of coupled silicon nitride ring resonators capable of hosting nested mode-locked states with a fast (near 1 THz) single-ring and a slow (near 3 GHz) topological super-ring timescales. We demonstrate signatures of multi-timescale mode-locking including quadratic distribution of the pump noise with the two-time azimuthal mode dimensions, as expected by mode-locking theory. Our observations are further corroborated by direct signatures of the near-transform-limit repetition beats and the formation of the temporal pattern on the slow timescale. Moreover, we show that these exotic properties of edge-confined mode-locked states are in sharp contrast to bulk and single-ring counterparts and establish a clear pathway for their identification. Our unprecedented demonstration of mode-locking in topological combs unlocks the implementation of lattice-scale synchronization and independently tunable multi-timescale mode-locking phenomena, also the exploration of the fundamental nonlinearity-topology interplay on a chip.</description>
