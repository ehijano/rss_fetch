      <title>Polar Coordinate Solutions of the Helmholtz Equation in General Dimensions and an Orthonormal Basis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In acoustical engineering, analytical methodologies are often restricted to two or three dimensions; however, a general-dimensional approach can enhance learning and implementation efficiency while providing a unified understanding of foundational principles. In this manuscript, we present a straightforward derivation of the polar coordinate solutions of the homogeneous Helmholtz equation in general dimensions. We define the radial function as a special function, with coefficients selected to maintain orthonormality within a reproducing kernel Hilbert space, which simplifies its kernel representation. Additionally, we derive an orthonormal basis for this space, thereby demonstrating that the addition theorem arises naturally from a property of the reproducing kernel.</description>

      <title>Results on the generalized numerical ranges in max algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10375v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $n$ and $k$ be two positive integers with $k\leq n$ and $C$ an $n \times n$ matrix with nonnegative entries. In this paper, the rank-$k$ numerical range in the max algebra setting is introduced and studied. The related notions of the max joint $k$-numerical range and the max joint $C$-numerical range of an entry-wise nonnegative matrix and an $m$-tuple of nonnegative matrices are also introduced. Some interesting algebraic properties of these concepts are investigated.</description>

      <title>Estimations of Fourier Coefficients For Controlled Distortion of a Periodic Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10376v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There is a class of physical filtration processes where the input is adequately modeled by a continuous periodic function f (x) of bounded variation over its period, and the output depends only on certain harmonics of the Fourier expansion of f (x) in the orthogonal basis of trigonometric functions. One example is the discrete spectrum sound generation by a revolving body in a steady fluid flow. This type of sound can be controlled through the amplitudes of certain harmonics of the circular distribution of the inflow velocity. Attainable goals of such a controlled distortion of f (x) are formulated as fuzzy targets and required inequalities relating the integral characteristics of f (x) with the coefficients of the corresponding Fourier expansion are proven.</description>

      <title>Expansions of real numbers in non-integer bases and charaterisation of Lazy expansion of 1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, our main focus is expressing real numbers on the non-integer bases. We denote those bases as $\beta$'s, which is also a real number and $\beta \in (1,2)$. This project has 3 main parts. The study of expansions of real numbers in such bases and algorithms for generating them will contribute to the first part of the paper. In this part, firstly, we will define those expansions as the sums of fractions with $1$'s or $0$'s in the nominator and powers of $\beta$ in the denominator. Then we will focus on the sequences of $1$'s and $0$'s generated by the nominators of in the sums we mentioned above. Such sequences will be called \textit{coefficient sequences} throughout the paper. In the second half, we will study the results in the first chapter of \cite{erdos1990characterization}, namely the greedy and lazy $\beta $-expansions . The last part of the paper will be on the characterisation of lazy expansion of 1, which was the first open question at the end of \textit{Erdos and Komornik}. I still don't know if that problem has been solved already. However, the solution that was presented here is the original work of mine.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.10379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A brief introduction to universal algebra and the theory of topological algebras, their varieties, and free topological algebras is presented. Free topological Mal'tsev algebras are studied. Their properties, relationship with topological groups and heaps, and the problem of direct limit decomposition are considered.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10395v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work derivations of definite integrals listed in Prudnikov volume I, Gradshteyn and Ryzhik and a few other tables are produced. Special cases of these integrals in terms of fundamental constants are also evaluated. The method used in these derivations is contour integration.</description>

      <title>Semiclassical and Microlocal Analysis of Energy Dissipation and Cascades in Turbulent Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10449v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents a comprehensive study of the microlocal energy decomposition and propagation of singularities for semiclassically adjusted dissipative pseudodifferential operators. The analysis focuses on the behavior of energy dissipation in turbulent flows modeled by operators \( P_h \) with symbols \( a(x, \xi) \in S^m(\mathbb{R}^n) \), where \( m &lt; 0 \). Using microlocal partitions of unity, we derive an expression for the energy dissipation rate \( \varepsilon_h \) in both spatial and spectral regions, showing its asymptotic equivalence to a two-dimensional integral over phase space. This framework is then applied to the study of the propagation of singularities in solutions to the equation \( P_h u_h = 0 \), where the wavefront set \( \operatorname{WF}_h(u_h) \) evolves along generalized bicharacteristics of the principal symbol \( p_0(x, \xi) \), with energy dissipation controlled by the imaginary part of \( p_0(x, \xi) \). The results combine microlocal analysis, semiclassical techniques, and symbolic calculus to offer insights into the complex dynamics of wave propagation and energy dissipation in turbulent systems, with implications for both theoretical and applied studies in mathematical physics.</description>

      <title>Investigation about a statement equivalent to Riemann Hypothesis (RH)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We try to approach a known equivalence to RH involving relative maxima and minima of Xi(t) on critical line by a representation of the derivative of the phase of Xi(s) with respect to imaginary coordinate that involves directly Euler product. In this attempt it is found an object conjectured to be the ``spectrum'' of prime numbers and an interesting widening of zero-free region. Reasons and consequences of the conjecture are highlighted.</description>

      <title>Conjecture: the set of prime numbers is supernatural</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12041v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Prime numbers are fascinating by the way they appear in the set of natural numbers. Despite several results enlighting us about their repartition, the set of prime numbers is often informally qualified as misterious. In the present paper, we introduce a formalism allowing to state a formal conjecture: the set of prime numbers is supernatural. Our conjecture has no analog in the existing literature. We explain that this conjecture is expected to be a hard challenge for any kind of intelligence. However it is really natural and even seems very close to be canonical.</description>
