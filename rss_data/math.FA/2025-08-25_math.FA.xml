      <title>Invariant strictly convex renormings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16182v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the question of Mikael de la Salle, we investigate the problem of the existence of equivalent strictly convex norms on Banach spaces that are invariant with respect to an action of a group by linear isometries. We develop various tools for constructing such norms and prove several preservation results. We also answer positively a question of Antunes, Ferenczi, Grivaux and Rosendal whether there is a strictly convex renorming of $c$ invariant with respect to its full linear isometry group. Finally, we specialize to the spaces $L_1[0,1]$ and $C(K)$, where $K$ is compact Hausdorff, and indicate that amenability of groups plays a role in this problem.</description>

      <title>Spectral representations of interpolation spaces of reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In statistical learning theory, interpolation spaces of the form $[\mathrm{L}^2,H]_{\theta,r}$, where $H$ is a reproducing kernel Hilbert space, are in widespread use. So far, however, they are only well understood for fine index $r=2$. We generalise existing results from $r=2$ to all possible values of $r$. In particular, we present a spectral decomposition of such spaces, analyse their embedding properties, and describe connections to the theory of Banach spaces of functions. We additionally present exemplary applications of our results to regularisation error estimation in statistical learning.</description>

      <title>Operations that are incompatible with certain systems of translates in $L^2(\mathbb{R})$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We say that a closed subspace $M$ of $L^2(\mathbb{R})$ admits a \emph{complete set of semi-regular a-translates} if there exist some $a&gt;0$, finitely many functions $g_1,\dots,g_N$, some subsets $J_1,\dots,J_N$ of $\mathbb{Z}$ and some finite subsets $\{\alpha_{1j}\}_{j=1}^{K_1},\dots,\{\alpha_{Nj}\}_{j=1}^{K_N}$ of $\mathbb{R}$ such that $$M={\overline{\text{span}}}\{g_i(\cdot-ak), ~g_i(\cdot-\alpha_{ij})\,|\,k\in J_i,1\leq j\leq K_i\,\}_{i=1}^N.$$
  Here $\cdot$ denotes a generic variable. In the first half of this paper, we prove that a closed subspace of $L^2(\mathbb{R})$ does not admit a complete set of semi-regular $a$-translates if it is closed under modulation or if it is closed under dilation with respect to a scaling factor $b$ satisfying $b\neq 0$ and $b^{-1}\notin \mathbb{Z}.$ We also show that no infinite-dimensional closed subspace of $L^2(\mathbb{R})$ can simultaneously be closed under Fourier transform and admit a complete set of semi-regular $a$-translates with $a^2\in \mathbb{Q}$, whereas for any $a&gt;0$, there do exist closed subspaces that are closed under reflection and admit a complete set of semi-regular $a$-translates.
  In the second half, we prove that a closed subspace of $L^2(\mathbb{R})$ does not admit a frame formed by a system of translates if it contains a closed subspace that is closed under modulation and contains a nonzero function in $M^1(\mathbb{R})$. We also prove that no closed subspace of $L^2(\mathbb{R})$ can simultaneously be closed under modulation and admit a Schauder basis of translates generated by finitely many functions in $M^1(\mathbb{R}).$ In addition, we present related results concerning the incompatibility between being closed under Fourier transform and the existence of frames or Schauder bases of translates in closed subspaces of $L^2(\mathbb{R})$. All results in this half can be extended to $L^2(\mathbb{R}^d)$ for any $d&gt;1.$</description>

      <title>Quantum Higher Order Fourier Analysis and the Clifford Hierarchy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15908v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a mathematical framework that we call quantum, higher-order Fourier analysis. This generalizes the classical theory of higher-order Fourier analysis, which led to many advances in number theory and combinatorics. We define a family of quantum measures on a Hilbert space, that reduce in the case of diagonal matrices to the classical uniformity norms. We show that our quantum measures and our related theory of quantum higher-order Fourier analysis characterize the Clifford hierarchy, an important notion of complexity in quantum information. In particular, we give a necessary and sufficient analytic condition that a unitary is an element of the k-th level of the Clifford hierarchy.</description>

      <title>A Fourier analysis approach to disprove the weak Shanks conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15938v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive formulas for the Fourier coefficients of $|f|^2$, where $f(z_1,z_2)=(1-\frac{z_1+z_2}{r})^{-\alpha}$, in terms of hypergeometric functions. Using these formulas we provide additional counterexamples to the weak Shanks conjecture, which was recently disproven by B\'en\'eteau, Khavinson and Seco. The obtained formulas allow for (numerical) optimization over the parameters $\alpha$ and $r$.</description>

      <title>Admissible operators for sun-dual semigroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02150v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We extend classical duality results by Weiss on admissible operators to settings where the dual semigroup lacks strong continuity. This is possible using the sun-dual framework, which is not immediate from the duality of the input and output maps. This extension enables the testing of admissibility for a broader range of examples, in particular for state space of continuous functions or $L^1$.</description>

      <title>Strictly convex norms and the local diameter two property</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18473v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce and study a strict monotonicity property of the norm in
  solid Banach lattices of real functions that prevents such spaces
  from having the local diameter two property.
  Then we show that any strictly convex 1-symmetric norm on
  $c_0(\Gamma)$ possesses this property.
  In the opposite direction, we show that any Banach space which is
  strictly convex renormable and contains a complemented copy of
  $c_0(\mathbb N),$ admits an equivalent strictly convex norm for
  which the space has the local diameter two property. In particular,
  this enables us to construct a strictly convex norm on
  $c_0(\Gamma),$ where $\Gamma$ is uncountable, for which the space
  has a 1-unconditional basis and the local diameter two property.</description>

      <title>Divided Differences and Multivariate Holomorphic Calculus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05484v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We review the multivariate holomorphic functional calculus for tuples in a commutative Banach algebra and establish a simple "na\"ive" extension to commuting tuples in a general Banach algebra. The approach is na\"ive in the sense that the na\"ively defined joint spectrum maybe too big. The advantage of the approach is that the functional calculus then is given by a simple concrete formula from which all its continuity properties can easily be derived.
  We apply this framework to multivariate functions arising as divided differences of a univariate function. This provides a rich set of examples to which our na\"ive calculus applies. Foremost, we offer a natural and straightforward proof of the Connes-Moscovici Rearrangement Lemma in the context of the multivariate holomorphic functional calculus. Secondly, we show that the Daletski-Krein type noncommutative Taylor expansion is a natural consequence of our calculus. Also Magnus' Theorem which gives a nonlinear differential equation for the $\log$ of the solutions to a linear matrix ODE follows naturally and easily from our calculus. Finally, we collect various combinatorial related formulas.</description>

      <title>A new complete proof of the random Brouwer fixed point theorem and its implied consequences of unification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08521v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a new development of the theory of $L^{0}$-simplicial subdivisions of $L^{0}$-simplexes, which enables us to overcome noticeable limitations of an earlier approach. This is carried out by introducing a general notion of an $L^{0}$-simplicial subdivision of an $L^{0}$-simplex in connection with a usual simplicial subdivision of a classical simplex. Then a key representation theorem of a proper $L^0$-labeling function by usual proper labeling functions is established so that we can formulate a general random Sperner lemma in a concise way. We thus achieve a new complete proof of the random Brouwer fixed theorem in random Euclidean spaces, which can provide a solid foundation for various contemporary applications of interest. Afterward, we unify the works currently available and closely related to the random Brouwer fixed theorem: we first prove that the stochastic Brouwer fixed point theorem occurring in stochastic analysis is equivalent to a special case of our random Brouwer fixed theorem, and then prove a general random Borsuk theorem and its equivalence with random Brouwer fixed theorem. Finally, we conclude this paper with commentaries on recent state of study of the famous Schauder conjecture.</description>

      <title>How orthogonality influences geometric constants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17122v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, based on isosceles orthogonality, we have found equivalent definitions for four constants: $A_2(X)$ proposed by Baronti in 2000 [J. Math. Anal. Appl. 252(2000), 124-146], $C'_{\mathrm{NJ}}(X)$ introduced by Alonso et al. in 2008 [Stud. Math. 188(2008), 135-150], $T(X)$ introduced by Alonso et al. in 2008 [J. Math. Anal. Appl. 340(2008), 1271-1283] and $L'_{\mathrm{YJ}}(X)$ put forward by Liu et al. in 2022 [Bull. Malays. Math. Sci. Soc., 45(2022),307-321]. A core commonality among these three constants is that they are all restricted to the unit sphere. This finding provides us with an insight: could it be that several constants defined over the entire space, when combined with orthogonality conditions, are equivalent to being restricted to the unit sphere?</description>
