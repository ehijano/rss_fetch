      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18224v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide the first fully polynomial-time randomized approximation scheme for the following two counting problems: 1. Given a Context Free Grammar $G$ over alphabet $\Sigma$, count the number of words of length exactly $n$ generated by $G$. 2. Given a circuit $\varphi$ in Decomposable Negation Normal Form (DNNF) over the set of Boolean variables $X$, compute the number of assignments to $X$ such that $\varphi$ evaluates to 1.</description>

      <title>Complexity Classes for Online Problems with and without Predictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the developments in machine learning, there has been a surge in interest and results focused on algorithms utilizing predictions, not least in online algorithms where most new results incorporate the prediction aspect for concrete online problems. While the structural computational hardness of problems with regards to time and space is quite well developed, not much is known about online problems where time and space resources are typically not in focus. Some information-theoretical insights were gained when researchers considered online algorithms with oracle advice, but predictions of uncertain quality is a very different matter. We initiate the development of a complexity theory for online problems with predictions, focusing on binary predictions for minimization problems. Based on the most generic hard online problem type, string guessing, we define a hierarchy of complexity classes and develop notions of reductions, class membership, hardness, and completeness. Our framework contains all the tools one expects to find when working with complexity, and we illustrate our tools by analyzing problems with different characteristics. Our work also implies the same results for classic online problems without predictions.</description>

      <title>Lift-and-Project Integrality Gaps for Santa Claus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18273v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to the study of the MaxMinDegree Arborescence (MMDA) problem in layered directed graphs of depth $\ell\le O(\log n/\log \log n)$, which is a special case of the Santa Claus problem. Obtaining a poly-logarithmic approximation for MMDA in polynomial time is of high interest as it is the main obstacle towards the same guarantee for the general Santa Claus problem, which is itself a necessary condition to eventually improve the long-standing 2-approximation for makespan scheduling on unrelated machines by Lenstra, Shmoys, and Tardos [FOCS'87]. The only ways we have to solve the MMDA problem within an $O(\text{polylog}(n))$ factor is via a ``round-and-condition'' algorithm using the $(\ell-1)^{th}$ level of the Sherali-Adams hierarchy, or via a ``recursive greedy'' algorithm which also has quasi-polynomial time. However, very little is known about the limitations of these techniques, and it is even plausible that the round-and-condition algorithm could obtain the same approximation guarantee with only $1$ round of Sherali-Adams, which would imply a polynomial-time algorithm. As a main result, we construct an MMDA instance of depth $3$ for which an integrality gap of $n^{\Omega(1)}$ survives $1$ round of the Sherali-Adams hierarchy. This result is best possible since it is known that after only $2$ rounds the gap is at most poly-logarithmic on depth-3 graphs. Second, we show that our instance can be ``lifted'' via a simple trick to MMDA instances of any depth $\ell\in \Omega(1)\cap o(\log n/\log \log n)$, for which we conjecture that an integrality gap of $n^{\Omega(1/\ell)}$ survives $\Omega(\ell)$ rounds of Sherali-Adams. We show a number of intermediate results towards this conjecture, which also suggest that our construction is a significant challenge to the techniques used so far for Santa Claus.</description>

      <title>Sum-of-Squares Lower Bounds for Independent Set in Ultra-Sparse Random Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18429v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that for every $D \in \N$, and large enough constant $d \in \N$, with high probability over the choice of $G \sim G(n,d/n)$, the \Erdos-\Renyi random graph distribution, the canonical degree $2D$ Sum-of-Squares relaxation fails to certify that the largest independent set in $G$ is of size $o(\frac{n}{\sqrt{d} D^4})$. In particular, degree $D$ sum-of-squares strengthening can reduce the integrality gap of the classical \Lovasz theta SDP relaxation by at most a $O(D^4)$ factor.
  This is the first lower bound for $&gt;4$-degree Sum-of-Squares (SoS) relaxation for any problems on \emph{ultra sparse} random graphs (i.e. average degree of an absolute constant). Such ultra-sparse graphs were a known barrier for previous methods and explicitly identified as a major open direction (e.g.,~\cite{deshpande2019threshold, kothari2021stressfree}). Indeed, the only other example of an SoS lower bound on ultra-sparse random graphs was a degree-4 lower bound for Max-Cut.
  Our main technical result is a new method to obtain spectral norm estimates on graph matrices (a class of low-degree matrix-valued polynomials in $G(n,d/n)$) that are accurate to within an absolute constant factor. All prior works lose $\poly log n$ factors that trivialize any lower bound on $o(\log n)$-degree random graphs. We combine these new bounds with several upgrades on the machinery for analyzing lower-bound witnesses constructed by pseudo-calibration so that our analysis does not lose any $\omega(1)$-factors that would trivialize our results. In addition to other SoS lower bounds, we believe that our methods for establishing spectral norm estimates on graph matrices will be useful in the analyses of numerical algorithms on average-case inputs.</description>

      <title>Distribution Learnability and Robustness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17814v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We examine the relationship between learnability and robust (or agnostic) learnability for the problem of distribution learning. We show that, contrary to other learning settings (e.g., PAC learning of function classes), realizable learnability of a class of probability distributions does not imply its agnostic learnability. We go on to examine what type of data corruption can disrupt the learnability of a distribution class and what is such learnability robust against. We show that realizable learnability of a class of distributions implies its robust learnability with respect to only additive corruption, but not against subtractive corruption.
  We also explore related implications in the context of compression schemes and differentially private learnability.</description>

      <title>Parameterizing the quantification of CMSO: model checking on minor-closed graph classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18465v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a graph $G$ and a vertex set $X$, the annotated treewidth tw$(G,X)$ of $X$ in $G$ is the maximum treewidth of an $X$-rooted minor of $G$, i.e., a minor $H$ where the model of each vertex of $H$ contains some vertex of $X$. That way, tw$(G,X)$ can be seen as a measure of the contribution of $X$ to the tree-decomposability of $G$. We introduce the logic CMSO/tw as the fragment of monadic second-order logic on graphs obtained by restricting set quantification to sets of bounded annotated treewidth. We prove the following Algorithmic Meta-Theorem (AMT): for every non-trivial minor-closed graph class, model checking for CMSO/tw formulas can be done in quadratic time. Our proof works for the more general CMSO/tw+dp logic, that is CMSO/tw enhanced by disjoint-path predicates. Our AMT can be seen as an extension of Courcelle's theorem to minor-closed graph classes where the bounded-treewidth condition in the input graph is replaced by the bounded-treewidth quantification in the formulas. Our results yield, as special cases, all known AMTs whose combinatorial restriction is non-trivial minor-closedness.</description>

      <title>A simple deterministic near-linear time approximation scheme for transshipment with arbitrary positive edge costs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.07440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.07440v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We describe a simple deterministic near-linear time approximation scheme for uncapacitated minimum cost flow in undirected graphs with real edge weights, a problem also known as transshipment. Specifically, our algorithm takes as input a (connected) undirected graph $G = (V, E)$, vertex demands $b \in \mathbb{R}^V$ such that $\sum_{v \in V} b(v) = 0$, positive edge costs $c \in \mathbb{R}_{&gt;0}^E$, and a parameter $\varepsilon &gt; 0$. In $O(\varepsilon^{-2} m \log^{O(1)} n)$ time, it returns a flow $f$ such that the net flow out of each vertex is equal to the vertex's demand and the cost of the flow is within a $(1 + \varepsilon)$ factor of optimal. Our algorithm is combinatorial and has no running time dependency on the demands or edge costs.
  With the exception of a recent result presented at STOC 2022 for polynomially bounded edge weights, all almost- and near-linear time approximation schemes for transshipment relied on randomization to embed the problem instance into low-dimensional space. Our algorithm instead deterministically approximates the cost of routing decisions that would be made if the input were subject to a random tree embedding. To avoid computing the $\Omega(n^2)$ vertex-vertex distances that an approximation of this kind suggests, we also take advantage of the clustering method used in the well-known Thorup-Zwick distance oracle.</description>

      <title>Faster Approximation Scheme for Euclidean $k$-TSP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.08069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.08069v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the Euclidean $k$-traveling salesman problem ($k$-TSP), we are given $n$ points in the $d$-dimensional Euclidean space, for some fixed constant $d\geq 2$, and a positive integer $k$. The goal is to find a shortest tour visiting at least $k$ points. We give an approximation scheme for the Euclidean $k$-TSP in time $n\cdot 2^{O(1/\varepsilon^{d-1})} \cdot(\log n)^{2d^2\cdot 2^d}$. This improves Arora's approximation scheme of running time $n\cdot k\cdot (\log n)^{\left(O\left(\sqrt{d}/\varepsilon\right)\right)^{d-1}}$ [J. ACM 1998]. Our algorithm is Gap-ETH tight and can be derandomized by increasing the running time by a factor $O(n^d)$.</description>

      <title>How to Reduce Temporal Cliques to Find Sparse Spanners</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.13624v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many real-world networks, such as transportation or trade networks, are dynamic in the sense that the edge set may change over time, but these changes are known in advance. This behavior is captured by the temporal graphs model, which has recently become a trending topic in theoretical computer science. A core open problem in the field is to prove the existence of linear-size temporal spanners in temporal cliques, i.e., sparse subgraphs of complete temporal graphs that ensure all-pairs reachability via temporal paths. So far, the best known result is the existence of temporal spanners with $\mathcal{O}(n\log n)$ many edges. We present significant progress towards proving that linear-size temporal spanners exist in all temporal cliques.
  We adapt techniques used in previous works and heavily expand and generalize them to provide a simpler and more intuitive proof of the $\mathcal{O}(n\log n)$ bound. Moreover, we use our novel approach to show that a large class of temporal cliques, called edge-pivot graphs, admit linear-size temporal spanners. To contrast this, we investigate other classes of temporal cliques that do not belong to the class of edge-pivot graphs. We introduce two such graph classes and we develop novel techniques for establishing the existence of linear temporal spanners in these graph classes as well.</description>
