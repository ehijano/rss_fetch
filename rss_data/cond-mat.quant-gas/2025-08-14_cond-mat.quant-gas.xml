      <title>Electric-Field Control of Josephson Oscillations in Dipolar Bose-Einstein Condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09343v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the dynamic behavior of a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) with dipolar interactions when the influence of external electric fields affects the coherent tunneling properties. Here, we propose a tunable platform based on BECs where Josephson oscillations can be engineered and modulated through external electric fields. We develop a theoretical and numerical frame-work that reveals how electric fields affect intercondensate tunneling, phase dynamics, and collective excitations. By employing a coupled set of Gross-Pitaevskii equations with adiabatic elimination of excited states, we demonstrate field-induced tuning of Josephson frequencies and a transition from contact to dipole-dominated regimes. These findings corroborate theoretical predictions about the sensitivity of dipolar BECs to external fields and deepen our understanding of quantum coherence and tunneling in long-range interacting quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Bose-Einstein condensate sub-wavelength confinement via superoscillations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09390v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical lattices are essential tools in ultra-cold atomic physics. Here we demonstrate theoretically that sub-wavelength confinement can be achieved in these lattices through \textit{superoscillations}. This generic wave phenomenon occurs when a local region of the wave oscillates faster than any of the frequencies in its global Fourier decomposition. To illustrate how sub-wavelength confinement can be achieved via superoscillations, we consider a one-dimensional tri-chromatic optical potential confining a spinless Bose-Einstein Condensate of $^{87}$Rb atoms. By numerical optimization of the relative phases and amplitudes of the optical trap's frequency components, it is possible to generate superoscillatory spatial regions. Such regions contain multiple density peaks at sub-wavelength spacing. This work establishes superoscillations as a viable route to sub-wavelength BEC confinement in blue-detuned optical lattices.</description>

      <title>A Promise for the JWST era: Massive black holes directly collapsed from wave dark matter haloes, and Star formation in and around their accretion flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09258v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There are several puzzling phenomena from recent JWST observations, which seem to push the standard {\Lambda}CDM cosmology over the edge. All those puzzles can be understood in a coherent way if we assume that first massive black holes (MBHs, the "heavy eggs") formed by directly collapsing from wave CDM haloes, which can be even earlier than the formation of first galaxies (the "chickens"). We elucidate two false obstacles that have been believed to prevent wave CDM haloes from collapsing into black holes (namely "maximum stable mass" and "bosenova") and point out that general-relativistic instabilities (e.g., the non-axisymmetric instability numerically found in spinning scalar-field boson stars) could serve as the concrete mechanisms for direct-collapse black holes (DCBHs) born from wave dark matter. Once the MBHs formed, star formation bursts in and around the accretion flows, characteristic of a special mode in compact regions of high gravitational accelerations.</description>

      <title>Certifying Quantum States with Uniform Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09259v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Qubit-resolved operations and measurements are required for most current quantum information processing schemes. However, these operations can be experimentally costly due to the need for local addressing, demanding significant classical control. A more resource-efficient alternative to extract information is uniform measurement, where a site-independent rotation of qubits is performed before measuring in the computational basis. This operation can be performed in parallel, or globally, in atom- and ion-based platforms, reducing resource cost and increasing fidelity. In this work, we initiate the exploration of the utility of this operation in quantum information processing. In particular, we demonstrate that uniform measurements can certify certain graph states, a family of highly entangled and broadly useful quantum states. We provide a sample-efficient certification algorithm with a proved performance guarantee, together with an experimental scheme based on analog-mode Rydberg atom arrays. Uniform measurements, therefore, allow direct and efficient characterization of quantum states on quantum platforms in a hitherto unexplored manner.</description>

      <title>A Pseudo-Fermion Propagator Approach to the Fermion Sign Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09557v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, within the framework of path integral Monte Carlo, we construct a pseudo-fermion propagator by replacing the original fermionic determinant with its absolute value. This modified propagator defines an auxiliary system free from the fermion sign problem, enabling efficient simulations of fermionic systems. We found that by shifting the pseudo-fermion energy based on the energy of a non-interacting fermion system, we can efficiently and reliably infer the energy of fermionic systems in various situations, from strong quantum degeneracy to weak quantum degeneracy. We have performed first-principles simulations of quantum dots confined in a two-dimensional harmonic potential and found excellent agreement with benchmark results provided by other established methods. We believe that this pseudo-fermion propagator framework opens up new possibilities for first-principles simulations of fermionic systems.</description>

      <title>Resonantly enhanced polariton-mediated superconductivity in a doped transition metal dichalcogenide monolayer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09619v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a proposal for achieving light-induced superconductivity using exciton polaritons - hybrid light-matter particles of excitons (bound electron-hole pairs) and microcavity photons. In contrast to previous theories of polariton-mediated superconductivity, which typically require multiple semiconductor layers, we show that superconductivity can be induced within a single semiconductor monolayer with inverted conduction bands, such as in the tungsten-based transition metal dichalcogenides. The key ingredient is that we can resonantly excite exciton polaritons into bands that are different from those occupied by the doped electrons, thus avoiding any Pauli blocking effects. Crucially, we can exploit the trion fine structure (i.e., multiple exciton-electron bound states) and tune the electron-polariton interactions via Feshbach resonances. Our theory of polariton-mediated superconductivity includes the energy dependence of the polariton-mediated interactions between electrons, as well as the polariton-induced changes to the electron quasiparticles. We find that superconductivity at elevated temperatures is within reach of current experiments.</description>

      <title>Enhanced metrology based on flipping trajectory of cold Rydberg gases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11035v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The dynamical trajectory of a dissipative Rydberg many-body system could be flipped under a microwave field driving, displaying an enhanced sensitivity. This is because the intersection of the folded hysteresis trajectories exhibits a sharp peak near the phase transition, amplifying the response to small changes in the microwave field. Here, we demonstrate an experiment of enhanced metrology through flipping the hysteresis trajectory in a cold atomic system, displaying an approach to improve sensitivity near the gap-closing points. By measuring the intersection points of hysteresis trajectories versus Rabi frequency of the microwave field, we quantify the equivalent sensitivity to be 1.6(5) nV cm-1 Hz-1/2. The measurement is also dependent on the interaction time, optical depth and principal quantum number since the long-range interaction between Rydberg atoms could dramatically change the shape of hysteresis trajectories. The reported results suggest that flipping trajectory features in cold Rydberg many-body systems could advance sensing and metrology applications.</description>

      <title>Floquet Theory of lattice electrons coupled to an off-resonant cavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22715v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use Floquet theory and the High-Frequency expansion to derive an effective Hamiltonian for electrons coupled to an off resonant cavity mode, either in its vacuum or driven by classical light. For vacuum fields, we show that long-range hopping and cavity-mediated interactions arise as a direct consequence of quantum fluctuations. As an application, this method is applied to the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model. At high light-matter coupling, our results reveal significant deviations from mean-field predictions, with our framework capturing light-matter entanglement through the Floquet micromotion. Furthermore, the cavity-mediated interactions appearing at first order are shown to be crucial to the description of the system at sufficiently strong light-matter coupling for a fixed cavity frequency. Finally, a drive resonant with the cavity is added with the SSH chain displaying dynamical behavior dependent on the cavity parameters.</description>
