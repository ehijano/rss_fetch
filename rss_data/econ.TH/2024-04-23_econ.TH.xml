      <title>Optimal Refund Mechanism with Consumer Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the optimal refund mechanism when an uninformed buyer can privately acquire information about his valuation of a product over time. We consider a class of refund mechanisms based on stochastic return policies: if the buyer requests a return, the seller will issue a (partial) refund while allowing the buyer to keep the product with some probability. Such return policies can affect the buyer's learning process and thereby influence the return rate. Nevertheless, we show that the optimal refund mechanism is deterministic and takes a simple form: either the seller offers a sufficiently low price and disallows returns to deter buyer learning, or she offers a sufficiently high price with free returns to implement maximal buyer learning. The form of the optimal refund mechanism is non-monotone in the buyer's prior belief regarding his valuation.</description>

      <title>Blackwell-Monotone Information Costs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15158v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A Blackwell-monotone information cost function assigns higher costs to Blackwell more informative experiments. This paper provides simple necessary and sufficient conditions for Blackwell monotonicity over finite experiments. The key condition is a system of linear differential inequalities that are convenient to check given an arbitrary cost function. When the cost function is additively separable across signals, our characterization implies that Blackwell monotonicity is equivalent to sublinearity. This identifies a wide range of practical information cost functions. Finally, we apply our results to bargaining and persuasion problems with costly information.</description>

      <title>Common Knowledge, Regained</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.04374v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For common knowledge to arise in dynamic settings, all players must simultaneously come to know it has arisen. Consequently, common knowledge cannot arise in many realistic settings with timing frictions. This counterintuitive observation of Halpern and Moses (1990) was discussed by Arrow et al. (1987) and Aumann (1989), was called a paradox by Morris (2014), and has evaded satisfactory resolution for four decades. We resolve this paradox by proposing a new definition for common knowledge, which coincides with the traditional one in static settings but is more permissive in dynamic settings. Under our definition, common knowledge can arise without simultaneity, particularly in canonical examples of the Haplern-Moses paradox. We demonstrate its usefulness by deriving for it an agreement theorem \`a la Aumann (1976), showing it arises in the setting of Geanakoplos and Polemarchakis (1982) with timing frictions added, and applying it to characterize equilibrium behavior in a dynamic coordination game.</description>

      <title>Sequential unanimity voting rules for binary social choice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.13009v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a group of voters that needs to decide between two candidates. We propose a novel family of neutral and strategy-proof rules, which we call sequential unanimity rules. By demonstrating their formal equivalence to the M-winning coalition rules of Moulin (1983), we show that sequential unanimity rules are characterized by neutrality and strategy-proofness. We establish our results by developing algorithms that transform a given M-winning coalition rule into an equivalent sequential unanimity rule and vice versa. The analysis can be extended to accommodate the full preference domain in which voters may be indifferent between candidates.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Population Games: A Tractable Intersection of Mean-Field Games and Population Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.14662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2104.14662v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In many real-world large-scale decision problems, self-interested agents have individual dynamics and optimize their own long-term payoffs. Important examples include the competitive access to shared resources (e.g., roads, energy, or bandwidth) but also non-engineering domains like epidemic propagation and control. These problems are natural to model as mean-field games. However, existing mathematical formulations of mean field games have had limited applicability in practice, since they require solving non-standard initial-terminal-value problems that are tractable only in limited special cases. In this letter, we propose a novel formulation, along with computational tools, for a practically relevant class of Dynamic Population Games (DPGs), which correspond to discrete-time, finite-state-and-action, stationary mean-field games. Our main contribution is a mathematical reduction of Stationary Nash Equilibria (SNE) in DPGs to standard Nash Equilibria (NE) in static population games. This reduction is leveraged to guarantee the existence of a SNE, develop an evolutionary dynamics-based SNE computation algorithm, and derive simple conditions that guarantee stability and uniqueness of the SNE. Additionally, DPGs enable us to tractably incorporate multiple agent types, which is of particular importance to assess fairness concerns in resource allocation problems. We demonstrate our results by computing the SNE in two complex application examples: fair resource allocation with heterogeneous agents and control of epidemic propagation.
