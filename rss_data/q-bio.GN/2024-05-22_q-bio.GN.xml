      <title>Multi-omics Prediction from High-content Cellular Imaging with Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.09391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.09391v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: High-content cellular imaging, transcriptomics, and proteomics data provide rich and complementary views on the molecular layers of biology that influence cellular states and function. However, the biological determinants through which changes in multi-omics measurements influence cellular morphology have not yet been systematically explored, and the degree to which cell imaging could potentially enable the prediction of multi-omics directly from cell imaging data is therefore currently unclear. Here, we address the question of whether it is possible to predict bulk multi-omics measurements directly from cell images using Image2Omics - a deep learning approach that predicts multi-omics in a cell population directly from high-content images of cells stained with multiplexed fluorescent dyes. We perform an experimental evaluation in gene-edited macrophages derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSC) under multiple stimulation conditions and demonstrate that Image2Omics achieves significantly better performance in predicting transcriptomics and proteomics measurements directly from cell images than predictions based on the mean observed training set abundance. We observed significant predictability of abundances for 4927 (18.72%; 95% CI: 6.52%, 35.52%) and 3521 (13.38%; 95% CI: 4.10%, 32.21%) transcripts out of 26137 in M1 and M2-stimulated macrophages respectively and for 422 (8.46%; 95% CI: 0.58%, 25.83%) and 697 (13.98%; 95% CI: 2.41%, 32.83%) proteins out of 4986 in M1 and M2-stimulated macrophages respectively. Our results show that some transcript and protein abundances are predictable from cell imaging and that cell imaging may potentially, in some settings and depending on the mechanisms of interest and desired performance threshold, even be a scalable and resource-efficient substitute for multi-omics measurements.</description>

      <title>Wasserstein Wormhole: Scalable Optimal Transport Distance with Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09411v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Optimal transport (OT) and the related Wasserstein metric (W) are powerful and ubiquitous tools for comparing distributions. However, computing pairwise Wasserstein distances rapidly becomes intractable as cohort size grows. An attractive alternative would be to find an embedding space in which pairwise Euclidean distances map to OT distances, akin to standard multidimensional scaling (MDS). We present Wasserstein Wormhole, a transformer-based autoencoder that embeds empirical distributions into a latent space wherein Euclidean distances approximate OT distances. Extending MDS theory, we show that our objective function implies a bound on the error incurred when embedding non-Euclidean distances. Empirically, distances between Wormhole embeddings closely match Wasserstein distances, enabling linear time computation of OT distances. Along with an encoder that maps distributions to embeddings, Wasserstein Wormhole includes a decoder that maps embeddings back to distributions, allowing for operations in the embedding space to generalize to OT spaces, such as Wasserstein barycenter estimation and OT interpolation. By lending scalability and interpretability to OT approaches, Wasserstein Wormhole unlocks new avenues for data analysis in the fields of computational geometry and single-cell biology.</description>
