      <title>Ratchet-mediated resetting: Current, efficiency, and exact solution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10698v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We model an overdamped Brownian particle that is subject to resetting facilitated by a periodic ratchet potential. This asymmetric potential switches on with a constant rate, but switches off again only upon the particle's first passage to a resetting point at the minimum of the potential. Repeating this cycle sustains a non-equilibrium steady-state, as well as a directed steady-state current which can be harnessed to perform useful work. We derive exact analytic expressions for the probability densities of the free-diffusion and resetting phases, the associated currents for each phase, and an efficiency parameter that quantifies the return in current for given power input. These expressions allow us to fully characterise the system and obtain experimentally relevant results such as the optimal current and efficiency. Our results are corroborated by simulations, and have implications for experimentally viable finite-time resetting protocols.</description>

      <title>Comparison of the microcanonical population annealing algorithm with the Wang-Landau algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10865v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of new algorithms for simulations in physics is as important as the development of new analytical methods. In this paper we present a comparison of the recently developed microcanonical population annealing (MCPA) algorithm with the rather mature Wang-Landau algorithm. The comparison is performed on two cases of the Potts model exhibiting a first order phase transition. We compare the simulation results of both methods with exactly known results, including the finite-dimensional dependence of the maximum of the specific heat capacity. We evaluate the Binder cumulant minimum, the ratio of peaks in the energy distribution at the critical temperature, and the energies of the ordered and disordered phases. Both methods exhibit similar accuracy at selected sets of modeling parameters.</description>

      <title>Adversarial Robustness Guarantees for Quantum Classifiers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10360v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite their ever more widespread deployment throughout society, machine learning algorithms remain critically vulnerable to being spoofed by subtle adversarial tampering with their input data. The prospect of near-term quantum computers being capable of running {quantum machine learning} (QML) algorithms has therefore generated intense interest in their adversarial vulnerability. Here we show that quantum properties of QML algorithms can confer fundamental protections against such attacks, in certain scenarios guaranteeing robustness against classically-armed adversaries. We leverage tools from many-body physics to identify the quantum sources of this protection. Our results offer a theoretical underpinning of recent evidence which suggest quantum advantages in the search for adversarial robustness. In particular, we prove that quantum classifiers are: (i) protected against weak perturbations of data drawn from the trained distribution, (ii) protected against local attacks if they are insufficiently scrambling, and (iii) protected against universal adversarial attacks if they are sufficiently quantum chaotic. Our analytic results are supported by numerical evidence demonstrating the applicability of our theorems and the resulting robustness of a quantum classifier in practice. This line of inquiry constitutes a concrete pathway to advantage in QML, orthogonal to the usually sought improvements in model speed or accuracy.</description>

      <title>A Relativistic Formula for the Multiple Scattering of Photons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10484v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have discovered analytical expressions for the probability density function (PDF) of photons that are multiply scattered in relativistic flows, under the assumption of isotropic and inelastic scattering. These expressions characterize the collective dynamics of these photons, ranging from free-streaming to diffusion regions. The PDF, defined within the light cone to ensure the preservation of causality, is expressed in a three-dimensional space at a constant time surface. This expression is achieved by summing the PDFs of photons that have been scattered $n$ times within four-dimensional spacetime. We have confirmed that this formulation accurately reproduces the results of relativistic Monte Carlo simulations.We found that the PDF in three-dimensional space at a constant time surface can be represented in a separable variable form. We demonstrate the behavior of the PDF in the laboratory frame across a wide range of Lorentz factors for the relativistic flow. When the Lorentz factor of the fluid is low, the behavior of scattered photons evolves sequentially from free propagation to diffusion, and then to dynamic diffusion, where the mean effective velocity of the photons equates to that of the fluid. On the other hand, when the Lorentz factor is large, the behavior evolves from anisotropic ballistic motion, characterized by a mean effective velocity approaching the speed of light, to dynamic diffusion.</description>

      <title>A minimal scenario for the origin of non-equilibrium order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10911v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Extant life contains numerous non-equilibrium mechanisms to create order not achievable at equilibrium; it is generally assumed that these mechanisms evolved because the resulting order was sufficiently beneficial to overcome associated costs of time and energy. Here, we identify a broad range of conditions under which non-equilibrium order-creating mechanisms will evolve as an inevitable consequence of self-replication, even if the order is not directly functional. We show that models of polymerases, when expanded to include known stalling effects, can evolve kinetic proofreading through selection for fast replication alone, consistent with data from recent mutational screens. Similarly, replication contingent on fast self-assembly can select for non-equilibrium instabilities and result in more ordered structures without any direct selection for order. We abstract these results into a framework that predicts that self-replication intrinsically amplifies dissipative order-enhancing mechanisms if the distribution of replication times is wide enough. Our work suggests the intriguing possibility that non-equilibrium order can arise more easily than assumed, even before that order is directly functional, with consequences impacting mutation rate evolution and kinetic traps in self-assembly to the origin of life.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the performance of a Brownian heat engine working in a heterogeneous thermal bath where the mobility fluctuates. Brownian particle is trapped by the time-dependent harmonic potential, by changing the stiffness coefficient and the bath temperatures, we perform a Stirling cycle. We numerically evaluated the average work, power and efficiency. We compare our results with the Brownian heat engine working in a homogeneous thermal bath. We find that for the normal diffusive system, the performance of a Gaussian heat engine serves as an upper bound. We also observe that the non-Gaussian position distribution decreases the stochastic heat engine performance.</description>

      <title>LiHoF4 as a spin-half non-standard quantum Ising system</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.10095v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: $\mathrm{LiHoF_{4}}$ is a magnetic material known for its Ising-type anisotropy, making it a model system for studying quantum magnetism. However, the theoretical description of $\mathrm{LiHoF_{4}}$ using the quantum Ising model has shown discrepancies in its phase diagram, particularly in the regime dominated by thermal fluctuations. In this study, we investigate the role of off-diagonal dipolar terms in $\mathrm{LiHoF_{4}}$, previously neglected, in determining its properties. We analytically derive the low-energy effective Hamiltonian of $\mathrm{LiHoF_{4}}$, including the off-diagonal dipolar terms perturbatively, both in the absence and presence of a transverse field. Our results encompass the full $B_{x}-T$ phase diagram, confirming the significance of the off-diagonal dipolar terms in reducing the zero-field critical temperature and determining the critical temperature's dependence on the transverse field. We also highlight the sensitivity of this mechanism to the crystal structure by comparing our calculations with the $\mathrm{Fe_{8}}$ system.</description>

      <title>Quantum reaction-limited reaction-diffusion dynamics of noninteracting Bose gases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.04018v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate quantum reaction-diffusion systems in one-dimension with bosonic particles that coherently hop in a lattice, and when brought in range react dissipatively. Such reactions involve binary annihilation ($A + A \to \emptyset$) and coagulation ($A + A \to A$) of particles at distance $d$. We consider the reaction-limited regime, where dissipative reactions take place at a rate that is small compared to that of coherent hopping. In classical reaction-diffusion systems, this regime is correctly captured by the mean-field approximation. In quantum reaction-diffusion systems, for non-interacting fermionic systems, the reaction-limited regime recently attracted considerable attention because it has been shown to give universal power law decay beyond mean-field for the density of particles as a function of time. Here, we address the question whether such universal behavior is present also in the case of the non-interacting Bose gas. We show that beyond mean-field density decay for bosons is possible only for reactions that allow for destructive interference of different decay channels. Furthermore, we study an absorbing-state phase transition induced by the competition between branching $A\to A+A$, decay $A\to \emptyset$ and coagulation $A+A\to A$. We find a stationary phase-diagram, where a first and a second-order transition line meet at a bicritical point which is described by tricritical directed percolation. These results show that quantum statistics significantly impact on both the stationary and the dynamical universal behavior of quantum reaction-diffusion systems.</description>

      <title>Quantum entanglement in mixed-spin trimer: Effects of a magnetic field and heterogeneous g-factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00178v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mixed spin-(1/2,1/2,1) trimer with two different Land\'{e} g-factors and two different exchange couplings is considered. The main feature of the model is non-conserving magnetization. The Hamiltonian of the system is diagonalized analytically. We presented a detailed analysis of the ground state properties, revealing several possible ground state phase diagrams and magnetization profiles. The main focus is on how non-conserving magnetization affects quantum entanglement. We have found that non-conserving magnetization can bring to the continuous dependence of the entanglement quantifying parameter (negativity) on magnetic field within the same eigenstate, while for the case of uniform $g$-factors it is a constant. The main result is an essential enhancement of the entanglement in case of uniform couplings for one pair of spins caused by an arbitrary small difference in the values of $g$-factors. This enhancement is robust and brings to almost 7-fold increasing of the negativity. We have also found weakening of entanglement for other cases. Thus, non-conserving magnetization offers a broad opportunity to manipulate the entanglement by means of magnetic field.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.04221v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rate and security of quantum communications between users placed at arbitrary points of a quantum communication network depend on the structure of the network, on its extension and on the nature of the communication channels. In this work we propose a strategy for the optimization of trusted-relays based networks that intertwines classical network approaches and quantum information theory. Specifically, by suitably defining a quantum communication efficiency functional, we identify the optimal quantum communication connections through the network by balancing security and the quantum communication rate. The optimized network is then constructed as the network of the maximal quantum communication efficiency connections and its performance is evaluated by studying the scaling of average properties as functions of the number of nodes and of the network spatial extension.</description>

      <title>Dual Symmetry Classification of Non-Hermitian Systems and $\mathbb{Z}_2$ Point-Gap Topology of a Non-Unitary Quantum Walk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04147v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Non-Hermitian systems exhibit richer topological properties compared to their Hermitian counterparts. It is well known that non-Hermitian systems have been classified based on either the symmetry relations for non-Hermitian Hamiltonians or the symmetry relations for non-unitary time-evolution operators in the context of Floquet topological phases. In this work, we propose that non-Hermitian systems can always be classified in two ways; a non-Hermitian system can be classified using the symmetry relations for non-Hermitian Hamiltonians or time-evolution operator regardless of the Floquet topological phases or not. We refer to this as dual symmetry classification. To demonstrate this, we successfully introduce a new non-unitary quantum walk that exhibits point gaps with a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ point-gap topological phase applying the dual symmetry classification and treating the time-evolution operator of this quantum walk as the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian.</description>

      <title>The Asymptotic Behavior of the Mayer Series Coefficients for a Dimer Gas on a Rectangular Lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05388v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The first 20 Mayer series coefficients for a dimer gas on a rectangular lattice are now known in every dimension, by the work of Butera, Pernici, and the author, [1]. In the present work we initiate a numerical study of a very promising asymptotic form. In a restricted setup we study the following limited precise problem. We note eqs. (A1) and (A2).
  \begin{equation} \label{A1} \tag{A1} b(n) \sim f(n)=\bigg((-1)^{n+1}\bigg)\left(\frac{1}{n}\right) \left(\dfrac{n!}{\left(\left(\frac{n}{2d}\right)!\right)^{2d}}\right)ft(n) \end{equation}
  \begin{equation} \label{A2} \tag{A2} ft(n)=\hat{c} \prod\limits_{k}^{n}\left(c_0+\frac{c_1}{n} +\ldots+ \frac{c_r}{n^{r}}\right) \end{equation}
  For $d \le 20$ and $n \le 20$ we define $\hat{b}(n)$ so that $\hat{b}(n)$ equals $b(n)$ if $n \leq N+1$, and equals $f(n)$ if $ n \geq N - r$. We pick $k=N- r$ and then $\hat{c}$, $c_{0}$. $c_{1}$,...,$c_{r}$ are uniquely determined. $N$ and $r$ must be chosen satisfying $N &lt; 20$ and $N - r &gt; 0$. In fact we work with $N = 10$ and $r \leq 6$ in this note and hope further exploration in many directions will follow. We have not explicitly indicated $d$ dependence of many of the variables. We will see that $\hat{b}(n)$ is a good approximation to $b(n)$, in a sense we will define. Theoretical analysis of these approximations, we envision, will be very difficult. We will indicate the form of theorems we should want to have proved.</description>
