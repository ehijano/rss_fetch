      <title>Reflexive dg categories in algebra and topology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11213v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reflexive dg categories were introduced by Kuznetsov and Shinder to abstract the duality between bounded and perfect derived categories. In particular this duality relates their Hochschild cohomologies, autoequivalence groups, and semiorthogonal decompositions. We establish reflexivity in a variety of settings including affine schemes, simple-minded collections, chain and cochain dg algebras of topological spaces, Ginzburg dg algebras, and Fukaya categories of cotangent bundles and surfaces as well as the closely related class of graded gentle algebras. Our proofs are based on the interplay of reflexivity with gluings, derived completions, and Koszul duality. In particular we show that for certain (co)connective dg algebras, reflexivity is equivalent to derived completeness.</description>

      <title>Twisted Graded Categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11240v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a presentably symmetric monoidal $\infty$-category $\mathcal{C}$ and an $\mathbb{E}_{\infty}$-monoid $M$, we introduce and classify twisted graded categories, which generalize the Day convolution structure on $\mathrm{Fun}(M, \mathcal{C})$. These are characterized by a braiding encoded in symmetric group actions on tensor powers, whose character we show depends only on the $\mathbb{T}$-equivariant monoidal dimension. We analyze the $\mathbb{T}$-action on the dimension of invertible objects and identify it with the $\mathbb{T}$-transfer map. Finally, we compute braiding characters in examples arising from higher cyclotomic extensions, such as the $(\mathbb{S}, n+1)$-oriented extension of $\mathrm{Mod}_{En}^{\wedge}$ at all primes and heights, and of the cyclotomic closure of $\mathrm{Vect}^n$ at low heights.</description>

      <title>Unstable $1$-semiadditivity as classifying Goodwillie towers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11245v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A stable $\infty$-category is $1$-semiadditive if all norms for finite group actions are equivalences. In the presence of $1$-semiadditivity, Goodwillie calculus simplifies drastically. We introduce two unstable analogs of $1$-semiadditivity for an $\infty$-category $C$ and study their relation to the Goodwillie calculus of functors $C \rightarrow \s(C)$. We demonstrate these qualities are complete obstructions to the problem of endowing $\partial_\ast F$ with either a right module or a divided power right module structure which completely classifies the Goodwillie tower of $F$. We find applications to algebraic localizations of spaces, the Morita theory of operads, and bar-cobar duality of algebras. Along the way, we address several milestones in these areas including: Lie structures in the Goodwillie calculus of spaces, spectral Lie algebra models of $v_h$-periodic homotopy theory, and the Poincar\'e/Koszul duality of $E_d$-algebras.</description>

      <title>Double groupoids and $2$-groupoids in regular Mal'tsev categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06210v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that the category 2-$ \mathrm{Grpd}(\mathscr{C}) $ of internal $2$-groupoids is a Birkhoff subcategory of the category $ \mathrm{Grpd}^2(\mathscr{C}) $ of double groupoids in a regular Mal'tsev category $\mathscr{C}$ with finite colimits. In particular, when $\mathscr{C}$ is a Mal'tsev variety of universal algebras, the category 2-$ \mathrm{Grpd}(\mathscr{C}) $ is also a Mal'tsev variety, of which we describe the corresponding algebraic theory. When $\mathscr{C}$ is a naturally Mal'tsev category, the reflector from $ \mathrm{Grpd}^2(\mathscr{C}) $ to 2-$ \mathrm{Grpd}(\mathscr{C}) $ has an additional property related to the commutator of equivalence relations. We prove that the category 2-$ \mathrm{Grpd}(\mathscr{C}) $ is semi-abelian when $\mathscr{C}$ is semi-abelian, and then provide sufficient conditions for 2-$ \mathrm{Grpd}(\mathscr{C}) $ to be action representable.</description>

      <title>A Gapless Phase with Haagerup Symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19040v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct a (1+1)d gapless theory which has Haagerup $\mathcal{H}_3$ symmetry. The construction relies on the recent exploration of the categorical Landau paradigm applied to fusion category symmetries. First, using the Symmetry Topological Field Theory, we construct all gapped phases with Haagerup symmetry. Extending this construction to gapless phases, we study the second order phase transition between gapped phases, and determine analytically a Haagerup-symmetric conformal field theory. This is given in terms of two copies of the three-state Potts model, on which we realise the full $\mathcal{H}_3$ symmetry action and determine the relevant deformations to the $\mathcal{H}_3$-symmetric gapped phases. This continuum analysis is corroborated by a lattice model construction of the gapped and gapless phases, using the anyon chain.</description>

      <title>Distributive Laws of Monadic Containers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17191v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Containers are used to carve out a class of strictly positive data types in terms of shapes and positions. They can be interpreted via a fully-faithful functor into endofunctors on Set. Monadic containers are those containers whose interpretation as a Set functor carries a monad structure. The category of containers is closed under container composition and is a monoidal category, whereas monadic containers do not in general compose.
  In this paper, we develop a characterisation of distributive laws of monadic containers. Distributive laws were introduced as a sufficient condition for the composition of the underlying functors of two monads to also carry a monad structure. Our development parallels Ahman and Uustalu's characterisation of distributive laws of directed containers, i.e. containers whose Set functor interpretation carries a comonad structure. Furthermore, by combining our work with theirs, we construct characterisations of mixed distributive laws (i.e. of directed containers over monadic containers and vice versa), thereby completing the 'zoo' of container characterisations of (co)monads and their distributive laws.
  We have found these characterisations amenable to development of existence and uniqueness proofs of distributive laws, particularly in the mechanised setting of Cubical Agda, in which most of the theory of this paper has been formalised.</description>

      <title>Logical relations for call-by-push-value models, via internal fibrations in a 2-category</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14482v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give a denotational account of logical relations for call-by-push-value (CBPV) in the fibrational style of Hermida, Jacobs, Katsumata and others. Fibrations -- which axiomatise the usual notion of sets-with-relations -- provide a clean framework for constructing new, logical relations-style, models. Such models can then be used to study properties such as effect simulation.
  Extending this picture to CBPV is challenging: the models incorporate both adjunctions and enrichment, making the appropriate notion of fibration unclear. We handle this using 2-category theory. We identify an appropriate 2-category, and define CBPV fibrations to be fibrations internal to this 2-category which strictly preserve the CBPV semantics.
  Next, we develop the theory so it parallels the classical setting. We give versions of the codomain and subobject fibrations, and show that new models can be constructed from old ones by pullback. The resulting framework enables the construction of new, logical relations-style, models for CBPV.
  Finally, we demonstrate the utility of our approach with particular examples. These include a generalisation of Katsumata's $\top\top$-lifting to CBPV models, an effect simulation result, and a relative full completeness result for CBPV without sum types.</description>
