      <title>Methodological considerations for semialgebraic hypothesis testing with incomplete U-statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, Sturma, Drton, and Leung proposed a general-purpose stochastic method for hypothesis testing in models defined by polynomial equality and inequality constraints. Notably, the method remains theoretically valid even near irregular points, such as singularities and boundaries, where traditional testing approaches often break down. In this paper, we evaluate its practical performance on a collection of biologically motivated models from phylogenetics. While the method performs remarkably well across different settings, we catalogue a number of issues that should be considered for effective application.</description>

      <title>Directionality measures in evolutionary ecological networks: Insights from the Tangled Nature model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14062v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The myriad microscopic interactions among the individual organisms that constitute an ecological system collectively give rise, at the macroscopic scale, to evolutionary trends. The ability to detect the directionality of such trends is crucial for understanding and managing the dynamics of natural systems. Nevertheless, identifying the key observable quantities that capture such directional behaviour poses a major challenge. In this study, we propose that translating ecological data into a network framework is a valuable strategy to measure system stability and evolution. We examine the Tangled Nature model as a test case, evaluating network entropy, species diversity, and the clustering coefficient as metrics of network stability and directionality.</description>

      <title>Modelling the spillover from online engagement to offline protest: stochastic dynamics and mean-field approximations on networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13310v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Social media is transforming various aspects of offline life, from everyday decisions such as dining choices to the progression of conflicts. In this study, we propose a coupled modelling framework with an online social network layer to analyse how engagement on a specific topic spills over into offline protest activities. We develop a stochastic model and derive several mean-field models of varying complexity. These models allow us to estimate the reproductive number and anticipate when surges in activity are likely to occur. A key factor is the transmission rate between the online and offline domains; for offline outbursts to emerge, this rate must fall within a critical range, neither too low nor too high. Additionally, using synthetic networks, we examine how network structure influences the accuracy of these approximations. Our findings indicate that low-density networks need more complex approximations, whereas simpler models can effectively represent higher-density networks. When tested on two real-world networks, however, increased complexity did not enhance accuracy.</description>
