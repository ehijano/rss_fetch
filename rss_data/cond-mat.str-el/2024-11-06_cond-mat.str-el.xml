      <title>Gapless Floquet topology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases in insulators and superconductors are known for their robust edge modes, linked to bulk invariants through the bulk-boundary correspondence. While this principle traditionally applies to gapped phases, recent advances have extended it to gapless systems, where topological edge states persist even in the absence of a bulk gap. We extend this framework to periodically driven chains with chiral symmetry, revealing the existence of topological edge zero- and pi-modes despite the lack of bulk gaps in the quasienergy spectrum. By examining the half-period decomposition of chiral evolutions, we construct topological invariants that circumvent the need to define the Floquet Hamiltonian, making them more suitable for generalization to the gapless regime. We provide explicit examples, including generalizations of the Kitaev chain and related spin models, where localized pi-modes emerge even when the bulk is gapless at the same quasi-energy as the edge modes. We numerically study the effect of interactions, which give a finite lifetime to the edge modes in the thermodynamic limit with the decay rate consistent with Fermi's Golden Rule.</description>

      <title>Unveiling Non-Kitaev Interactions and Field-Angle Dependence in Topological Magnon Transport of $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02894v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Honeycomb lattice Kitaev magnets exhibit exotic magnetic properties governed by the Kitaev interaction. This study delves into $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$, a prototypical example described by effective Hamiltonians encompassing bond-dependent Kitaev interactions alongside additional terms such as the Heisenberg interaction and symmetric off-diagonal exchange interactions. These non-Kitaev terms significantly influence $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$'s low-temperature magnetism, impacting both magnetic order and excitations. We employ spin-wave theory to elucidate the topological nature of magnetic excitations within the polarized state of $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ under an external magnetic field. Our focus lies on transverse magnon conductivities, specially the thermal Hall conductivity and spin Nernst coefficient. The calculations unveil a pronounced dependence of the magnitude and sign structure of the low-temperature transverse thermal conductivities on both the applied magnetic field's orientation and the exchange parameters within the nearest neighbor Heisenberg-Kitaev-Gamma-Gamma$'$ $(JK\Gamma\Gamma')$ model, which govern the nature and strength of spin interactions. This theoretical framework facilitates critical comparisons with experimental observations, ultimately aiding the identification of an effective Hamiltonian for Kitaev magnets exemplified by $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$.</description>

      <title>Hubbard interaction at finite $T$ on a hexagonal lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The temporal finite volume induces significant effects in Monte Carlo simulations of systems in low dimensions, such as graphene, a 2-D hexagonal system known for its unique electronic properties and numerous potential applications. In this work, we explore the behavior of fermions on a hexagonal sheet with a Hubbard-type interaction characterized by coupling $U$. This system exhibits zero or near zero-energy excitations that are highly sensitive to finite temperature effects. We compute corrections to the self-energy and the effective mass of low-energy excitations, arriving at a quantization condition that includes the temporal finite volume. These analyses are then conducted for both zero and finite temperatures. Our findings reveal that the first-order $\mathcal{O}(U)$ contributions are absent, leading to non-trivial corrections starting at $\mathcal{O}(U^2)$. We validate our calculations against exact and numerical results obtained from Hybrid Monte Carlo simulations on small lattices.</description>

      <title>Theory of potential impurity scattering in pressurized superconducting La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01935v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently discovered high-T$_c$ superconductivity in pressurized bilayer nickelate La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ (La-327) is believed to be driven by the non-phononic repulsive interaction. Depending on the strength of the interlayer repulsion, the symmetry of the superconducting order parameter is expected to be either $d$-wave or sign-changing bonding-antibonding $s_{\pm}$-wave. Unfortunately, due to the need of high pressure to reach superconducting phase, conventional spectroscopic probes to validate the symmetry of the order parameter are hard to use. Here, we study the effect of the point-like non-magnetic impurities on the superconducting state of La-327 and show that $s_{\pm}$-wave and $d$-wave symmetries show a very different behavior as a function of impurity concentration, which can be studied experimentally by irradiating the La-327 samples by electrons prior applying the pressure. While $d-$wave superconducting state will be conventionally suppressed, the $s_{\pm}$-wave state shows more subtle behavior, depending on the asymmetry between bonding and antibonding subspaces. For the electronic structure, predicted to realize in La-327, the $s_{\pm}-$wave state will be robust against complete suppression and the transition temperature, $T_c$ demonstrates a transition from convex to concave behavior, indicating a crossover from $s_{\pm}$-wave to $s_{++}$-wave symmetry as a function of impurity concentration. We further analyze the sensitivity of the obtained results with respect to the potential electronic structure modification.</description>

      <title>Hot Electron-Driven Structural Expansion and Magnetic Collapse in Bilayer FeSe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02443v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum phenomena emerging from the interaction of light and matter in low-dimensional systems hold great potential for future quantum technologies. Here, using first-principles calculations incorporating non-local van der Waals interactions and Hubbard corrections, we report simultaneous structural expansion and magnetic collapse in bilayer FeSe induced by photoexcited hot electrons. Our calculations reveal that, while bulk FeSe is paramagnetic, as observed experimentally, double-layer FeSe exhibits robust {\it staggered} antiferromagnetic order at low temperatures with a net site magnetization of $\sim 2.75~\mu_B$/Fe. However, increasing the density of photoexcited electrons systematically enhances the internal electronic entropy, leading to a complete collapse of antiferromagnetic order accompanied by an abrupt expansion of the interlayer separation. Our findings suggest the structural and magnetic properties of FeSe thin films can be finely tuned via ultrafast laser excitation, offering a pathway to control quantum phases in iron-based compounds through electronic temperature.</description>

      <title>The q-deformed Haldane-Shastry chain at q=i with even length</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02472v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this note we announce some results extending our recent work with A. Toufik on the free-fermion point q=i of the Haldane-Shastry chain to the case with an even number N of sites. The resulting long-range version of the Heisenberg XX chain may be viewed as a model of fermions with extended gl(1|1) symmetry. Unlike for odd N, the conserved charges are nilpotent and exhibit Jordan blocks.</description>

      <title>Scar-induced imbalance in staggered Rydberg ladders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02500v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that the kinematically-constrained model of Rydberg atoms on a two-leg ladder with staggered detuning, $\Delta \in [0,1]$, has quantum many-body scars (QMBS) in its spectrum and represents a non-perturbative generalization of the paradigmatic PXP model defined on a chain. We show that these QMBS result in coherent many-body revivals and site-dependent magnetization dynamics for both N\'eel and Rydberg vacuum initial states around $\Delta=1$. The latter feature leads to eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH)-violating finite imbalance at long times in a disorder free system. This is further demonstrated by constructing appropriate local imbalance operators that display finite long-time averages for N\'eel and vacuum initial states. We also study the fidelity and Shannon entropy for such dynamics which, along with the presence of long-time finite imbalance, brings out the qualitatively different nature of QMBS in PXP ladders with $\Delta \sim 1$ from those in the PXP chain.</description>

      <title>Topological incommensurate Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov superconductor and Bogoliubov Fermi surface in rhombohedral tetra-layer graphen</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02503v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We performed a random phase approximation (RPA) calculation for a spin-valley polarized model of the rhombohedral tetra-layer graphene to study the possibility of chiral superconductor from the Kohn-Luttinger mechanism. We included the realistic band structure and form factor in our calculation and solved the self-consistent equation numerically by sampling 20,000 points in the momentum space at a given temperature. Around the Van-Hove singularity (VHS), we find p-ip pairing with Chern number switching from $C=-1$ to $C=0$ through a gap closing at $\mathbf k=(0,0)$ (defined relative to $\mathbf K$). Although the superconductor is generically fully gapped at low temperature, we find Bogoliubov Fermi surface at temperature just below mean field $T_c$. Besides, through calculation of the free energy, we conclude that the optimal Cooper pair momentum $\mathbf Q$ is generically finite and can be as large as $0.1 k_F$. We dub the $\mathbf Q\neq 0$ phase as an incommensurate Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov(FFLO) superconductor to distinguish it from the $\mathbf Q=0$ phase. Compared to the $\mathbf Q=0$ phase, our incommensurate $\mathbf Q$ phase is a nematic superconductor if it is in the Fulde-Ferrell(FF) phase or exhibts charge density wave (CDW) if it is in the Larkin-Ovchinnikov (LO) phase. Our work demonstrates the rhombohedral tetra-layer graphene as a wonderful platform to explore Majorana zero-mode, FFLO physics and Bogoliubov fermi surface within one single platform.</description>

      <title>Clear Reduction in Spin Susceptibility and Superconducting Spin Rotation for $H \parallel a$ in the Early-Stage Sample of Spin-Triplet Superconductor UTe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02698v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the re-measurement of the $a$-axis spin susceptibility component in an early-stage sample of the spin-triplet superconductor UTe$_2$ with the transition temperature of $T_{\rm SC}$ = 1.6 K. Using Knight-shift measurements along the $b$ axis and at a 10-degree tilt from the $b$ axis towards the $a$ axis, we accurately determined the $a$-axis component without directly measuring the $a$-axis Knight shift. Our results reveal a decrease of approximately 3\% in the $a$-axis spin susceptibility in the superconducting state under $a$-axis magnetic field $\mu_0 H_a \sim 0.1$ T, indicating that the spin susceptibility decreases similarly in both early-stage and ultraclean samples with $T_{\rm SC}$ = 2.1 K. The previously reported absence of the reduction in Knight shift is attributed to the missing of signal from the superconducting region and to the detection of residual signals from the non-superconducting region instead. We also found that the decrease in the $a$-axis spin susceptibility is immediately suppressed with increasing the $a$-axis magnetic field and is estimated to be completely suppressed at around 1.5 T due to superconducting spin rotation.</description>

      <title>Gauge theory for topological waves in continuum fluids with odd viscosity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02958v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider two-dimensional continuum fluids with odd viscosity under a chiral body force. The chiral body force makes the low-energy excitation spectrum of the fluids gapped, and the odd viscosity allows us to introduce the first Chern number of each energy band in the fluids. Employing a mapping between hydrodynamic variables and U(1) gauge-field strengths, we derive a U(1) gauge theory for topologically nontrivial waves. The resulting U(1) gauge theory is given by the Maxwell-Chern-Simons theory with an additional term associated with odd viscosity. We then solve the equations of motion for the gauge fields concretely in the presence of the boundary and find edge-mode solutions. We finally discuss the fate of bulk-boundary correspondence (BBC) in the context of continuum systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03115v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A self-correcting quantum memory is a type of quantum error correcting code that can correct errors passively through cooling. A major open question in the field is whether self-correcting quantum memories can exist in 3D. In this work, we propose two candidate constructions for 3D self-correcting quantum memories. The first construction is an extension of Haah's code, which retains translation invariance. The second construction is based on fractals with greater flexibility in its design. Additionally, we review existing 3D quantum codes and suggest that they are not self-correcting.</description>

      <title>Dynamical renormalization of the magnetic excitation spectrum via high-momentum nonlinear magnonics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.19667v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Controlling macroscopic properties of quantum materials requires the ability to induce and manipulate excited states. The set of collective excitations of a solid is encoded in its dispersion relations. We find that the spectra of the low-momentum eigenmodes are renormalized by resonantly driving the high-momentum excitations. Our experimental data rule out laser-induced thermal processes as an origin of the renormalization. The photoinduced changes of the amplitudes and frequencies can be explained theoretically and numerically with a resonant light-scattering mechanism that couples high- and low-momentum eigenmodes in the dispersion relation across momentum space. While we demonstrate the renormalization of the magnetic spectrum in a quantum material, our experimental approach can be further generalized to lattice modes in semiconductors.</description>

      <title>Low-energy perspective on two-orbital Hund metals and the case of LaNiO2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.11457v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Hund-metal route to strong correlations continues to attract large interest in the condensed-matter community. The question arose to what extent it applies to the infinite-layer nickelates and, as a related question, to two-orbital systems in general. Here, we provide a low-energy perspective on this topic through a dynamical mean-field study using the numerical renormalization group (NRG) as a real-frequency impurity solver. We find that the RG flow from high to low energy is a uniquely adequate tool to reveal two-stage Kondo screening (2SKS), a fascinating mechanism for Hund physics. Further, we show that 2SKS takes place in a quarter-filled two-orbital system, but can be easily suppressed by a sufficiently large crystal-field splitting. We apply these insights to LaNiO2 using a recently proposed two-orbital model and show that it is indeed the crystal-field splitting that suppresses multiorbital phenomena in this scenario. Our general findings open the way for further explorations of 2SKS, and we propose a way of reviving low-energy Hund physics in LaNiO2 by counteracting the crystal field.</description>

      <title>Exploring Intrinsic Magnetic Topological Insulators: The Case of EuIn$_2$As$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.11386v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, ultrafast optical spectroscopy was employed to elucidate the intricate topological features of EuIn$_2$As$_2$, a promising candidate for a magnetic topological-crystalline axion insulator. Our investigation, focusing on the real-time evolution of topological states, unveiled a narrow surface magnetic gap (2$\Delta_0$ $\simeq$ 8.2 meV)) emerging at the antiferromagnetic transition temperature ($T_N$ $\approx$ 16 K). Below $T_N$, two extremely low-energy collective modes, $\omega_1$ and $\omega_2$, with frequencies of $\sim$9.9 and 21.6 GHz at $T$ = 4 K, respectively, were observed, exhibiting strong temperature dependence. $\omega_1$ correlates with an acoustic phonon, while $\omega_2$ is associated with a magnon. The results suggest that EuIn$_2$As$_2$ has the potential to manifest a magnetic topological-crystalline axion insulator, presenting a small magnetic energy gap on the (001) surface.

      <title>Emergence of interfacial magnetism in strongly-correlated nickelate-titanate superlattices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00728v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Strongly-correlated transition-metal oxides are widely known for their various exotic phenomena. This is exemplified by rare-earth nickelates such as LaNiO$_{3}$, which possess intimate interconnections between their electronic, spin, and lattice degrees of freedom. Their properties can be further enhanced by pairing them in hybrid heterostructures, which can lead to hidden phases and emergent phenomena. An important example is the LaNiO$_{3}$/LaTiO$_{3}$ superlattice, where an interlayer electron transfer has been observed from LaTiO$_{3}$ into LaNiO$_{3}$ leading to a high-spin state. However, macroscopic emergence of magnetic order associated with this high-spin state has so far not been observed. Here, by using muon spin rotation, x-ray absorption, and resonant inelastic x-ray scattering, we present direct evidence of an emergent antiferromagnetic order with high magnon energy and exchange interactions at the LaNiO$_{3}$/LaTiO$_{3}$ interface. As the magnetism is purely interfacial, a single LaNiO$_{3}$/LaTiO$_{3}$ interface can essentially behave as an atomically thin strongly-correlated quasi-two-dimensional antiferromagnet, potentially allowing its technological utilisation in advanced spintronic devices. Furthermore, its strong quasi-two-dimensional magnetic correlations, orbitally-polarized planar ligand holes, and layered superlattice design make its electronic, magnetic, and lattice configurations resemble the precursor states of superconducting cuprates and nickelates, but with an $S \rightarrow 1$ spin state instead.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.06440v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Feynman diagrams are an essential tool for simulating strongly correlated electron systems. However, stochastic quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) sampling suffers from the sign problem, e.g., when solving a multiorbital quantum impurity model. Recently, two approaches have been proposed for efficient numerical treatment of Feynman diagrams: Tensor Cross Interpolation (TCI) for replacing the stochastic sampling and the Quantics Tensor Train (QTT) representation for compressing space-time dependence. Combining these approaches, we find low-rank structures in weak-coupling Feynman diagrams for a multiorbital electron-phonon model and demonstrate their efficient numerical integrations with exponential resolution in time and exponential convergence of error with respect to computational cost.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional fracton topological orders with boundary Toeplitz braiding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02482v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we theoretically study a class of 3D non-liquid states that show exotic boundary phenomena in the thermodynamical limit. More concretely, we focus on a class of 3D fracton topological orders formed via stacking 2D twisted \(\mathbb{Z}_N\) topologically ordered layers along \(z\)-direction. Nearby layers are coupled while maintaining translation symmetry along \(z\) direction. The effective field theory is given by the infinite-component Chern-Simons (iCS) field theory, with an integer-valued symmetric block-tridiagonal Toeplitz \(K\)-matrix whose size is thermodynamically large. With open boundary conditions (OBC) along \(z\), certain choice of \(K\)-matrices exhibits exotic boundary ``Toeplitz braiding'', where the mutual braiding phase angle between two anyons at opposite boundaries oscillates and remains non-zero in the thermodynamic limit. In contrast, in trivial case, the mutual braiding phase angle decays exponentially to zero in the thermodynamical limit. As a necessary condition, this phenomenon requires the existence of boundary zero modes in the \(K\)-matrix spectrum under OBC. We categorize nontrivial \(K\)-matrices into two distinct types. Each type-I possesses two boundary zero modes, whereas each type-II possesses only one boundary zero mode. Interestingly, the integer-valued Hamiltonian matrix of the familiar 1D SSH can be used as a non-trivial $K$-matrix. Importantly, since large-gauge-invariance ensures integer quantized \(K\)-matrix entries, global symmetries are not needed to protect these zero modes. We also present numerical simulation as well as finite size scaling, further confirming the above analytical results. Symmetry fractionalization is also discussed.</description>

      <title>A SymTFT for Continuous Symmetries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.06128v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Symmetry is a powerful tool for studying dynamics in QFT: it provides selection rules, constrains RG flows, and often simplifies analysis. Currently, our understanding is that the most general form of symmetry is described by categorical symmetries which can be realized via Symmetry TQFTs or ``SymTFTs." In this paper, we show how the framework of the SymTFT, which is understood for discrete symmetries (i.e. finite categorical symmetries), can be generalized to continuous symmetries. In addition to demonstrating how $U(1)$ global symmetries can be incorporated into the paradigm of the SymTFT, we apply our formalism to study cubic $U(1)$ anomalies in $4d$ QFTs, describe the $\mathbb{Q}/\mathbb{Z}$ non-invertible chiral symmetry in $4d$ theories, and conjecture the SymTFT for general continuous $G^{(0)}$ global symmetries.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09023v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A novel theorem in $\mathbb{Z}_2$-equivariant homotopy theory is stated, proven and applied to the topological classification of frustrated magnets in the presence of canonical time-reversal symmetry. This theorem generalises a result which had been key to the homotopical derivation of the renowned Bott-Kitaev periodic table for topological insulators and superconductors. We distinguish between three symmetry classes $\mathrm{AIII}$, $\mathrm{AIII/BDI}$, and $\mathrm{AIII/CII}$ depending on the existence and type of canonical time-reversal symmetry. For each of these classes, the relevant objects to classify are $\mathbb{Z}_2$-equivariant maps into a Stiefel manifold. The topological classification is illustrated through examples of frustrated spin models and is compared to the one of Roychowdhury and Lawler (RL).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00597v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a mathematical framework for symmetry-resolved entanglement entropy with a non-abelian symmetry group. To obtain a reduced density matrix that is block-diagonal in the non-abelian charges, we define subsystems operationally in terms of subalgebras of invariant observables. We derive exact formulas for the average and the variance of the typical entanglement entropy for the ensemble of random pure states with fixed non-abelian charges. We focus on compact, semisimple Lie groups. We show that, compared to the abelian case, new phenomena arise from the interplay of locality and non-abelian symmetry, such as the asymmetry of the entanglement entropy under subsystem exchange, which we show in detail by computing the Page curve of a many-body system with SU(2) symmetry.</description>

      <title>Electric, thermal, and thermoelectric magnetoconductivity for Weyl/multi-Weyl semimetals in planar Hall set-ups induced by the combined effects of topology and strain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14844v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We continue our investigation of the response tensors in planar Hall (or planar thermal Hall) configurations where a three-dimensional Weyl/multi-Weyl semimetal is subjected to the combined influence of an electric field $\mathbf E $ (and/or temperature gradient $\nabla_{\mathbf r } T$) and an effective magnetic field $\mathbf B_\chi $, generalizing the considerations of Phys. Rev. B 108 (2023) 155132 and Physica E 159 (2024) 115914. The electromagnetic fields are oriented at a generic angle with respect to each other, thus leading to the possibility of having collinear components, which do not arise in a Hall set-up. The net effective magnetic field $\mathbf B_\chi $ consists of two parts -- (a) an actual/physical magnetic field $\mathbf B $ applied externally; and (b) an emergent magnetic field $\mathbf B_5 $ which quantifies the elastic deformations of the sample. $\mathbf B_5 $ is an axial pseudomagnetic field because it couples to conjugate nodal points with opposite chiralities with opposite signs. Using a semiclassical Boltzmann formalism, we derive the generic expressions for the response tensors, including the effects of the Berry curvature (BC) and the orbital magnetic moment (OMM), which arise due to a nontrivial topology of the bandstructures. We elucidate the interplay of the BC-only and the OMM-dependent parts in the longitudinal and transverse (or Hall) components of the electric, thermal, and thermoelectric response tensors. Especially, for the co-planar transverse components of the response tensors, the OMM part acts exclusively in opposition (sync) with the BC-only part for the Weyl (multi-Weyl) semimetals.</description>

      <title>Superconductivity in three-dimensional interacting doped topological insulators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08736v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Three-dimensional doped Dirac insulators foster simply connected (in both topological and trivial regimes) and annular (deep inside the topological regime) Fermi surfaces (FSs) in the normal state, and allow on-site repulsions among fermions with opposite spin ($U_1$) and parity ($U_2$) eigenvalues. From an unbiased leading-order (one-loop) renormalization group analysis, controlled by a suitable $\epsilon$ expansion, we show that this system develops a strong propensity toward the nucleation of scalar $s$-wave and odd-parity pseudoscalar $p$-wave pairings, favored by repulsive $U_1$ and $U_2$ interactions, respectively, irrespective of the underlying FS topology. Our results can be pertinent for the observed superconductivity in various doped narrow gap semiconductors, and the theoretical foundation can readily be applied to investigate similar phenomenon in various doped topological materials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.07520v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the microcanonical thermal pure quantum (mTPQ) method, the canonical ensemble is derived using Taylor series expansions. We prove that the truncation error decreases exponentially with system size when the effective temperature of the mTPQ state is smaller than the target temperature, and otherwise, the error remains constant. We also show the discipline to set the mTPQ parameter by considering the trade-off between the error and the numerical cost.</description>

      <title>Two-doublon Bloch oscillations in the mass-imbalanced extended Fermi-Hubbard model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08194v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Interactions between particles normally induce the decay of the particles Bloch oscillations (BOs) in a periodic lattice. In the limit of strong on-site interactions, spin-$1/2$ fermions may form doublon bound states and undergo BOs in the presence of a tilted potential. Here we investigate the impact of nearest-neighbor interaction $V$ on the multi-doublon BOs in a mass-imbalanced extended Fermi-Hubbard model. We derive an effective Hamiltonian for doublons, and show that a slight change in $V$ can qualitatively alter their dynamic behaviors. Notably, at a resonance point, the doublons behave like free hard-core bosons. Under a tilted potential, the system may exhibit different types of multi-doublon BOs at or deviation from the resonance point. Numerical results are presented to demonstrate our conclusions in both one- and two-dimensional systems.</description>
