      <title>Short-range order and local distortions in entropy stabilized oxides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01841v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An idealized high entropy oxide is characterized by perfect chemical disorder and perfect positional order. In this work, we investigate the extent to which short-range order (SRO) and local structural distortions impede that idealized scenario. Working in the entropy stabilized $\alpha$-PbO$_2$ structure, we compare a two-component system, (Ti,Zr)O$_2$, with a four-component system, (Ti,Zr,Hf,Sn)O$_2$, using a combination of experimental and computational approaches. Special quasi-random structures are used in conjunction with density functional theory calculations to investigate the local distortions around specific elements revealing significant local distortions that are relatively insensitive to the number of chemical constituents. Using finite temperature Monte Carlo simulations, we are able to reproduce the previously experimentally observed SRO and transition temperature for the two-component system. However, ideal configurational entropy is never reached, so SRO is expected even at synthesis temperatures. On the other hand, the order-disorder transition temperature is dramatically lower and experimentally inaccessible for the four-component system, while the configurational entropy is closer to ideal and less sensitive to temperature. Total scattering measurements and pair distribution function analysis of slow-cooled and quenched samples support this view. In general, we demonstrate that SRO effects in high entropy materials are less prevalent as more components are added in, provided the pairwise interaction strengths remain comparable, while local distortions are less affected by the number of components.</description>

      <title>Interface doping and the effect of strain and oxygen stoichiometry on the transport and electronic structure properties of SrIrO$_3$ heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01845v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The 5$d$ series semimetallic Dirac nodal-line perovskite SrIrO$_3$ presents a promising system to study the interplay between spin-orbit coupling and electron-electron interactions in the epitaxial thin film geometry. The competition between the band splitting and the suppression of the correlation energy, from the extended d orbitals can influence the electronic and magnetic structure and lead to exotic quantum phases in such systems. This iridate member possesses a phase diagram which is acutely sensitive to both heterostructure growth conditions and geometric strain, which stabilises the orthorhombic phase over the monoclinic bulk crystal structure. The growth mode and lattice constants of this iridate perovskite have been observed to vary sharply with oxygen partial pressure and thickness during growth by pulsed laser deposition. In this study the structural and transport properties originating from two sets of growth parameters have been compared, indicating distinct differences in the electronic structure at the Fermi edge. Density functional theory calculations of the convolved density of states compared with the X-ray photoemission spectra near the Fermi edge allow the identification of the states contributing to the electronic structure in this region. The spectral differences between these case studies indicate that controlling the growth regime could enable the tuning of the electronic structure to promote enhanced concentrations of one carrier type over another at the Fermi level in this nominally semimetallic system. The control of the correlation-induced electronic transport parameters in this system will enable access to the spin-orbital entangled states and the topological crystalline properties associated with the honeycomb lattice in this Mott system.</description>

      <title>Dynamic transition and Galilean relativity of current-driven skyrmions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The coupling of conduction electrons and magnetic textures leads to quantum transport phenomena described by the language of emergent electromagnetic fields [1-3]. For magnetic skyrmions, spin-swirling particle-like objects, an emergent magnetic field is produced by their topological winding [4-6], resulting in the conduction electrons exhibiting the topological Hall effect (THE) [7]. When the skyrmion lattice (SkL) acquires a drift velocity under conduction electron flow, an emergent electric field is also generated [8,9]. The resulting emergent electrodynamics dictate the magnitude of the THE via the relative motion of SkL and conduction electrons. Here, we report the emergent electrodynamics induced by SkL motion in Gd$_2$PdSi$_3$, facilitated by its giant THE [10,11]. With increasing current excitation, we observe the dynamic transition of the SkL motion from the pinned to creep regime and finally to the flow regime, where the THE is totally suppressed. We argue that the Galilean relativity required for the total cancellation of the THE can be generically recovered in the flow regime, even in complex multiband systems such as the present compound. Moreover, the observed THE voltages are large enough to enable real-time measurement of the SkL velocity-current profile, which reveals the inertial-like motion of the SkL in the creep regime, appearing as current-hysteretic behavior of the skyrmion velocity.</description>

      <title>High-temperature magnetic anomaly via suppression of antisite disorder through synthesis route modification in a Kitaev candidate Cu$_2$IrO$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01925v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By incorporating inert KCl into the Na$_2$IrO$_3$ + 2CuCl $\to$ Cu$_2$IrO$_3$ + 2NaCl topochemical reaction, we significantly reduced the synthesis temperature of Cu$_2$IrO$_3$ from the 350$^\circ$C reported in previous studies to 170$^\circ$C. This adjustment decreased the Cu/Ir antisite disorder concentration in Cu$_2$IrO$_3$ from $\sim$19$\%$ to $\sim$5$\%$. Furthermore, magnetic susceptibility measurements of the present Cu$_2$IrO$_3$ sample revealed a weak ferromagnetic-like anomaly with hysteresis at a magnetic transition temperature of $\sim$70 K. Our research indicates that the spin-disordered ground state reported in chemically disordered Cu$_2$IrO$_3$ is an extrinsic phenomenon, rather than an intrinsic one, underscoring the pivotal role of synthetic chemistry in understanding the application of Kitaev model to realistic materials.</description>

      <title>Predicting the Curie temperature of magnetic materials with automated calculations across chemistries and structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02084v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a technique for predicting the Curie temperature of magnetic materials using density functional theory calculations suitable to include in high-throughput frameworks. We apply four different models, including physically relevant observables and assess numerical constants by studying 32 ferro- and ferrimagnets. With the best-performing model, the Curie temperature can be predicted with a mean absolute error of approximately 126 K. As predictive factors, the models consider either the energy differences between the magnetic ground state and a magnetically disordered paramagnetic state, or the average constraining fields acting on magnetic moments in a disordered local moments calculation. Additionally, the energy differences are refined by incorporating the magnetic entropy of the paramagnetic state and the number of nearest magnetic neighbors of the magnetic atoms. The most advanced model is found to extend well into Fe$_{1-x}$Co$_x$ alloys, indicating the potential efficacy of utilizing our model in designing materials with tailored Curie temperatures by altering alloy compositions. This examination can illuminate the factors influencing magnetic transition temperatures in magnetic materials and provide insights into how they can be employed to make quantitative predictions of Curie temperatures. Our approach is not restricted to specific crystal structures or chemical compositions. It offers a more cost-effective alternative, in terms of human time and need for hands-on oversight, to other density functional theory methods for predicting the Curie temperature. As a result, it provides a practical strategy for conducting high-throughput screening for new technologically applicable magnetic materials. Alternatively, it can complement ML-based screening of magnetic materials by integrating physical principles into such approaches, thereby enhancing their prediction accuracy.</description>

      <title>Altermagnetism: Exploring New Frontiers in Magnetism and Spintronics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent developments have introduced a groundbreaking form of collinear magnetism known as "altermagnetism". This emerging magnetic phase is characterized by robust time-reversal symmetry breaking, antiparallel magnetic order, and alternating spin-splitting band structures, yet it exhibits vanishing net magnetization constrained by symmetry. Altermagnetism uniquely integrates traits previously considered mutually exclusive to conventional collinear ferromagnetism and antiferromagnetism, thereby facilitating phenomena and functionalities previously not achievable within these traditional categories of magnetism. Initially proposed theoretically, the existence of the altermagnetic phase has since been corroborated by a range of experimental studies, which have confirmed its unique properties and potential for applications. This review explores the rapidly expanding research on altermagnets, emphasizing the novel physical phenomena they manifest, methodologies for inducing altermagnetism, and promising altermagnetic materials. The goal of this review is to furnish readers with a comprehensive overview of altermagnetism and to inspire further innovative studies on altermagnetic materials which could potentially revolutionize applications in technology and materials science.</description>

      <title>Room-temperature entanglement of the nickel-radical molecular complex (Et3NH)[Ni(hfac)2L]</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02144v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The bipartite entanglement is comprehensively investigated in the mononuclear molecular complex (Et3NH)[Ni(hfac)2L]L, where HL denotes 2-(2-hydroxy-3-methoxy-5-nitrophenyl)-4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-4,5-dihydro-1H-imidazol-3-oxide-1-oxyl and hfacH stands for hexafluoroacetylacetone. From the magnetic point of view, the molecular compound (Et3NH)[Ni(hfac)2L] consists of an exchange-coupled spin-1 Ni2+ magnetic ion and a spin-1/2 nitronyl-nitroxide radical substituted nitrophenol. The nickel-radical molecular complex affords an experimental realization of a mixed spin-(1/2, 1) Heisenberg dimer with a strong antiferromagnetic exchange coupling J/kB = 505 K and two distinct g-factors gRad=2.005 and gNi=2.275. By adopting this set of magnetic parameters we demonstrate that the Zeeman splitting of a quantum ferrimagnetic ground-state doublet due to a weak magnetic field may substantially reinforce the strength of bipartite entanglement at low temperatures. The molecular compound (Et3NH)[Ni(hfac)2L] maintains sufficiently strong thermal entanglement even at room temperature, vanishing only above 546 K. Specifically, the thermal entanglement in the nickel-radical molecular complex retains approximately 40% of the maximum value corresponding to perfectly entangled Bell states at room temperature, which implies that this magnetic compound provides suitable platform of a molecular qubit with potential implications for room-temperature quantum computation and quantum information processing.</description>

      <title>Electromechanical response of saddle points in twisted hBN moir\'e superlattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In twisted layered materials (t-LMs), an inter-layer rotation can break inversion symmetry and create an interfacial array of staggered out-of-plane polarization due to AB/BA stacking registries. This symmetry breaking can also trigger the formation of edge in-plane polarizations localized along the perimeter of AB/BA regions (i.e., saddle point domains). However, a comprehensive experimental investigation of these features is still lacking. Here, we use piezo force microscopy to probe the electromechanical behavior of twisted hexagonal boron nitride (t-hBN). For a parallel stacking alignment of t-hBN, we reveal very narrow (width ~ 20 nm) saddle point polarizations, which we also measure in the anti-parallel configuration. These localized polarizations can still be found on a multiply-stacked t-hBN structure, determining the formation of a double moir\'e. We also visualize a t-hBN moir\'e superlattice in the topography maps with atomic force microscopy, related to the strain accumulated at the saddle point domains. Our findings imply that polarizations in t-hBN do not only point in the out-of-plane direction, but also show an in-plane component, giving rise to a much more complex 3D polarization field.</description>

      <title>Diffusion Distribution Model for Damage Mitigation in Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02207v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite the widespread use of Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy (STEM) for observing the structure of materials at the atomic scale, a detailed understanding of some relevant electron beam damage mechanisms is limited. Recent reports suggest that certain types of damage can be modeled as a diffusion process and that the accumulation effects of this process must be kept low in order to reduce damage. We therefore develop an explicit mathematical formulation of spatiotemporal diffusion processes in STEM that take into account both instrument and sample parameters. Furthermore, our framework can aid the design of Diffusion Controlled Sampling (DCS) strategies using optimally selected probe positions in STEM, that constrain the cumulative diffusion distribution. Numerical simulations highlight the variability of the cumulative diffusion distribution for different experimental STEM configurations. These analytical and numerical frameworks can subsequently be used for careful design of 2- and 4-dimensional STEM experiments where beam damage is minimised.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic spin Hall effect from spin quantum metric</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02257v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The intrinsic spin Hall effect (ISHE) proposed in [\href{https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.92.126603} {Sinova \textit{et al.} Phys. Rev. Lett. \textbf{92}, 126603 (2004)}] is driven by the spin Berry curvature. Herein, we establish the concept of \textit{spin quantum metric}, which is the counterpart of the spin Berry curvature in the \textit{spin quantum geometric tensor} defined in a similar way to the quantum geometric tensor. Dual to the $\mathcal{T}$-even ($\mathcal{T}$, time reversal) spin Berry curvature, the spin quantum metric features a $\mathcal{T}$-odd characteristic. Notably, we show that the $\mathcal{T}$-odd spin quantum metric can also drive an ISHE ($\mathcal{T}$-odd ISHE) under a high-frequency electric field. Guided by symmetry, we evaluate this $\mathcal{T}$-odd ISHE in the magnetically tilted surface Dirac cone and in ferromagnetic monolayer MnBi$_2$Te$_4$. We find that this $\mathcal{T}$-odd ISHE dominates when the Fermi level is close to the band (anti)crossing point, where its magnitude can be as large as the $\mathcal{T}$-even ISHE when an infrared driving field is applied. Our work not only uncovers an indispensable ingredient in the emergent community of quantum geometric physics but also offers a novel mechanism for ultrafast spintronics.</description>

      <title>On a Modified Directional Distortional Hardening Model for Metal Plasticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02446v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study proposes a modification of the yield condition that overcomes the mathematical constraints of the Directional Distortional Hardening models developed by Feigenbaum and Dafalias. This modified model surpasses the mathematical inconsistency of the complete model and the limitation of the r-model of Feigenbaum and Dafalias. In the complete model, the inconsistency of distortional term in the yield surface and the plastic part of free energy appears in the absence of kinematic hardening. In addition, the simplified r-model fails to capture the flattening of the yield surface in the opposite direction of loading due to the absence of a fourth-order internal variable in the distortional term. Hence, this study incorporates a decoupled distortional hardening term in the equation of yield surface that makes it possible to simultaneously capture the flattening of the yield surface and allows isotropic hardening with distortion, even in the absence of kinematic hardening. The mathematical formulation of the proposed modified model is also developed, which sets the stage for future experimental investigations and validation efforts.</description>

      <title>Machine learning Hubbard parameters with equivariant neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02457v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Density-functional theory with extended Hubbard functionals (DFT+$U$+$V$) provides a robust framework to accurately describe complex materials containing transition-metal or rare-earth elements. It does so by mitigating self-interaction errors inherent to semi-local functionals which are particularly pronounced in systems with partially-filled $d$ and $f$ electronic states. However, achieving accuracy in this approach hinges upon the accurate determination of the on-site $U$ and inter-site $V$ Hubbard parameters. In practice, these are obtained either by semi-empirical tuning, requiring prior knowledge, or, more correctly, by using predictive but expensive first-principles calculations. Here, we present a machine learning model based on equivariant neural networks which uses atomic occupation matrices as descriptors, directly capturing the electronic structure, local chemical environment, and oxidation states of the system at hand. We target here the prediction of Hubbard parameters computed self-consistently with iterative linear-response calculations, as implemented in density-functional perturbation theory (DFPT), and structural relaxations. Remarkably, when trained on data from 11 materials spanning various crystal structures and compositions, our model achieves mean absolute relative errors of 3% and 5% for Hubbard $U$ and $V$ parameters, respectively. By circumventing computationally expensive DFT or DFPT self-consistent protocols, our model significantly expedites the prediction of Hubbard parameters with negligible computational overhead, while approaching the accuracy of DFPT. Moreover, owing to its robust transferability, the model facilitates accelerated materials discovery and design via high-throughput calculations, with relevance for various technological applications.</description>

      <title>Electronic properties of magnetic semiconductor $\textrm{CuMnO}_{2}$ : a first principles study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02499v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Geometrically frustrated magnetic semiconductor $\textrm{CuMnO}_{2}$ has potential applications as photo-catalyst, in photochemical cells and multi-ferroic devices. Electronic band structure in the antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic phases of $\textrm{CuMnO}_{2}$ were calculated using first principle density functional theory (DFT) as implemented in VASP. Electronic band structure in the antiferromagnetic state shows indirect band gap ($\sim 0.53$ eV) where as in the ferromagnetic state it shows half-metallic state with 100\% spin polarization. The half-metallic state arises due to \textit{double exchange} mechanism. In the half-metallic state the density of states for the up spin channel shows asymmetric power law behaviour near the Fermi level while the down spin channel shows fully gapped behaviour. The calculated magnetic moment of Mn atom in the ferromagnetic (3.70 $\mu_{B}$) and antiferromagnetic (3.57 $\mu_{B}$) states are consistent with experimental values. Our calculation predicts potential application of $\textrm{CuMnO}_{2}$ in spintronic devices especially in the ferromagnetic state, as a spin injector for spin valves in spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Ferromagnetic semimetal and charge-density wave phases of interacting electrons in a honeycomb moir\'e potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01715v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The exploration of quantum phases in moir\'e systems has drawn intense experimental and theoretical efforts. The realization of honeycomb symmetry has been a recent focus. The combination of strong interaction and honeycomb symmetry can lead to exotic electronic states such as fractional Chern insulator, unconventional superconductor, and quantum spin liquid. Accurate computations in such systems, with reliable treatment of strong long-ranged Coulomb interaction and approaching the large system sizes to extract thermodynamic phases, are mostly missing. We study the two-dimensional electron gas on a honeycomb moir\'e lattice at quarter filling, using fixed-phase diffusion Monte Carlo. The ground state phases of this important model are determined in the parameter regime relevant to current experiments. With increasing moir\'e potential, the systems transitions from a paramagnetic metal to an itinerant ferromagnetic semimetal and then a charge-density-wave insulator.</description>

      <title>In-Context Learning of Physical Properties: Few-Shot Adaptation to Out-of-Distribution Molecular Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01808v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models manifest the ability of few-shot adaptation to a sequence of provided examples. This behavior, known as in-context learning, allows for performing nontrivial machine learning tasks during inference only. In this work, we address the question: can we leverage in-context learning to predict out-of-distribution materials properties? However, this would not be possible for structure property prediction tasks unless an effective method is found to pass atomic-level geometric features to the transformer model. To address this problem, we employ a compound model in which GPT-2 acts on the output of geometry-aware graph neural networks to adapt in-context information. To demonstrate our model's capabilities, we partition the QM9 dataset into sequences of molecules that share a common substructure and use them for in-context learning. This approach significantly improves the performance of the model on out-of-distribution examples, surpassing the one of general graph neural network models.</description>

      <title>Can Entanglement-enhanced Quantum Kernels Improve Data Classification?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01948v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Classical machine learning, extensively utilized across diverse domains, faces limitations in speed, efficiency, parallelism, and processing of complex datasets. In contrast, quantum machine learning algorithms offer significant advantages, including exponentially faster computations, enhanced data handling capabilities, inherent parallelism, and improved optimization for complex problems. In this study, we used the entanglement-enhanced quantum kernel in quantum support vector machine to train complex respiratory data sets. Compared to classical algorithms, our findings reveal that QSVM performs better with 45% higher accuracy for complex respiratory data sets while maintaining comparable performance with linear datasets in contrast to their classical counterparts executed on a 2-qubit system. Through our study, we investigate the efficacy of the QSVM-Kernel algorithm in harnessing the enhanced dimensionality of the quantum Hilbert space for effectively training complex datasets.</description>

      <title>Timescale bridging in atomistic simulations of epoxy polymer mechanics using non-affine deformation theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02113v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Developing a deep understanding of macroscopic mechanical properties of amorphous systems which lack structural periodicity, has posed a key challenge, not only at the level of theory but also in molecular simulations. Despite significant advancements in computational resources, there is a vast timescale disparity, more than 6 orders of magnitude, between mechanical properties probed in simulations compared to experiments. Using the theoretical framework of non-affine lattice dynamics (NALD), based on the instantaneous normal modes analysis determined through the dynamical matrix of the system, we study the viscoelastic response of a cross-linked epoxy system of diglycidyl ether of bisphenol A (DGEBA) and poly(oxypropylene) diamine, over many orders of magnitude in deformation frequency, below the glass transition temperature. Predictions of the elastic modulus are satisfactorily validated against the non-equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations in the high-frequency regime, and against experimental data from dynamic mechanical analysis at frequencies $ \sim 1 {\rm Hz}$, hence successfully bridging the timescale gap. The comparison shows that non-affine displacements at the atomic level account for nearly two orders of magnitude reduction in the low-frequency elastic modulus of the polymer glass, compared to affine elasticity estimates. The analysis also reveals the role of internal stresses (as reflected in the instantaneous normal modes), which act as to strengthen the mechanical response.</description>

      <title>Plasmonic properties of electrochromic doped metal oxides investigated through Kubelka Munk formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02181v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Materials with broadband tunable optical properties are looked for in smart windows applications. Doped metal oxides presenting dual band visible (VIS) near infrared (NIR) electrochromic properties can be used for solving such a challenge, and their accurate optical characterization is therefore of prime importance. Kubelka Munk model is a state of the art way to optically quantify the absorption properties of materials and is occasionally applied to plasmonic materials, even if great care should be taken to meet the formalism hypotheses. In the present work, Kubelka Munk theory is discussed in the context of particles of indium tin oxide and molybdenum tungsten oxide formulations that are used as single NIR and both VIS and NIR active advanced electrochromic materials, respectively. An analytical model is derived for particles of much smaller dimensions than the incident wavelength and is experimentally verified. A dilution method is applied to verify the plasmonic characteristics of the particles. This study is key for efficient characterization of optical properties of metal oxides, and plasmonic materials in general, from diffuse reflectance measurements.</description>

      <title>Near-Room-Temperature Field-Controllable Exchange Bias in 2D van der Waals Ferromagnet Fe3GaTe2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02260v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Exchange bias (EB) is a cornerstone of modern magnetic memory and sensing technologies. Its extension to the realm of two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals (vdW) magnets holds promise for revolutionary advancements in miniaturized and efficient atomic spintronic devices. However, the blocking temperature of EB in 2D vdW magnets is currently well below room temperature ~130 K. This study reports a robust EB phenomenon in Fe3GaTe2 thin-layer devices, which significantly increases the blocking temperature to a near-room-temperature record of 280 K. Both the bias direction and magnitude can be isothermally tuned by adjusting the field sweep range, in striking contrast to the conventional EB in ferromagnetic/antiferromagnetic (FM/AFM) bilayers. We propose an exchange spring model in which crystal defects with higher coercivity act as the pivotal pinning source for the observed EB phenomenon, deviating from the conventional FM/AFM interface mechanism. Cumulative growth of minor loops and multiple magnetization reversal paths are observed in field cycles below the saturation field, consistent with the hard FM defects behavior of our exchange spring model. These findings provide insights into the complex magnetic order in 2D ferromagnets and open new avenues for developing practical ultrathin vdW spintronic devices with EB-like properties at room temperature.</description>

      <title>Valley-dependent transport through graphene quantum dots due to proximity-induced, staggered spin-orbit couplings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02393v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a system composed of graphene decorated with an array of islands with C_3v symmetry that induce quantum dot (IQD) regions via proximity effects and give rise to several spin-orbit couplings (SOCs). We evaluate transport properties for an array of IQDs and analyze the conditions for realizing isolated valley conductances and valley-state localization. The resulting transmission shows a square-type behavior with wide gaps that can be tuned by adjusting the strength of the staggered intrinsic SOCs. Realistic proximity effects are characterized by weak SOC strengths, and the analysis of our results in this regime shows that the Rashba coupling is the important interaction controlling valley properties. As a consequence, a top gate voltage can be used to tune the valley polarization and switch the valley scattering for positive or negative incident energies. A proper choice of SOC strengths leads to higher localization of valley states around the linear array of IQDs. These systems can be implemented in heterostructures composed of graphene and semiconducting transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) such as MoSe2, WSe2, MoS2, or WS2. In these setups, the magnitudes of induced SOCs depend on the twist angle, and due to broken valley degeneracy, valley-polarized currents at the edges can be generated in a controllable manner as well as localized valley states. Our findings suggest an alternative approach for producing valley-polarized currents and propose a corresponding mechanism for valley-dependent electron optics and optoelectronic devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02442v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Adapting electronics to perfectly conform to non-planar and rough surfaces, such as human skin, is a very challenging task which, if solved, could open up new applications in fields of high economic and scientific interest ranging from health to robotics, wearable electronics, human-machine interface and Internet of Things. The key to success lies in defining a technology that can lead to the fabrication of ultra-thin devices while exploiting materials that are ultimately thin, with high mechanical flexibility and excellent electrical properties. Here, we report a hybrid approach for the definition of high-performance, ultra-thin and conformable electronic devices and circuits, based on the integration of ultimately thin semiconducting transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDC), i.e., MoS2, with organic gate dielectric material, i.e., polyvinyl formal (PVF) combined with the ink-jet printing of conductive PEDOT:PSS ink for electrodes definition. Through this cost-effective, fully bottom-up and solution-based approach, transistors and simple digital and analogue circuits are fabricated by a sequential stacking of ultrathin (nanometer) layers on a few micron thick polyimide substrate, which guarantees the high flexibility mandatory for the targeted applications.</description>

      <title>Superconducting magic-angle twisted trilayer graphene hosts competing magnetic order and moir\'e inhomogeneities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02521v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The microscopic mechanism of superconductivity in the magic-angle twisted graphene family, including magic-angle twisted trilayer graphene (MATTG), is poorly understood. Properties of MATTG, like Pauli limit violation, suggest unconventional superconductivity. Theoretical studies propose proximal magnetic states in the phase diagram, but direct experimental evidence is lacking. We show direct evidence for an in-plane magnetic order proximal to the superconducting state using two complementary electrical transport measurements. First, we probe the superconducting phase by using statistically significant switching events from superconducting to the dissipative state of MATTG. The system behaves like a network of Josephson junctions due to lattice relaxation-induced moir\'e inhomogeneity in the system. We observe non-monotonic and hysteretic responses in the switching distributions as a function of temperature and in-plane magnetic field. Second, in normal regions doped slightly away from the superconducting regime, we observe hysteresis in magnetoresistance with an in-plane magnetic field; showing evidence for in-plane magnetic order that vanishes $\sim$900 mK. Additionally, we show a broadened Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition due to relaxation-induced moir\'e inhomogeneity. We find superfluid stiffness $J_{\mathrm{s}}$$\sim$0.15 K with strong temperature dependence. Theoretically, the magnetic and superconducting order arising from the magnetic order's fluctuations have been proposed - we show direct evidence for both. Our observation that the hysteretic magnetoresistance is sensitive to the in-plane field may constrain possible intervalley-coherent magnetic orders and the resulting superconductivity that arises from its fluctuations.</description>

      <title>Competing multiferroic phases in monolayer and few-layer NiI$_{2}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.14423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.14423v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A recent experiment reported type-II multiferroicity in monolayer (ML) NiI$_{2}$ based on a presumed spiral magnetic configuration (Spiral-B), which is, as we found here, under debate in the ML limit. Freestanding ML NiI$_{2}$ breaks its C$_{3}$ symmetry, as it prefers a striped antiferromagnetic order (AABB-AFM) along with an intralayer antiferroelectric (AFE) order. However, substrate confinement may preserve the C$_{3}$ symmetry and/or apply tensile strain to the ML. This leads to another spiral magnetic order (Spiral-$IV^X$), while 2L shows a different order (Spiral-$V^Y$) and Spiral-B dominates in thicker layers. Thus, three multiferroic phases, namely, Spiral-B+FE, Spiral-$IV^X$ +FE, Spiral-$V^Y$+FE, and an anti-multiferroic AABB-AFM+AFE one, show layer-thickness-dependent and geometry-dependent dominance, ascribed to competitions among thickness-dependent Kitaev, biquadratic, and Heisenberg spin-exchange interactions and single-ion magnetic anisotropy. Our theoretical results clarify the debate on the multiferroicity of ML NiI$_{2}$ and shed light on the role of layer-stacking-induced changes in noncollinear spin-exchange interactions and magnetic anisotropy in thickness-dependent magnetism.</description>

Abstract: We propose a novel approach to evaluating the ionic Seebeck coefficient in electrolytes from relatively short equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations, based on the Green-Kubo theory of linear response and Bayesian regression analysis. By exploiting the probability distribution of the off-diagonal elements of a Wishart matrix, we develop a consistent and unbiased estimator for the Seebeck coefficient whose statistical uncertainty can be arbitrarily reduced in the long-time limit. To validate the effectiveness of our method, we benchmark it against extensive equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations conducted on molten $\mathrm{CsF}$ using empirical force fields. We then employ this procedure to calculate the Seebeck coefficient of molten $\mathrm{NaCl}$, $\mathrm{KCl}$ and $\mathrm{LiCl}$ using neural-network force fields trained on ab initio data over a range of pressure-temperature conditions.</description>

      <title>Can we predict mixed grain boundaries from their tilt and twist components?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02070v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One of the major challenges towards understanding and further utilizing the properties and functional behaviors of grain boundaries (GB) is the complexity of general GBs with mixed tilt and twist characters. Here, we report the correlations between mixed GBs and their tilt and twist components in terms of structure, energy and stress field by computationally examining 7040 silicon GBs. Such correlations indicate that low angle mixed GBs are formed through the reconstruction mechanisms between their superposed tilt and twist components, which are revealed as the energetically favorable dissociation, motion and reaction of dislocations and stacking faults. In addition, various complex disconnection network structures are discovered near the conventional twin and structural unit GBs, implying the role of disconnection superposition in forming high angle mixed GBs. By unveiling the energetic correlation, an extended Read-Shockley model that predicts the general trends of GB energy is proposed and confirmed in various GB structures across different lattices. Finally, this work is validated in comparison with experimental observations and first-principles calculations.</description>

      <title>Suppression of flux jumps in high-$J_c$ Nb$_3$Sn conductors by ferromagnetic layer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06389v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Flux jumps observed in high-$J_c$ Nb$_3$Sn conductors are urgent problems to construct high field superconducting magnets. The low-field instabilities usually reduce the current-carrying capability and thus cause the premature quench of Nb$_3$Sn coils at low magnetic field. In this paper, we explore suppressing the flux jumps by ferromagnetic (FM) layer. Firstly, we experimentally and theoretically investigate the flux jumps of Nb$_3$Sn/FM hybrid wires exposed to a magnetic field loop with constant sweeping rate. Comparing with bare Nb$_3$Sn and Nb$_3$Sn/Cu wires, we reveal two underlying mechanisms that the suppression of flux jumps is mainly attributed to the thermal effect of FM layer for the case of lower sweeping rate, whereas both thermal and electromagnetic effects play a crucial role for the case of higher sweeping rate. Furthermore, we explore the flux jumps of Nb$_3$Sn/FM hybrid wires exposed to AC magnetic fields with amplitude $B_{a0}$ and frequency $\rm\omega$. We build up the phase diagrams of flux jumps in the plane $\rm\omega$-$B_{a0}$ for bare Nb$_{3}$Sn wire, Nb$_{3}$Sn/Cu wire and Nb$_{3}$Sn/FM wire, respectively. We stress that the region of flux jumps of Nb$_{3}$Sn/FM wire is much smaller than the other two wires, which indicates that the Nb$_{3}$Sn/FM wire has significant advantage over merely increasing the heat capacity. The findings shed light on suppression of the flux jumps by utilizing FM materials, which is useful for developing new type of high-$J_c$ Nb$_{3}$Sn conductors.</description>

      <title>Establishing the relationship between generalized crystallographic texture and macroscopic yield surfaces using partial input convex neural networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03863v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we present a methodology to predict the macroscopic yield surface of metals and metallic alloys with general crystallographic textures. In previous work, we have established the use of partially input convex neural networks (pICNN) as macroscopic yield functions of crystal plasticity simulations. However, this work was performed with an over-abundance of data, and on limited crystallographic textures. Here, we extend this study to approach more realistic material states (i.e., complex crystallographic textures), and consider data-availability as a major driver for our approach. We present our modified framework capable of handling generalized material states and demonstrate its effectiveness on samples with multi-modal textures deformed under plane stress conditions. We further describe an adaptive algorithm for the generation of training data as informed by the shape of yield surfaces to reduce the time for both the generation of training data as well as pICNN training. Finally, we will discuss errors in both training and test datasets, limitations, and future extensibility.</description>

Abstract: Despite the ubiquity of ice, a molecular-resolution image of ice crystallized from liquid water or the resulting defect structure has never been obtained. Here, we report the stabilization and angstrom-resolution electron imaging of ice Ih crystallized from liquid water. We combine lattice mapping with molecular dynamics simulations to reveal that ice formation is highly tolerant to nanoscale defects such as misoriented subdomains and trapped gas bubbles, which are stabilized by molecular-scale structural motifs. Importantly, bubble surfaces adopt low-energy nanofacets and create negligible strain fields in the surrounding crystal. These bubbles can dynamically nucleate, grow, migrate, dissolve, and coalesce under electron irradiation and be monitored in situ near a steady state. This work opens the door to understanding water crystallization behaviors at an unprecedented spatial resolution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2202.10993v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The manner in which metallic glasses fail under external loading is known to correlate well with those glasses' Poisson's ratio $\nu$: low-$\nu$ (compressible) glasses typically feature brittle failure patterns with scarce plastic deformation, while high-$\nu$ (incompressible) glasses typically fail in a ductile manner, accompanied by a high degree of plastic deformation and extensive liquid-like flow. Since the technological utility of metallic glasses depends on their ductility, materials scientists have been concerned with fabricating high-$\nu$ glassy alloys. To shed light on the underlying micromechanical origin of high-$\nu$ metallic glasses, we employ computer simulations of a simple glass-forming model with a single tunable parameter that controls the interparticle-potential's stiffness. We show that the presented model gives rise to ultra high-$\nu$ glasses, reaching $\nu\!=\!0.45$ and thus exceeding the most incompressible laboratory metallic glass. We discuss the possible role of the so-called unjamming transition in controlling the elasticity of ultra high-$\nu$ glasses. To this aim, we show that our higher-$\nu$ computer glasses host relatively softer quasilocalized glassy excitations, and establish relations between their associated characteristic frequency, macroscopic elasticity, and mechanical disorder.</description>

      <title>Two-dimensional coherent spectrum of high-spin models via a quantum computing approach</title>

Abstract: We present and benchmark a quantum computing approach to calculate the two-dimensional coherent spectrum (2DCS) of high-spin models. Our approach is based on simulating their real-time dynamics in the presence of several magnetic field pulses, which are spaced in time. We utilize the adaptive variational quantum dynamics simulation (AVQDS) algorithm for the study due to its compact circuits, which enables simulations over sufficiently long times to achieve the required resolution in frequency space. Specifically, we consider an antiferromagnetic quantum spin model that incorporates Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions and single-ion anisotropy. The obtained 2DCS spectra exhibit distinct peaks at multiples of the magnon frequency, arising from transitions between different eigenstates of the unperturbed Hamiltonian. By comparing the one-dimensional coherent spectrum with 2DCS, we demonstrate that 2DCS provides a higher resolution of the energy spectrum. We further investigate how the quantum resources scale with the magnitude of the spin using two different binary encodings of the high-spin operators: the standard binary encoding and the Gray code. At low magnetic fields both encodings require comparable quantum resources, but at larger field strengths the Gray code is advantageous. Numerical simulations for spin models with increasing number of sites indicate a polynomial system-size scaling for quantum resources. Lastly, we compare the numerical 2DCS with experimental results on a rare-earth orthoferrite system. The observed strength of the magnonic high-harmonic generation signals in the 2DCS of the quantum high-spin model aligns well with the experimental data, showing significant improvement over the corresponding mean-field results.</description>

      <title>Quantum Hall Transport Measurements of Lateral p-n Junctions Formed via Precise Spatial Photodoping of Graphene/hBN Heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01998v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Doped semiconductors are a central and crucial component of all integrated circuits. By using a combination of white light and a focused laser beam, and exploiting hBN defect states, heterostructures of hBN/Graphene/hBN are photodoped in-operando, reproducibly and reversibly. We demonstrate device geometries with spatially-defined doping type and magnitude. After each optical doping procedure, magnetotransport measurements including quantum Hall measurements are performed to characterize the device performance. In the unipolar (p+-p-p+ and n-n+-n) configurations, we observe quantization of the longitudinal resistance, proving well-defined doped regions and interfaces that are further analyzed by Landauer-Buttiker modeling. Our unique measurements and modeling of these optically doped devices reveal a complete separation of the p- and n-Landau level edge states. The non-interaction of the edge states results in an observed "insulating" state in devices with a bi-polar p-n-p configuration that is uncommon and has not been measured previously in graphene devices. This insulating state could be utilized in high-performance graphene electrical switches. These quantitative magnetotransport measurements confirm that these doping techniques can be applied to any 2D materials encapsulated within hBN layers, enabling versatile, rewritable circuit elements for future computing and memory applications.</description>

      <title>$^{27}$Al NMR study of the magnetic Weyl semimetal CeAlGe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06476v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the recent observations of electronic correlation effect [M. Corasaniti \textit{et al}., Phys. Rev. B \textbf{104}, L121112 (2021)] and topology-stabilized magnetic fluctuations [N. Drucker \textit{et al}., Nat. Commun. \textbf{14}, 5182 (2023)] in the noncentrosymmetric magnetic Weyl semimetal candidate CeAlGe, we performed systematic studies on the local static and dynamic spin susceptibilities by $^{27}$Al nuclear magnetic resonance. Due to the large spin susceptibility from Ce-$4f$ electrons, the theoretically predicted responses from Weyl fermions are overwhelmed. A Knight-shift anomaly is observed below $T^*\sim50$ K, a signature of the onset of coherent Kondo coupling. In addition, an anomalous peak is found in $1/T_1T$ near 15 K, well above the magnetic ordering temperature $T_N \approx 5$ K, which probably is a consequence of topology-stabilized magnetic fluctuations. These results highlight the interplay among electronic correlation, magnetism and band topology in this family of Kondo Weyl semimetals.</description>
