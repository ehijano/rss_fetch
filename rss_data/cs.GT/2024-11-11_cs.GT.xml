      <title>Parameterized Voter Relevance in Facility Location Games with Tree-Shaped Invitation Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05574v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion mechanism design, which investigate how to incentivise agents to invite as many colleagues to a multi-agent decision making as possible, is a new research paradigm at the intersection between microeconomics and computer science. In this paper we extend traditional facility location games into the model of diffusion mechanism design. Our objective is to completely understand to what extent of anonymity/voter-relevance we can achieve, along with strategy-proofness and Pareto efficiency when voters strategically invite collegues. We define a series of anonymity properties applicable to the diffusion mechanism design model, as well as parameterized voter-relevance properties for guaranteeing reasonably-fair decision making. We obtained two impossibility theorems and two existence theorems, which partially answer the question we have raised in the beginning of the paper</description>

      <title>Expectation vs. Reality: Towards Verification of Psychological Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Game theory provides an effective way to model strategic interactions among rational agents. In the context of formal verification, these ideas can be used to produce guarantees on the correctness of multi-agent systems, with a diverse range of applications from computer security to autonomous driving. Psychological games (PGs) were developed as a way to model and analyse agents with belief-dependent motivations, opening up the possibility to model how human emotions can influence behaviour. In PGs, players' utilities depend not only on what actually happens (which strategies players choose to adopt), but also on what the players had expected to happen (their belief as to the strategies that would be played). Despite receiving much attention in fields such as economics and psychology, very little consideration has been given to their applicability to problems in computer science, nor to practical algorithms and tool support. In this paper, we start to bridge that gap, proposing methods to solve PGs and implementing them within PRISM-games, a formal verification tool for stochastic games. We discuss how to model these games, highlight specific challenges for their analysis and illustrate the usefulness of our approach on several case studies, including human behaviour in traffic scenarios.</description>

      <title>Settling the Complexity of Popularity in Additively Separable and Fractional Hedonic Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05713v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study coalition formation in the framework of hedonic games. There, a set of agents needs to be partitioned into disjoint coalitions, where agents have a preference order over coalitions. A partition is called popular if it does not lose a majority vote among the agents against any other partition. Unfortunately, hedonic games need not admit popular partitions and prior work suggests significant computational hardness. We confirm this impression by proving that deciding about the existence of popular partitions in additively separable and fractional hedonic games is $\Sigma_2^p$-complete. This settles the complexity of these problems and is the first work that proves completeness of popularity for the second level of the polynomial hierarchy.</description>

      <title>Online Nash Welfare Maximization Without Predictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.03077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.03077v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The maximization of Nash welfare, which equals the geometric mean of agents' utilities, is widely studied because it balances efficiency and fairness in resource allocation problems. Banerjee, Gkatzelis, Gorokh, and Jin (2022) recently introduced the model of online Nash welfare maximization for $T$ divisible items and $N$ agents with additive utilities with predictions of each agent's utility for receiving all items. They gave online algorithms whose competitive ratios are logarithmic. We initiate the study of online Nash welfare maximization \emph{without predictions}, assuming either that the agents' utilities for receiving all items differ by a bounded ratio, or that their utilities for the Nash welfare maximizing allocation differ by a bounded ratio. We design online algorithms whose competitive ratios only depend on the logarithms of the aforementioned ratios of agents' utilities and the number of agents.</description>

      <title>Market efficiency, informational asymmetry and pseudo-collusion of adaptively learning agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05032v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We examine the dynamics of informational efficiency in a market with asymmetrically informed, boundedly rational traders who adaptively learn optimal strategies using simple multiarmed bandit (MAB) algorithms. The strategies available to the traders have two dimensions: on the one hand, the traders must endogenously choose whether to acquire a costly information signal, on the other, they must determine how aggressively they trade by choosing the share of their wealth to be invested in the risky asset. Our study contributes to two strands of literature: the literature comparing the effects of competitive and strategic behavior on asset price efficiency under costly information as well as the actively growing literature on algorithmic tacit collusion and pseudo-collusion in financial markets. We find that for certain market environments (with low information costs) our model reproduces the results of Kyle [1989] in that the ability of traders to trade strategically leads to worse price efficiency compared to the purely competitive case. For other environments (with high information costs), on the other hand, our results show that a market with strategically acting traders can be more efficient than a purely competitive one. Furthermore, we obtain novel results on the ability of independently learning traders to coordinate on a pseudo-collusive behavior, leading to non-competitive pricing. Contrary to some recent contributions (see e.g. [Cartea et al. 2022]), we find that the pseudo-collusive behavior in our model is robust to a large number of agents, demonstrating that even in the setting of financial markets with a large number of independently learning traders non-competitive pricing and pseudo-collusive behavior can frequently arise.</description>

      <title>Performative Reinforcement Learning with Linear Markov Decision Process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05234v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the setting of \emph{performative reinforcement learning} where the deployed policy affects both the reward, and the transition of the underlying Markov decision process. Prior work~\parencite{MTR23} has addressed this problem under the tabular setting and established last-iterate convergence of repeated retraining with iteration complexity explicitly depending on the number of states. In this work, we generalize the results to \emph{linear Markov decision processes} which is the primary theoretical model of large-scale MDPs. The main challenge with linear MDP is that the regularized objective is no longer strongly convex and we want a bound that scales with the dimension of the features, rather than states which can be infinite. Our first result shows that repeatedly optimizing a regularized objective converges to a \emph{performatively stable policy}. In the absence of strong convexity, our analysis leverages a new recurrence relation that uses a specific linear combination of optimal dual solutions for proving convergence. We then tackle the finite sample setting where the learner has access to a set of trajectories drawn from the current policy. We consider a reparametrized version of the primal problem, and construct an empirical Lagrangian which is to be optimized from the samples. We show that, under a \emph{bounded coverage} condition, repeatedly solving a saddle point of this empirical Lagrangian converges to a performatively stable solution, and also construct a primal-dual algorithm that solves the empirical Lagrangian efficiently. Finally, we show several applications of the general framework of performative RL including multi-agent systems.</description>

      <title>Statistical Discrimination in Ratings-Guided Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.11531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2004.11531v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study statistical discrimination of individuals based on payoff-irrelevant social identities in markets that utilize ratings and recommendations for social learning. Even though rating/recommendation algorithms can be designed to be fair and unbiased, ratings-based social learning can still lead to discriminatory outcomes. Our model demonstrates how users' attention choices can result in asymmetric data sampling across social groups, leading to discriminatory inferences and potential discrimination based on group identities.</description>

      <title>Linearly representable games and pseudo-polynomial calculation of the Shapley value</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.12324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.12324v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of linearly representable games. Broadly speaking, these are TU games that can be described by as many parameters as the number of players, like weighted voting games, airport games, or bankruptcy games. We show that the Shapley value calculation is pseudo-polynomial for linearly representable games. This is a generalization of many classical and recent results in the literature. Our method naturally turns into a strictly polynomial algorithm when the parameters are polynomial in the number of players.</description>

      <title>Learning in Stackelberg Games with Non-myopic Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.09407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.09407v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study Stackelberg games where a principal repeatedly interacts with a non-myopic long-lived agent, without knowing the agent's payoff function. Although learning in Stackelberg games is well-understood when the agent is myopic, dealing with non-myopic agents poses additional complications. In particular, non-myopic agents may strategize and select actions that are inferior in the present in order to mislead the principal's learning algorithm and obtain better outcomes in the future.
  We provide a general framework that reduces learning in presence of non-myopic agents to robust bandit optimization in the presence of myopic agents. Through the design and analysis of minimally reactive bandit algorithms, our reduction trades off the statistical efficiency of the principal's learning algorithm against its effectiveness in inducing near-best-responses. We apply this framework to Stackelberg security games (SSGs), pricing with unknown demand curve, general finite Stackelberg games, and strategic classification. In each setting, we characterize the type and impact of misspecifications present in near-best responses and develop a learning algorithm robust to such misspecifications.
  On the way, we improve the state-of-the-art query complexity of learning in SSGs with $n$ targets from $O(n^3)$ to a near-optimal $\widetilde{O}(n)$ by uncovering a fundamental structural property of these games. The latter result is of independent interest beyond learning with non-myopic agents.</description>

      <title>Six Candidates Suffice to Win a Voter Majority</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03390v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A cornerstone of social choice theory is Condorcet's paradox which says that in an election where $n$ voters rank $m$ candidates it is possible that, no matter which candidate is declared the winner, a majority of voters would have preferred an alternative candidate. Instead, can we always choose a small committee of winning candidates that is preferred to any alternative candidate by a majority of voters?
  Elkind, Lang, and Saffidine raised this question and called such a committee a Condorcet winning set. They showed that winning sets of size $2$ may not exist, but sets of size logarithmic in the number of candidates always do. In this work, we show that Condorcet winning sets of size $6$ always exist, regardless of the number of candidates or the number of voters. More generally, we show that if $\frac{\alpha}{1 - \ln \alpha} \geq \frac{2}{k + 1}$, then there always exists a committee of size $k$ such that less than an $\alpha$ fraction of the voters prefer an alternate candidate. These are the first nontrivial positive results that apply for all $k \geq 2$.
  Our proof uses the probabilistic method and the minimax theorem, inspired by recent work on approximately stable committee selection. We construct a distribution over committees that performs sufficiently well (when compared against any candidate on any small subset of the voters) so that this distribution must contain a committee with the desired property in its support.</description>

      <title>Some Characterizations of TTC in Multiple-Object Reallocation Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04822v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper considers reallocation of indivisible objects when agents are endowed with and can consume any bundles. We obtain characterizations of generalized versions of the Top Trading Cycles (TTC) rule on several preference domains. On the lexicographic domain, the TTC rule is uniquely determined by balancedness, Pareto efficiency, the worst endowment lower bound, and either truncation-proofness or drop strategy-proofness. On the more general responsive domain, the TTC rule is the unique individual-good-based rule that satisfies balancedness, individual-good efficiency, truncation-proofness, and either individual rationality or the worst endowment lower bound. On the conditionally lexicographic domain, the augmented TTC rule is characterized by balancedness, Pareto efficiency, the worst endowment lower bound, and drop strategy-proofness. The conditionally lexicographic domain is a maximal domain on which Pareto efficiency coincides with individual-good efficiency. For the housing market introduced by Shapley and Scarf (1974), the TTC rule is characterized by Pareto efficiency, individual rationality, and truncation-proofness.</description>
