      <title>Low-exposure, high-quality multimodal speckle X-ray imaging via an intrinsic gradient-flow approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new approach for retrieving dark-field, attenuation, and phase shift from speckle-based X-ray images. Speckle-based X-ray imaging (SBXI) images and quantifies how a sample modifies a reference near-field speckle pattern, which is generated by a randomly structured mask. Phase-shift images are useful because they reveal how materials in a sample refract the X-ray beam, providing contrast between similar low-density structures that are difficult to visualise in attenuation images. Dark-field images convey information about structures that are smaller than the spatial resolution and thus invisible in both attenuation and phase-shift images. In a previous work, we presented the Multimodal Intrinsic Speckle-Tracking (MIST) algorithm, which recovers the three complementary imaging modes from SBXI data by solving the associated Fokker-Planck equation. The algorithm presented in this work, the Gradient-Flow MIST, (1) reduces the amount of SBXI data required for image retrieval, (2) maintains the full generality of the X-ray Fokker-Planck equation, and (3) recovers dark-field images with higher quality than the previously proposed variants. We demonstrate the new gradient-flow MIST approach on experimental SBXI data acquired at the Australian synchrotron. This approach is anticipated to be useful in phase-contrast and dark-field applications that require simplicity in experimentation.</description>

      <title>Mitigating MRI Domain Shift in Sex Classification: A Deep Learning Approach with ComBat Harmonization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20300v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning models for medical image analysis often suffer from performance degradation when applied to data from different scanners or protocols, a phenomenon known as domain shift. This study investigates this challenge in the context of sex classification from 3D T1-weighted brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans using the IXI and OASIS3 datasets. While models achieved high within-domain accuracy (around 0.95) when trained and tested on a single dataset (IXI or OASIS3), we demonstrate a significant performance drop to chance level (about 0.50) when models trained on one dataset are tested on the other, highlighting the presence of a strong domain shift. To address this, we employed the ComBat harmonization technique to align the feature distributions of the two datasets. We evaluated three state-of-the-art 3D deep learning architectures (3D ResNet18, 3D DenseNet, and 3D EfficientNet) across multiple training strategies. Our results show that ComBat harmonization effectively reduces the domain shift, leading to a substantial improvement in cross-domain classification performance. For instance, the cross-domain balanced accuracy of our best model (ResNet18 3D with Attention) improved from approximately 0.50 (chance level) to 0.61 after harmonization. t-SNE visualization of extracted features provides clear qualitative evidence of the reduced domain discrepancy post-harmonization. This work underscores the critical importance of domain adaptation techniques for building robust and generalizable neuroimaging AI models.</description>

      <title>Unraveling the Redox Mechanisms Underlying FLASH Radiotherapy: Critical Dose Thresholds and NRF2-Driven Tissue Sparing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20510v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: FLASH radiotherapy (FLASH-RT) achieves tumor control comparable to conventional dose-rate irradiation (CONV-RT) while significantly reducing radiation damage to normal tissues. However, the physical conditions triggering the FLASH sparing effect remain unclear, and mechanisms related to oxidative stress and redox regulation are poorly understood. This study utilizes a murine acute intestinal toxicity model to investigate how beam parameters influence the FLASH sparing effect and tumor control using innovative FLASH-RT and CONV-RT combined irradiation. Results demonstrate for the first time that a substantially reduced FLASH dose can still elicit sparing effect, provided a total dose threshold is met. Kinetic simulation and experimental validation demonstrate that FLASH-RT enhances peroxyl radical recombination, reducing reactive oxygen species (ROS) and malondialdehyde levels. Antioxidant interventions further confirm the essential role of free radicals. RNA sequencing and molecular analyses reveal that FLASH-RT activates the nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (NRF2) antioxidant pathway while suppressing extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK) signaling, thereby enhancing cellular redox defenses, reducing apoptosis, and mitigating ROS-mediated tissue injury. These findings highlight the feasibility of optimizing the FLASH-RT therapeutic window through redox modulation and provide a foundation for developing free radical-targeted strategies to improve its therapeutic efficacy.</description>

      <title>Matrixed-Spectrum Decomposition Accelerated Linear Boltzmann Transport Equation Solver for Fast Scatter Correction in Multi-Spectral CT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20524v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: X-ray scatter has been a serious concern in computed tomography (CT), leading to image artifacts and distortion of CT values. The linear Boltzmann transport equation (LBTE) is recognized as a fast and accurate approach for scatter estimation. However, for multi-spectral CT, it is cumbersome to compute multiple scattering components for different spectra separately when applying LBTE-based scatter correction. In this work, we propose a Matrixed-Spectrum Decomposition accelerated LBTE solver (MSD-LBTE) that can be used to compute X-ray scatter distributions from CT acquisitions at two or more different spectra simultaneously, in a unified framework with no sacrifice in accuracy and nearly no increase in computation in theory. First, a matrixed-spectrum solver of LBTE is obtained by introducing an additional label dimension to expand the phase space. Then, we propose a ``spectrum basis'' for LBTE and a principle of selection of basis using the QR decomposition, along with the above solver to construct the MSD-LBTE. Based on MSD-LBTE, a unified scatter correction method can be established for multi-spectral CT. We validate the effectiveness and accuracy of our method by comparing it with the Monte Carlo method, including the computational time. We also evaluate the scatter correction performance using two different phantoms for fast-kV switching based dual-energy CT, and using an elliptical phantom in a numerical simulation for kV-modulation enabled CT scans, validating that our proposed method can significantly reduce the computational cost at multiple spectra and effectively reduce scatter artifact in reconstructed CT images.</description>

      <title>Start-to-end modelling of laser-plasma acceleration, beam transport and dose deposition of very high-energy electrons for radiotherapy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20678v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radiotherapy using very high-energy electron (VHEE) beams generated by a laser-plasma accelerator has garnered significant interest due to its dose distribution capabilities and potential to address limitations of traditional photon-based radiotherapy. To explore the feasibility of such approach, the presented study uses the parameters of OONA, the commercial &lt;1.3\,J, &lt;25\,fs pulse duration laser recently installed at the Weizmann Institute of Science. Through particle-in-cell simulations of laser-plasma interaction, realistic electron beams were obtained. After filtering and collimation with a beamline and arranging them into an array of pencil beams, their radiotherapeutic potential was investigated. GEANT4 simulations were used to calculate the dose deposition in water phantoms and heterogeneous phantoms with bone inserts, considering realistic beam parameters for laser-plasma accelerators. Multifield irradiation setup and the dose distribution at the isocenter through different incidence angles were studied, simulating an intensity-modulated delivery. Our findings demonstrate that polychromatic VHEE beams generated from laser-plasma accelerators, when collimated using a compact beamline of quadrupoles and dipoles, can deliver an on-axis dose with enhanced precision and uniformity. This study highlights the transformative potential of laser-plasma accelerators in advancing radiotherapy modalities, paving the way for further research and clinical implementation.</description>

      <title>Ising energy model for the stochastic prediction of tumor islets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20804v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A major challenge in diagnosing and treating cancer is the infiltrative growth of tumors into surrounding tissues.
  This microscopic spread of the disease is invisible on most diagnostic imaging modalities and can often only be detected histologically in biopsies.
  The purpose of this paper is to develop a physically based model of tumor spread that captures the histologically observed behavior in terms of seeding small tumor islets in prostate cancer.
  The model is based on three elementary events: a tumor cell can move, duplicate, or die.
  The propensity of each event is given by an Ising-like Hamiltonian that captures correlations between neighboring cells.
  The model parameters were fitted to clinical data obtained from surgical specimens taken from 23 prostate cancer patients.
  The results demonstrate that this straightforward physical model effectively describes the distribution of the size and the number of tumor islets in prostate cancer.
  The simulated tumor islets exhibit a regular, approximately spherical shape, correctly mimicking the shapes observed in histology.
  This is due to the Ising interaction term between neighboring cells acting as a surface tension that gives rise to regularly shaped islets.
  The model addresses the important clinical need of calculating the probability of tumor involvement in specific sub-volumes of the prostate, which is required for radiation treatment planning and other applications.</description>

      <title>Velocity Spectrum Imaging using velocity encoding preparation pulses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20218v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The movement of water in the human body is a very complex phenomenon encompassing both diffusion and convection. These different physical principles coexist within the same voxel with dominant sub-mechanisms within different intra-voxel structures. While diffusion imaging techniques can separate diffusion populations, convective flow imaging techniques usually measure an average velocity over the voxel. In this article, we present, test and implement a new technique to measure the velocity distribution of water inside each voxel of an MR image. This approach is completely non-invasive and requires no contrast agents. Modified velocity-selective RF pulses can be used to encode velocity information analogously to k-space encoding. The velocity distribution can then be decoded via the Fourier transform. This approach yields a three-dimensional velocity vector distribution of convective flow in each voxel, analogously to Diffusion Tensor Imaging. We present the theoretical principles of this technique, and demonstrates its use on a simple flow phantom with known flow characteristics. We also demonstrate the technique on human participants used to collect the velocity distribution along the three laboratory axes, and discusses its challenges and potential applications. In addition to a useful tool for validating computational fluid dynamic models in vivo, velocity spectrum imaging can be a powerful tool to study the complex movement of water in the glymphatic system and its involvement in neurodegenerative disorders.</description>

      <title>Prediction of Local Failure after Stereotactic Radiotherapy in Melanoma Brain Metastases Using Ensemble Learning on Clinical, Dosimetric, and Radiomic Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20825v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Background: This study aimed to predict lesion-specific outcomes after stereotactic radiotherapy (SRT) in patients with brain metastases from malignant melanoma (MBM), using clinical, dosimetric, and pretherapeutic MRI data. Methods: In this multicenter retrospective study, 517 MBM from 130 patients treated with single-fraction or hypofractionated SRT at three centers were analyzed. From contrast-enhanced T1-weighted MRI, 1576 radiomic features (RF) were extracted per lesion - 788 from the gross tumor volume (GTV) and 788 from a 3 mm peritumoral margin. Clinical, dosimetric and RF data from one center were used for feature selection and model development via nested cross-validation employing an ensemble learning approach; external validation used data from the other two centers. Results: Local failure occurred in 72/517 lesions (13.9%). Predictive models based on clinical data, RF, or a combination of both achieved c-indices of 0.60 +/- 0.15, 0.65 +/- 0.11, and 0.65 +/- 0.12, respectively. RF-based models outperformed the clinical models; dosimetric data alone were not predictive. Most predictive RF originated from the peritumoral margin (92%) versus GTV (76%). On the first external dataset, all models performed similarly (c-index: 0.60-0.63), but generalization was poor on the second (c-index &lt; 0.50), likely due to differences in patient characteristics and imaging protocols. Conclusions: Pretherapeutic MRI features, particularly from the peritumoral region, show promise for predicting lesion-specific outcomes in MBM after SRT. Their consistent contribution suggests biologically relevant information that may support individualized treatment planning. Combined with clinical data, these markers offer prognostic insight, though generalizability remains limited by data heterogeneity.</description>

      <title>Ultrasound Autofocusing: Common Midpoint Phase Error Optimization via Differentiable Beamforming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03008v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In ultrasound imaging, propagation of an acoustic wavefront through heterogeneous media causes phase aberrations that degrade the coherence of the reflected wavefront, leading to reduced image resolution and contrast. Adaptive imaging techniques attempt to correct this phase aberration and restore coherence, leading to improved focusing of the image. We propose an autofocusing paradigm for aberration correction in ultrasound imaging by fitting an acoustic velocity field to pressure measurements, via optimization of the common midpoint phase error (CMPE), using a straight-ray wave propagation model for beamforming in diffusely scattering media. We show that CMPE induced by heterogeneous acoustic velocity is a robust measure of phase aberration that can be used for acoustic autofocusing. CMPE is optimized iteratively using a differentiable beamforming approach to simultaneously improve the image focus while estimating the acoustic velocity field of the interrogated medium. The approach relies solely on wavefield measurements using a straight-ray integral solution of the two-way time-of-flight without explicit numerical time-stepping models of wave propagation. We demonstrate method performance through in silico simulations, in vitro phantom measurements, and in vivo mammalian models, showing practical applications in distributed aberration quantification, correction, and velocity estimation for medical ultrasound autofocusing.</description>

      <title>Myocardial T1 mapping at 5T using multi-inversion recovery real-time spoiled GRE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07081v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Objective: To develop an accurate myocardial T1 mapping technique at 5T using Look-Locker-based multiple inversion-recovery with the real-time spoiled gradient echo (GRE) acquisition. Approach: The proposed T1 mapping technique (mIR-rt) samples the recovery of inverted magnetization using the real-time GRE and the images captured during diastole are selected for T1 fitting. Multiple-inversion recoveries are employed to increase the sample size for accurate fitting. The T1 mapping method was validated using Bloch simulation, phantom studies, and in 16 healthy volunteers at 5T. Main results: In both simulation and phantom studies, the T1 values measured by mIR-rt closely approximate the reference T1 values, with errors less than 3%, while the conventional MOLLI sequence underestimates T1 values. The myocardial T1 values at 5T are 1553 +/- 52 ms, 1531 +/- 53 ms, and 1526 +/- 60 ms (mean +/- standard deviation) at the apex, middle, and base, respectively. The T1 values measured by MOLLI (1350 +/- 48 ms, 1349 +/- 47 ms, and 1354 +/- 45 ms at the apex, middle, and base) were significantly lower than those of mIR-rt with p&lt;0.001 for all three layers. The mIR-rt sequence method used in our study provides high reproducibility, particularly in the middle slices, supporting its practical relevance for myocardial T1 mapping. Significance: The proposed method is feasible for myocardial T1 mapping at 5T and provides better accuracy than the conventional MOLLI sequence.</description>

      <title>Accurate myocardial T1 mapping at 5T using an improved MOLLI method: A validation study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08425v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Purpose: To develop Coefficient-based Fitting with Adjustment (COFIA), a 5T myocardial T1 mapping method for MOLLI that corrects inversion inefficiency and readout disturbance via empirically estimated factors, addressing limits from inversion factor, readout perturbations, and imperfect recovery. Methods: COFIA uses a modified 5-(3)-3 MOLLI with ECG gating and GRE readout. Inversion at 5T was improved by redesigning the adiabatic pulse (Tan/Tanh vs HSn). The signal model recursively includes an inversion factor (delta) and a correction factor (C); T1 is estimated by nonlinear optimization. Validation included phantom scans and in vivo studies at 5T (21 healthy volunteers, 9 patients). Results: With peak amplitude 10.6 uT, the Tan/Tanh pulse outperformed HSn, yielding average delta = 0.9014 across Delta B0 = +/-250 Hz and B1 = 225-540 kHz. Phantom experiments showed errors within 5%. In vivo, native myocardial T1 (mean+/-SD) was 1468+/-48 ms (apex), 1514+/-39 ms (middle), and 1545+/-50 ms (base); blood T1 was 2182+/-132 ms, 2124+/-153 ms, and 2131+/-158 ms at the three levels. Conclusion: COFIA achieved accurate phantom T1 and feasible in vivo mapping at 5T. Using the standard 5(3)3 MOLLI acquisition, it supports clinical translation of 5T cardiac imaging.</description>

      <title>Stopping cross-section for protons across different phases of water</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.23396v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurately quantifying the energy loss rate of proton beams in liquid water is crucial for the precise application and improvement of proton therapy, whereas the slowing down of proton in water ices also plays an important role in astrophysics. However, precisely determining the electronic stopping power, particularly for the liquid phase, has been elusive so far. Experimental techniques are difficult to apply to volatile liquids, and the availability of sufficient reliable measurements has been limited to the solid and vapor phases. The accuracy of current models is typically limited to proton energies just above the energy-loss maximum, making it difficult to predict radiation effects at an energy range of special relevance. We elucidate the phase differences in proton energy loss in water in a wide energy range (0.001-10 MeV) by means of real-time time-dependent density functional theory combined with the Penn method. This non-perturbative model, more computationally-efficient than current approaches, describes the phase effects in water in excellent agreement with available experimental data, revealing clear deviations around the maximum of the stopping power curve and below. As an important outcome, our calculations reveal that proton stopping quantities of liquid water and amorphous ice are identical, in agreement with recent similar observations for low-energy electrons, pointing out to this equivalence for all charged particles. This could help to overcome the limitation in obtaining reliable experimental information for the biologically-relevant liquid water target.</description>

Abstract: A model-independent method is proposed to characterize and correct charge sharing spectral distortions in energy-resolved X-ray acquisitions with pixellated photon-counting detectors. The technique is based on the determination of a coincidence-based response matrix (CBRM) through a preliminary calibration with a uniform irradiation and an arbitrary polychromatic spectrum. The calibration requires the collection of the number of coincidences between a reference pixel and its neighbours for different combinations of energy bins, in order to calculate a set of charge sharing probabilities which are independent of the input spectrum. A detector response matrix is determined, which can afterwards be applied to correct other spectra acquired with the same detector and a conventional multi-comparator electronics, without introducing penalties in terms of processing time. The technique was validated with Geant4 simulations of a 1 mm thick CdTe detector and with data collected with a pixel hybrid detector made of a 300 um thick silicon sensor coupled to a Timepix4 ASIC chip. The differences between the reconstructed spectra and reference distributions of an ideal detector or a 3x3 offline clustering algorithm were evaluated in terms of mean absolute percentage errors. It is demonstrated that the response matrix can restore the spectral information with a performance close to standard clustering algorithms and is less affected by noise artifacts than analog charge summing techniques.</description>
