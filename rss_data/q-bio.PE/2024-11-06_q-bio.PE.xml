      <title>Interaction between harvesting intervention and birth perturbation in an age-structured model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02748v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An age-structured fish model with birth and harvesting pulses is established, where birth pulses are responsible for increasing the amount of fish due to the constant multiple placement of juveniles, and harvesting pulses describe the decrease of fish due to fishing activities. The principal eigenvalue as a threshold value depending on the harvesting and birth intensity is firstly investigated by three different ways. The asymptotic behavior of the population is fully investigated and sufficient conditions for the species to be extinct or persist are given. Numerical simulations suggest that interaction between negative harvesting intervention and positive birth perturbation decides extinction and persistence of the species. It is also shown that perturbation timing plays an important role.</description>

      <title>Comparison of two mean-field approaches to modeling an epidemic spread</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02800v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper describes and compares three approaches to modeling an epidemic spread. The first approach is a well-known system of SIR ordinary differential equations. The second is a mean-field model, in which an isolation strategy for each epidemiological group (Susceptible, Infected, and Removed) is chosen as an optimal control. The third is another meanfield model, in which isolation strategy is common for the entire population. The considered models have been compared analytically, their sensitivity analysis has been carried out and their predictive capabilities have been estimated using sets of synthetic and real data. For one of the meanfield models, its finite-difference analogue has been devised. The models have also been assessed in terms of their applicability for predicting a viral epidemic spread.</description>

      <title>Heterogeneity in temporally fluctuating environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many biological systems regulate phenotypic heterogeneity as a fitness-maximising strategy in uncertain and dynamic environments. Analysis of such strategies is typically confined both to a discrete set of environmental conditions, and to a discrete (often binary) set of phenotypes specialised to each condition. In this work, we extend theory on both fronts to encapsulate a possibly continuous spectrum of phenotypes arising in response to two broad classes of environmental fluctuations that drive changes in the phenotype-dependent growth rates. Specifically, we develop mathematical theory to investigate diversification strategies in environments driven directly by white-noise processes, and in those that manifest growth rates that are continuous almost always. Our primary goal is to demonstrate the existence of regimes in which both discrete and continuous models of heterogeneity are evolutionary advantageous. For tractability, we restrict our analysis to a simplistic exponential growth model, and consider several biologically relevant simplifications that pertain to the relative timescale of phenotype switching. These assumptions yield a series of analytical and semi-analytical expressions that reveal regimes in which heterogeneity is evolutionary advantegeous.</description>

      <title>A phenotype-structured mathematical model for the influence of hypoxia on oncolytic virotherapy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02413v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The effectiveness of oncolytic virotherapy is significantly affected by several elements of the tumour microenvironment, which reduce the ability of the virus to infect cancer cells. In this work, we focus on the influence of hypoxia on this therapy and develop a novel continuous mathematical model that considers both the spatial and epigenetic heterogeneity of the tumour. We investigate how oxygen gradients within tumours affect the spatial distribution and replication of both the tumour and oncolytic viruses, focusing on regions of severe hypoxia versus normoxic areas. Additionally, we analyse the evolutionary dynamics of tumour cells under hypoxic conditions and their influence on susceptibility to viral infection. Our findings show that the reduced metabolic activity of hypoxic cells may significantly impact the virotherapy effectiveness; the knowledge of the tumour's oxygenation could, therefore, suggest the most suitable type of virus to optimise the outcome. The combination of numerical simulations and theoretical results for the model equilibrium values allows us to elucidate the complex interplay between viruses, tumour evolution and oxygen dynamics, ultimately contributing to developing more effective and personalised cancer treatments.</description>

      <title>Stochastic trade-offs and the emergence of diversification in E. coli evolution experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.11033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.11033v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Laboratory experiments with bacterial colonies, under well-controlled conditions often lead to evolutionary diversification, where at least two ecotypes emerge from an initially monomorphic population. Empirical evidence suggests that such ''evolutionary branching'' occurs stochastically, even under fixed and stable conditions. This stochastic nature is characterized by: (i) occurrence in a significant fraction, but not all, of experimental settings, (ii) emergence at widely varying times, and (iii) variable relative abundances of the resulting subpopulations across experiments. Theoretical approaches to understanding evolutionary branching under these conditions have been previously developed within the (deterministic) framework of ''adaptive dynamics''. Here, we advance the understanding of the stochastic nature of evolutionary outcomes by introducing the concept of ''stochastic trade-offs'' as opposed to ''hard'' ones. The key idea is that the stochasticity of mutations occurs in a high-dimensional trait space and this translates into variability that is constrained to a flexible tradeoff curve. By incorporating this additional source of stochasticity, we are able to account for the observed empirical variability and make predictions regarding the likelihood of evolutionary branching under different conditions. This approach effectively bridges the gap between theoretical predictions and experimental observations, providing insights into when and how evolutionary branching is more likely to occur in laboratory experiments.</description>

      <title>Branch length statistics in phylogenetic trees under constant-rate birth-death dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13403v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Phylogenetic trees represent the evolutionary relationships between extant lineages, where extinct or non-sampled lineages are omitted. Extending the work of Stadler and collaborators, this paper focuses on the branch lengths in phylogenetic trees arising under a constant-rate birth-death model. We derive branch length distributions of phylogenetic branches with and without random sampling of individuals of the extant population under two distinct statistical scenarios: a fixed age of the birth-death process and a fixed number of individuals at the time of observation. We find that branches connected to the tree leaves (pendant branches) and branches in the interior of the tree behave very differently under sampling; pendant branches grow longer without limit as the sampling probability is decreased, whereas the interior branch lengths quickly reach an asymptotic distribution that does not depend on the sampling probability.</description>
