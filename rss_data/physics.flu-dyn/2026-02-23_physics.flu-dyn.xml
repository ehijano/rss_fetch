      <title>The microscopic origin of droplet line tension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17707v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The size dependence of the equilibrium droplet contact angle is governed by line tension. In this work, we identify a contribution to line tension arising from gravitational effects and pressure-induced changes in volume-fraction-dependent interfacial tensions within an adsorption layer. This mechanism addresses a multiscale problem of line tension in droplets ranging from nanometric to millimetric sizes that change sign and span several orders of magnitude, in agreement with experimental and simulation results. The sign of the apparent line tension is controlled by surface wettability, the initial volume fraction in the adsorption layer, and the droplet size, which also strongly influences its magnitude. Our results provide a unified physical interpretation of the experimentally observed variability in both the sign and magnitude of line tensions.</description>

      <title>On the turbulent wake of the actuated fluidic pinball: dynamics, bifurcations and control authority</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17713v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first comprehensive experimental and numerical study featuring the turbulent wake of the fluidic pinball for a large actuation range. The fluidic pinball is a cluster of three equal circular cylinders centered on the vertices of an equilateral triangle, pointing upstream in uniform flow. This configuration has become a canonical benchmark for control-oriented reduced-order modeling, for nonlinear control design and for a large kaleidoscope of drag reduction mechanisms. While the literature covers well the laminar two-dimensional Reynolds number regime, we focus on unexplored terra incognita: experiments of the symmetrically actuated turbulent regime at a Reynolds number of Re=9100. In other words, the upstream cylinder is kept stationary, while the two downstream cylinders rotate with equal and opposite angular velocities. A large range of base-bleeding and boat-tailing actuation parameters is investigated with time-resolved particle image velocimetry and aerodynamic force measurement with a companion Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes simulation. Our results indicate that the turbulent wake of the fluidic pinball can be approximated by a three-dimensional actuation manifold comprising two inverse pitchfork bifurcations. In the boat-tailing limit, a reduced control authority with a new low-frequency shedding state is observed.</description>

      <title>Learning Flow Distributions via Projection-Constrained Diffusion on Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17773v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a generative modeling framework for synthesizing physically feasible two-dimensional incompressible flows under arbitrary obstacle geometries and boundary conditions. Whereas existing diffusion-based flow generators either ignore physical constraints, impose soft penalties that do not guarantee feasibility, or specialize to fixed geometries, our approach integrates three complementary components: (1) a boundary-conditioned diffusion model operating on velocity fields; (2) a physics-informed training objective incorporating a divergence penalty; and (3) a projection-constrained reverse diffusion process that enforces exact incompressibility through a geometry-aware Helmholtz-Hodge operator. We derive the method as a discrete approximation to constrained Langevin sampling on the manifold of divergence-free vector fields, providing a connection between modern diffusion models and geometric constraint enforcement in incompressible flow spaces. Experiments on analytic Navier-Stokes data and obstacle-bounded flow configurations demonstrate significantly improved divergence, spectral accuracy, vorticity statistics, and boundary consistency relative to unconstrained, projection-only, and penalty-only baselines. Our formulation unifies soft and hard physical structure within diffusion models and provides a foundation for generative modeling of incompressible fields in robotics, graphics, and scientific computing.</description>

      <title>Impact of Structure-Preserving Discretizations on Compressible Wall-Bounded Turbulence of Thermally Perfect Gases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Direct numerical simulations of compressible turbulent channel flow at supersonic and hypersonic Mach numbers are performed using a thermally perfect gas model for CO$_2$. The objective is to assess the role of structure-preserving discretizations of the convective terms in high-enthalpy regimes, with particular emphasis on entropy conservation, kinetic-energy preservation, and consistency with the thermodynamic closure.
  The comparative analysis of various formulations examines their impact on robustness, thermodynamic fluctuations, and turbulence statistics across a range of Mach numbers. Differences among formulations are found to originate primarily in the treatment of thermodynamic variables and progressively influence the dynamical fields as compressibility effects intensify. In particular, the coupling between entropy consistency and pressure discretization is shown to affect Reynolds stresses and mean flow properties in high-speed regimes.
  Overall, the results indicate that consistency between the numerical formulation and the thermodynamic model contributes significantly to the reliable simulation of high-enthalpy compressible turbulence. The study systematically assesses entropy-conservative discretizations for thermally perfect gases in wall-bounded flows and examines their impact on thermodynamic-dynamic coupling at high Mach numbers.</description>

      <title>The influence of body anisotropy on wake characteristics and enstrophy production for prolate ellipsoids at $ \mathrm{Re}_{D} = 10,000 $</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17804v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The flow around prolate ellipsoids is investigated using Large Eddy Simulation (LES) at a Reynolds number of $ \mathrm{Re}_{D} = 10,000 $. Five different aspect ratios are considered, with $ \mathit{AR} = H/D $ varying from 5:1 to 1:1, where $D$ and $H$ represent the minor- and major- axes, respectively. The major axes of the ellipsoids are set perpendicular to the freestream, and the influence of body anisotropy on boundary layer separation, shear layer behaviour, enstrophy production, and local flow topology is examined. Higher body anisotropy leads to early separation of the boundary layer in the equatorial plane, resulting in a wider wake and a monotonic increase in pressure drag and total drag. Positive enstrophy production reaches a maximum approximately $2.5D$ downstream of the ellipsoids independently of body anisotropy. High body anisotropy leads to sustained negative enstrophy production in the near-wake, specifically near the poles of the 5:1 ellipsoid. Negative production occurs due to the distinct behaviour of streamlines near the high curvature pole, where they undergo strong anisotropic contraction in the cross-stream plane. Interactions between the vorticity vector and the intermediate eigenvector of the strain rate tensor are shown to be the primary source of enstrophy production close to the pole, and the intermediate eigenvalue exhibits negative values in this region. The negative production region is shown to be dominated by the unstable focus / compressing (UF/C) topology, which is consistent with findings from other studies that report negative enstrophy production in turbulent flows.</description>

      <title>Optimization of Higher-Order Harmonic Surface Tessellations for Additively Manufactured Air-to-Air Heat Exchangers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17824v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Air-to-air heat exchangers are vital for energy recovery and thermal management but often suffer from reduced effectiveness, high pressure losses, and increased pumping power in conventional designs. Advances in additive manufacturing have enabled nature-inspired geometries, such as lattice and triply periodic minimal surface (TPMS) structures, which enhance heat transfer through complex first-order surfaces but frequently cause excessive pressure drops. This study proposes an optimized higher-order harmonic heat-transfer surface tessellation developed through an optimization framework integrating analytical and numerical methods. The goal is to improve the overall thermal-hydraulic performance of the heat exchanger over a range of operating conditions. Results of sensitivity analysis show that secondary surface modification of this type can yield significant increase in the effectiveness reaching up to 70% although with associated increase in the pressure drop. The secondary surface wave frequency was found to be a more important control parameter than the amplitude in achieving high thermal-hydraulic performance. Additionally, we show that the optimized second order harmonic-type structure achieved relatively higher effectiveness and lower pressure-drop than the gyroid structure in the turbulent flow regime for Re&gt;=7000. Although the gyroid TPMS structure had relatively higher effectiveness in the laminar and weakly turbulent flow regime, the associated pressure drop was found to be significantly higher than that of the harmonic-type structure.</description>

      <title>Manifestation of spurious currents and interface regularization in wind turbulence over fast-propagating waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18024v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate simulation of wind turbulence over fast-propagating waves requires interface-capturing methods that suppress numerical artifacts while accurately resolving momentum transfer across the interface. In high wave-age regimes, numerical errors at the air-water interface can reach magnitudes comparable to the physical flow, directly affecting predicted turbulence statistics. This study examines widely used interface-capturing techniques to evaluate how spurious currents and interface regularization influence wind-wave simulations through curvature estimation and flux discretization. A systematic assessment is performed using static and translating droplet benchmarks, together with solitary and monochromatic wave cases, to identify and quantify the dominant numerical error mechanisms. In addition, comparison with experimental measurements reveals how these primary error sources manifest in coupled wind-wave simulations. These findings clarify the numerical origin of the observed discrepancies and underscore the importance of accurate curvature and flux treatment in high wave-age regimes.</description>

      <title>Measured multiple flow states in turbulent thermal convection with aspect ratio 10</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report an experimental investigation of turbulent Rayleigh-Benard convection in a rectangular cell of large aspect ratio ($\Gamma = 10$) over the Rayleigh number range $5.4\times10^7 \le Ra \le 7.2\times10^9$ and Prandtl number range $4.3 \le Pr \le 67.3$. Planar particle image velocimetry measurements show that the flow self organises into several horizontally stacked convection rolls, and repeated experiments under identical parameters (both $Ra$ and $Pr$) reveal that the number of rolls varies within the range of 3 to 7 with 6 being the most probable, which demonstrates the presence of multiple flow states. When $Pr$ is increased to 67.3, the number of roll like structures increases significantly, indicating a structural transition from a roll dominated to a plume dominated flow. This transition is reflected in the global momentum transport, for $Pr \leq 18.3$ the Reynolds number scales as $Re \sim Ra^{0.58}Pr^{-0.97}$, whereas the scaling is changed to $Re \sim Ra^{0.72}$ when $Pr$ reaches 67.3. Within individual rolls, we further examine the Reynolds numbers based on horizontal and vertical velocity components, $Re_{u,\text{roll}}$ and $Re_{w,\text{roll}}$, and find that the former increases while the latter decreases with roll size (quantified as the aspect ratio of the roll $\Gamma_\text{roll}$) due to continuity constraints, with their ratio following $Re_{w,\text{roll}}/Re_{u,\text{roll}} \sim \Gamma_\text{roll}^{-0.61}$. We impose different initial flow conditions (roll structures) with controlled perturbations, and demonstrate that the initial condition can influence the final turbulent state. We show that the number of horizontally stacked rolls regulates the global transport, larger number of rolls induces greater vertical momentum and heat transfer.</description>

      <title>Vortex breakdown in a hydro turbine draft tube swirling jet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18278v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The swirling flow in a Francis type hydropower turbine is known to be susceptible to the formation of a large helical structure, commonly referred to as a vortex rope. This vortex rope can be interpreted as an unstable mode associated with vortex breakdown. This perspective is adopted here in a simplified laminar flow setting. The helical vortex rope mode is shown to bifurcate supercritically from an axisymmetric baseflow in a Hopf bifurcation within a turbine draft tube. When wall friction effects are neglected, a large recirculation region at the axis can form and a range of subcritical solutions is identified for a flow regime corresponding to partial load of the turbine. The existence of these subcritical solutions promotes the emergence of a hysteresis loop. We further describe a regular dynamics of a formation of recirculation bubble at the axis and its destruction due to the emergence of a helical vortex rope at its periphery. Increasing the axial flow discharge towards the regime corresponding to nominal turbine load leads to an unfolding of the steady solutions branch in a transcritical bifurcation. This bifurcation takes place at finite Reynolds number and complements existing evidence of transcritical bifurcation of the swirling jet flows, previously reported only in the inviscid limit.</description>

      <title>Solutocapillary bubble centering in a confined ethanol plume in water</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the radial centering of gas bubbles within a buoyant plume of ethanol injected into a co-flowing water sheath flow in a vertical capillary. Bubbles nucleate in the ethanol stream due to CO$_2$ supersaturation and rapidly migrate toward the plume axis via solutocapillary (Marangoni) forces driven by interfacial tension gradients in the ethanol-water mixture. Experiments reveal that bubbles of varying sizes reliably align along the plume centerline, facilitated by steep radial concentration gradients near the plume boundary. A reduced-order model supports robust centering across a wide range of bubble radii. For larger bubbles, axial Marangoni effects modulate ascent velocities and can even induce upstream migration under transient conditions, highlighting the complex feedback between bubble dynamics and plume distortion. The results demonstrate that solutocapillary migration provides a reliable mechanism for contact-free bubble focusing, with implications for bubble manipulation in microfluidics, reactors, and phase-separation processes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.18136v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fluids composed of chiral active components can exhibit odd viscosity, a property that breaks time-reversal and parity symmetries. We investigate the hydrodynamic response to monopole and dipole singularities in a compressible thin fluid layer with odd viscosity, supported by a conventional lubrication layer. Using the two-dimensional Green's function in Fourier space, we derive exact analytical solutions for the flow and pressure fields. These solutions provide a detailed description of the hydrodynamic interactions governing the motion of colloidal particles and microswimmers in confined chiral fluids, offering insight into the role of odd viscosity in modifying particle dynamics and collective behavior. The derived results are directly applicable to modeling transport, control, and self-organization phenomena in active and chiral microfluidic systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.18220v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a space-dependent eddy thermal diffusivity model for turbulent vertical natural convection in a fluid between two infinite vertical walls at different temperatures. Using this model, we derive analytical results for the mean temperature profile. Our results reveal that mean temperature profiles for different Rayleigh and Prandtl numbers are described by two universal scaling functions in the inner region next to the walls and the outer region near the centerline between the two walls and the characteristic temperature scales in the inner and outer regions are expressed in terms of the two parameters of the model which determine the characteristic velocities for heat transfer in the two regions. We show that these results are in good agreement with direct numerical simulation data.</description>

      <title>Physics-informed graph neural networks for flow field estimation in carotid arteries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07110v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hemodynamic quantities are valuable biomedical risk factors for cardiovascular pathology such as atherosclerosis. Non-invasive, in-vivo measurement of these quantities can only be performed using a select number of modalities that are not widely available, such as 4D flow magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). In this work, we create a surrogate model for hemodynamic flow field estimation, powered by machine learning. We train graph neural networks that include priors about the underlying symmetries and physics, limiting the amount of data required for training. This allows us to train the model using moderately-sized, in-vivo 4D flow MRI datasets, instead of large in-silico datasets obtained by computational fluid dynamics (CFD), as is the current standard. We create an efficient, equivariant neural network by combining the popular PointNet++ architecture with group-steerable layers. To incorporate the physics-informed priors, we derive an efficient discretisation scheme for the involved differential operators. We perform extensive experiments in carotid arteries and show that our model can accurately estimate low-noise hemodynamic flow fields in the carotid artery. Moreover, we show how the learned relation between geometry and hemodynamic quantities transfers to 3D vascular models obtained using a different imaging modality than the training data. This shows that physics-informed graph neural networks can be trained using 4D flow MRI data to estimate blood flow in unseen carotid artery geometries.</description>
