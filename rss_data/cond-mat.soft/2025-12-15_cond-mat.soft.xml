      <title>Curved Odd Elasticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Living materials such as membranes, cytoskeletal assemblies, cell collectives and tissues can often be described as active solids -- materials that are energized from within, with elastic response about a well defined reference configuration. These materials often live in complex and curved manifolds, yet most descriptions of active solids are flat. Here, we explore the interplay between curvature and non-reciprocal elasticity via a covariant effective theory on curved manifolds in combination with numerical simulations. We find that curvature spatially patterns activity, gaps the spectrum, modifies exceptional points and introduces non-Hermitian defect modes. Together these results establish a foundation for hydrodynamic and rheological models on curved manifolds, with direct implications for living matter and active metamaterials.</description>

      <title>Heterogeneity-Induced Oscillations in Active Nematics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the defining features of active nematics is that above a critical activity the quiescent state becomes unstable to a distorted, flowing one. We show that spatial variations in activity can fundamentally change the nature of this instability, affecting the symmetry of the unstable mode and producing spontaneous oscillations. We analytically identify a dynamical system for the evolution of the odd and even director modes, with the leading-order coefficients dependent on the activity profile, allowing a quantitative connection between the spatially-heterogeneous activity and dynamics, which we verify numerically. In the context of constant gradients in activity, we determine a phase diagram for the active response and highlight how variation of the activity profile causes the oscillations to vary from almost harmonic to relaxational. Our results indicate a novel route to spatio-temporal structure in active nematics and suggest experiments on controllable light-activated systems.</description>

      <title>Shear-induced pressure anisotropy in granular materials of nonspherical particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When a granular material composed of elongated grains is sheared in a split-bottom shear cell, a pressure difference develops within the material. This pressure difference depends on the interparticle friction ($\mu$), which affects shear localization and particle alignment. For large $\mu$, alignment is confined to a narrow shear band, leading to localized increases in packing density and pressure. For small $\mu$, particles align over a wider region, leading to a nearly uniform packing density and pressure throughout the material. In contrast, spherical particles, regardless of $\mu$, maintain a uniform packing density and pressure throughout the material. We observe a phenomenological similarity to the Weissenberg effect in non-Newtonian fluids, where normal stress differences induce radial pressure gradients, unlike the uniform pressure in Newtonian fluids.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamic permeability of fluctuating porous membranes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we examine how porosity fluctuations affect the hydrodynamic permeability of a porous matrix or membrane. We introduce a fluctuating Darcy model, which couples the Navier-Stokes equation to the space- and time-dependent porosity fluctuations via a Darcy friction term. Using a perturbative approach, a Dyson equation for hydrodynamic fluctuations is derived and solved to express the permeability in terms of the matrix fluctuation spectrum. Surprisingly, the model reveals strong modifications of the fluid permeability in fluctuating matrices compared to static ones. Applications to various matrix excitation models - breathing matrix, phonons, active forcing - highlight the significant influence of matrix fluctuations on fluid transport, offering insights for optimizing membrane design for separation applications.</description>

      <title>Heat capacity of dense liquids: A link between two-phase model and melting temperature scaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11520v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generalized Rosenfeld-Tarazona scaling predicts the power-law dependence of the excess heat capacity of simple liquids on temperature. The two-phase model treats a liquid as a superposition of gas- and solid-like components whose relative abundance is quantified by a liquid rigidity parameter. We demonstrate here that the generalized Rosenfeld-Tarazona scaling emerges naturally in the two-phase model from the scale invariance of the liquid rigidity parameter.</description>

      <title>Elastocapillary adhesion of soft gel microspheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Softer means stickier for solid adhesives, because material compliance facilitates close contact between non-conformal surfaces. Recent discoveries have revealed that soft materials can exhibit a rich array of new physics arising from competing effects of continuum elasticity, fluid-like surface mechanics, and internal poroelastic flows, all of which can directly impact interfacial interactions. In this work, we investigate this complex interplay across several orders of magnitude of elastic stiffness by measuring the complete adhesive contact geometry between compliant silicone gel microspheres and flat, rigid substrates. We observe a continuous elastocapillary transition in adhesion mechanics, with novel features revealed by both the breadth of data and the detailed contact geometries. Importantly, soft gel spheres exhibit a remarkably broad range of near-equilibrium contact morphologies and their contact line deformation is always mediated by a fluid contact zone that phase separates from the gel. To explain this, we develop a new model incorporating elastocapillary and poroelastic mechanics that predicts the complete range of adhesive behavior and elucidates energetic tradeoffs. The data and model together reveal a shallow energy landscape that may contribute to the robustness of everyday adhesives.</description>

      <title>Corkscrew motion of Trypanosome brucei is driven by helical beating of the flagellum and facilitated by its bent shape</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10021v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the pathogenic parasite Trypanosoma brucei, a laterally attached flagellum drives rapid deformation of the complex cell body, producing puzzling dynamics. High-speed defocusing imaging reveals that surface points trace flower-like patterns in transverse planes. The petals arise from clockwise flagellar beating, which generates a right-handed helical wave propagating from the anterior tip along the body, advancing the cell like a twisted corkscrew. The central lobes result from slower counterclockwise body rotation required to balance the active torque. The bent cell shape underneath the flagellum superimposes these two chiral motions at different radial distances, producing the observed patterns. Three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations using the method of regularized Stokeslets reproduce these dynamics and show that bent cell shape enhances swimming, suggesting an adaptive advantage of T. brucei's morphology.</description>

      <title>A review on combinatorial approach to aggregation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11459v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, a combinatorial approach to discrete, finite, and irreversibly aggregating systems has been progressively developed. In this work, we review its achievements up to the present moment, focusing on the practical aspects and discussing its limitations. First, we present the assumptions and combinatorial foundations of the approach, which are based on direct counting of the system states, in contrast to the previous approaches of Smoluchowski and Marcus--Lushnikov. A method to obtain combinatorial expressions for the average number of clusters of a given size and the corresponding standard deviation is described by solving the simplest example of a constant kernel. Then, we extend consideration to a number of kernels (e.g., additive, product, linear--chain, condensation), which were recently solved by explicitly finding the number of internal states of the cluster of a given size. Next, we show that theoretical predictions for any given kernel may be obtained with no need to find an explicit solution but using a recursive expression. We exploit this opportunity to present the use of combinatorial expressions to solve kernels related to the real processes of aerosol growth and planetesimal formation. At this point, a comparison to numerical results appears. Other potential application fields are indicated, including dust agglomeration and polymer growth. Finally, issues related to the varying precision of the theoretical predictions are summarized. In the last section, we propose open problems.</description>

      <title>Capillary Filling Dynamics in Polygonal Tubes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11553v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of capillary filling in tubes of regular polygon cross-section. Using Onsager variational principle, we derive a coupled ordinary differential equation and partial differential equation, which respectively describe time evolution of the bulk flow and the saturation profile of the finger flow. We obtain both numerical solution and self-similar solution to the coupled equations, and the results indicate that the bulk flow and the finger flow both follow the $t^{1/2}$ time-scaling. We show that due to the coupling effect of the finger flow, the prefactor for the bulk flow is smaller than that of the Lucas-Washburn prediction. The reduction effect is more pronounced when the side number $n$ of the regular-polygon is small, while as $n$ increases, the prefactor approaches Lucas-Washburn prediction.</description>

      <title>Recovering long-range cumulative response to geometric frustration in quasi-1d systems, mediated by constitutive softness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11562v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cumulative geometric frustration can drive self-limited assembly and morphology selection through size-dependent energetic costs. However, the slenderness of quasi-one-dimensional systems generally suppresses the formation of long-range longitudinal gradients. We show that the suppression of longitudinal gradients can be overcome by tuning the ratio between the longitudinal and transverse (shear) moduli. We demonstrate the recovery of cumulative frustration across distinct quasi-one-dimensional systems, each frustrated through a different mechanism, by the introduction of a soft response mode.</description>

      <title>A Single-granule Stirling Heat Engine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11591v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Single-particle heat engines at atomic and colloidal scales obey the universal thermodynamic bounds on work and efficiency. Here, we translate these principles to the macroscale by building an athermal Stirling engine whose working medium is a millimeter-sized, vibrofluidized granule confined in a time-dependent magnetic trap. By embedding a rattler within the granule to inject noise, we engineer overdamped, Brownian-like dynamics in an otherwise inertial particle. This design enables independent control over the granule's effective temperature and spatial confinement. Our engine quantitatively reproduces the universal power-efficiency trade-offs of finite-time thermodynamics, achieving the Curzon-Ahlborn efficiency at maximum power. Strikingly, we uncover a control parameter-dependent damping that leads to an unexpected dissipation mechanism - the losses in the compression stroke rival or even exceed those during expansion. Our work establishes an accessible experimental platform to study small-system thermodynamics in intrinsically athermal systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.07844v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The elastic response of mechanical, chemical, and biological systems is often modeled using a discrete arrangement of Hookean springs, either representing finite material elements or even the molecular bonds of a system. However, to date, there is no direct derivation of the relation between a general discrete spring network\blu{, with arbitrary geometry,} and it's corresponding elastic continuum. Furthermore, understanding the network's mechanical response requires simulations that may be expensive computationally. Here we report a method to derive the exact elastic continuum model of any discrete network of springs, requiring network geometry and topology only. We identify and calculate the so-called "non-affine" displacements. Explicit comparison of our calculations to simulations of different crystalline and disordered configurations, shows we successfully capture the mechanics even of auxetic materials. Our method is valid for residually stressed systems with non-trivial geometries, and is an essential step in generalizing active stresses on such discrete systems. It is easily generalizable to other discrete models, and opens the possibility of a rational design of elastic systems.</description>

      <title>Expanding the reach of diffusing wave spectroscopy and tracer bead microrheology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14973v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Diffusing Wave Spectroscopy (DWS) is an extension of standard dynamic light scattering (DLS), applied to soft materials that are turbid or opaque. The propagation of light is modeled using light diffusion, characterized by a light diffusion coefficient that depends on the transport mean free path l* of the medium. DWS is highly sensitive to small particle displacements or other local fluctuations in the scattering properties and can probe sub-nanometer displacements. Analyzing the motion of beads in a viscoelastic matrix, known as one-bead microrheology, is one of the most common applications of DWS. Despite significant advancements since its invention in the late 1980s, including two-cell and multispeckle DWS, challenges such as merging single- and multispeckle data and limited accuracy for short correlation times persist. Here, we address these issues by improving the two-cell echo DWS scheme. We propose a calibration-free method to blend and merge echo and two-cell DWS data and demonstrate the use of an exponential basis fit to enhance data quality, in particular at very short times. Building on this, we introduce stable corrections for bead and fluid inertia, significantly improving the quality of microrheology data at high frequencies.</description>

      <title>Instability and stress fluctuations of a probe driven through a worm-like micellar fluid</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.13080v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A particle moving through a worm-like micellar fluid (WLM) shows instability and large fluctuations beyond a threshold \textcolor{black}{velocity/force (depending on the control parameter used)}. Despite many detailed studies, a direct measurement of the time-dependent stress on the probe particle remains unexplored. To address this, we have designed a measuring geometry coupled with a commercial rheometer to study the dynamics of a cylindrical probe through a WLM system of 2 wt.\% cetyltrimethyl ammonium tosylate(CTAT) + 100 mM sodium chloride(NaCl) for a wide range of velocity and stress scales. We map out the in-situ velocity distribution using particle imaging velocimetry. Beyond a velocity threshold, we observe large stress fluctuation with gradual stress build-up followed by sudden stress drop indicating storage and release of elastic energy. The length scale constructed from the stress build-up time scale and the probe's velocity match the length scale of extensile deformation just before the stress drop, confirming the strong correlation of storage and release of energy with the unstable probe motion. Interestingly, the Weissenberg number ($Wi$) for the onset of flow instability obtained from the shear and extensile components remains almost the same. We also find that the turbulent motion of the probe at higher $Wi$ results from the complex mixing of the stick-slip events originating from the partial release of the stored elastic energy. Further, we show that the magnitude of the stick-slip events depends on the detailed micellar structure and dynamics controlled by salt concentration and temperature.</description>

      <title>Reentrant Rigidity Transition in Planar Epithelia with Volume- and Area Elasticity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.12558v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We find a reentrant columnar-to-squamous rigidity transition in 3D epithelia, governed by volume- and area elasticity. Our framework maps onto the classic 2D Area- and Perimeter-Elasticity model but, unlike its 2D counterpart, exhibits both softening and stiffening depending on the initial state. The phase diagram reveals floppy states with vanishing shear and in-plane bulk moduli, alongside a lateral-tension-driven discontinuous columnar-to-squamous transition. The critical behavior underlying the emergence of the reentrant transition belongs to the mean-field universality class.</description>

      <title>Generalized non-reciprocal phase transitions in multipopulation systems</title>

Abstract: Non-reciprocal interactions are prevalent in various complex systems leading to phenomena that cannot be described by traditional equilibrium statistical physics. Although non-reciprocally interacting systems composed of two populations have been closely studied, the physics of non-reciprocal systems with a general number of populations is not well explored despite the relevance to biological systems, active matter, and driven-dissipative quantum materials. In this work, we investigate the generic features of the phases and phase transitions and emerge in $O(2)$ symmetric many-body systems with multiple non-reciprocally coupled populations, applicable to microscopic models such as networks of oscillators, flocking models, and more generally systems where each agent has a phase variable. Using symmetry and topology of the possible orbits, we systematically show that a rich variety of time-dependent phases and phase transitions arise. Examples include multipopulation chiral phases that are distinct from their two-population counterparts that emerge via a phase transition characterized by critical exceptional points, as well as limit cycle saddle-node bifurcation and Hopf bifurcation. Interestingly, we find a phase transition that dynamically restores the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry occurs via a homoclinic orbit bifurcation, where the two $\mathbb{Z}_2$ broken orbits merge at the phase transition point, providing a general route to homoclinic chaos in the order parameter dynamics for $N\geq4$ populations. Our framework provides general principles for understanding non-equilibrium heterogeneous systems and guides experimental exploration into such systems.</description>

      <title>Many interacting particles in solution. I. Screening-ranged expansions of electrostatic potential and energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08407v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an analytical many-body formalism for systems of spherical particles carrying arbitrary free charge distributions and interacting in a polarizable electrolyte solution, that we model within the linearized Poisson--Boltzmann framework. Building on the detailed spectral analysis of the associated nonstandard Neumann--Poincar\'e-type operators developed in our companion study arXiv:2512.08684, we construct exact explicit expansions of the electrostatic potential and energy in ascending orders of Debye screening thereby obtaining systematic "screening-ranged" series for potentials and energies. These screening-ranged expansions provide a unified and tractable description of many-body electrostatics. We demonstrate the versatility of the approach by showing how it generalizes and improves upon both classical and modern methods, enabling rigorous treatment of heterogeneously charged systems (such as Janus particles) and accurate modeling of higher-order phenomena (such as asymmetric dielectric screening, opposite-charge repulsion, like-charge attraction) as well as yielding many-body generalizations to analytical explicit results previously known only in the two-body setting.</description>

      <title>Universal scaling in one-dimensional non-reciprocal matter</title>

Abstract: Unveiling universal non-equilibrium scaling laws has been a central theme in modern statistical physics, with recent attention increasingly directed toward non-equilibrium phases that exhibit rich dynamical phenomena. A striking example arises in non-reciprocal systems, where asymmetric interactions between components lead to inherently dynamic phases and unconventional criticality near a critical exceptional point (CEP), where the criticality arises from the coalescence of collective modes with an existing Nambu-Goldstone mode. However, the universal scaling behavior that emerges in this system with full consideration of many-body effects and stochastic noise remains largely elusive. Here, we establish a dynamical scaling law in a generic one-dimensional (1D) stochastic non-reciprocal $O(2)$-symmetric system. Through large-scale simulations, we uncover a new non-equilibrium scaling in the vicinity of the CEP, distinct from any previously known equilibrium or non-equilibrium universality classes. We report an anomalously large roughening exponent $\alpha_{\rm CEP}=1.35(5)$, which is to be compared with those of simple diffusion $\alpha_{\rm EW}=0.5$. In regimes where the system breaks into domains with opposite chirality and spatiotemporal vortices inevitably emerge, we find that fluctuations are strongly suppressed, leading to a logarithmic scaling as a function of system size $L$ that manifests a short-range correlation. This work elucidates the beyond-mean-field dynamics of non-reciprocal matter, thereby shedding light on the exploration of criticality in non-reciprocal phase transition across diverse physical contexts, from active matter and driven quantum systems to biological pattern formation and non-Hermitian physics.</description>

      <title>Phonon-confinement theory of thermal conductivity in ultrathin silicon films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11914v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The thermal properties of solids under nanoscale confinement are currently not understood at the atomic level. Recent numerical studies have highlighted the presence of a minimum in the thermal conductivity as a function of thickness for ultrathin films at a thickness about 1-2 nm, which cannot be described by existing theories. We develop a theoretical description of thin films which predicts a new physical law for heat transfer at the nanoscale. In particular, due to the strong redistribution of phonon momentum states in reciprocal space (with a transition from a spherical Debye surface to a different homotopy group $\mathbb{Z}$ at strong confinement), the low-energy phonon density of states no longer follows Debye's law but rather a cubic law with frequency, which then crosses over to Debye's law at a crossover frequency proportional to the average speed of sound of the material and inversely proportional to the film thickness. Concomitantly, this implies that the phonon population becomes dominated by low-energy phonons as confinement increases, which then leads to a higher thermal conductivity under extreme confinement. The theory is able to reproduce the thermal conductivity minimum in recent molecular simulations data for ultrathin silicon and provides useful guidelines so as to tune the minimum position based on the mechanical properties of the material.</description>
