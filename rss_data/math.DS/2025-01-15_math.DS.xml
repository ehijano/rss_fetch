      <description>arXiv:2501.07950v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A diffeomorphism f has a heterodimensional cycle if it displays two (transitive) hyperbolic sets K and K' with different indices such that the unstable set of K intersects the stable one of K' and vice versa. We prove that it is possible to find robust heterodimensional cycles for families of polynomial automorphisms of C^3 . The proof is based on Bonatti-D{\'i}az blenders.</description>

      <title>Global stability of perturbed chemostat systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to the analysis of global stability of the chemostat system with a perturbation term representing any type of exchange between species. This conversion term depends on species and substrate concentrations but also on a positive perturbation parameter. After having written the invariant manifold as a union of a family of compact subsets, our main result states that for each subset in this family, there is a positive threshold for the perturbation parameter below which, the system is globally asymptotically stable in the corresponding subset. Our approach relies on the Malkin-Gorshin Theorem and on a Theorem by Smith and Waltman about perturbations of a globally stable steady state. Properties of steady-states and numerical simulations of the system's asymptotic behavior complete this study for two types of perturbation term between species.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.08069v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the connections between independence, sequence entropy, and sensitivity for a measure preserving system under the action of a countable infinite discrete group. We establish that every measure theoretic sequence entropy tuple for an ergodic measure is an IT tuple. Furthermore, if the acting group is amenable, we show that for an ergodic measure, the sequence entropy tuples, the mean sensitive tuples along some tempered F{\o}lner sequence, and the sensitive in the mean tuples along some tempered F{\o}lner sequence coincide.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.08116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a complete characterization of two different non-integers with the same R\'{e}nyi-Parry measure. We prove that for two non-integers $\beta_1 ,\beta_2 &gt;1$, the R\'{e}nyi-Parry measures coincide if and only if $\beta_1$ is the root of equation $x^2-qx-p=0$, where $p,q\in\mathbb{N}$ with $p\leq q$, and $\beta_2 = \beta_1 + 1$, which confirms a conjecture of Bertrand-Mathis in \cite[Section III]{Bertrand-1998}.</description>

      <title>Data-driven system identification using quadratic embeddings of nonlinear dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08202v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel data-driven method called QENDy (Quadratic Embedding of Nonlinear Dynamics) that not only allows us to learn quadratic representations of highly nonlinear dynamical systems, but also to identify the governing equations. The approach is based on an embedding of the system into a higher-dimensional feature space in which the dynamics become quadratic. Just like SINDy (Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics), our method requires trajectory data, time derivatives for the training data points, which can also be estimated using finite difference approximations, and a set of preselected basis functions, called dictionary. We illustrate the efficacy and accuracy of QENDy with the aid of various benchmark problems and compare its performance with SINDy and a deep learning method for identifying quadratic embeddings. Furthermore, we analyze the convergence of QENDy and SINDy in the infinite data limit, highlight their similarities and main differences, and compare the quadratic embedding with linearization techniques based on the Koopman operator.</description>

      <title>Variations on hypergeometric functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08310v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove new integral formulas for generalized hypergeometric functions and their confuent variants. We apply them, via stationary phase formula, to study WKB expansions of solutions: for large argument in the confuent case and for large parameter in the general case. We also study variations of hypergeometric functions for small perturbations of hypergeometric equations, i.e., in expansions of solutions in powers of a small parameter. Next, we present a new proof of a theorem due to Wasow about equivalence of the Airy equation with its perturbation; in particular, we explain that this result does not deal with the WKB solutions and the Stokes phenomenon. Finally, we study hypergeometric equations, one of second order and another of third order, which are related with two generating functions for MZVs, one $\Delta_2 (\lambda )$ for $\zeta(2, \ldots , 2)$'s and another $\Delta_3 (\lambda )$ for $\zeta(3, \ldots , 3)$'s; in particular, we correct a statement from [ZZ3] that the function $\Delta_3(\lambda)$ admits a regular WKB expansion.</description>

      <title>Multiple Local and Global Bifurcations and Their Role in Quorum Sensing Dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02764v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quorum sensing governs bacterial communication, playing a crucial role in regulating population behaviour. We propose a mathematical model that uncovers chaotic dynamics within quorum sensing networks, highlighting challenges to predictability. The model explores interactions between autoinducers and two bacterial subtypes, revealing oscillatory dynamics in both a constant autoinducer sub-model and the full three-component model. In the latter case, we find that the complicated dynamics can be explained by the presence of homoclinic Shilnikov bifurcations. We employed a combination of normal form analysis and numerical continuation methods to analyse the system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.02615v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The idea of a parsing of a stationary process according to a collection of words is introduced, and the basic framework required for the asymptotic analysis of these parsings is presented. We demonstrate how the pointwise ergodic theorem and the Shannon-McMillan-Breiman theorem can be deduced from their respective weaker convergence in probability versions combined with our observations regarding parsings, where the parsings are done according to collections that originate in stopping times tailored for that purpose.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.06380v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this note, we investigate the coboundaries of interval exchange transformations of 3 intervals (3-IETs). More precisely, we show that a differentiable function with absolutely continuous derivative with bounded variation, whose integral and integral of its derivative is 0, is a coboundary for typical 3-IET if and only if the values at the endpoints of the domain are zero. This contrasts with 2-IETs, i.e., rotations, because every continuous function is a coboundary for every rotation. We also show the existence of rare counterexamples for both cases of possible values at the endpoints of the interval. We obtain our result by studying the properties of associated skew products.</description>

      <title>On structural contraction of biological interaction networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.13678v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Biological networks are customarily described as structurally robust. This means that they often function extremely well under large forms of perturbations affecting both the concentrations and the kinetic parameters. In order to explain this property, various mathematical notions have been proposed in the literature. In this paper, we propose the notion of structural contractivity, building on the previous work of the authors. That previous work characterized the long-term dynamics of classes of Biological Interaction Networks (BINs), based on "rate-dependent Lyapunov functions". Here, we show that stronger notions of convergence can be established by proving structural contractivity with respect to non-standard polyhedral $\ell_\infty$-norms. In particular, we show that such networks are nonexpansive. With additional verifiable conditions, we show that they are strictly contractive over arbitrary positive compact sets. In addition, we show that such networks entrain to periodic inputs. We illustrate our theory with examples drawn from the modeling of intracellular signaling pathways.</description>

      <title>Invariance Proximity: Closed-Form Error Bounds for Finite-Dimensional Koopman-Based Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.13033v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A popular way to approximate the Koopman operator's action on a finite-dimensional subspace of functions is via orthogonal projections. The quality of the projected model directly depends on the selected subspace, specifically on how close it is to being invariant under the Koopman operator. The notion of invariance proximity provides a tight upper bound on the worst-case relative prediction error of the finite-dimensional model. However, its direct calculation is computationally challenging. This paper leverages the geometric structure behind the definition of invariance proximity to provide a closed-form expression in terms of Jordan principal angles on general inner product spaces. Unveiling this connection allows us to exploit specific isomorphisms to circumvent the computational challenges associated with spaces of functions and enables the use of existing efficient numerical routines to compute invariance proximity.</description>

      <title>Explicit dynamical properties of the Pelikan random map in the chaotic region and at the intermittent critical point towards the non-chaotic region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19999v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Pelikan random trajectories $x_t \in [0,1[$ are generated by choosing the chaotic doubling map $x_{t+1}=2 x_t [mod 1]$ with probability $p$ and the non-chaotic half-contracting map $x_{t+1}=\frac{x_t}{2}$ with probability $(1-p)$. We compute various dynamical observables as a function of the parameter $p$ via two perspectives. In the first perspective, we focus on the closed dynamics within the subspace of probability densities that remain constant on the binary-intervals $x \in [ 2^{-n-1}, 2^{-n}[$ partitioning the interval $x \in [0,1[$ : the dynamics for the weights $\pi_t(n)$ of these intervals corresponds to a biased random walk on the half-infinite lattice $n \in \{0,1,2,..+\infty\}$ with resetting occurring with probability $p$ from the origin $n=0$ towards any site $n$ drawn with the distribution $2^{-n-1}$. In the second perspective, we study the Pelikan dynamics for any initial condition $x_0$ via the binary decomposition $x_t = \sum_{l=1}^{+\infty} \frac{\sigma_l (t)}{2^l} $, where the dynamics for the half-infinite lattice $l=1,2,..$ of the binary variables $\sigma_l(t) \in \{0,1\}$ can be reformulated in terms of two global variables : $z_t$ corresponds to a biased random walk on the half-infinite lattice $z \in \{0,1,2,..+\infty\}$ that may remain at the origin $z=0$ with probability $p$, while $F_t \in \{0,1,2,..t\}$ counts the number of time-steps $\tau \in [0,t-1]$ where $z_{\tau+1}=0=z_{\tau}$ and represents the number of the binary coefficients of the initial condition that have been erased. We discuss typical and large deviations properties in the chaotic region $\frac{1}{2}&lt;p&lt;1 $ as well as at the intermittent critical point $p_c=\frac{1}{2}$ towards the non-chaotic region $0&lt;p&lt;\frac{1}{2}$.</description>

      <title>Relative differential closure in Hardy fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.10764v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study relative differential closure in the context of Hardy fields. Using our earlier work on algebraic differential equations over Hardy fields, this leads to a proof of a conjecture of Boshernitzan (1981): the intersection of all maximal analytic Hardy fields agrees with that of all maximal Hardy fields. We also generalize a key ingredient in the proof, and describe a cautionary example delineating the boundaries of its applicability.</description>
