      <title>Symmetric Rule-Based Achlioptas Processes for Random $k$-SAT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07870v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inspired by the "power-of-two-choices" model from random graphs, we investigate the possibility of limited choices of online clause choices that could shift the satisfiability threshold in random $k$-SAT.Here, we introduce an assignment symmetric, non-adaptive, topology-oblivious online rule called \emph{MIDDLE-HEAVY}, that prioritizes balanced sign profile clauses.Upon applying a biased $2$-SAT projection and a two-type branching process certificate, we derive closed-form expressions for the shifted thresholds $\alpha_{\textbf{SYM}}(k,\ell)$ for this algorithm.We show that minimal choices $\ell=5$ for $k=4$, $\ell=4$ for $k=5$, and $\ell=3$ for $k\ge 6$ suffice to exceed the asymptotic first-moment upper bound $\sim 2^k \ln 2$ for random $k$-SAT.Moreover, to bridge the gap with biased assignment rules used in maximum of the previous works in this context, we propose a hybrid symmetric biased rule that achieves thresholds comparable to prior work while maintaining symmetry.Our results advance the understanding of Achlioptas processes in random CSPs beyond classical graph-theoretic settings.</description>

      <title>A Graph Width Perspective on Partially Ordered Hamiltonian Paths and Cycles II: Vertex and Edge Deletion Numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of finding a Hamiltonian path or cycle with precedence constraints in the form of a partial order on the vertex set. We study the complexity for graph width parameters for which the ordinary problems $\mathsf{Hamiltonian\ Path}$ and $\mathsf{Hamiltonian\ Cycle}$ are in $\mathsf{FPT}$. In particular, we focus on parameters that describe how many vertices and edges have to be deleted to become a member of a certain graph class. We show that the problems are $\mathsf{W[1]}$-hard for such restricted cases as vertex distance to path and vertex distance to clique. We complement these results by showing that the problems can be solved in $\mathsf{XP}$ time for vertex distance to outerplanar and vertex distance to block. Furthermore, we present some $\mathsf{FPT}$ algorithms, e.g., for edge distance to block. Additionally, we prove para-$\mathsf{NP}$-hardness when considered with the edge clique cover number.</description>

      <title>Finite Simple Groups in the Primitive Positive Constructability Poset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06487v3 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that any clone over a finite domain that has a quasi Maltsev operation and fully symmetric operations of all arities has an incoming minion homomorphism from I, the clone of all idempotent operations on a two element set. We use this result to show that in the pp-constructability poset the lower covers of the structure with all relations that are invariant under I are the transitive tournament on three vertices and structures in one-to-one correspondence with all finite simple groups.</description>

      <title>Isolation of non-triangle cycles in graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08361v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a set $\mathcal{F}$ of graphs, we call a copy of a graph in $\mathcal{F}$ an $\mathcal{F}$-graph. The $\mathcal{F}$-isolation number of a graph $G$, denoted by $\iota(G, \mathcal{F})$, is the size of a smallest set $D$ of vertices of $G$ such that the closed neighbourhood of $D$ intersects the vertex sets of the $\mathcal{F}$-graphs contained by $G$ (equivalently, $G-N[D]$ contains no $\mathcal{F}$-graph). Let $\mathcal{C}$ be the set of cycles, and let $\mathcal{C}'$ be the set of non-triangle cycles (that is, cycles of length at least $4$). Let $G$ be a connected graph having exactly $n$ vertices and $m$ edges. The first author proved that $\iota(G,\mathcal{C}) \leq n/4$ if $G$ is not a triangle. Bartolo and the authors proved that $\iota(G,\{C_4\}) \leq n/5$ if $G$ is not a copy of one of nine graphs. Various authors proved that $\iota(G,\mathcal{C}) \leq (m+1)/5$ if $G$ is not a triangle. We prove that $\iota(G,\mathcal{C}') \leq (m+1)/6$ if $G$ is not a $4$-cycle. Zhang and Wu established this for the case where $G$ is triangle-free. Our result yields the inequality $\iota(G,\{C_4\}) \leq (m+1)/6$ of Wei, Zhang and Zhao. These bounds are attained by infinitely many (non-isomorphic) graphs. The proof of our inequality hinges on also determining the graphs attaining the bound.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian dynamics of Boolean networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03175v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article examines the impact of Hamiltonian dynamics on the interaction graph of Boolean networks. Three types of dynamics are considered: maximum height, Hamiltonian cycle, and an intermediate dynamic between these two. The study addresses how these dynamics influence the connectivity of the graph and the existence of variables that depend on all other variables in the system. Additionally, a family of unate Boolean networks capable of describing these three Hamiltonian behaviors is introduced, highlighting their specific properties and limitations. The results provide theoretical tools for modeling complex systems and contribute to the understanding of dynamic interactions in Boolean networks.</description>

      <title>Complexity and algorithms for matching cut problems in graphs without long induced paths and cycles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.05402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.05402v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a graph, a (perfect) matching cut is an edge cut that is a (perfect) matching. Matching Cut (MC), respectively, Perfect Matching Cut (PMC), is the problem of deciding whether a given graph has a matching cut, respectively, a perfect matching cut. The Disconnected Perfect Matching problem (DPM) is to decide if a graph has a perfect matching that contains a matching cut. Solving an open problem posed in [Lucke, Paulusma, Ries (ISAAC 2022, Algorithmica 2023)], we show that PMC is NP-complete in graphs without induced 14-vertex path $P_{14}$. Our reduction also works simultaneously for MC and DPM, improving the previous hardness results of MC on $P_{15}$-free graphs and of DPM on $P_{19}$-free graphs to $P_{14}$-free graphs for both problems. Actually, we prove a slightly stronger result: within $P_{14}$-free 8-chordal graphs (graphs without chordless cycles of length at least 9), it is hard to distinguish between those without matching cuts (respectively, perfect matching cuts, disconnected perfect matchings) and those in which every matching cut is a perfect matching cut. Moreover, assuming the Exponential Time Hypothesis, none of these problems can be solved in $2^{o(n)}$ time for $n$-vertex $P_{14}$-free 8-chordal graphs.
  On the positive side, we show that, as for MC [Moshi (JGT 1989)], DPM and PMC are polynomially solvable when restricted to 4-chordal graphs. Together with the negative results, this partly answers an open question on the complexity of PMC in $k$-chordal graphs asked in [Le, Telle (WG 2021, TCS 2022) &amp; Lucke, Paulusma, Ries (MFCS 2023, TCS 2024)].</description>

      <title>Graph-SCP: Accelerating Set Cover Problems with Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.07979v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine learning (ML) approaches are increasingly being used to accelerate combinatorial optimization (CO) problems. We investigate the Set Cover Problem (SCP) and propose Graph-SCP, a graph neural network method that augments existing optimization solvers by learning to identify a smaller sub-problem that contains the solution space. Graph-SCP uses both supervised learning from prior solved instances and unsupervised learning to minimize the SCP objective. We evaluate the performance of Graph-SCP on synthetically weighted and unweighted SCP instances with diverse problem characteristics and complexities, and on instances from the OR Library, a canonical benchmark for SCP. We show that Graph-SCP reduces the problem size by 60-80% and achieves runtime speedups of up to 10x on average when compared to Gurobi (a state-of-the-art commercial solver), while maintaining solution quality. This is in contrast to fast greedy solutions that significantly compromise solution quality to achieve guaranteed polynomial runtime. We showcase Graph-SCP's ability to generalize to larger problem sizes, training on SCP instances with up to 3,000 subsets and testing on SCP instances with up to 10,000 subsets.</description>

      <title>Optimal Padded Decomposition For Bounded Treewidth Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12230v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A $(\beta,\delta,\Delta)$-padded decomposition of an edge-weighted graph $G = (V,E,w)$ is a stochastic decomposition into clusters of diameter at most $\Delta$ such that for every vertex $v\in V$, the probability that $\rm{ball}_G(v,\gamma\Delta)$ is entirely contained in the cluster containing $v$ is at least $e^{-\beta\gamma}$ for every $\gamma \in [0,\delta]$. Padded decompositions have been studied for decades and have found numerous applications, including metric embedding, multicommodity flow-cut gap, multicut, and zero extension problems, to name a few. In these applications, parameter $\beta$, called the padding parameter, is the most important parameter since it decides either the distortion or the approximation ratios. For general graphs with $n$ vertices, $\beta = \Theta(\log n)$. Klein, Plotkin, and Rao showed that $K_r$-minor-free graphs have padding parameter $\beta = O(r^3)$, which is a significant improvement over general graphs when $r$ is a constant. A long-standing conjecture is to construct a padded decomposition for $K_r$-minor-free graphs with padding parameter $\beta = O(\log r)$. Despite decades of research, the best-known result is $\beta = O(r)$, even for graphs with treewidth at most $r$. In this work, we make significant progress toward the aforementioned conjecture by showing that graphs with treewidth $\rm{tw}$ admit a padded decomposition with padding parameter $O(\log \rm{tw})$, which is tight. As corollaries, we obtain an exponential improvement in dependency on treewidth in a host of algorithmic applications: $O(\sqrt{ \log n \cdot \log(\rm{tw})})$ flow-cut gap, max flow-min multicut ratio of $O(\log(\rm{tw}))$, an $O(\log(\rm{tw}))$ approximation for the 0-extension problem, an $\ell^{O(\log n)}_\infty$ embedding with distortion $O(\log \rm{tw})$, and an $O(\log \rm{tw})$ bound for integrality gap for the uniform sparsest cut.</description>

      <title>Graphon Mixtures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13864v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Social networks have a small number of large hubs, and a large number of small dense communities. We propose a generative model that captures both hub and dense structures. Based on recent results about graphons on line graphs, our model is a graphon mixture, enabling us to generate sequences of graphs where each graph is a combination of sparse and dense graphs. We propose a new condition on sparse graphs (the max-degree), which enables us to identify hubs. We show theoretically that we can estimate the normalized degree of the hubs, as well as estimate the graphon corresponding to sparse components of graph mixtures. We illustrate our approach on synthetic data, citation graphs, and social networks, showing the benefits of explicitly modeling sparse graphs.</description>

      <title>A 13/6-Approximation for Strip Packing via the Bottom-Left Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04654v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the Strip Packing problem, we are given a vertical strip of fixed width and unbounded height, along with a set of axis-parallel rectangles. The task is to place all rectangles within the strip, without overlaps, while minimizing the height of the packing. This problem is known to be NP-hard. The Bottom-Left Algorithm is a simple and widely used heuristic for Strip Packing. Given a fixed order of the rectangles, it places them one by one, always choosing the lowest feasible position in the strip and, in case of ties, the leftmost one. Baker, Coffman, and Rivest proved in 1980 that the Bottom-Left Algorithm has approximation ratio 3 if the rectangles are sorted by decreasing width. For the past 45 years, no alternative ordering has been found that improves this bound. We introduce a new rectangle ordering and show that with this ordering the Bottom-Left Algorithm achieves a 13/6 approximation for the Strip Packing problem.</description>

      <title>Exact Causal Attention with 10% Fewer Operations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05175v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present Exact Causal Attention (ECA), a Strassen-style algorithm that computes exact Causal Attention using 10\% fewer operations. ECA improves a special class of matrix multiplications where either one operand or the output matrix is upper- or lower-triangular. This includes all matrix multiplication operations in the forward and backward pass of Causal Attention, such as masked product $\mathrm{Mask}(QK^{T})$. ECA is built upon algebraic identities discovered via machine learning and combinatorial search. We note that ECA cannot accelerate fused kernels such as FlashAttention on GPU. This is because ECA requires materialization of large intermediate expressions in the memory, while FlashAttention does not. However, it provides an alternative approach for compute-bound applications and can potentially be useful in scenarios with FLOPs considerations.</description>
