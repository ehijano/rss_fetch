      <title>Seeing Stereotypes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02146v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reliance on stereotypes is a persistent feature of human decision-making and has been extensively documented in educational settings, where it can shape students' confidence, performance, and long-term human capital accumulation. While effective techniques exist to mitigate these negative effects, a crucial first step is to establish whether teachers can recognize stereotypes in their professional environment. We introduce the Stereotype Identification Test (SIT), a novel survey tool that asks teachers to evaluate and comment on the presence of stereotypes in images randomly drawn from school textbooks. Their responses are systematically linked to established measures of implicit bias (Implicit Association Test, IAT) and explicit bias (survey scales on teaching stereotypes and social values). Our findings demonstrate that the SIT is a valid and reliable measure of stereotype recognition. Teachers' ability to recognize stereotypes is linked to trainable traits such as implicit bias awareness and inclusive teaching practices. Moreover, providing personalized feedback on implicit bias improves SIT scores by 0.25 standard deviations, reinforcing the idea that stereotype recognition is malleable and can be enhanced through targeted interventions.</description>

      <title>Educational Assortative Mating and Household Income Inequality: Evidence from Brazil, Indonesia, Mexico, and South Africa</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02713v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents new empirical evidence from four emerging economies on the relationship between educational assortative mating and household income inequality. Using a methodological approach that allows for studying marital sorting patterns without imposing restrictive assumptions about search frictions, the study finds that people in Brazil, Indonesia, Mexico, and South Africa tend to sort into internally homogeneous marriages based on education level. While educational sorting has a noticeable impact on household income inequality in any given year, changes in the degree of sorting over time barely have any impact on inequality. Further analysis reveals that this counterintuitive result is due to different dynamics within educational groups. The inequality-decreasing impact from reduced sorting among the highly educated is almost entirely offset by the inequality-increasing impact from increased sorting among the least educated. While it is certainly reassuring that concerns about educational assortative mating having a potentially large effect on income disparities between households appear to be unwarranted, these findings suggest another concerning narrative. Marginalization processes are occurring at low levels of the educational distribution. The least educated are being left behind, facing limited labor market opportunities and diminished chances of achieving upward socioeconomic mobility through marriage to more educated partners.</description>

      <title>Consistent Segregation Metrics: Addressing Structural Variations in Global Labor Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02763v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Index of Dissimilarity (ID), widely utilized in economic literature as a measure of segregation, is inadequate for cross-country or time series studies due to its failure to account for structural variations across countries' labor markets or changes over time within a single country's labor market. Building on the works of Karmel and MacLachlan (1988) and Blackburn et al. (1993), we propose a new measure - the standardized ID - that isolates structural differences from true differences in segregation across space or time. A key advantage of our proposed measure lies in its ease of implementation and interpretation, even when working with datasets encompassing a large number of countries or time periods. Moreover, our measure can be consistently applied in the case of lumpy sectors or occupations that account for a large fraction of the workforce. We illustrate the new measure in an analysis of the cross-country relationship between economic development (as measured by GDP per capita) and occupational and sectoral gender segregation. Comparing the crude ID with the standardized ID, we show that the crude ID overestimates the positive correlation between income and segregation, especially between low- and middle-income countries. This suggests that analyses relying on the crude ID risk overestimating the importance of income differentials in explaining cross-country variation in gender segregation.</description>

      <title>Can Large Language Models Extract Customer Needs as well as Professional Analysts?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01870v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Identifying customer needs (CNs) is important for product management, product development, and marketing. Applications rely on professional analysts interpreting textual data (e.g., interview transcripts, online reviews) to understand the nuances of customer experience and concisely formulate "jobs to be done." The task is cognitively complex and time-consuming. Current practice facilitates the process with keyword search and machine learning but relies on human judgment to formulate CNs. We examine whether Large Language Models (LLMs) can automatically extract CNs. Because evaluating CNs requires professional judgment, we partnered with a marketing consulting firm to conduct a blind study of CNs extracted by: (1) a foundational LLM with prompt engineering only (Base LLM), (2) an LLM fine-tuned with professionally identified CNs (SFT LLM), and (3) professional analysts. The SFT LLM performs as well as or better than professional analysts when extracting CNs. The extracted CNs are well-formulated, sufficiently specific to identify opportunities, and justified by source content (no hallucinations). The SFT LLM is efficient and provides more complete coverage of CNs. The Base LLM was not sufficiently accurate or specific. Organizations can rely on SFT LLMs to reduce manual effort, enhance the precision of CN articulation, and provide improved insight for innovation and marketing strategy.</description>

      <title>BiHRNN -- Bi-Directional Hierarchical Recurrent Neural Network for Inflation Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01893v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inflation prediction guides decisions on interest rates, investments, and wages, playing a key role in economic stability. Yet accurate forecasting is challenging due to dynamic factors and the layered structure of the Consumer Price Index, which organizes goods and services into multiple categories. We propose the Bi-directional Hierarchical Recurrent Neural Network (BiHRNN) model to address these challenges by leveraging the hierarchical structure to enable bidirectional information flow between levels. Informative constraints on the RNN parameters enhance predictive accuracy at all levels without the inefficiencies of a unified model. We validated BiHRNN on inflation datasets from the United States, Canada, and Norway by training, tuning hyperparameters, and experimenting with various loss functions. Our results demonstrate that BiHRNN significantly outperforms traditional RNN models, with its bidirectional architecture playing a pivotal role in achieving improved forecasting accuracy.</description>

      <title>FinArena: A Human-Agent Collaboration Framework for Financial Market Analysis and Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02692v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To improve stock trend predictions and support personalized investment decisions, this paper proposes FinArena, a novel Human-Agent collaboration framework. Inspired by the mixture of experts (MoE) approach, FinArena combines multimodal financial data analysis with user interaction. The human module features an interactive interface that captures individual risk preferences, allowing personalized investment strategies. The machine module utilizes a Large Language Model-based (LLM-based) multi-agent system to integrate diverse data sources, such as stock prices, news articles, and financial statements. To address hallucinations in LLMs, FinArena employs the adaptive Retrieval-Augmented Generative (RAG) method for processing unstructured news data. Finally, a universal expert agent makes investment decisions based on the features extracted from multimodal data and investors' individual risk preferences. Extensive experiments show that FinArena surpasses both traditional and state-of-the-art benchmarks in stock trend prediction and yields promising results in trading simulations across various risk profiles. These findings highlight FinArena's potential to enhance investment outcomes by aligning strategic insights with personalized risk considerations.</description>

      <title>Seeded Poisson Factorization: Leveraging domain knowledge to fit topic models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02741v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topic models are widely used for discovering latent thematic structures in large text corpora, yet traditional unsupervised methods often struggle to align with predefined conceptual domains. This paper introduces Seeded Poisson Factorization (SPF), a novel approach that extends the Poisson Factorization framework by incorporating domain knowledge through seed words. SPF enables a more interpretable and structured topic discovery by modifying the prior distribution of topic-specific term intensities, assigning higher initial rates to predefined seed words. The model is estimated using variational inference with stochastic gradient optimization, ensuring scalability to large datasets.
  We apply SPF to an Amazon customer feedback dataset, leveraging predefined product categories as guiding structures. Our evaluation demonstrates that SPF achieves superior classification performance compared to alternative guided topic models, particularly in terms of computational efficiency and predictive performance. Furthermore, robustness checks highlight SPF's ability to adaptively balance domain knowledge and data-driven topic discovery, even in cases of imperfect seed word selection. These results establish SPF as a powerful and scalable alternative for integrating expert knowledge into topic modeling, enhancing both interpretability and efficiency in real-world applications.</description>

      <title>Smiles in Profiles: Improving Efficiency While Reducing Disparities in Online Marketplaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.01235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.01235v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Online platforms often have conflicting goals: they face tradeoffs between increasing efficiency and reducing disparities, where the latter may relate to objectives such as the longer-term health of the marketplace or the organization's mission. We examine how participants' profile pictures shape this trade-off in the context of a peer-to-peer lending platform. We develop and apply an approach to estimate marketplace participants' preferences for different profile features, distinguishing between (i) "type" (e.g., gender, age) and (ii) "style" (e.g., smiling in the photo). Relative to type, style features are easier to change, and platforms may be more willing to encourage such changes. Our approach starts by using causal inference methods together with computer vision algorithms applied to observational data to identify type and style features of profiles that appear to affect demand for transactions. We further decompose type-based disparities into a component driven by demand for certain types and a component that arises because different types have different distributions of style features; we find that style differences exacerbate type-based disparities. To improve internal validity, we then carry out two randomized survey experiments using generative models to create multiple versions of profile images that differ in one feature at a time. We then evaluate counterfactual platform policies based on the changeable profile features and identify approaches that can ameliorate the disparity-efficiency tension. We identify marketplace feedback effects, where encouraging certain style choices attracts participants who value these choices.</description>

      <title>Behavioral Expectations in New Keynesian DSGE Models: Evidence from India's COVID-19 Recovery and Vaccination Program</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17165v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper extends the New Keynesian Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium (DSGE) framework by incorporating behavioral expectations to analyze India's output gap moments, focusing on COVID-19 and vaccination effects. Departing from rational expectations models, we show that behavioral expectations better capture the non-normal distribution of India's output gap. Using Hodrick-Prescott and Kalman filters, we estimate the output gap and match it with simulated moments. Following Dasgupta and Rajeev (2023), we model the pandemic as a prolonged negative demand shock and vaccinations as a positive supply shock, deriving the initial negative demand shock from observed output gap declines. We then identify the optimal positive supply shock that best aligns with the actual moments of the filtered output gap data. Using Euclidean distance minimization, we obtain initial supply shock magnitudes of 0.41 and 0.3 for the HP and Kalman filter specifications, respectively. Moreover, we quantitatively extend previous work by Dasgupta and Rajeev (2023), which presented only a simple Keynesian analysis.</description>
