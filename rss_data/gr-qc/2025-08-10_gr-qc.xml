      <title>Conformal Gravity as a Deformed Topological Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05683v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the MacDowell-Mansouri formulation of general relativity, the spin connection and coframe variables are incorporated into a single Lie algebra-valued connection called the MacDowell-Mansouri connection, $\omega$. From the curvature form $F$ of $\omega$ and an auxiliary field, $B$, one may formulate general relativity as a deformed topological field theory by constructing an action functional whose variation yields a set of field equations that are equivalent to the Einstein equations on shell. In this article, we show that when the fundamental length scale of the MacDowell-Mansouri connection is regarded as a dynamical variable -- a cosmological scalar field -- the field equations obtained from the variation of the resulting action are equivalent to the conformal Einstein equations on shell. Through the lens of Cartan geometry, we then discuss a notable geometrical difference between general relativity and its conformally transformed counterpart. Specifically, for the latter, we show that points in spacetime are infinitesimally approximated by homogeneous spaces (restricted to a point) whose radii are parameterised by the value of the cosmological scalar field.</description>

      <title>On the Determination of Collisional Stopping Power via Kaluza-Klein Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05701v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, the tools of general relativity are used to analytically derive collisional stopping power. We start from a Kaluza-Klein inspired, five-dimensional diffeomorphism-invariant action, and upon compactification, obtain a four-dimensional effective theory in which the matter fields are treated to be brane-localized. The medium response to the projected electron is encoded in symmetric tensor fields coupled covariantly to both electromagnetic and fermionic parts via Lagrangian-derived interactions. When $R_c \sim \Lambda_{\text{EM}}^{-1}$, $\Lambda_{\text{EM}} \gg m_e$ and $g_4^2 = \frac{3\pi^2 m_e v}{4\gamma^3 R_c^2 e^2 \Lambda_{\text{EM}}}$ are satisfied, the leading term of Bethe-Moller formula is shown to be recovered in the large $R'$ limit. The construction presented here may serve as an alternative approach that uses compactification geometry and medium excitations to determine observable couplings and stopping power. The model intrinsically supports phenomena linked to anisotropy and nonlinear response, as well as gravitational or extra-dimensional effects in laboratory-scale systems via the study of stopping power and particle range.</description>

      <title>Stable Islands of Weak Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05729v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an exploration of the phenomenology of Horndeski gravity, focusing on regimes that produce weak gravity compared to General Relativity. This letter introduces a novel method to generate models of modified gravity theories that produce a specific observational behaviour while fulfilling stability criteria, without imposing a fixed parametrisation. We start from the inherently stable basis of linear Horndeski theory, implemented in the recently released Einstein-Boltzmann solver mochi_class. The time evolution of the basis functions is designed with Gaussian processes that directly include the stability and phenomenology criteria during the generation. Here, we focus on models with weak gravity that suppress the growth of Large-Scale Structure at late times. To achieve this behaviour, we mainly focus on the design of a dynamical effective Planck mass for theories with a vanishing fifth force. We find a broad range of weak-gravity islands in Horndeski theory space. We also include additional features, like a vanishing modification to gravity at $z=0$, and extend the exploration to islands of gravity with a non-zero fifth force. Finally, we show that replacing the $\Lambda$CDM expansion model by the DESI $w_0w_a$CDM best fit also produces stable islands of weak gravity.</description>

      <title>Perturbative Hyperboloidal Extraction of Gravitational Waves in 3+1 Numerical Relativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05743v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a framework to propagate to null infinity gravitational waves computed at timelike worldtubes in the interior of a 3+1 (Cauchy) numerical relativity simulations. In our method, numerical relativity data are used as the inner inflowing boundary of a perturbative time-domain Regge-Wheeler-Zerilli simulation in hyperboloidal coordinates that reaches null infinity. We showcase waveforms from (3+1)D simulations of gravitational collapse of rotating neutron stars, binary black holes mergers and scattering, and binary neutron star mergers and compare them to other extrapolation methods. Our perturbative hyperboloidal extraction provides a simple yet efficient procedure to compute gravitational waves with data quality comparable to the Cauchy characteristic extraction for several practical applications. Nonlinear effects in the wave propagation are not captured by our method, but the present work is a stepping stone towards more sophisticated hyperboloidal schemes for gravitational-wave extraction.</description>

      <title>A spacetime-covariant approach to inertial and accelerated quantum clocks in first-quantization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05897v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is expected that a quantum theory of gravity will radically alter our current notion of spacetime geometry. However, contrary to what was commonly assumed for many decades, quantum gravity effects could manifest in scales much larger than the Planck Scale, provided that there is enough coherence in the superposition of geometries. Quantum Clocks, i.e. quantum mechanical systems whose internal dynamics can keep track of proper-time lapses, are a very promising tool for probing such low-energy quantum gravity effects. In this work, we contribute to this subject by proposing a spacetime-covariant formalism to describe clocks in first quantization. In particular, we account for the possibility of dynamically accelerated clocks via suitable couplings with external fields. We find that a particular decomposition of the (quadratic) clock Hamiltonian into positive- and negative-mass sectors, when attainable, enables one to compute the evolution of the system directly in terms of the clock's proper-time while maintaining explicit covariance. When this decomposition is possible, the evolution obtained is always unitary, even with couplings with external fields used to, e.g., accelerate the clocks. We then apply this formulation to compute the joint time evolution of a pair of quantum clocks in two cases: (i) inertial clocks with relative motion and (ii) charged clocks accelerated by a uniform magnetic field. In both cases, when our clocks are prepared in coherent states, we find that the density matrix $\rho_{\tau_2|\tau_1}$ describing time-measurements of the two clocks yields not only conditional probabilities whose peaks match exactly the classical expected values for time dilation, but also yields coherent quantum fluctuations around that peak with a Gaussian profile.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.06099v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In our paper we pay attention to the problem of uniqueness (classification) of higher-dimensional electro-magnetic static, asymptotically flat, non-extremal solutions of multi-dimensional Einstein (n-2)-form gauge field gravity theory, which possess a photon sphere. The photon sphere is uniquely described by its asymptotic data. Conformal positive energy theorem is the key tool in the proof.</description>

      <title>Planckian bound on IR/UV mixing from cold-atom interferometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06171v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: IR/UV mixing (a mechanism causing ultraviolet quantum-gravity effects to manifest themselves also in a far-infrared regime) is a rare case of feature found in several approaches to the quantum-gravity problem. We here derive the implications for "soft" IR/UV mixing (corrections to the dispersion relation that are linear in momentum) of some recent cold-atom-interferometry measurements. For both signs of the IR/UV-mixing correction term we establish bounds on the characteristic length scale which reach the Planck-length milestone. Intriguingly, for values of the characteristic scale of about half the Planck length we find that IR/UV mixing provides a solution for a puzzling discrepancy between Cesium-based and Rubidium-based atom-interferometric measurements of the fine structure constant.</description>

      <title>Quantum cosmological background superposition and perturbation predictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Predictions from early universe cosmology typically concern primordial perturbations generated during epochs where effects arising from the quantum nature of gravity may be important; quantum vacuum fluctuations being stretched to cosmological scales during a phase of inflation. Quantizing the background is then done by assuming a single close-to-classical state over which perturbations grow, as well as a Born-Oppenheimer factorization throughout the relevant phase. We present a scenario in which although the latter factorization remains valid at all times, we allow the background state to be very non-classical by defining quantum trajectories through an eikonal approximation. We find that these trajectories asymptotically reproduce an almost classical behavior for the background, but the predictions for the power spectrum of perturbations can significantly differ.</description>

      <title>Generalized Perturbed Kepler Problem: Gravitational Wave Imprints from Eccentric Compact Binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06245v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Observations of astrophysical binaries may reveal departures from pure Keplerian orbits due to environmental influences, modifications to the underlying gravitational dynamics, or signatures of new physics. In this work, we develop a unified framework to systematically study such perturbations in the ambit of perturbed Kepler problem, and explore their impact on eccentric orbital dynamics and gravitational wave emission. Unlike traditional parametrized frameworks such as post-Newtonian and post-Einsteinian expansions, our approach offers a more source-specific modeling strategy, making it more natural to trace the physical origins of various model parameters. Starting from a general perturbed potential, we derive the modified orbit and compute the associated gravitational fluxes and phase evolution, assessing their observational relevance for both current and future detectors. This framework thus offers a general and physically transparent toolkit to probe such subtle effects in gravitational wave data.</description>

      <title>General relativistic solutions with finite self-energy for a point charge under Bopp-Podolsky electromagnetism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish the existence of a family of static, spherically symmetric spacetimes that are solutions of the Einstein Field Equations of General Relativity coupled to the electric field of a static point charge obeying the equations of electromagnetism of Maxwell-Bopp-Land\'e-Thomas-Podolsky. The point charge is modeled as a naked singularity with non-positive bare mass. The singularity at the location of the charge is milder than that of the Reissner-Weyl-Nordstr\"om solution to the conventional Einstein-Maxwell equations, and, contrary to what happens for the latter, the electric-field energy of these solutions is finite.</description>

      <title>Exact Analytical Traversable Wormhole Solutions in Teleparallel $F(T)$ Gravity with the de Rham-Gabadadze-Tolley Massive Graviton Sector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we derive a novel class of exact, static, spherically symmetric traversable wormhole solutions in teleparallel $F(T)$ gravity augmented by the non-linear de Rham-Gabadadze-Tolley (dRGT) graviton mass term. By using the Morris-Thorne ansatz with a generalized redshift function including constant, logarithmic, and power-law profiles, we rigorously integrate the dRGT-modified conservation laws together with the teleparallel field equations to reconstruct both the shape function $b(r)$ and the possible torsion-based teleparallel $F(T)$ solutions. Our solutions, which accommodate both pressureless dust and dark-energy perfect fluids, are naturally expressed via special function representations. We verify the flaring-out condition $b'(r_0)&lt;1$, demonstrate the absence of event horizons, and show that the null and weak energy conditions are either strictly satisfied or incur only controlled violations at the throat. These results establish teleparallel massive gravity as a self-consistent, mathematically rich framework for asymptotically flat wormhole geometries without necessarily invoking an explicit cosmological constant.</description>

      <title>Dynamical neutron-star tides: The signature of a mode resonance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by future opportunities in gravitational-wave astronomy and the ongoing effort to constrain physics under extreme conditions, we consider the signature of individual mode resonances excited during the inspiral of binary systems involving neutron stars. Specifically, we quantify how each resonant mode contributes to the effective (frequency-dependent) tidal deformability. The resonant solution is shown to be accurately represented by a new closed-form approximation, which sheds light on the involved phenomenology, and which should be useful for the development of precise waveform models and future parameter extraction efforts.</description>

      <title>Learning geometries beyond asymptotic AdS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05808v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a data-driven method for holographic bulk reconstruction that works even when the spacetime is not asymptotically AdS. Given the data of boundary Green functions within a finite frequency window, we iteratively adjust a bulk metric with a finite radial cutoff until its holographic Green functions reproduce the boundary data. Based on the holographic Wilsonian renormalization group for the Klein-Gordon equation in an undetermined curve space, we construct a radial flow equation and transform it into a Neural ODE, which is an infinite-depth neural network for modeling continuous dynamics. Assuming the double-trace coupling $h$ in the Wilsonian action is real, we demonstrate that the Neural ODE can effectively learn the metrics with AdS, Lifshitz, and hyperscaling violated asymptotics. In particular, we apply the algorithm to the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model which slightly deviates from the conformal limit. In the hyperparameter space spanned by the rescaled temperature $\bar{T}$ and the radial cutoff $\epsilon$, we identify a critical curve along which the learned metric is close to AdS$_2$ black hole with finite cutoff. We derive an approximate analytical expression for this curve, from which an effective bulk dual of the SYK coupling $v$ is established. Our work provides a promising way for using machine learning to depict the novel bulk geometry dual to the non-conformal boundary systems in the real world.</description>

      <title>Assessing Universal Relations for Rapidly Rotating Neutron Stars: Insights from an Interpretable Deep Learning Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05850v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Relations between stellar properties independent of the nuclear equation of state offer profound insights into neutron star physics and have practical applications in data analysis. Commonly, these relations are derived from utilizing various realistic nuclear cold hadronic, hyperonic, and hybrid EoS models, each of which should obey the current constraints and cover a wide range of stiffnesses. Concurrently, the field of multimessenger astronomy has been significantly enhanced by the advent of gravitational wave astronomy, which increasingly incorporates deep learning techniques and algorithms. At the same time, X-ray spectral data from NICER based on known pulsars are available, and additional observations are expected from upcoming missions. In this study, we revisit established universal relations, introduce new ones, and reassess them using a feed-forward neural network as a regression model. More specifically, we mainly propose ``deep'' EoS-insensitive hypersurface relations for rapidly rotating compact objects between several of the star's global parameters, which achieve an accuracy of within $1\%$ in most cases, with only a small fraction of investigated models exceeding this threshold. While analytical expressions can be used to represent some of these relations, the neural network approach demonstrates superior performance, particularly in complex regions of the parameter space. Furthermore, we use the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) method to interpret the suggested network's predictions, since is based on a strong theoretical framework inspired by the field of cooperative Game Theory. Most importantly, these highly accurate universal relations empowered with the interpretability description could be used in efforts to constrain the high-density equation of state in neutron stars, with the potential to enhance our understanding as new observables emerge.</description>

      <title>Quantum Geometric Phases as a New Window on Gravitational Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05881v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate how low-frequency gravitational waves (LFGWs), originating from distant astrophysical or cosmological sources, can induce purely quantum geometric phases in mesoscopic optomechanical systems. These phases represent subtle imprints with no classical counterpart, going beyond standard dynamical or Berry-type contributions that admit Hannay-angle analogues. Such ultra-weak waves couple to the motion of a mechanical mirror and generate distinctive phase shifts in the system's quantum state that cannot arise in any classical description. To access this effect, we propose a Ramsey-type interferometric protocol in which the photon-number states of a quantized optical mode become entangled with the mirror's center-of-mass motion, enabling a direct readout of the LFGW-induced geometric phase. This framework establishes a distinctly quantum approach for probing low-frequency gravitational wave modes, offering an alternative to conventional detection strategies based on spacetime strain.</description>

      <title>Fast radio bursts by stellar wind microlensing of a faint background source</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05947v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By assuming the inverse square law of solar wind plasma density as representative of other stars, it is shown that just outside a star the {\it outward} deflection of a passing radio signal at $\nu\approx 1$~GHz (which is capable of penetrating the plasma) is about 5 times larger than the gravitational inward deflection by the star, and the ensuing lens equation which takes both effects into account is a cubic polynomial with three roots and a new strong lensing caustic. The geometric optics approach is valid for a radio source size $\lesssim 1$~pc. Microlensing magnification of a steady background source occurs typically over a timescale of milliseconds, resulting in $\approx 80$ Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) per day over the whole sky, which can only perturb the isotropy of FRB distribution at the several \% level. Moreover, repeating FRBs could be triggered by the periodic interception of the line-of-sight of the background source by members of a binary system. The temporal signatures of such FRBs are consistent with the power spectrum of solar wind density fluctuations on corresponding scales, except the mean density of the wind is a few times higher than the solar value.</description>

      <title>Mergers Fall Short: Non-merger Channels Required for Galactic Heavy Element Production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06020v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Since the discovery of the binary neutron star merger GW170817 and its associated kilonova, neutron star mergers have been established as a key production channel for $r$-process elements in the Universe. However, observations of $r$-process abundances as inferred from stellar spectra of Milky Way disk stars, together with chemical evolution modeling, suggest that additional channels are needed to fully account for the $r$-process element enrichment in the Milky Way. Neutron star-black hole mergers and fast-merging binary neutron star systems are among the leading alternative candidates. In this study, we combine gravitational-wave observations from LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA with data from short gamma-ray bursts, Galactic pulsars, and Galactic [Eu/Fe] vs [Fe/H] abundance observations to assess the contribution of these mergers to $r$-process enrichment in the Galactic disk. We find that neither neutron star-black hole mergers nor fast-merging binary neutron star populations can serve as the dominant additional channel without generating strong tension with existing observations and theoretical expectations. These results constrain the viable sources of Galactic $r$-process enrichment and underscore the necessity of non-merger production channels.</description>

      <title>Impact of black hole spin on low-mass black hole-neutron star mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06341v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent detection of GW230529 suggests that black hole-neutron star mergers may involve low-mass black holes, potentially producing detectable electromagnetic counterparts. Motivated by this, we perform eleven fully general-relativistic hydrodynamic simulations with and without neutrino treatment, targeting the inferred chirp mass of GW230529. We systematically vary the black hole spin from $a_{\mathrm{BH}} = 0.0$ to $0.8$ in steps of $0.1$, making this the most comprehensive study of spin effects in black hole-neutron star mergers to date. We confirm our earlier findings of fast-moving ejecta ($v \geq 0.6\,c$) in this parameter regime and demonstrate a clear spin dependence, with fast-ejecta masses reaching up to $\qty{\sim e-3}{\Mass\Sun}$ for $a_{\mathrm{BH}} = 0.8$. Most notably, we identify for the first time the presence of spiral wave-driven ejecta in black hole-neutron star mergers -- a phenomenon previously reported only in binary neutron star systems. The mass of this component grows significantly with spin, reaching levels up to $\qty{\sim 7e-3}{\Mass\Sun}$. These results establish a new spin-enhanced mechanism for powering blue kilonova emission in black hole-neutron star mergers, significantly extending the range of systems expected to produce observable electromagnetic counterparts.</description>

      <title>Schwinger--DeWitt expansion for the heat kernel of nonminimal operators in causal theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06439v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We suggest a systematic calculational scheme for heat kernels of covariant nonminimal operators in causal theories whose characteristic surfaces are null with respect to a generic metric. The calculational formalism is based on a pseudodifferential operator calculus which allows one to build a linear operator map from the heat kernel of the minimal operator to the nonminimal one. This map is realized as a local expansion in powers of spacetime curvature, dimensional background fields, and their covariant derivatives with the coefficients -- the functions of the Synge world function and its derivatives. Finiteness of these functions, determined by multiple proper time integrals, is achieved by a special subtraction procedure which is an important part of the calculational scheme. We illustrate this technique on the examples of the vector Proca model and the vector field operator with a nondegenerate principal symbol. We also discuss smoothness properties of heat kernels of nonminimal operators in connection with the nondegenerate nature of their operator symbols.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.06465v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compute the renormalized stress-energy tensor for a massless quantum scalar field in the background of the horizonless Bardeen spacetime. Within the weak-field approximation, we show that the vacuum fluctuations differ significantly between conformally and non-conformally coupled fields, both in magnitude and in their behavior at short and intermediate distances. At large distances, we recover the universal asymptotic behavior previously observed in black hole and Newtonian star backgrounds. Going beyond the weak-field regime, we find that, for certain parameter ranges, the modes of the field can develop imaginary frequencies, leading to instabilities and an exponential growth of vacuum fluctuations. We also discuss critically the applicability of the anomaly-induced effective action for computing the renormalized stress-energy tensor in the conformally coupled case.</description>

Abstract: Parameter estimation of gravitational wave data is often computationally expensive, requiring simplifying assumptions such as circularisation of binary orbits. Although, if included, the sub-dominant effects like orbital eccentricity may provide crucial insights into the formation channels of compact binary mergers. To address these challenges, we present a pipeline strategy leveraging minimally modelled waveform reconstruction to identify the presence of eccentricity in real time. Using injected signals, we demonstrate that ignoring eccentricity ($e_{\rm 20Hz} \gtrsim 0.1$) leads to significant biases in parameter recovery, including chirp mass estimates falling outside the 90% credible interval. Waveform reconstruction shows inconsistencies increase with eccentricity, and this behaviour is consistent for different mass ratios. Our method enables low-latency inferences of binary properties supporting targeted follow-up analyses and can be applied to identify any physical effect of measurable strength.</description>

      <title>Transverse expansion of the metric at null hypersurfaces II. Existence results and application to Killing horizons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03983v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper finishes the series of two papers that we started with [arXiv:2405.05377], where we analyzed the transverse expansion of the metric at a general null hypersurface. While [arXiv:2405.05377] focused on uniqueness results, here we show existence of ambient manifolds given the full asymptotic expansion at the null hypersurface. When such expansion fulfills a set of "constraint equations" we prove that the ambient manifold solves the Einstein equations to infinite order at the hypersurface. Our approach does not make any assumptions regarding the dimension or topology of the null hypersurface and is entirely covariant. Furthermore, when the hypersurface exhibits a product topology we find the minimum amount of data on a cross-section that ensures the existence of an ambient space solving the Einstein equations to infinite order on the hypersurface. As an application we recall the notion of abstract Killing horizon data (AKH) introduced in [arXiv:2405.05377], namely the minimal data needed to define a non-degenerate Killing horizon from a detached viewpoint, and we prove that every AKH of arbitrary dimension and topology gives rise to an ambient space solving the {\Lambda}-vacuum equations to infinite order and with the given data as Killing horizon. Our result also includes the possibility of the Killing vector having zeroes at the horizon.</description>

      <title>Gravitational wave signals from primordial black holes orbiting solar-type stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.07517v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Primordial black holes (PBHs) with masses between $10^{14}$ and $10^{20}$ kg are candidates to contribute a substantial fraction of the total dark matter abundance. When in orbit around the center of a star, which can possibly be a completely interior orbit, such objects would emit gravitational waves, as predicted by general relativity. In this work, we examine the gravitational wave signals emitted by such objects when they orbit typical stars, such as the Sun. We show that the magnitude of the waves that could eventually be detected on Earth from a possible PBH orbiting the Sun or a neighboring Sun-like star within our galaxy can be significantly stronger than those originating from a PBH orbiting a denser but more distant neutron star (NS). Such signals may be detectable by the LISA gravitational-wave detector. In addition, we estimate the contribution that a large collection of such PBH-star systems would make to the stochastic gravitational-wave background (SGWB) within a range of frequencies to which pulsar timing arrays are sensitive.</description>

      <title>Wormhole Nucleation via Topological Surgery in Lorentzian Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02210v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct a model for the nucleation of a wormhole within a Lorentzian spacetime by employing techniques from topological surgery and Morse theory. In our framework, a 0-surgery process describes the neighborhood of the nucleation point inside a compact region of spacetime, yielding a singular Lorentzian cobordism that connects two spacelike regions with different topologies. To avoid the singularity at the critical point of the Morse function, we employ the Misner trick of taking a connected sum with a closed 4-manifold -- namely $\mathbb{CP}^{2}$ -- to obtain an everywhere non-degenerate Lorentzian metric. This connected sum replaces the naked singularity with a region containing closed timelike curves. The obtained spacetime is non-singular, but violates all the standard energy conditions. Our construction thus shows that a wormhole can be "created" without singularities in classical general relativity.</description>

      <title>Structure Scalars for Charged Dissipative Spherical Collapse in $f(R, T)$ Gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.23605v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examine the structure scalars constructed from the orthogonal splitting of the Riemann tensor for the spacetime metric describing the interior of a charged matter configuration undergoing dissipative collapse in the framework of $f(R,T)$ gravity (where $R$ and $T$ are the Ricci scalar and the trace of energy-momentum tensor, respectively), and also the way these quantities influence the various physical parameters of the collapsing matter. In absence of dissipation, the energy density inhomogeneity is found to be influenced by the structure scalar $X_{TF}$ and the mass-function of the collapsing matter. Further, the presence of charge affects the structure scalars and the total mass-energy content. The dependence of the various physical parameters like heat dissipation, energy density inhomogeneity, evolution of the expansion scalar, the shear scalar, effective homogeneous energy density, and pressure anisotropy on the structure scalars, have been clearly indicated along with a discussion on the complexity factor of the collapsing configuration. The $f(R,T)$ junction conditions have been presented, showing the matching conditions for the matter Lagrangian and their derivatives at the boundary. The energy conditions are also presented and the possibility of violation of the Strong Energy Condition has been discussed.</description>

Abstract: The Kerr-Bertotti-Robinson (Kerr-BR) black hole, a theoretical model of a rotating black hole immersed in a uniform magnetic field, has been proposed recently by Podolsky and Ovcharenko. This study investigates the optical characteristics of the Kerr-BR black hole based on the exact solution. We analyze the optical image under two illumination models: a celestial light source and a geometrically thin accretion disk. We reveal distinct roles for the fundamental parameters in the model. Specifically, it is found that under both illumination models, the effect of the rotation parameter on the optical image of the Kerr-BR black hole is significantly different from that of the magnetic field. As the magnetic field increases, the radii of both the shadow and the Einstein ring enlarge. We also attempt to use the data from M87* and Sgr A* to constrain the magnetic field. These results enhance our understanding of the optical characteristics of the Kerr-BR black hole and establish a theoretical foundation for interpreting future observations on the optical image of the black hole immersed in a uniform magnetic field. Finally, we point out that with advances in the resolution of black hole images, it is possible to detect potential BR-like magnetic fields around black holes.</description>

      <title>Inference of multi-channel r-process element enrichment in the Milky Way using binary neutron star merger observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.03696v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Observations of GW170817 strongly suggest that binary neutron star (BNS) mergers produce rapid neutron-capture nucleosynthesis (r-process) elements. However, it remains an open question whether these mergers can account for all the r-process element enrichment in the Milky Way's history. Here, we constrain the contributions of the BNS channel using astrophysical neutron star observations. The rate and mass distributions are constrained by LIGO/Virgo/Kagra through the latest catalog GWTC-3, the neutron star equation of state by gravitational-wave, radio, and X-ray observations, and the delay time distribution by short gamma-ray burst (GRB) host galaxy associations. We present a Bayesian framework to consistently combine these lines of observations with abundance data to quantify the contribution and uncertainties of single and multiple astrophysical enrichment sources. Whereas we obtain a distribution of per-event BNS r-process element yields consistent with geophysical and astrophysical abundance constraints, BNS-only enrichment scenarios are inconsistent with the observed r-process abundance trend of disk stars in the Galaxy. Using stellar abundance observations instead of the short GRB constraints, we infer a shorter delay time distribution with power-law index $\alpha\leq -2.0$ and minimum delay time $t_{\rm min}\leq 40$ Myr at 90\% confidence. Such delay times are in tension with those predicted by standard BNS formation models. Alternatively, we confirm that a two-channel scenario, in which the second channel tracks the star formation history without significant delay, can account for both Galactic stellar and short GRB observations. We show that 45--90\% of the r-process abundance in the Milky Way today was produced by a star-formation-tracking channel, rather than BNS mergers with significant delay times.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.16673v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) has significantly advanced our ability to study black holes, achieving unprecedented spatial resolution and revealing horizon-scale structures. Notably, these observations feature a distinctive dark shadow--primarily arising from faint jet emissions--surrounded by a bright photon ring. Anticipated upgrades of the EHT promise substantial improvements in dynamic range, enabling deeper exploration of low-background regions, particularly the inner shadow defined by the lensed equatorial horizon. Our analysis shows that observations of these regions transform supermassive black holes into powerful probes for annihilating dark matter, which is expected to accumulate densely in their vicinity. By analyzing the black hole image morphology and performing electron-positron propagation calculations in realistic plasma backgrounds derived from general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations, we set stringent constraints on dark matter annihilation, requiring contributions below the astrophysical emission. These constraints, derived from both current EHT observations and projections for future upgraded arrays, exclude a substantial region of previously unexplored parameter space and remain robust against astrophysical uncertainties, including black hole spin and plasma temperature variations.</description>

      <title>Perturbative unitarity bounds from momentum-space entanglement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23709v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Physical theories have a limited regime of validity and hence must be accompanied by a breakdown diagnostic to establish when they cease to be valid as parameters are varied. For perturbative theories, estimates of the first neglected order offer valuable guidance, but one is often interested in sharp bounds beyond which perturbation theory necessarily fails. In particle physics, it is common to employ the bounds on partial waves imposed by unitarity as such a diagnostic. Unfortunately, these bounds don't extend to curved spacetime, where scattering experiments are challenging to define. Here, we propose to use the growth of entanglement in momentum space as a breakdown diagnostic for perturbation theory in general field theories. This diagnostic can be readily used in cosmological spacetimes and does not require any flat spacetime limit. More in detail, we consider the so-called purity of the reduced density operator constructed by tracing out all but one of the Fourier modes in an effective theory and we present a diagrammatic technique to compute it perturbatively. Constraints on the regime of validity of perturbation theory are then derived when the perturbative purity violates its unitarity bounds.
  In flat spacetime, we compare these purity bounds to those from partial waves. We find general qualitative agreement but with remarkable differences: purity bounds can be sometimes weaker, but other times they exist when no partial wave bounds exist. We then derive purity bounds for scalar field theories in de Sitter spacetime for a variety of interactions that appear in inflationary models. Importantly, our bounds make no reference to time evolution and in de Sitter they depend exclusively on scale-invariant ratios of the physical kinematics.</description>

      <title>Inflationary constraints on the moduli-dependent species scale in modular invariant theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08467v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that a broad class of modular inflation models predicts the emergence of new physics within an energy range of approximately \( 10^{15} \, \mathrm{GeV} \) to \( 10^{17} \, \mathrm{GeV} \). This prediction arises by comparing the moduli-dependent species scale with observational constraints on inflation. Specifically, we illustrate this within the context of \( SL(2, \mathbb{Z}) \)-modular inflation models by re-expressing inflationary observables in terms of the species scale. We further discuss the implications of this approach for generic Calabi-Yau threefolds.</description>

      <title>Scrambling in charged hairy black holes and the Kasner interior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01680v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze how the axion parameter, the Einstein-Maxwell-Scalar (EMS) coupling constant, and the charge density affect the chaotic properties of a charged hairy black hole, as characterized by the quantum Lyapunov exponent. We inject charged shock waves from the asymptotic boundary and compute the out-of-time-ordered correlators (OTOCs). Due to the relevant deformation in the boundary theory induced by a bulk scalar field, the bulk solution flows to a more general Kasner spacetime near the black hole singularity. We examine the behavior of chaotic parameters, including the Lyapunov exponent, butterfly velocity, and scrambling time delay, under this deformation. We find that as the deformation parameter increases, the ratio of the quantum Lyapunov exponent to the surface gravity decreases. For sufficiently large deformation, the Lyapunov exponent in the deformed geometry can exceed that of the axion Reissner-Nordstrom case. We observe that boundary deformation generally reduces the scrambling time delay, with the EMS coupling having a significant effect on the delay. These results provide further insight into the role of boundary deformations in modifying chaotic properties in charged hairy black holes.</description>

      <title>Ultradense Dark Matter Halos with Poisson Noise from Stellar-Mass Primordial Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00914v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the impact of Poisson noise from stellar-mass primordial black holes (PBHs) on the formation of ultradense dark matter halos (UDMHs). Our findings reveal that the discrete spatial distribution of PBHs significantly enhances small-scale density fluctuations, particularly for massive stellar-mass PBHs. Our results indicate that the modified power spectrum, incorporating both adiabatic and isocurvature contributions from PBH-induced Poisson noise, strongly depends on PBH mass and fraction. Specifically, increasing PBH mass shifts the differential mass function of UDMHs toward higher masses, while variations in the suppression parameter $n$ modulate the efficiency of UDMH formation at small scales. For lower values of $n$, our findings show a significant boost in UDMH abundance, favoring multi-component dark matter scenarios. Conversely, at higher values of $n$, the predicted UDMH distributions align more closely with single-component models dominated by stellar-mass PBHs. Furthermore, our analysis demonstrates that more realistic halo mass functions, which account for angular momentum and dynamical friction, consistently predict higher UDMH abundances compared to traditional Press-Schechter formalism.</description>

      <title>The Proper Motion of Strongly Lensed Binary Neutron Star Mergers in LIGO/Virgo/Kagra can be Constrained by Measuring Doppler Induced Gravitational Wave Dephasing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03547v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Strongly lensed binary neutron star (NS-NS) mergers are expected to be observed once LIGO/Virgo/Kagra reaches the planned A+ or proposed A\# sensitivity. We demonstrate that the relative transverse velocity of the source-lens system can be constrained by comparing the phase of the two associated gravitational wave (GW) images, using both semi-analytical and numerical Bayesian methods. For A+ sensitivity, a one-sigma NS-NS merger signal in magnification $(\mu=200)$ and redshift $(z_{\rm S}=1)$ will carry a marginally detectable dephasing signature for a source transverse velocity of $\sim 1800$ km/s. This is comparable to the velocity dispersion of large galaxy clusters. Assuming the same population distribution, the most likely source parameters of $\mu=100$ and $z_{\rm S}=1.4$ are always expected to showcase detectable dephasing imprints for A\# sensitivity, provided they are moving with transverse velocities larger than $\sim 2000$ km/s. We conclude that a first measurement of the relative transverse velocity of a source via GW dephasing methods is likely only a few years away.</description>

      <title>Environmental effects in stellar mass gravitational wave sources I: Expected fraction of signals with significant dephasing in the dynamical and AGN channels</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.24084v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the first overview of the expected quantity of signals which will showcase significant gravitational wave phase shifts caused by astrophysical environments, considering the upcoming A+ and A\# LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA, Cosmic Explorer and Einstein Telescope detectors. We construct and analyse two general families of dephasing prescriptions with extensions to eccentric sources, as well as collect five specific prescriptions for the fundamental smoking gun physical mechanisms at play in the dynamical and AGN formation channel for stellar mass binary black holes: Roemer delays, tidal forces and hydrodynamical interactions. We compute the expected fraction of signals containing astrophysical dephasing, as a function of environmental properties and based on observed distributions of binary parameters. We find that next generation detectors can expect to find environmental effects in hundreds of detected signals.</description>

      <title>Lorentzian Gromov-Hausdorff convergence and pre-compactness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10380v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The goal of the paper is to introduce a convergence \`a la Gromov-Hausdorff for Lorentzian spaces, building on $\epsilon$-nets consisting of causal diamonds and relying only on the time separation function. This yields a geometric notion of convergence, which can be applied to synthetic Lorentzian spaces (Lorentzian pre-length spaces) or smooth spacetimes. Among the main results, we prove a Lorentzian counterpart of the celebrated Gromov's pre-compactness theorem for metric spaces, where controlled covers by balls are replaced by controlled covers by diamonds. This yields a geometric pre-compactness result for classes of globally hyperbolic spacetimes, satisfying a uniform doubling property on Cauchy hypersurfaces and a suitable control on the causality, and a curvature-driven pre-compactness result. The final part of the paper establishes several applications: we show that Chru\'sciel-Grant approximations are an instance of the Lorentzian Gromov-Hausdorff convergence here introduced, we prove that timelike sectional curvature bounds are stable under such a convergence, we introduce timelike blow-up tangents and discuss connections with the main conjecture of causal set theory.</description>

      <title>Effects of eccentricity on accreting binary black holes: MHD simulations in full GR reveal novel periodicities in jet power and synchrotron spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12375v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We perform simulations of magnetohydrodynamic accretion onto equal-mass, nonspinning binary black holes in 3+1 full general relativity addressing the effects of orbital eccentricity. We find that binary black holes with non-negligible eccentricity accrete matter with periodicity that matches the binary orbital period, whereas quasicircular binaries exhibit accretion rate modulation at approximately $\sim 0.7\times$ their binary orbital period. Additionally, we find that the total jet luminosity is modulated at the orbital period for eccentric binaries, while quasicircular binaries only exhibit long-term modulations. We perform a radiative transfer calculation of the dual jet synchrotron emission and demonstrate that the optically thin synchrotron emission varies on the binary orbital period for eccentric binaries. Moreover, eccentric binaries spend more time in a {\it low} state, where the synchrotron emission is minimum, than in a {\it high} state, where the synchrotron emission peaks. The quasicircular binary also exhibits variability in its optically thin synchrotron emission but the exact frequency of variability does not appear robust against different parameters. Our suite of simulations is an essential step towards providing a comprehensive catalog of multimessenger theoretical models that will enable studies of supermassive binary black holes detectable across the electromagnetic and gravitational wave spectra.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.07461v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a novel and systematic approach to computing the $(2n-1)$-form Chern-Simons potential given the Pontryagin density, i.e. the $n^{\text{th}}$ Chern character, in arbitrary even dimensions $D=2 n \geq 2$. Throughout we work with a generic affine connection, that results in a non-vanishing torsion in general, and allows for non-metricity, which accommodates the existence of non-trivial Chern characters and hence Pontryagin densities. We outline an algorithm, with its implementation as a code, which lets one to determine the Chern-Simons potential given the Pontryagin density in an arbitrary even dimension.</description>

      <title>Lie Group Theory of Multipole Moments and Shape of Stationary Rotating Fluid Bodies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14712v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a rigorous framework for determining equilibrium configurations of uniformly rotating self-gravitating fluid bodies. This work addresses the longstanding challenge of modeling rotational deformation in celestial objects such as stars and planets. By integrating classical Newtonian potential theory with modern mathematical tools, we develop a unified formalism that improves both the precision and generality of shape modeling in astrophysical contexts. Our method employs Lie group theory and exponential mapping to characterize vector flows associated with rotational deformations. We derive functional equations for perturbations in density and gravitational potential, resolved analytically using the shift operator and Neumann series. This extends Clairaut's classical linear theory into the nonlinear regime. The resulting formulation yields an exact nonlinear differential equation for the shape function, describing hydrostatic equilibrium under rotation without assuming slow rotation. This generalized Clairaut equation incorporates nonlinear effects and accommodates large rotational speeds. We validate the theory by deriving exact solutions, including the Maclaurin spheroid, Jacobi ellipsoid, and the unit-index polytrope. We also introduce spectral decomposition techniques to analyze radial harmonics of the shape function and gravitational perturbations. Using Wigner's formalism for angular momentum addition, we compute higher-order spectral corrections and derive boundary conditions for radial harmonics. This enables accurate computation of Love numbers and gravitational multipole moments, offering a comprehensive, non-perturbative approach to modeling rotational deformations in astrophysical systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.09140v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We model the effect of resonances between time-varying perturbative forces and the epi-cyclical motion of eccentric binaries in the gravitational wave (GW) driven regime. These induce secular drifts in the orbital elements which are reflected in a dephasing of the binary's GW signal, derived here systematically. The resulting dephasing prescriptions showcase a much richer phenomenology with respect to typically adopted power-laws, and are better able to model realistic environmental effects (EE). The most important consequences are for gas embedded binaries, which we analyse in detail with a series of analytical calculations, numerical experiments and a curated set of hydrodynamical simulations for equal masses. Even in these simplified tests, we find the surprising result that dephasing caused by epi-cyclical resonances dominate over expectations based on smoothed or orbit averaged gas drag models in GW signals that retain mild eccentricity in the detector band ($e&gt; 0.05$). We discuss how dissecting GW dephasing in its component Fourier modes can be used to probe the coupling of binaries with their surrounding environment in unprecedented detail.</description>

      <title>Detectability of post-Newtonian classical and quantum gravity via quantum clock interferometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.15014v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding physical phenomena at the intersection of quantum mechanics and general relativity remains a major challenge in modern physics. While various experimental approaches have been proposed to probe quantum systems in curved spacetime, most focus on the Newtonian regime, leaving post-Newtonian effects such as frame dragging largely unexplored. In this study, we propose and theoretically analyze an experimental scheme to investigate how post-Newtonian gravity affects quantum systems. We consider two setups: (i) a quantum clock interferometry setup designed to detect the gravitational field of a rotating mass, and (ii) a scheme exploring whether such effects could be used to generate gravity induced entanglement. Due to the symmetry of the configuration, the proposed setup is insensitive to Newtonian gravitational contributions but remains sensitive to the frame-dragging effect. Assuming the validity of the quantum equivalence principle, this approach provides insights not only into the quantum nature of gravity but also into whether spacetime itself exhibits quantum properties. While the predicted effects appear too small to detect with current technology, our scheme offers a starting point for future experiments probing post-Newtonian quantum gravitational effects.</description>

      <title>The Baby Universe is Fine and the CFT Knows It: On Holography for Closed Universes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10649v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Big bang/big crunch closed universes can be realized in AdS/CFT, even though they lack asymptotically AdS boundaries. With enough bulk entanglement, the bulk Hilbert space of a closed universe can be holographically encoded in the CFT. We clarify the relation of this encoding to observer-clone proposals and refute recent arguments about the breakdown of semiclassical physics in such spaces. In the limit of no bulk entanglement, the holographic encoding breaks down. The oft-cited one-dimensional nature of the closed universe Hilbert space represents the limitation of the external (CFT) Hilbert space to access the quantum information in the closed universe, similar to the limitations imposed on observers outside a perfectly isolated quantum lab. We advocate that the CFT nevertheless continues to determine the physical properties of the closed universe in this regime, showing how to interpret this relationship in terms of a final state projection in the closed universe. We provide a dictionary between the final state wavefunction and CFT data. We propose a model of the emergence of an arrow of time in the universe with a given initial or final state projection. Finally, we show that the conventional EFT in the closed universe, without any projection, can be recovered as a maximally ignorant description of the final state. This conventional EFT is encoded in CFT data, and it can be probed by computing coarse-grained observables. We provide an example of one such observable. Taken together, these results amount to a clean bill of health for baby universes born of AdS/CFT.</description>

      <title>You've got a Freund--Rubin in Me: The Aretakis Instability of Extremal Black Branes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12529v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate how the Aretakis instability affects non-dilatonic extremal black $p$-branes by focusing on their near-horizon geometry. Crucially, the strength of the instability, \textit{i.e.} the number of transverse derivatives needed to see non-decay/blow-up of fields on the horizon at late null time, is given by the scaling dimensions with respect to the near-horizon $\mathrm{AdS}_{p+2}$-factor. This renders the problem of determining the severity of the Aretakis instability equivalent to computing the Kaluza--Klein spectrum of fields on Freund--Rubin spaces. We use this to argue that non-dilatonic extremal black branes suffer from the Aretakis instability even in the absence of additional fields -- we find that this is weaker than for extremal black holes. We also argue that the scaling dimensions determine the smoothness of stationary deformations to the original black brane background -- here, our findings indicate that generically more modes can lead to worse curvature singularities compared to extremal black holes.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Entropy of Quantum Corners</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.16800v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In gravitational theories with boundaries, diffeomorphisms can become physical and acquire a non-vanishing Noether charge. Using the covariant phase space formalism, on shell of the gravitational constraints, the latter localizes on codimension-$2$ surfaces, the corners. The corner proposal asserts that these charges, and their algebras, must be important ingredients of any quantum gravity theory. In this manuscript, we continue the study of quantum corner symmetries and algebras by computing the entanglement entropy and quantum informational properties of quantum states abiding to the quantum representations of corners in the framework of $2$-dimensional gravity. We do so for two classes of states: the vacuum and coherent states, properly defined. We then apply our results to JT gravity, seen as the dimensional reduction of $4$d near extremal black holes. There, we demonstrate that the entanglement entropy of some coherent quantum gravity states -- states admitting a semiclassical description -- scales like the dilaton, reproducing the semiclassical area law behavior and further solidifying the quantum informational nature of entropy of quantum corners. We then study general states and their gluing procedure, finding a formula for the entanglement entropy based entirely on the representation theory of $2$d quantum corners.</description>

Abstract: In order to derive model-independent observational bounds on dark energy/modified gravity theories, a typical approach is to constrain parametrised models intended to capture the space of dark energy theories. Here we investigate in detail the effect that the nature of these parametrisations can have, finding significant effects on the resulting cosmological dark energy constraints. In order to observationally distinguish well-motivated and physical parametrisations from unphysical ones, it is crucial to understand the theoretical priors that physical parametrisations place on the phenomenology of dark energy. To this end we discuss a range of theoretical priors that can be imposed on general dark energy parametrisations, and their effect on the constraints on the phenomenology of dynamical dark energy. More specifically, we investigate both the phenomenological $\{\mu,\Sigma\}$ parametrisation as well as effective field theory (EFT) inspired approaches to model dark energy interactions. We compare the constraints obtained in both approaches for different phenomenological and theory-informed time-dependences for the underlying functional degrees of freedom, discuss the effects of priors derived from gravitational wave physics, and investigate the interplay between constraints on parameters constraining only the background evolution vs. parameters controlling linear perturbations.</description>
