      <title>A Synergistic Approach: Dynamics-AI Ensemble in Tropical Cyclone Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22533v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study addresses a critical challenge in AI-based weather forecasting by developing an AI-driven optimized ensemble forecast system using Orthogonal Conditional Nonlinear Optimal Perturbations (O-CNOPs). The system bridges the gap between computational efficiency and dynamic consistency in tropical cyclone (TC) forecasting. Unlike conventional ensembles limited by computational costs or AI ensembles constrained by inadequate perturbation methods, O-CNOPs generate dynamically optimized perturbations that capture fast-growing errors of FuXi model while maintaining plausibility. The key innovation lies in producing orthogonal perturbations that respect FuXi nonlinear dynamics, yielding structures reflecting dominant dynamical controls and physically interpretable probabilistic forecasts. Demonstrating superior deterministic and probabilistic skills over the operational Integrated Forecasting System Ensemble Prediction System, this work establishes a new paradigm combining AI computational advantages with rigorous dynamical constraints. Success in TC track forecasting paves the way for reliable ensemble forecasts of other high-impact weather systems, marking a major step toward operational AI-based ensemble forecasting.</description>

      <title>A fusion of concepts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22894v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This essay fuses concepts and approaches used to describe fluctuating phenomena in climate systems and statistical mechanics, and explores new ideas essential for understanding such phenomena. Its starting points are the Langevin equation (LE) and the fluctuation-dissipation theorem (FDT). The former was introduced to climate research by Klaus Hasselmann through his stochastic climate models. While a version of the latter, formulated within the framework of linear response theory, has found wide application, the deeper origin of the relation between fluctuations and dissipation has remained inconclusive. This essay goes one step further by seeking the cause of the apparent randomness, rather than merely describing it as in the LE, and by directly linking a fluctuation-dissipation relation to the governing microscopic equations. It postulates that such a relation, also referred to as the integral fluctuation-dissipation relation (IFDR), resides in integrals of the forcings that determine microscopic evolutions (individual trajectories) of the considered system. The IFDR ensures the emergence of well-defined macroscopic quantities, such as variance and spectra, quantities that characterize the system's fluctuations, provided the system is in dynamical equilibrium with constant external forcing. It is the dissipation embodied in IFDR that renders future states uncorrelated with initial conditions, thereby generating apparent randomness. Randomness is therefore not an unphysical artifact; on the contrary, it is a fundamental property of forced-dissipative systems in dynamical equilibrium. Fluctuation phenomena in such systems must be described by two principles: the governing microscopic equations and the IFDR. The two principles are complementary but not reducible to one another.</description>

      <title>Partial recovery of meter-scale surface weather</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.23146v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Near-surface atmospheric conditions can differ sharply over tens to hundreds of meters due to land cover and topography, yet this variability is absent from current weather analyses and forecasts. It is unclear whether such meter-scale variability reflects irreducibly chaotic dynamics or contains a component predictable from surface characteristics and large-scale atmospheric forcing. Here we show that a substantial, physically coherent component of meter-scale near-surface weather is statistically recoverable from existing observations. By conditioning coarse atmospheric state on sparse surface station measurements and high-resolution Earth observation data, we infer spatially continuous fields of near-surface wind, temperature, and humidity at 10 m resolution across the contiguous United States. Relative to ERA5, the inferred fields reduce wind error by 29% and temperature and dewpoint error by 6%, while explaining substantially more spatial variance at fixed time steps. They also exhibit physically interpretable structure, including urban heat islands, evapotranspiration-driven humidity contrasts, and wind speed differences across land cover types. Our findings expand the frontier of weather modeling by demonstrating a computationally feasible approach to continental-scale meter-resolution inference. More broadly, they illustrate how conditioning coarse dynamical models on static fine-scale features can reveal previously unresolved components of the Earth system.</description>

      <title>An Eclipse-Ballooning Study of Shadow Bands During the April 2024 Total Eclipse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13335v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study we searched for shadow bands associated with the total solar eclipse of April 8, 2024. Our aim was to improve our understanding of their origin. Shadow bands are debated to arise either from atmospheric turbulence within Earth's planetary boundary layer (PBL) or from a diffraction-interference effect occurring above the atmosphere. To test these theories, high altitude balloons (HABs) equipped with light sensors, similar ground light sensors, radiosondes launched with weather balloons, and an aircraft-mounted light sensor were deployed. Our team was located in Concan, TX, except for the plane which flew to NE Vermont to find clear weather. Unlike Pitt's 2017 HAB study, which detected a 4.5 Hz signal attributed to shadow bands above the PBL and on the ground, no shadow bands were detected above the PBL in Texas or in northeast Vermont, despite the use of improved instrumentation. Cloud cover prevented useful ground based measurements in Texas, limiting our conclusions about the nature of shadow bands. These findings suggest that shadow bands may not always be present or, if they are, may be primarily due to atmospheric turbulence. The results of this study and Pitt's 2017 study emphasize the need for future work.</description>

      <title>Harnessing natural and mechanical airflows for surface-based atmospheric pollutant removal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11803v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Removal strategies for atmospheric pollutants are increasingly being considered to mitigate global warming and improve public health. However, the global potential of surface-based removal techniques has not yet been quantified based on limits of pollutant transport and removal rates. We evaluate the atmospheric pollutant transport to surfaces and assess the potential of surface-based removal technologies for global-scale deployment across a variety of configurations, including air interaction with the built environment, mechanical ventilation and convection systems, and over the global transportation fleet Cities provide the highest removal potential, with median annual estimates of 30 GtCO$_2$, 0.06 GtCH$_4$, 0.007 GtNO$_\text{x}$ and 0.0001 GtPM$_{2.5}$ transported to their total surface area. Cities, solar farms, HVAC systems and filters have the potential to exceed 1 GtCO$_2$/yr (1 GtCO$_2$e/yr for CH$_4$, 20-year GWP) of removal when literature-based CO$_2$-sorbent (CH$_4$-catalyst) efficiencies are applied across their total surface area. These values represent theoretical upper bounds and are intended for comparison across applications rather than application-specific deployment. HVAC filters have the potential to achieve materials costs as low as \$600 per tCO$_2$ removed (\$2000 per tCO$_2$e) when CO$_2$-sorption (CH$_4$-catalyst) technologies are incorporated into their fibre sheets and maintained through routine filter replacement, compared with \$3000 per tCO$_2$ (\$10000 per tCO$_2$e) for city surfaces, based on the literature values for these technologies' materials costs. These findings demonstrate that integrating surface-based pollutant removal technologies into infrastructure may offer a pathway to advance climate and health objectives, though further studies are needed to assess their feasibility in application, and application-implementation rates and cost.</description>

      <title>Social Cost of Greenhouse Gases -- OPTiMEM and the Heat Conjecture(s)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06085v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite well-meaning scenarios that propose global CO2 emissions will decline presented in every IPCC report since 1988, the trend of global CO2 increase continues without significant change. Even if any individual nation manages to flatten its emissions, what matters is the trajectory of the globe. Together the gulf between climate science and climate economics, plus the urgent need for alternative methods of estimation, provided the incentives for development of our Ocean-Heat-Content (OHC) Physics and Time Macro Economic Model (OPTiMEM) system.
  To link NOAA damages to climate required creating a carbon consumption model to drive a physics model of climate. How fast could carbon be burned and how much coal, oil and natural gas was reasonably available? A carbon model driving climate meant burning the carbon, and modelling how the earth heated up. We developed this using the most recent best greenhouse gas equations and production models for CO2, CH4, N2O, and halogenated gases. This developed an ocean heat content model for the globe. Each step is validated against Known carbon consumption, CO2, temperature, and ocean heat content. This allows a physics founded model of climate costs to be projected.</description>

      <title>Using OPTiMEM and the Heat Conjecture to Estimate Future Social Cost of Greenhouse Gases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03009v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an entirely new physics founded approach to estimating the social cost of carbon (SCC). For this, we developed our Ocean-Heat-Content Physics and Time Macro Economic Model (OPTiMEM) to estimate future heat content (separately published). The heat conjecture assumes that weather damages curves are stochastically proportional to ocean heat increase. We model carbon combustion, validate to datasets for greenhouse gas (GHG), temperature, and ocean heat content (OHC). We show that the social cost of 4 GHGs: CO2, CH4, N2O and halogenated hydrocarbons, cannot be single values, but must be represented by a kind of economic phase space.
  We propose very long-term carbon bonds to implement real discounting. This obviates the Gordian knot of the descriptivist versus prescriptivist discount disagreement that is unsolvable. Implementing these bonds leads to a new monitoring metric: real-dollar spending and bond discount rates compared to SC-GHG cost with variation on the discount scale, where the discount has no relationship to the pure rate of time preference (PRTP).
  This heat conjecture is based on OPTiMEM. OPTiMEM initiates from a fossil fuel consumption function to produce CO2, with 18 scenarios implemented to provide the uncertainty range. We provide 1:N year loss risk models (1:10, 1:100, 1:1000) that government, engineers, and actuaries should find useful.
  A scenario implementing DICE family of models carbon and growth assumptions shows +18{\deg} C is breached by 2210 CE, and +110{\deg} C by 2300 CE -- both of which outcomes are obviously not compatible with the fairly rosy conclusions of DICE models.
  Concerns are raised about having enough low-cost fossil fuel for conversion to minimal CO$_2$ maximal energy return on energy invested (EROEI) power if nations wait too long, and low EROEI power is questioned because monetary value is dependent on energy.</description>
