      <title>Scaling invariance: a bridge between geometry, dynamics and criticality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scale invariance is a central organizing principle in physics, underlying phenomena that range from critical behaviour in statistical mechanics to transport and chaos in nonlinear dynamical systems. Here we present a unified and physically motivated exploration of scaling concepts, emphasizing how invariance under rescaling transformations emerges across systems of increasing dynamical complexity. Rather than adopting a purely abstract approach, we combine simple geometrical constructions, analytical arguments, and prototypical dynamical models to build physical intuition. We begin with elementary, easily reproducible examples governed by a single control parameter, showing how power-law behaviour naturally arises when characteristic scales are absent. We then extend the discussion to nonlinear dynamical systems exhibiting local bifurcations, where two scaling variables control the relaxation toward stationary states. In this context, scaling invariance manifests through critical exponents, crossover phenomena, and critical slowing down, allowing systems of different dimensionality to be grouped into universality classes. Finally, we address continuous phase transitions in chaotic dynamical systems, including transitions from integrability to non-integrability and from bounded to unbounded diffusion. By drawing on concepts traditionally associated with statistical mechanics, such as order parameters, susceptibilities, symmetry breaking, elementary excitations, and topological defects, we show how these transitions can be interpreted within a coherent scaling framework. Taken together, the examples discussed here demonstrate that scaling invariance provides a unifying language for understanding structure, transport, and criticality in nonlinear systems, bridging deterministic dynamics and nonequilibrium statistical physics in a transparent and physically intuitive manner.</description>

      <title>A mobility based approach to transport in chiral fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18091v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chiral fluids, for which the mobility tensor has antisymmetric, off-diagonal components, exhibit transport phenomena absent in conventional systems, including interaction-enhanced diffusion and negative mobility. While these effects have been predicted theoretically and observed in simulations, their microscopic origin has remained unclear. Here, we address this question using a mobility-based nonequilibrium approach, analysing the steady-state drift of a tracer driven through an interacting chiral fluid. We show that, under strong chirality, the tracer generates a reversed density wake, in which regions of particle accumulation and depletion are inverted compared to the achiral case. This structural inversion of the wake provides a unified physical mechanism underlying both enhanced diffusion and negative mobility. Furthermore, we demonstrate that these phenomena are robust to changes in the interaction potential, highlighting their generality as a consequence of odd mobility.</description>

      <title>A contour for the entanglement negativity of bosonic Gaussian states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18099v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a contour function for the logarithmic negativity and the logarithm of the moments of the partial transpose of the reduced density matrix for multimode bosonic Gaussian states of a free lattice model. In one spatial dimension, numerical results are obtained for harmonic chains either in the ground state or at finite temperature, by considering, respectively, either a subsystem made by two adjacent or disjoint blocks on the line or a bipartition of the circle. The contour function of the logarithmic negativity diverges only at the entangling points, while the contour function for the logarithm of the moments of the partial transpose is divergent also at the boundary of the bipartite subsystem, as functions of the position. In a two-dimensional conformal field theory, analytic expressions that describe these divergencies are discussed. In one spatial dimension, we explore the partial derivative of the logarithmic negativity of two adjacent intervals with respect to the logarithm of the harmonic ratio of their lengths while their ratio and the other parameters are kept fixed. Considering the ground state of the harmonic chain on the line and in the massive regime, we report numerical results showing that this quantity displays a monotonically decreasing behaviour.</description>

      <title>Emergence of generic first-passage time distributions for large Markovian networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: First-passage times are often the most relevant aspect of a complex Markovian network, because they signify when information processing has resulted in a definite decision. Previous studies have shown that for kinetic proofreading networks in the limit of large network size the first-passage time distribution converges either to a delta or to an exponential distribution. Remarkably, these two forms correspond to the two extreme distributions of minimal and maximal entropy for a fixed mean, respectively. Here we build on the connection between first-passage times and graph theory to show that these two limits are not model-specific, but arise generically in Markovian networks from the distribution of the eigenvalues of the generator matrix. A deterministic peak emerges when infinitely many eigenvalues contribute, while the exponential limit arises from a single dominant eigenvalue. We also show that the exponential limit emerges robustly for reversible networks when a backward bias exists. In contrast, the deterministic limit is not obtained from a simple reversal of this condition, but under structurally tighter conditions, revealing a fundamental asymmetry between both regimes. Our theoretical analysis is illustrated and validated by computer simulations of one-step master equations and random networks.</description>

      <title>Near-optimality of conservative driving in discrete systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transferring a physical system from an initial to a final state while minimizing energetic losses is an interdisciplinary control problem that bridges stochastic thermodynamics and optimal transport theory. Recent research typically considers problems in which the optimal solution is realized via conservative forces, but whether this situation applies depends on the problem's constraints. In systems with complex topologies like discrete networks, the optimal, dissipation-minimizing protocol involves applying nonconservative forces along cycles if the timescales of the transitions in the network are fixed. We show that although nonconservative driving is optimal in this setting, a conservative protocol exists whose dissipation is at most twice the optimal one. This finding is complemented with an example modeling transport across an energy barrier, which illustrates such improvements of order 1 explicitly. Qualitatively, conservative driving falls short of achieving optimality because direct transport across the barrier is avoided. We conclude with a discussion that the optimality of nonconservative driving might be a generic phenomenon: As fewer degrees of freedom can be optimized, additional degrees of freedom due to adding nonconservative forces become more significant.</description>

      <title>Liouvillian Gap in Dissipative Haar-Doped Clifford Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03234v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum chaos is commonly assessed through probe-dependent signatures such as spectral statistics, OTOCs, and entanglement growth, which need not coincide. Recently, a dissipative diagnostic of chaos has been proposed, in which an infinitesimal coupling to a bath yields a finite Liouvillian gap in chaotic systems, marking the onset of intrinsic relaxation. This raises a conceptual question: what is the minimal departure from Clifford dynamics needed for this intrinsically relaxing behavior to emerge? In this work, we investigate the dynamics under the Floquet two-qubit Clifford circuit interleaved with a finite density of Haar-random single-site gates, followed by a depolarizing channel with strength $\gamma$. For Floquet Clifford circuits built from an \textit{i}SWAP-class two-qubit gate, our analysis identifies two distinct regimes for the Liouvillian gap in the thermodynamic limit, exemplified by the undoped and fully doped extreme cases. In both regimes, the dissipative diagnostic signals chaotic behavior, differing only in how the gap scales with system size. In the undoped circuit, the gap scales as $\Delta \sim \gamma N$, whereas in the fully doped circuit it remains finite as $N\to\infty$. We find that the doping density $p_h$ governs the crossover: as $p_h\to 0$, any spatial structure remains undoped-like, whereas for finite $p_h$ certain structures can enter a finite-gap regime. These results are analytically established in the strongly dissipative regime $\gamma\gg 1$ by deriving lower bounds on the gap as a function of $p_h$ and explicit finite-gap constructions, and their extension toward $\gamma\to 0$ is supported by numerics. Importantly, our analytic treatment depends only on the spatial doping structure, so the same gap scaling persists even when the Haar rotations are independently resampled each Floquet period.</description>

      <title>Scaling and tuning to criticality in resting-state human magnetoencephalography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17820v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scaling laws in biological neural networks have long been investigated. From 1/f noise to neuronal avalanches, evidence of scaling in brain activity has been increasingly linked to tuning to or near criticality. The concept of scaling is intimately related to the renormalization group (RG), in essence providing coarse-grained, simplified descriptions that generalize to classes of diverse physical systems. Following the RG idea, a coarse-graining scheme has recently been proposed for populations of real neurons, and scaling behaviors in collective quantities have been reported in the hippocampus and in different areas of the rat cortex. To bridge the gap between neuronal population scales and species, here we consider large-scale, electrophysiological recordings of human brain activity in the awake resting-state. We demonstrate robust scaling behaviors of collective dynamics across coarse-graining scales, with exponents close to those measured in populations of spiking neurons. Further, we show that dynamics of neuronal avalanches, scale-free cascades of neural activity, are invariant under the proposed coarse-graining approach. Simulations of a non-equilibrium adaptive Ising model inferred from data and apt to reproduce a large repertoire of resting-state brain dynamics indicate that the scaling behaviors of the resting human brain activity emerge close to criticality and depend on the excitation/inhibition (E/I) balance of the network. While extending the range of validity of previous observations at small spatial scales and pointing to common scaling laws in mammals, the results open the way to a robust (currently missing) non-invasive approach to estimate the E/I balance, a key quantity in neuroscience research.</description>

      <title>Precise Determination of the Long-Time Asymptotics of the Diffusion Spreadability of Two-Phase Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17873v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The time-dependent diffusion spreadability $\mathcal{S}(t)$ is a powerful dynamical probe of the microstructure of two-phase heterogeneous media across length scales [Torquato, S., \emph{Phys. Rev. E.}, 104 054102 (2021)]. It has been shown that when the spectral density takes the power-law form $\tilde{\chi}_{_V}(\mathbf{k})\sim |\mathbf{k}|^\alpha$ as the wavenumber $|\mathbf{k}|$ tends to zero, the normalized excess spreadability $\mathscr{s}^{ex}(t)$ [proportional to $\mathcal{S}(\infty)-\mathcal{S}(t)$] scales as $\mathscr{s}^{ex}(t)\sim t^{-\frac{d+\alpha}{2}}$ in the long-time limit $t\to\infty$, enabling one to determine the infinite-wavelength scaling exponent $\alpha$. An algorithm that allows one to reliably extract the exponent $\alpha$ from long-time spreadability data was previously devised [Wang, H., Torquato, S., \emph{Phys. Rev. Appl.}, 17 034022 (2022)]. In this paper, we further improve this procedure to obtain $\alpha$ even more accurately by incorporating higher-order correction terms to the long-time asymptotics and by utilizing analyticity properties of $\tilde{\chi}_{_V}(k)$ at the origin. We illustrate our procedure by analyzing hyperuniform ($\alpha&gt; 0$), typical nonhyperuniform ($\alpha=0$), and antihyperuniform ($-d &lt; \alpha &lt;0$) models of two-phase media. In addition, by combining the large-$t$ asymptotic expansion of $\mathscr{s}^{ex}(t)$ with the small-$t$ expansion, we have devised a two-point Pad\'e approximant to approximate $\mathscr{s}^{ex}(t)$ for all $t$ with just a few parameters. Our findings facilitate the characterization of the microstructure of two-phase media across length scales as obtained from numerical spreadability data or experimental data obtained from NMR relaxation measurements. Our work can also be applied in the inverse design of two-phase microstructures with targeted spreadability behaviors.</description>

      <title>Simulating Quantum Field Theories with Boundaries in Curved Spacetimes Using Open Spin Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17935v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a framework to simulate quantum field theories (QFTs) with boundaries in $(1+1)$-dimenmsional curved spacetimes by employing open spin systems. Building upon our previous work that established a mapping from spin systems to QFTs in periodic geometries, we extend the correspondence to systems with boundaries, where boundary conditions play a crucial role in shaping the dynamics. Focusing on Majorana fermions, we derive the allowed boundary conditions from the requirement of inner product conservation and formulate their realization in spin systems. The corresponding spin model is shown to reproduce boundary conditions of QFT accurately when a free function in the spin model is appropriately chosen. As an explicit demonstration, we analyze a flat spacetime example, comparing spectra, mode functions, and linear responses between the continuum and lattice descriptions. Our findings confirm that open spin systems can successfully replicate QFT dynamics with boundaries.</description>

      <title>Decoding cell signaling via optimal transport and information theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.18028v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A central challenge in cellular signal processing is understanding how biochemical networks perform reliably despite molecular noise. Traditionally, mutual information has been widely used to quantify signaling fidelity, capturing how well outputs discriminate distinct input states. However, it fails to capture whether the output also faithfully mirrors the statistical structure of the input, a property crucial in processes like morphogen patterning, dose-dependent signaling, and cellular communication. To address this gap, we introduce the 2-Wasserstein distance from optimal transport theory, which provides a geometric basis for comparing input and output distributions. In our proposed framework, we define mutual information as informational fidelity and the inverse of the 2-Wasserstein distance as geometric fidelity. Applying this dual-fidelity framework to canonical regulatory motifs under Gaussian channel approximation reveals a topology-dependent trade-off: coherent feed-forward loops can achieve high performance in both dimensions, whereas feedback architectures typically sacrifice informational fidelity to enhance geometric fidelity. We demonstrate that theoretical predictions of feedback regulation are well supported by experimental data from tumor necrosis factor signaling. Our results demonstrate that maximizing information alone is not always advantageous and that reliable signaling arises from balancing information transmission with the geometric aspects of signaling. Thus, our analysis establishes geometric fidelity as a fundamental, yet previously unrecognized, dimension of signaling fidelity. It also provides a quantitative, experimentally accessible framework for dissecting natural networks and designing task-specific synthetic circuits.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.18204v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate periodic integrable Markov models, constructed from set-theoretical solutions of the Yang-Baxter equation. We first focus on the simplest class of solutions, called Lyubashenko solutions. We show that the resulting models are equivalent to some twisted Symmetric Simple Exclusion Process (SSEP), which are usual periodic SSEP models where a twist is added on a bond of the ring. We also provide various possible interpretations for these Markov models. Then, we study the long time dynamics of the twisted SSEP, characterising its different stationary states and counting them. Allowing the twist to vary, we examine the possible transitions between the different stationary states. Finally, we extend our construction of Markov models to set-theoretical solutions that are more general than Lyubashenko solutions and show that such models are not equivalent to a twisted SSEP in general.</description>

      <title>Higher-order spatial photon interference versus dipole blockade effect</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.18269v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The steady-state quantum dynamics of three dipole-dipole coupled two-level emitters, fixed at the vertices of an equilateral triangle, and interacting via the environmental thermostat is investigated. We have analytically obtained the populations of the involved three-atom cooperative states as well as of the second- and third-order spatial photon correlation functions of the light scattered by the few-qubit sample. As a consequence, we have demonstrated that this incoherently excited system spontaneously generates streams of single photons possessing sub-Poissonian photon statistics. In analogy to the dipole-dipole blockade, one may expect that at smaller inter particle distances, compared to the photon emission wavelength, the reported phenomenon has the same origin. However, we have shown that the quantum photon features are due to the interaction's nature of the few symmetrically arranged two-level emitters with the surrounding thermal reservoir. Respectively, at larger atomic intervals the effect occurs because of high-order spatial interference phenomena. Sub-wavelength interference fringes can be observed too, via measurements of spatial higher-order photon correlation functions.</description>

Abstract: To analyze the $\pm J$ XY spin-glass in three dimensions, we verified a method aimed at obtaining a high-precision dynamical exponent $z$ from the correlation length in the nonequilibrium relaxation process. The obtained $z$ yielded consistent and highly accurate results in previous studies for relatively well-studied models -- specifically, the three-dimensional (3D) ferromagnetic Ising model and the 3D $\pm J$ Ising model. Building on these previous studies, we used this method and the dynamical scaling method to analyze the 3D $\pm J$ XY model and obtained highly precise critical temperatures and exponents. These findings support the spin chirality decoupling picture, explaining the experimental spin-glass phase transition.</description>

      <title>Number of local minima in discrete-time fractional Brownian motion</title>

Abstract: The analysis of local minima in time series data and random landscapes is essential across numerous scientific disciplines, offering critical insights into system dynamics. Recently, Kundu, Majumdar, and Schehr derived the exact distribution of the number of local minima for a broad class of Markovian symmetric walks [Phys. Rev. E \textbf{110}, 024137 (2024)]; however, many real-world systems are non-Markovian, typically due to interactions with possibly hidden degrees of freedom. This work investigates the statistical properties of local minima in discrete-time samples of fractional Brownian motion (fBm), a non-Markovian Gaussian process with stationary increments, widely used to model complex, anomalous diffusion phenomena. We derive a complete asymptotic characterization of the fluctuations of the number of local minima $m_N$ in an $N$-step discrete-time fBm. We show that the fluctuations of $m_N$ exhibit a sharp transition at the Hurst exponent $H=3/4$: for $H\le 3/4$ they satisfy a central limit theorem with Gaussian limiting law, whereas for $H&gt;3/4$ they converge to a non-Gaussian Rosenblatt process. The convergence at the process level gives us full statistical description at all times. We exemplify it on the covariance of the rescaled minima process, which displays two qualitatively distinct regimes matching Brownian and Rosenblatt covariances on either side of this threshold. Our analysis relies on a Hermite/Wick decomposition of the local-minimum indicator, which isolates a quadratic functional of an effective long-memory mode as the unique driver of the anomalous statistics. These results identify the count of local minima as a simple and robust diagnostic of long-range dependence in non-Markovian Gaussian processes, a conclusion supported by numerical simulations.</description>

Abstract: Entropy is critically examined as a fundamental concept in contemporary science and informatics. Although the typical Shannon entropy provides a proper framework for describing the canonical ensemble, it fails to represent adequately the microcanonical ensemble. This discrepancy manifests additionally in its inability to support a theoretical derivation of the Second Law of thermodynamics.</description>

      <title>Entropy Has No Direction: A Mirror-State Paradox Against Universal Monotonic Entropy Increase and a First-Principles Proof that Constraints Reshape the Entropy Distribution $P_{\infty}(S;\lambda)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15369v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a purely theoretical, self-contained argument that the Second Law of Thermodynamics cannot be a universal fundamental law in the form ``entropy does not decrease'' (whether asserted trajectory-wise or as a universal statistical principle) when the underlying microscopic dynamics are time-reversal invariant. The core is a mirror-state construction: for any microstate $A$ one constructs its time-reversed partner $B$ (momenta inverted). If a universal monotonicity statement is applied to both $A$ and $B$, it implies that $A$ is a local minimum of entropy at every moment, which forces entropy to be constant and destroys any entropic arrow of time. The consistent replacement is that entropy is a stochastic variable described by a probability distribution $P(S)$, whose shape depends on constraints and boundary conditions. We then prove from first principles that constraints necessarily reshape the long-time entropy distribution $P_{\infty}(S;\lambda)$ by altering the invariant measure through changes in the Hamiltonian and/or the accessible phase space. A sharp criterion is given: in the microcanonical setting, the \emph{only} way $P_{\infty}^{(E)}(S;\lambda)$ can remain the same up to translation is when all accessible macrostate volumes are scaled by a common factor; otherwise the distribution changes structurally. Recent experimental work validates this framework: asymmetric constraints enable spontaneous low-entropy transitions, allowing systems to produce useful work by absorbing heat from a single thermal reservoir. With both theoretical and experimental barriers overcome, practical devices based on constraint-reshaped entropy distributions become feasible, with profound implications for energy generation and the long-term sustainability of civilization.</description>

      <title>Entropy production reveals hidden dynamical constraints rather than stochastic disorder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15663v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Entropy production is often interpreted as a proxy for microscopic disorder or environmental roughness in stochastic systems. We test this interpretation using controlled simulations of overdamped stochastic dynamics on curved surfaces in which local noise, geometry, and forces are held fixed while global constraints are varied. Trajectories are generated for particles evolving toward a central attractor, and entropy production is quantified using both a continuum probability-current estimator and coarse-grained Markov transition statistics across multiple spatial and temporal resolutions. Across systematic sweeps of timestep size, domain extent, and boundary topology, entropy production is governed primarily by constraint-induced probability flow rather than local stochastic variability. Periodic domains that permit sustained circulation yield substantially higher entropy production than reflecting domains despite identical local stochastic structure, with the magnitude of the separation depending on domain extent. In contrast, coarse-grained estimates decrease as temporal resolution increases and rise with finer spatial binning, demonstrating that discrete estimates depend strongly on observation scale and may fail to resolve topology-induced irreversible structure. Ergo, entropy production is not a direct measure of environmental roughness or randomness. Instead, it quantifies how strongly system dynamics are driven away from reversibility by global constraints, geometry, and the space of allowed trajectories. Interpreted in this way, entropy production maps function as diagnostics of organized probability flow and provide a principled method for detecting hidden dynamical constraints from trajectory data alone.</description>

      <title>A gradient flow perspective on McKean-Vlasov equations in econophysics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.05696v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that the Gini coefficient of economic inequality is a Lyapunov functional for a class of nonlinear, nonlocal integro-differential equations arising at the intersection of mathematics, economics, and statistical physics. Next, a novel Riemannian geometry is imposed on a subset of probability densities such that the evolutionary dynamics are formally driven by the Gini coefficient functional as a gradient flow. Thus in the same way that classical 2-Wasserstein theory connects heat flow and the Second Law of Thermodynamics by way of Boltzmann entropy, the work here gives rise to a principle of econophysics that is much of the same flavor but for the Gini coefficient.
  The noncanonical Onsager operators associated to the metric tensors are derived and some transport inequalities proven. The new metric relates to the dual norm of a second-order Sobolev-like factor space, in a similar way to how the classical 2-Wasserstein metric linearizes as the dual norm of a first-order, homogeneous Sobolev space.</description>

      <title>Exact analysis of AC sensors based on Floquet time crystals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.22731v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss the behavior of general Floquet time crystals (FTCs), including prethermal ones, in closed systems acting as AC sensors. We provide an analytical treatment of their quantum Fisher information (QFI) dynamics, which characterizes the ultimate sensor accuracy. By tuning the direction and frequency of the AC field, we show how to induce transitions resonantly between macroscopic paired cat states in the FTC sensor. This allows for robust Heisenberg scaling precision (QFI $\sim N^2 t^2$) for exponentially long times in the system size. The QFI dynamics exhibit, moreover, a characteristic step-like structure in time due to the eventual dephasing along the cat subspaces. The behavior is discussed for various initial sensor preparations, including ground states and low- and high-correlated states. Furthermore, we examine the performance of the sensor along the FTC phase transition, with the QFI capturing its critical exponents. Our findings are presented for both linear and nonlinear response regimes and illustrated for a specific FTC based on the long-range interacting LMG model.</description>

      <title>Quasiprobability Thermodynamic Uncertainty Relation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.14354v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive a quantum extension of the thermodynamic uncertainty relation where dynamical fluctuations are quantified by the Terletsky-Margenau-Hill quasiprobability, a quantum generalization of the classical joint probability. The obtained inequality plays a complementary role to existing quantum thermodynamic uncertainty relations, focusing on observables' change rather than exchange of charges through jumps and respecting initial coherence. Quasiprobabilities show anomalous behaviors that are forbidden in classical systems, such as negativity; we reveal that negativity or a non-classically enhanced escape rate is necessary to increase an output-to-dissipation ratio beyond classical limitations and show that the requirements are basis-independent and stronger than quantum coherence. To illustrate these statements, we employ a model that can exhibit a dissipationless heat current, which would be prohibited in classical systems; we construct a state that has much coherence but does not lead to a dissipationless current due to the absence of anomalous behaviors in quasiprobabilities.</description>

      <title>Inhomogeneous SSH models and the doubling of orthogonal polynomials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.15527v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) models using the doubling method for orthogonal polynomial sequences. This approach yields the analytical spectrum and exact eigenstates of the models. We demonstrate that the standard SSH model is associated with the doubling of Chebyshev polynomials. Extending this technique to the doubling of other finite sequences enables the construction of Hamiltonians for inhomogeneous SSH models which are exactly solvable. We detail the specific cases associated with Krawtchouk and $q$-Racah polynomials. This work highlights the utility of polynomial-doubling techniques in obtaining exact solutions for physical models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.03488v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compute the critical exponents of the zero-temperature spin glass transition in a field on a one-dimensional long-range model, a proxy for higher-dimensional systems. Our approach is based on a novel loop expansion within the Bethe $M$-layer formalism, whose adaptation to this specific case is detailed here. The resulting estimates provide crucial benchmarks for numerical simulations that can access larger system sizes in one dimension, thus offering a key test of the theory of spin glasses in a field.</description>

      <title>Quantum Brownian motion with non-Gaussian noises: Fluctuation-Dissipation Relation and nonlinear Langevin equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10421v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Building upon the work of Hu, Paz, and Zhang [1,2] on open quantum systems we consider the quantum Brownian motion (QBM) model with one oscillator (position variable $x$) as the system, {\it nonlinearly} coupled to an environment of $N$ harmonic oscillators (with mass $m_n$, natural frequency $\omega_n$, position $q_n$ and momentum $p_n$ variables) in the form $\sum_{n}\left(v_{n1}(x)q_{n}^{k}+v_{n2}(x)p_{n}^{l}\right)$ where $k, l$ are integers (the present work only considers the $k=l=2$ cases). The vertex functions $v_{n1}, v_{n2} $ are of the form $v_{n1}=\lambda C_{n1} f(x), v_{n2}(x)=-\lambda\,C_{n2}m_{n}^{-2}\omega_{n}^{-2}f(x)$ where $C_{n1,2}$ are the coupling constants with the $n$th oscillator, $f(x)$ is any arbitrary function of $x$, and $\lambda$ is a dimensionless constant. Employing the closed-time-path formalism the influence action $S_{IF}$ is calculated using a perturbative expansion in $\lambda$. It is possible to identify the terms in $S_{IF}$ quadratic or higher in $\Delta(s)\equiv f(x_{+}(s))-f(x_{-}(s))$ to constitute the noise kernel, while terms linear in $\Delta$ to that of the dissipation kernel. The non-Gaussian noise kernel gives rise to non-zero three-point correlation function of the corresponding stochastic force. The pathway presented here should be useful for the exploration of \textit{non-Gaussian properties of systems nonlinearly coupled with their environments}; examples in early universe cosmology and in quantum optomechanics (QOM) are mentioned. A modified fluctuation-dissipation relation (FDR) is also established, which ensures the consistency of the model and the accuracy of results even at higher perturbative orders. Another result of significance is the derivation of a nonlinear Langevin equation which is expected to be useful for many open quantum system applications.</description>
