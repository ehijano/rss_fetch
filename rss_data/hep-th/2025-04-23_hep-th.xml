      <title>Postcarrollian gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct postcarrollian gravity models in two, three, and four spacetime dimensions by applying algebraic expansion methods. As a byproduct, we present the most general postcarrollian 2d dilaton gravity model, construct its solutions and discuss some boundary aspects, including Schwarzian-type boundary actions. In 3d, we propose Brown-Henneaux-like boundary conditions, generalizing a corresponding Carrollian analysis, and derive the postcarrollian asymptotic symmetry algebra with its central extensions.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian quantization of complex Chern-Simons theory at level-$k$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16367v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper develops a framework for the Hamiltonian quantization of complex Chern-Simons theory with gauge group $\mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{C})$ at an even level $k\in\mathbb{Z}_+$. Our approach follows the procedure of combinatorial quantization to construct the operator algebras of quantum holonomies on 2-surfaces and develop the representation theory. The $*$-representation of the operator algebra is carried by the infinite dimensional Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}_{\vec{\lambda}}$ and closely connects to the infinite-dimensional $*$-representation of the quantum deformed Lorentz group $\mathscr{U}_{\mathbf{q}}(sl_2)\otimes \mathscr{U}_{\widetilde{\mathbf{q}}}(sl_2)$, where $\mathbf{q}=\exp[\frac{2\pi i}{k}(1+b^2)]$ and $\widetilde{\mathbf{q}}=\exp[\frac{2\pi i}{k}(1+b^{-2})]$ with $|b|=1$. The quantum group $\mathscr{U}_{\mathbf{q}}(sl_2)\otimes \mathscr{U}_{\widetilde{\mathbf{q}}}(sl_2)$ also emerges from the quantum gauge transformations of the complex Chern-Simons theory. Focusing on a $m$-holed sphere $\Sigma_{0,m}$, the physical Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}_{phys}$ is identified by imposing the gauge invariance and the flatness constraint. The states in $\mathcal{H}_{phys}$ are the $\mathscr{U}_{\mathbf{q}}(sl_2)\otimes \mathscr{U}_{\widetilde{\mathbf{q}}}(sl_2)$-invariant linear functionals on a dense domain in $\mathcal{H}_{\vec{\lambda}}$. Finally, we demonstrate that the physical Hilbert space carries a Fenchel-Nielsen representation, where a set of Wilson loop operators associated with a pants decomposition of $\Sigma_{0,m}$ are diagonalized.</description>

      <title>Octonions, complex structures and Standard Model fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16465v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article is a write-up of the talk given in one of the mini-symposia of the 2024 European Congress of Mathematicians. I will explain some basics of the representation theory underlying Spin(10) and SU(5) Grand Unified Theories. I will also explain the characterisation of the Standard Model gauge group G_SM as a subgroup of Spin(10) that was developed in [1]. Thus, the symmetry breaking required to obtain G_SM can be seen to rely on two suitably aligned commuting complex structures on R10. The required complex structures can in turn be encoded in a pair of pure spinors of Spin(10). The condition that the complex structures are commuting and suitably aligned translates into the requirement that the respective pure spinors are orthogonal and that their sum is again a pure spinor. The most efficient description of spinors, and in particular pure spinors of Spin(10) is via the octonionic model of the latter, and this is how octonions enter the story.</description>

      <title>On the zoology of 2d $\mathcal{N}=(0,2)$ dualities gauge theories with antisymmetric matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we investigate and propose new dualities involving 2d gauge theories with $\mathcal{N}=(0,2)$ supersymmetry. In the first part of the paper we focus on $\mathrm{SU}(n)$ gauge theories with two antisymmetric chirals. The gauge theories are non-anomalous if we consider, in addition to such matter content, $n_f$ fundamental and $n_a$ antifundamental chirals, provided the constraint $n_f+n_a=4$. By exploring the five possibile scenarios arising from this constraint we provide in each case evidences of a dual LG description, by matching the 't Hooft anomalies and deriving the relation between the elliptic genera in terms of other more fundamental dualities. In the second part of the paper we provide a 4d origin for a gauge/LG duality already stated in the literature, that does not descend from any known s-confining duality. In the last part of the paper we focus on dualities for $\mathrm{SU}(n)$ and $\mathrm{USp}(2n)$ models with antisymmetric Fermi multiplets, obtained from dimensional reduction of 4d parent dualities.</description>

      <title>More on genuine multi-entropy and holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16589v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By generalizing the construction of genuine multi-entropy ${\rm GM}[\mathtt{q}]$ for genuine multi-partite entanglement proposed in the previous paper arXiv:2504.01625, we give a prescription on how to construct ${\rm GM}[\mathtt{q}]$ systematically for any $\mathtt{q}$. The crucial point is that our construction naturally fits to the partition number $p(\mathtt{a})$ of integer $\mathtt{a}$. For general $\mathtt{q}$, ${\rm GM}[\mathtt{q}]$ contains $N (\mathtt{q}) = p(\mathtt{q})-p(\mathtt{q}-1)-1$ number of free parameters. Furthermore, these give $N (\mathtt{q})+1$ number of new diagnostics for genuine $\mathtt{q}$-partite entanglement. Especially for $\mathtt{q}=4$ case, this reproduces not only the known diagnostics pointed out by arXiv:1406.2663, but also a new diagnostics for quadripartite entanglement. We also study these ${\rm GM}[\mathtt{q}]$ for $\mathtt{q} = 4, 5$ in holography and show that these are of the order of ${\cal{O}}\left(1/G_N \right)$ both analytically and numerically. Our results give evidence that genuine multipartite entanglement is ubiquitous in holography. We discuss the connection to quantum error correction and the role of genuine multipartite entanglement in bulk reconstruction.</description>

      <title>Monopoles, Clarified</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16673v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a manifestly duality-invariant, Lorentz-invariant, and local action to describe quantum electrodynamics theory in the presence of magnetic monopoles that derives from Sen's formalism. By employing field strengths as the dynamical variables, rather than potentials, this formalism resolves longstanding ambiguities in prior frameworks. Our analysis finds consistent outcomes at both tree and loop levels using the established principles of quantum field theory, obviating the need for external assumptions or amendments. We clarify the mechanisms of charge renormalisation and demonstrate the renormalisation group invariance of the charge quantisation condition. Our approach can be useful for phenomenological studies and in quantum field theories with strong-weak dualities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.16773v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyse dynamics of the closed Type IIA and IIB string on various tri-vector deformed background searching for signatures of integrability. Using numerical methods we construct Poincar\'e sections for particular embeddings of the string and show that these are not destroyed under tri-vector deformation. We find that the corresponding Lyapunov exponents decay showing that trajectories do not diverge.</description>

      <title>Supersymmetric Warped Solutions from Type IIB Orientifold Reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16822v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a family of supersymmetric solutions in Type IIB supergravity of the form ${\rm WAdS}_3\times {\rm WS}^3\times T^4$, where ${\rm WAdS}_3$ and ${\rm WS^3}$ denote a warped anti-de Sitter spacetime and a warped 3-sphere, respectively, while $T^4$ denotes an internal 4-torus. These backgrounds are constructed by uplifting corresponding solutions in the $D=6$, $\mathcal{N}=(1,1)$ ungauged supergravity resulting from the compactification of Type IIB supergravity on a $T^4/\mathbb{Z}_2$-orientifold. More specifically, the supersymmetric solutions are ${\rm WAdS}_3\times {\rm WS}^3\times T^4$ with lightlike warped AdS$_3$ and ${\rm WAdS}_3\times {\rm S}^3\times T^4$ in which the warping of AdS$_3$ is generic. Moreover, we also construct solutions in the form of a warped product $\mathrm{LM}^3_{\zeta,\omega}\times_{{\rm w}} \mathrm{S}^3\times T^4$ of a 2-parameter deformation $\mathrm{LM}^3_{\zeta,\omega}$ of ${\rm AdS}_3$ and a three-sphere. We discuss the relation of these backgrounds to known solutions.</description>

      <title>Boundary anomalous dimensions from BCFT: O($N$)-symmetric $\phi^{2n}$ theories with a boundary and higher-derivative generalizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16844v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the $\phi^{2n}$ deformations of the O($N$)-symmetric (generalized) free theories with a flat boundary, where $n\geqslant 2$ is an integer. The generalized free theories refer to the $\Box^k$ free scalar theories with a higher-derivative kinetic term, which is related to the multicritical generalizations of the Lifshitz type. We assume that the (generalized) free theories and the deformed theories have boundary conformal symmetry and O($N$) global symmetry. The leading anomalous dimensions of some boundary operators are derived from the bulk multiplet recombination and analyticity constraints. We find that the $\epsilon^{1/2}$ expansion in the $\phi^6$-tricritical version of the special transition extends to other multicritical cases with larger odd integer $n$, and most of the higher derivative cases involve a noninteger power expansion in $\epsilon$. Using the analytic bootstrap, we further verify that the multiplet-recombination results are consistent with boundary crossing symmetry.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have studied an $SO(4)$ gauged $O(5)$ Skyrmion on $\mathbb{R}^4$ which can be seen as a static soliton in $4+1$ dimension. This is a sequel of the known $SO(D)$ gauged $O(D+1)$ Skyrmions on $\mathbb{R}^D$ in $D=2$ and in $D=3$, with both of which its properties are compared. Two families of solutions are found, of these only one possessing a gauge decoupling limit. The curvatures of both of these solutions decay as $r^{-3}$, are bounded below by the topological charge, and are localised to an absolute scale. As such, they may have the potential of being interpreted as instantons.</description>

      <title>Collinear Corrections to the Cachazo-Strominger Soft Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16903v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Soft theorems describe the behavior of scattering amplitudes when one or several external particles are taken to be energetically soft. In tree-level gravity there are universal soft theorems for the three leading orders in the soft expansion, and they can be shown to be equivalent to Ward identities of asymptotic symmetries. While the leading and subleading symmetries are understood as supertranslations and superrotations respectively, the precise symmetry interpretation of the sub-subleading soft theorem is still a matter of investigation. The form of the sub-subleading soft graviton theorem was elucidated by Cachazo and Strominger using a BCFW expansion of graviton amplitudes. In this work we show that consistency with results based on asymptotic charges requires a careful treatment of collinear singularities in the amplitude, giving rise to collinear corrections to the usual Cachazo-Strominger soft theorem.</description>

Abstract: Let $X$ be a compact connected Riemann surface of genus $g \geq 3$ and $S \rightarrow X$ a $2:1$ branched covering defined by a generic quadratic differential on $X$. In the following notes, we explore how taking direct images of line bundles defined by certain distinguished special divisors on $S$ gives rank-2 bundles having nilpotent Higgs fields on $X$. The key ingredient is the notion of Baker-Akhiezer divisors associated to Higgs bundles and choices of subbundles of the underlying rank-2 bundles.</description>

      <title>Extreme mass ratio inspirals around topological stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16156v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a point scalar charge in circular orbit around a topological star, a regular, horizonless soliton emerging from dimensional compactification of Einstein-Maxwell theory in five dimensions, which could describe qualitative properties of microstate geometries for astrophysical black holes. This is the first step towards studying extreme mass-ratio inspirals around these objects. We show that when the particle probes the spacetime close to the object, the scalar-wave flux deviates significantly from the corresponding black hole case. Furthermore, as the topological star approaches the black-hole limit, the inspiral can resonantly excite its long-lived modes, resulting in sharp features in the emitted flux. Although such resonances are too narrow to produce detectable dephasing, we estimate that a year-long inspiral down to the innermost stable circular orbit could accumulate a significant dephasing for most configurations relative to the black hole case. While a full parameter-estimation analysis is needed, the generically large deviations are likely to be within the sensitivity reach of future space-based gravitational-wave detectors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.16169v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a new approach to the problem of proving global stability, based on symplectic geometry and with a focus on systems with several conserved quantities. We also provide a proof of instability for integrable systems whose momentum map is everywhere regular. Our results take root in the recently proposed notion of a confining function and are motivated by ghost-ridden systems, for whom we put forward the first geometric definition.</description>

      <title>Tracking the symmetries of $\mathbb Z_3$-orbifold K3s within the Mathieu groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16248v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For $\mathbb Z_3$-orbifold limits of K3, we provide a counterpart to the extensive studies by Nikulin and others of the geometry and symmetries of classical Kummer surfaces. In particular, we determine the group of holomorphic symplectic automorphisms of $\mathbb Z_3$-orbifold limits of K3. We moreover track this group within two of the Mathieu groups, which involves a variation of Kondo's lattice techniques that Taormina and Wendland introduced earlier in their study of the symmetries of Kummer surfaces and the genesis of their symmetry surfing programme. Specifically, we realise the finite group of symplectic automorphisms of this class of K3 surfaces as a subgroup of the sporadic groups Mathieu 12 and Mathieu 24 in terms of permutations of 12, resp. 24 elements. As a proof of concept, we construct an embedding that yields the largest Mathieu group when the symmetry group of $\mathbb Z_3$-orbifold K3s is combined with all symmetries of Kummer surfaces.</description>

      <title>A New Look At Small-$x$ Helicity Phenomenology: Investigating Uncertainties And The Impact Of Polarized Proton-proton Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16284v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This dissertation highlights the contributions I have made to the field of theoretical nuclear physics, specifically in high-energy Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). High-energy QCD is a robust subject and my research is refined to the sub-field of small-$x$ spin physics; small-$x$ physics is characterized by high-energy and density collisions and is well-suited for the Color Glass Condensate (CGC) effective field theory. Small-$x$ spin physics takes the ultra-relativistic description of high-energy QCD and gives special attention to spin-dependent interactions suppressed by powers of the center-of-mass energy. My expertise lies in exploring the theory and phenomenology relating to the KPS-CTT small-$x$ helicity evolution equations, a rubric that allows one to make predictions of the quarks' and gluons' distributions of spin at small-$x$. These predictions are heavily influenced by the initial conditions of the evolution, and the initial conditions are determined through analyses of world polarized data. My contributions focus on Bayesian parameter analysis, numerical and analytical calculations to discretize and cross-check the evolution equations, and the incorporation of a new observable into the pool of analyzed data. The results of such work show that the net amount of spin from quarks and gluons in the small-$x$ regime is predicted to be negative and/or potentially small; an analysis of polarized deep-inelastic scattering (DIS) and semi-inclusive DIS (SIDIS) data resulted in a net small-$x$ spin prediction that can be large and negative, but new results with the inclusion of data for single-inclusive jet production in polarized proton-proton ($pp$) collisions now estimate that the net amount of parton spin at small $x$ is small, with 1-$\sigma$ uncertainty that spans zero.</description>

      <title>Non-geometrical perturbation on homogeneous stealth dust</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.16313v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we study a non-geometrical perturbation to the stealth field, which means the background remains invariant. The stealh is homogeneous in a universe whose source is dust and demand that perturbation unchanged density. As a regular procedure, we introduce a parameter $\lambda$ to perturb the scalar field equation and get an intriguing expression of the equation, similar to a series expansion in $\lambda$. From this procedure, we distinguish and approach to discriminate solutions, and the numerical solutions show that the most significant contribution to the solution comes from the linear term of $\lambda$.</description>

      <title>Thawing quintessence and transient cosmic acceleration in light of DESI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16337v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent analysis of the DESI Collaboration challenges the $\Lambda$-Cold Dark Matter ($\Lambda$CDM) model, suggesting evidence for a dynamic dark energy. These results are obtained in the context of generic parameterizations of the dark energy equation of state (EoS), which better fit the data when they exhibit an unphysical phantom behavior in the past. In this paper, we briefly analyze how ambiguous this latter conclusion can be in light of the background degeneracy between EoS parameterizations and minimally coupled quintessence scenarios. We then investigate whether the current observational data can be accommodated with a non-phantom, thawing dark energy EoS, typical of a broad class of quintessence models. We show that the thawing behavior of this EoS outperforms the CPL parameterization and is statistically competitive with $\Lambda$CDM while predicting cosmic acceleration as a transient phenomenon. Such a dynamic behavior aligns with theoretical arguments from string theory and offers a way out of the trans-Planckian problem that challenges the ever-accelerated $\Lambda$CDM paradigm.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Equilibrium with Steady Flow and Relativistic Local Thermodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16517v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A relativistic self-gravitating equilibrium system with steady flow as well as spherical symmetry is discovered. The energy-momentum tensor contains the contribution of a current related to the flow and the metric tensor does an off-diagonal component to balance with the flow momentum. The presence of the off-diagonal component of the metric implies the radial motion of the reference frame, which gives rise to a problem how the relativistic effect is included in thermodynamic observables for such a general relativistic system. This problem is solved by taking an instantaneously rest frame in which geometric thermodynamic observables read as previously and giving them the special relativistic effect emerged from the inverse transformation to the original frame pointwise. The solution of the thermodynamic observables in accord with the laws of thermodynamics and the theory of relativity is presented. Finally the relativistic structure equations for the equilibrium are derived, from which the general relativistic Poisson equation as well as the heat conduction one are developed exactly.</description>

      <title>Hawking-R\'enyi black hole thermodynamics, Kiselev solution, and cosmic censorship</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.16705v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Explicit example, where the Hawking temperature of a black hole horizon is compatible with the black hole's R\'enyi entropy thermodynamic description, is constructed. It is shown that for every static, spherically symmetric, vacuum black hole space-time, a corresponding black hole solution can be derived, where the Hawking temperature is identical with the R\'enyi temperature, i.e. the one obtained from the R\'enyi entropy of the black hole via the 1st law of thermodynamics. In order to have this Hawking-R\'enyi type thermodynamic property, the black holes must be surrounded by an anisotropic fluid in the form of a Kiselev metric, where the properties of the fluid are uniquely determined by the mass of the black hole, $M$, and the R\'enyi parameter, {\lambda}. In the simplest Schwarzschild scenario, the system is found to be thermodynamically unstable, and the 3rd law of thermodynamics seems to play the role of a cosmic censor via placing an upper bound on the black hole's mass, by which preventing the black hole from loosing its horizon(s).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.16764v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this note, we investigate the stability of the dark energy model from time crystals proposed in [1]. We emphasize two ingredients, the coupling of the scalar field to gravity, and the fact that these time crystals are on an expanding FRW background, which play a crucial role in the field's dynamics. The Hubble parameter, which contributes a drag term to the equations of motion, grows with time until the scale factor diverges. When taken into account, these factors also alleviate the stability concern of [2].</description>

      <title>Particles in finite volumes and a toy model of decaying neutrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16784v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is well-known that the momentum spectra of particles confined to finite spatial volumes deviate from the continuous spectra used for unconfined particles. In this article, we consider real scalar particles confined to finite volumes with periodic boundary conditions, such that the particles' spectra are discrete. We directly compute the density matrices describing the decay processes $\phi \to \varphi^2$ and $\phi \to \varphi\chi\nu$, and subsequently derive expressions for the decay probabilities both for confined and unconfined particles. The latter decay process is used as a rough toy model for a neutron decaying into a proton, an electron, and an anti-electron neutrino. We propose that finite volume effects can have an impact on the outcomes of experiments measuring the neutron lifetime. In addition, our findings at the toy model level suggest that taking into account possible initial correlations between neutrons and their daughter particles might be relevant as well.</description>

      <title>Toroidal black holes in four dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16790v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: From a purely geometric (kinematic) perspective, black holes in four dimensional spacetimes can have event horizons with arbitrary topologies. It is only when energy conditions are imposed that the horizon's shape is constrained to be spherical. Despite this, exploring exotic horizon topologies remains theoretically intriguing since it allows to unveil structural aspects of General Relativity and gain intuition on energy condition violations. In the axisymmetric case, besides the well-known spherical topology, only a toroidal topology is consistent with the symmetry. Complete solutions, describing the entire exterior region of such toroidal black holes without singularities, have not been reported yet. To the best of our knowledge, the construction we present here is the first explicit example of a toroidal black hole solution in four spacetime dimensions that is free of singularities in the external region.</description>

      <title>Physical ageing from generalised time-translation-invariance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16857v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A generalised form of time-translation-invariance permits to re-derive the known generic phenomenology of ageing, which arises in many-body systems after a quench from an initially disordered system to a temperature $T\leq T_c$, at or below the critical temperature $T_c$. Generalised time-translation-invariance is obtained, out of equilibrium, from a change of representation of the Lie algebra generators of the dynamical symmetries of scale-invariance and time-translation-invariance. Observable consequences include the algebraic form of the scaling functions for large arguments of the two-time auto-correlators and auto-responses, the equality of the auto-correlation and the auto-response exponents $\lambda_C=\lambda_R$, the cross-over scaling form for an initially magnetised critical system and the explanation of a novel finite-size scaling if the auto-correlator or auto-response converge for large arguments $y=t/s\gg 1$ to a plateau. For global two-time correlators, the time-dependence involving the initial critical slip exponent $\Theta$ is confirmed and is generalised to all temperatures below criticality and to the global two-time response function, and their finite-size scaling is derived as well. This also includes the time-dependence of the squared global order-parameter. The celebrate Janssen-Schaub-Schmittmann scaling relation with the auto-correlation exponent is thereby extended to all temperatures below the critical temperature. A simple criterion on the relevance of non-linear terms in the stochastic equation of motion is derived, taking the dimensionality of couplings into account. Its applicability in a wide class of models is confirmed, for temperatures $T\leq T_c$. Relevance to experiments is also discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.16919v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore novel topological responses and axion-like phenomena in three-dimensional insulating systems with spacetime-dependent mass terms encoding domain walls. Via a dimensional-reduction approach, we derive a new axion-electromagnetic coupling term involving three axion fields. This term yields a topological current in the bulk and, under specific conditions of the axions, real-space topological defects such as magnetic-like monopoles and hopfions. Moreover, once one the axions acquires a constant value, a nontrivial boundary theory realizes a (2+1)-dimensional analog of the Witten effect, which shows that point-like vortices on the gapped boundary of the system acquire half-integer electric charge. Our findings reveal rich topological structures emerging from multi-axion theories, suggesting new avenues in the study of topological phases and defects.</description>

Abstract: We derive the finite-temperature quantum-tunneling rate from first principles. The rate depends on both real- and imaginary-time; we demonstrate that the relevant instantons should therefore be defined on a Schwinger-Keldysh contour, and how the familiar Euclidean-time result arises from it in the limit of large physical times. We generalize previous results for general initial states, and identify distinct behavior in the high- and low-temperature limits, incorporating effects from background fields. We construct a consistent perturbative scheme that incorporates large finite-temperature effects.</description>

      <title>Localization mechanism of $q-$form field on the brane-world by coupling with gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.11688v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is known that the scalar fields can be trapped on branes of different types, and the $U(1)$ gauge vector fields can be localized on the thick de Sitter brane, or the thick Minkowski brane via coupling with gravity. The Kalb-Ramond fields can be localized on the Minkowski brane and the thick de-Sitter brane, with certain couplings. In this paper, with considering a coupling mechanism between the kinetic term of the $q-$form fields and the background spacetime, we investigate the localization of Kaluza-Klein modes for the $q-$form fields in $D-$dimensional spacetime. Concrete $q-$form fields are discussed within five-dimensional brane models with typical spacetime geometries: Minkowski, de Sitter, and Anti-de Sitter. In the Minkowski brane case, the zero modes of various $q-$form fields can be localized on the brane. In the de Sitter brane case, the zero mode of the $U(1)$ gauge vector fields can be localized on the brane. Lastly in the Anti-de Sitter brane case, the zero mode of the Kalb-Ramond fields can be localized on the brane. For the massive Kaluza-Klein modes of these $q-$form fields, they could be localized or quasi-localized on the brane of different types. Besides, subtle and detailed behaviors of the Kaluza-Klein modes for $q-$form fields are observed: the zero modes could be localized on both sides of the brane, and the massive modes could be localized or quasi-localized at the brane position.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.08176v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A family of infinite-dimensional irreducible $*$-representations on $\mathcal{H}\simeq L^2(\mathbb{R})\otimes\mathbb{C}^N$ is defined for a quantum-deformed Lorentz algebra $\mathscr{U}_{\bf q}(sl_2)\otimes \mathscr{U}_{\widetilde{\bf {q}}}(sl_2)$, where $\mathbf{q}=\exp[\frac{\pi i}{N}(1+b^2)]$ and $\tilde{\mathbf{q}}=\exp[\frac{\pi i}{N}(1+b^{-2})]$ with $N\in\mathbb{Z}_+$ and $|b|=1$. The representations are constructed with the irreducible representation of quantum torus algebra at level-$N$, which is developed from the quantization of $\mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{C})$ Chern-Simons theory. We study the Clebsch-Gordan decomposition of the tensor product representation, and we show that it reduces to the same problem as diagonalizing the complex Fenchel-Nielson length operators in quantizing $\mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{C})$ Chern-Simons theory on 4-holed sphere. Finally, we explicitly compute the spectral decomposition of the complex Fenchel-Nielson length operators and the corresponding direct-integral representation of the Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}$, which we call the Fenchel-Nielson representation.</description>

      <title>Analyticity and the Unruh effect: a study of local modular flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18937v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Unruh effect can be formulated as the statement that the Minkowski vacuum in a Rindler wedge has a boost as its modular flow. In recent years, other examples of states with geometrically local modular flow have played important roles in understanding energy and entropy in quantum field theory and quantum gravity. Here I initiate a general study of the settings in which geometric modular flow can arise, showing (i) that any geometric modular flow must be a conformal symmetry of the background spacetime, and (ii) that in a well behaved class of "weakly analytic" states, geometric modular flow must be future-directed. I further argue that if a geometric transformation is conformal but not isometric, then it can only be realized as modular flow in a conformal field theory. Finally, I discuss a few settings in which converse results can be shown -- i.e., settings in which a state can be constructed whose modular flow reproduces a given vector field.</description>

      <title>Quantum Fisher information of a cosmic qubit undergoing non-Markovian de Sitter evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11490v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit the problem of thermalization process for an Unruh-DeWitt (UDW) detector in de Sitter space. We derive the full dynamics of the detector in the context of open quantum system, neither using Markovian or RWA approximations. We utilize quantum Fisher information (QFI) for Hubble parameter estimation, as a process function to distinguish the thermalization paths in detector Hilbert space, determined by its local properties, e.g., detector energy gap and its initial state preparation, or global spacetime geometry. We find that the non-Markovian contribution in general reduces the QFI comparing with Markovian approximated solution. Regarding to arbitrary initial states, the late-time QFI would converge to an asymptotic value. In particular, we are interested in the background field in the one parameter family of $\alpha$-vacua in de Sitter space. We show that for general $\alpha$-vacuum choices, the asymptotic values of converged QFI are significantly suppressed, comparing to previous known results for Bunch-Davies vacuum.</description>

Abstract: We consider the geometric action formulation for 3d pure gravity with vanishing cosmological constant.

      <title>Dimensional Reduction and K\"ahler Metric for Metric Moduli in Imaginary Self-Dual Flux</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.08623v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding which effective field theories are consistent with an ultraviolet completion in quantum gravity is an important theoretical question. Therefore, it is important to know the structure of the 4D effective theory associated with a given compactification of string theory. We present a first-principles derivation of the low-energy 4D effective theory of geometric moduli in a warped Calabi-Yau compactification of type IIB string theory with imaginary self-dual 3-form flux. This completes the derivation of the metric on K\"ahler moduli space from the 10D equations of motion. We also give the first derivation of an effective action for flat directions in the complex structure moduli space of the Calabi-Yau (which generically mix with the axiodilaton) and work out explicit examples of complex structure flat directions in toroidal compactifications. Finally, we outline applications to a variety of settings, including precision string phenomenology and the tadpole conjecture.</description>

      <title>Replica Wormholes, Modular Entropy, and Capacity of Entanglement in JT Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11474v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By employing the replica trick we study the impact of the replica parameter $n$ on the modular entropy and the capacity of entanglement in the End of the World (EoW) model and the island model, respectively. For the EoW model, we present $n$-dependent evolution curves of the modular entropy and the capacity of entanglement under both microcanonical and canonical ensembles. In particular, in the canonical ensemble, all quantities decrease as $n$ increases at late times. For the island model, we develop the replica geometry for finite $n$ and re-evaluate the modular entropy and the capacity of entanglement in a two-sided eternal Jackiw-Teitelboim black hole coupled with a thermal bath. In the case of a single island configuration, the modular entropy and capacity of entanglement closely resemble the thermal entropy and the heat capacity, respectively, yielding results analogous to those obtained in the canonical ensemble for the EoW model. The analysis of the results from these two models strongly indicates that in geometries with a greater number of $n$ copies, more connected geometries effectively purify thermal Hawking radiation. In addition, we compare these findings with statistical mechanics and provide an interpretation for the replica parameter $n$. Finally, we generalize the island formula to accommodate the finite $n$ case under this interpretation.</description>

      <title>The landscape of complexity measures in 2D gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.20943v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the broad landscape of holographic complexity measures for theories dual to two-dimensional (2D) dilaton gravity. Previous studies have largely focused on the complexity=volume and complexity=action proposals for holographic complexity. Here we systematically construct and analyze a wide class of generalized complexity functionals, focusing on codimension-one bulk observables. Two complementary approaches are presented: one inspired by dimensional reduction of codimension-one observables from higher-dimensional gravity, and another that adopts a purely 2D perspective. We verify the resulting observables exhibit hallmark features of complexity, such as linear growth at late times and the switchback effect. We further offer heuristic interpretations of the role of multiple extremal surfaces when they appear. Finally, we comment on the bulk-to-boundary dictionary via the covariant Peierls bracket in 2D gravity. Our work lays the groundwork for a richer understanding of quantum complexity in low-dimensional holographic dualities.</description>

      <title>On BPS Equations of Generalized $SU(2)$ Yang-Mills-Higgs Model with Scalars-Dependent Coupling $\theta$-term</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06635v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a most general $SU(2)$ Yang-Mills-Higgs model consist of terms up to quadratic in first-derivative of the fields, that is the generalized $SU(2)$ Yang-Mills-Higgs with additional scalars-dependent coupling $\theta$-term. Using the BPS Lagrangian method we try to find Bogomolnyi's equations for BPS monopoles and dyons by taking most general BPS Lagrangian density. We obtain more general Bogomolnyi's equations and a relation between all scalars dependent couplings. From these equations we can see there is a family of BPS monopole solutions parameterized by a real constant $\gamma$, while for BPS dyons there is an additional parameter which is the coupling of $\theta$-term. Interestingly even for a single BPS dyon we find the value of $\theta$-term's coupling only gives additional contribution to electric charge of BPS Dyons, which is in accordance with Witten's result in Phys.Lett.B 86 (1979), and thus can determine whether we get BPS monopoles or BPS dyons.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.07650v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study Carrollian amplitudes of massless scalars in (1+2) Minkowski space. Using the prescription recently shown by Alday et al. [JHEP 03 (2025) 158] originally designed for the AdS4 Witten diagrams, we show that AdS3 Witten diagrams in position space in the flat space limit reduce to Carrollian amplitudes. The flat space limit in the bulk is implemented by the Carrollian limit at the boundary. Focusing on four-point correlators with contact and exchange diagrams, we show that the Carrollian limit makes the universality of the bulk point singularity manifest upon performing analytic continuation to the Lorentzian signature of the boundary correlators. Unlike four-point Carrollian amplitudes in (1+3) dimensions, the (1+2) dimensional ones are non-distributional, having analytic properties simpler than the AdS correlators. We also observe for the first time a double copy structure of Carrollian amplitudes.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we provide another angle to understand recent discoveries, i.e., the hidden zeros and corresponding 2-split behavior using the BCFW recursion relation. For the hidden zeros, we show that although the BCFW recursion relation is not directly applicable for computing amplitudes of the non-linear sigma model, we can indeed prove the zeros using the modified BCFW recursion relation. Our work also indicates that for the 2-split to hold, the current should be carefully defined.</description>

      <title>Duality Anomalies in Linearized Gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.15973v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Classical linearized gravity admits a dual formulation in terms of a higher-rank tensor field. Proposing a prescription for the instanton sectors of linearized gravity and its dual, we show that they may be quantum inequivalent in even dimensions. The duality anomaly is obtained by resolving the dual graviton theories into vector-valued $p$-form electrodynamics and is controlled by the Reidemeister torsion, Ray-Singer torsion and Euler characteristic of the cotangent bundle. Under the proposed instanton prescription the duality anomaly vanishes for an odd number of spacetime dimensions as a consequence of the celebrated Cheeger-M\"uller theorem. In the presence of a gravitational $\theta$-term, the partition function is a modular form in direct analogy to Abelian S-duality for Maxwell theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08570v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a new approach to determining the strong coupling $\alpha_s(Q)$, over the entire range of validity of perturbative QCD, for scales above $\Lambda_{\mathrm{QCD}}$ and up to the Planck scale $\sim1.22\cdot10^{19}$\,GeV, with the highest precision and using the data of a single experiment. In particular, we use the results obtained for the thrust ($T$) and $C$-parameter ($C$) distributions in $e^+e^-$ annihilation at a single annihilation energy $\sqrt{s}=M_Z$ (i.e.\ at the $Z^0$ peak). This new method is based on the \emph{intrinsic conformality} (iCF) and on the Infinite-Order Scale Setting, using the Principle of Maximum Conformality (i.e.\ the PMC$_\infty$), which allows a rigorous determination of the renormalization scales for the event-shape variable distributions satisfying all of the requirements of Renormalization Group Invariance, including renormalization-scheme independence and consistency with Abelian theory in the $N_C \to 0$ limit. This new method is based on the scale-invariance of the iCF, which allows determination of $\alpha_s(\mu_0)$ at any scale $\mu_0$, and on the Maximum Likelihood statistical approach. We introduce a novel approach to determining the best-fitting range based on the most-likely-lowest $\chi^2$ calculated considering all possible intervals among the entire range of bins available in the perturbative region. This new method improves the precision and leads to results that are statistically more reliable. In particular, using data for thrust and $C$-parameter at the $Z^0$ peak from ALEPH, OPAL, DELPHI and L3 experiments, we obtain the average value: $\alpha_s(M_Z)= 0.1181^{+0.0005}_{-0.0005}$, for the strong coupling. This determination of $\alpha_s(M_Z)$ is consistent with the world average and has an improved precision with respect to the values obtained from the analysis of event shape observables currently used in the world average.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23184v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We extend the cohomological setting developed by Batalin, Fradkin and Vilkovisky (BFV), which produces a resolution of coisotropic reduction in terms of hamiltonian dg manifolds, to the case of nested coisotropic embeddings $C\hookrightarrow C_\circ \hookrightarrow F$ inside a symplectic manifold $F$. To this, we naturally assign $\underline{C}$ and $\underline{C_\circ}$, as well as the respective BFV dg manifolds. We show that the data of a nested coisotropic embedding defines a natural graded coisotropic embedding inside the BFV dg manifold assigned to $\underline{C}$, whose reduction can further be resolved using the BFV prescription. We call this construction \emph{double BFV resolution}, and we use it to prove that "resolution commutes with reduction" for a general class of nested coisotropic embeddings. We then deduce a quantisation of $\underline{C}$, from the (graded) geometric quantisation of the double BFV Hamiltonian dg manifold (when it exists), following the quantum BFV prescription. As an application, we provide a well defined candidate space of (physical) quantum states of three-dimensional Einstein--Hilbert theory, which is thought of as a partial reduction of the Palatini--Cartan model for gravity.</description>

      <title>What happens to topological invariants (and black holes) in singularity-free theories?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11450v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Potentials arising in ultraviolet-completed field theories can be devoid of singularities, and hence render spacetimes simply connected. This challenges the notion of topological invariants considered in such scenarios. We explore the classical implications for (i) electrodynamics in flat spacetime, (ii) ultrarelativistic gyratonic solutions of weak-field gravity, and (iii)the Reissner--Nordstr\"om black hole in general relativity. In linear theories, regularity spoils the character of topological invariants and leads to radius-dependent Aharonov--Bohm phases, which are potentially observable for large winding numbers. In general relativity, the physics is richer: The electromagnetic field can be regular and maintain its usual topological invariants, and the resulting geometry can be interpreted as a Reissner--Nordstr\"om black hole with a spacetime region of coordinate radius $\sim q^2/(GM)$ cut out. This guarantees the regularity of linear and quadratic curvature invariants ($\mathcal{R}$ and $\mathcal{R}^2$), but does not resolve singularities in invariants such as $\mathcal{R}^p\Box^n \mathcal{R}^q$, reflected by conical or solid angle defects. This motivates that gravitational models beyond general relativity need to be considered. These connections between regularity (= UV properties of field theories) and topological invariants (= IR observables) may hence present an intriguing avenue to search for traces of new physics and identify promising modified gravity theories.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12465v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The It\^{o} and Stratonovich approaches are two ways to integrate stochastic differential equations. Detailed knowledge of the origin of the stochastic noise is needed to determine which approach suits a particular problem. I discuss this topic pedagogically in stochastic inflation, where the noise arises from a changing comoving coarse-graining scale or, equivalently, from `zooming in' into inflating space. I introduce a zoom-in scheme where deterministic evolution alternates with instantaneous zoom-in steps. I show that this alternating zoom-in scheme is equivalent to the It\^{o} approach in the Markovian limit, while the Stratonovich approach doesn't have a similar interpretation. In the full non-Markovian setup, the difference vanishes. The framework of zoom-in schemes clarifies the relationship between computations in stochastic inflation, linear perturbation theory, and the classical $\Delta N$ formalism. It informs the numerical implementation of stochastic inflation and is a building block for a first-principles derivation of the stochastic equations.</description>

Abstract: We analyse the stability issue of the vector and axial modes of the torsion and nonmetricity tensors around general backgrounds in the framework of cubic Metric-Affine Gravity. We show that the presence of cubic order invariants defined from the curvature, torsion and nonmetricity tensors allow the cancellation of the well-known instabilities arising in the vector and axial sectors of quadratic Metric-Affine Gravity. For the resulting theory, we also obtain Reissner-Nordstr\"om-like black hole solutions with dynamical torsion and nonmetricity, which in general include massive tensor modes for these quantities, thus avoiding further no-go theorems that potentially prevent a consistent interaction of massless higher spin fields in the quantum regime.</description>

      <title>Prospects for quantum process tomography at high energies</title>

Abstract: In quantum information theory, the evolution of an open quantum system -- a unitary evolution followed by a measurement -- is described by a quantum channel or, more generally, a quantum instrument. In this work, we formulate spin and flavour measurements in collider experiments as quantum instruments. We demonstrate that the Choi matrix, which completely determines input-output transitions, can be both theoretically computed from a given model and experimentally reconstructed from a set of final state measurements (quantum state tomography) using varied input states. The experimental reconstruction of the Choi matrix, known as quantum process tomography, offers a powerful new approach for probing potential extensions of the Standard Model within the quantum field theory framework and, at the same time, constitutes a new foundational test of quantum mechanics itself. As an example, we outline the quantum process tomography approach applied to the $e^+ e^- \to t \bar{t}$ process at a polarized lepton collider.</description>

      <title>Geometry of a generalized uncertainty-inspired spacetime</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08004v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We examine the geometry of a generalized uncertainty-inspired quantum black hole. The diagonal line element is not $t$-$r$ symmetric, i.e. $g_{00} \ne -1/g_{11}$, which leads to an interesting approach to resolving the classical curvature singularity. In this paper, we show, in Schwarzschild coordinates, the $r = 0$ coordinate location is a null surface which is not a transition surface or leads to a black bounce. We find the expansion of null geodesic congruences in the interior turn around then vanishes at $r = 0$, and the energy conditions are predominately violated indicating a repulsive gravitational core. In addition, we show that the line element admits a wormhole solution which is not traversable, and the black hole at its vanishing horizon radius could be interpreted as a remnant.</description>

      <title>Vertex functions of type $D$ Nakajima quiver varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13937v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the quasimap vertex functions of type $D$ Nakajima quiver varieties. When the quiver varieties have isolated torus fixed points, we compute the coefficients of the vertex functions in the $K$-theoretic fixed point basis. We also give an explicit combinatorial description of zero-dimensional type $D$ quiver varieties and their vertex functions using the combinatorics of minuscule posets. Using Macdonald polynomials, we prove that these vertex functions can be expressed as products of $q$-binomial functions, which proves a degeneration of the conjectured 3d mirror symmetry of vertex functions. We provide an interpretation of type $D$ spin vertex functions as the partition functions of the half-space Macdonald processes of Barraquand, Borodin, and Corwin. This hints that the geometry of quiver varieties may provide new examples of integrable probabilistic models.</description>

      <title>The dark side of the universe may be more harmonic than we thought</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00536v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The standard paradigm of cosmology assumes two distinct dark components, namely the dark energy driving the late-universe acceleration and the dark matter that is responsible for the structure formation. However, the necessity of splitting the dark-side world into two sectors has not been experimentally or theoretically proven. It is shown in Wang et al. 2024 that cosmology with one unified dark fluid can also explain the cosmic microwave background (CMB) and late-universe data, with the fitting quality not much worse than the standard Lambda cold dark matter ($\Lambda$CDM) model. The present work aims to provide a clearer physical interpretation of the Wang et al. 2024 results. We show that the unified dark fluid model can produce primary CMB temperature and polarization power spectra that are very close to the $\Lambda$CDM prediction (relative difference $\lesssim 10^{-4}$). The model can also mimic the $\Lambda$CDM background expansion history and linear growth factor on sub-horizon scales with percent-level accuracy. With better physical understanding of the model, we make precision tests and find a minor error in the Boltzmann code used in Wang et al. 2024. We correct the error and update the model comparison between $\Lambda$CDM and the unified dark fluid model.</description>

      <title>A new perspective on modulus stabilization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10668v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the original Randall-Sundrum (RS) two-brane model, the radion potential was fine-tuned to zero, leaving the extra-dimensional modulus undetermined. Goldberger and Wise (GW) introduced a stabilization mechanism by incorporating a massive bulk scalar field, leading to a radion potential with a stable minimum. In this work, we examine the impact of the intrinsic stability of the GW scalar field on the modulus stabilization procedure. To elucidate this relationship, we test the stabilization scheme across several relevant scenarios using methods of singular perturbation theory. Our analysis consistently indicates a one-to-one correspondence between the stability of the GW scalar and successful modulus stabilization. Additionally, we highlight that certain classes of GW bulk potentials demonstrate such a correspondence explicitly, and provide checks which any GW bulk potential must satisfy in order to ensure modulus stabilization.</description>

      <title>Area spectrum and black hole thermodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12014v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The role of horizon area quantization on black hole thermodynamics is investigated in this article. The coefficient appearing in the quantization of area is fixed by an appeal to the saturated form of the Landauer's principle. Then by considering transition between discrete states of the event horizon area which in turn is equivalent to transitions between discrete mass states of the black hole, the change in the mass can be obtained. The change in mass is then equated to the product of the Hawking temperature and change in entropy of the black hole between two consecutive discrete states applying the first law of black hole thermodynamics. This gives the corrected Hawking temperature. In particular, we apply this technique to the Schwarzschild black hole, the quantum corrected Schwarzschild black hole, the Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m black hole which is a charged black hole, and the rotating Kerr black hole geometry, and obtain the corrected Hawking temperature in each of these cases. We then take a step forward by inserting this corrected Hawking temperature in the first law of black hole thermodynamics once again to calculate the entropy of the black hole in terms of the horizon area of the black hole. This leads to logarithmic and inverse corrections to the entropy of the black hole.</description>
