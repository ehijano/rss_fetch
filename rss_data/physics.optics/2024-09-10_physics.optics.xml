      <title>Inverse-designed dispersive time-modulated nanostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time-modulated nanostructures allow us to control the spatial and temporal properties of light. The temporal modulation of the nanostructures constitutes an additional degree of freedom to control their scattering properties on demand and in a reconfigurable manner. However, these additional parameters create a vast design space, raising challenges in identifying optimal designs. Therefore, tools from the field of photonic inverse design must be used to optimize the degrees of freedom of the system to facilitate predefined optical responses. To further develop this field, here we introduce a differentiable transition (T-) matrix-based inverse design framework for dispersive time-modulated nanostructures. The electron density of the material of the nanostructures is modulated non-adiabatically as a generic periodic function of time. Using the inverse design framework, the temporal shape of the electron density can be manipulated to reach the target functionality. Our computational framework is exploited, exemplarily, in two instances. First, the decay rate enhancement of oscillating dipoles near time-modulated spheres is controlled on demand. Second, using spatiotemporal metasurfaces, a system supporting asymmetric transmission of light at visible frequencies is designed. Our work paves the way toward programmable spatiotemporal metasurfaces and space-time crystals for a future generation of reconfigurable functional photonic devices.</description>

      <title>Orthonormalization of phase-only basis functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04565v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Orthonormal bases serve as a powerful mathematical tool in theoretical and experimental optics. However, producing arbitrary optical fields in real-world experiments is limited by the hardware, which in many cases involves a phase-only spatial light modulator. Since most basis functions also have a varying amplitude component, they cannot be represented truthfully. We present a general method to construct an orthonormal phase-only basis, optionally possessing desirable properties like smoothness and symmetry. We demonstrate the practical benefit of our approach in a wavefront shaping experiment, achieving a factor 1.5 increase in performance over a non-orthonormal phase only basis.</description>

      <title>Etching Properties of PIN-PMN-PT and its Integration in Electro-Optic Phase Modulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04586v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the etching characteristics of PIN-PMN-PT crystals, exploring various wet etching solutions, reactive ion etching gases, and ion beam etching. The etch rate and surface roughness are systematically measured for each method. A process flow to obtain PIN-PMN-PT thin films is described and performed to later build a single mode rib waveguide. An integrated electro-optic phase modulator is fabricated by depositing electrodes on the sides of the waveguides. The electro-optic coefficient implied in our phase modulators is the $r_{51}/r_{42}$. The performances are tested achieving a $V_\pi L$ of 19.2 V$\cdot$cm.</description>

      <title>10$^{-15}$-level laser stabilization down to fiber thermal noise limit using balanced photodetection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04681v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate a self-homodyne detection method to stabilize a continuous-wave 1550-nm laser to a 1-km optical fiber delay line, achieving a frequency instability of 6.3x10&lt;sup&gt;-15&lt;/sup&gt; at a 16-ms averaging time. This result, limited by fiber thermal noise, is achieved without the need for a vacuum system, highlighting the potential of our approach for ultra-stable laser systems in non-laboratory environments. The system utilizes only a few passive fiber optic components and a single balanced photodetector, significantly simplifying the laser stabilization process while maintaining high performance. The entire optical setup is compactly packaged in a portable metal air-tight enclosure.</description>

      <title>Chalcogenide Metasurfaces Enabling Ultra-Wideband Detectors from Visible to Mid-infrared</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04763v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermoelectric materials can be designed to support optical resonances across multiple spectral ranges to enable ultra-wide band photodetection. For instance, antimony telluride (Sb2Te3) chalcogenide exhibits interband plasmonic resonances in the visible range and Mie resonances in the mid-infrared (mid-IR) range, while simultaneously possessing large thermoelectric Seebeck coefficients. In this paper, we designed and fabricated Sb2Te3 metasurface devices to achieve resonant absorption for enabling photodetectors operating across an ultra-wideband spectrum, from visible to mid-IR. Furthermore, relying on asymmetric Sb2Te3 metasurface, we demonstrated the thermoelectric photodetectors with polarization-selectivity. This work provides a potential platform towards the portable ultrawide band spectrometers at room temperature, for environmental sensing applications.</description>

      <title>Characterization of resonator using confocal laser scanning microscopy and its application in air density sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04823v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the characterization of the photonic waveguide resonator using confocal laser scanning microscopy imaging method. Free space TEM$_{00}$ laser mode is coupled into quasi-TE$_{0}$ waveguide mode using confocal microscopy via a diffractive grating coupler and vice versa. Our work includes the design, fabrication, and experimental characterization of a silicon nitride racetrack-shaped resonator of length ~ 165 um. We illustrate clear evidence of resonance excitation from the confocal microscope image and demonstrate loaded Q-factor and finesse ~ 8.2 \pm 0.17 * 10^4 and ~ 180 \pm 3.5, respectively. We further demonstrate its one application in air density sensing by measuring the resonance wavelength shifts with variation in environment air pressure. Our work impacts spectroscopy, imaging, and sensing applications of single or ensemble atoms or molecules coupled to photonic devices. Additionally, our study highlights the potential of confocal microscopy for analyzing photonic components on large-scale integrated circuits, providing high-resolution imaging and spectral characterization.</description>

      <title>Differential Sensing Approaches for Scattering-Based Holographic Encryption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04969v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a new scattering-based framework for the holographic encryption of analog and digital signals. The proposed methodology, termed "differential sensing", involves encryption of a wavefield image by means of two hard-to-guess, complex and random scattering media, namely, a background and a total (background plus scatterer) medium. Unlike prior developments in this area, not one but two scattering media are adopted for scrambling of the probing wavefields (as encoded, e.g., in a suitable ciphertext hologram) and, consequently, this method offers enhanced security. In addition, while prior works have addressed methods based on physical imaging in the encryption phase followed by computational imaging in the decryption stage, we examine the complementary modality wherein encryption is done computationally while decryption is done analogically, i.e., via the materialization of the required physical imaging system comprising the ciphertext hologram and the two unique (background and total) media. The practical feasibility of the proposed differential sensing approach is examined with the help of computer simulations incorporating multiple scattering. The advantages of this method relative to the conventional single-medium approach are discussed for both analog and digital signals. The paper also develops algorithms for the required in situ holography as well as a new wavefield-nulling-based approach for scattering-based encryption with envisioned applications in real-time customer validation and secure communication.</description>

      <title>High-Transmission Mid-Infrared Bandpass Filters Using Hybrid Metal-Dielectric Metasurfaces for CO2 Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mid-infrared (MIR) spectroscopy is a powerful technique employed for a variety of applications, including gas sensing, industrial inspection, astronomy, surveillance, and imaging. Thin-film narrowband interference filters, targeted to specific absorption bands of target molecules, are commonly deployed for cost-effective MIR sensing systems. These devices require complex and time-consuming fabrication processes. Also, their customization on the micro-scale for emerging miniaturized applications is challenging. Plasmonic nanostructure arrays operating in reflection and transmission modes have been developed for MIR. However, they experience undesirable characteristics, such as broad spectra and low reflection/transmission efficiencies. All-dielectric metasurfaces have low intrinsic losses and have emerged as a substitute for plasmonic metasurfaces in MIR spectroscopy. Nevertheless, they typically operate only in reflection mode. In this work, we present a hybrid metal-dielectric metasurface for MIR spectroscopy operating in transmission mode. The metasurface is composed of germanium (Ge) atop aluminum (Al) cylinders, and we show that the transmission response arises because of the hybridization of modes arising from the Ge and the Al structures. The presented metasurface has a high transmission efficiency of 80 % at $\lambda = 2.6\ \mu\text{m}$, and a narrow full-width-at-half-maximum of $0.4\ \mu\text{m}$. We show numerical simulations, successful fabrication using a straightforward fabrication method, and deployment as the in-line optical filter in a CO$_2$ gas detection with a limit of detection of ~0.04% (a few hundred ppm). Our work demonstrates the potential for hybrid metasurfaces as in-line gas sensing optical filters in MIR spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>Giant enhancement of the transverse magneto-optical Kerr effect in etchless bismuth-substituted yttrium iron garnet empowered by quasi-bound states in the continuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Here, we propose an etchless bismuth-substituted yttrium iron garnet layer assisted by a one-dimensional resonant grating waveguide to enhance transverse magneto-optical Kerr effect (TMOKE) via the excitation of quasi-bound state in the continuum. The TMOKE amplitude can be tailored by manipulating the perturbation parameter, and it can reach as high as 1.978, approaching the theoretical maximum value of 2. Additionally, a single-mode temporal coupled-mode theory is employed to further reveal the underlying physical mechanism. It is found that TMOKE is strongly related to the line width of the quasi-BIC resonance and local field enhancement, which are pivotal factors in the design and optimization of photonic devices. As a potential application, we design and numerically demonstrate a refractive index sensor based on the resonantly enhanced TMOKE, with the optimal sensitivity of 110.66 nm/RIU and the corresponding maximum figure of merit of 299.3 RIU$^{-1}$. Our work provides a simple and efficient approach for enhancing TMOKE based on an easy-to-fabricate platform, laying the groundwork for exploring and developing magneto-optical devices such as sensors, magnetic storage devices, and nonreciprocal photonic devices.</description>

      <title>Photon Antibunching in Single-Molecule Vibrational Sum-Frequency Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sum-frequency generation (SFG) allows for coherent upconversion of an electromagnetic signal and has applications in mid-infrared vibrational spectroscopy of molecules. Recent experimental and theoretical studies have shown that plasmonic nanocavities, with their deep sub-wavelength mode volumes, may allow to obtain vibrational SFG signals from a single molecule. In this article, we compute the degree of second order coherence ($g^{(2)}(0)$) of the upconverted mid-infrared field under realistic parameters and accounting for the anharmonic potential that characterizes vibrational modes of individual molecules. On the one hand, we delineate the regime in which the device should operate in order to preserve the second-order coherence of the mid-infrared source, as required in quantum applications. On the other hand, we show that an anharmonic molecular potential can lead to antibunching of the upconverted photons under coherent, Poisson-distributed mid-infrared and visible drives. Our results therefore open a path toward a new kind of bright and tunable source of indistinguishable single photons by leveraging ``vibrational blockade'' in a resonantly and parametrically driven molecule, without the need for strong light-matter coupling.</description>

      <title>Single-distance nano-holotomography with coded apertures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-resolution phase-contrast 3D imaging using nano-holotomography typically requires collecting multiple tomograms at varying sample-to-detector distances, usually 3 to 4. This multi-distance approach significantly limits temporal resolution, making it impractical for operando studies. Moreover, shifting the sample complicates reconstruction, requiring precise alignment and interpolation to correct for shift-dependent magnification on the detector. In response, we propose and validate through simulations a novel single-distance approach that leverages coded apertures to structure beam illumination while the sample rotates. This approach is made possible by our proposed joint reconstruction scheme, which integrates coded phase retrieval with 3D tomography. This scheme ensures data consistency and achieves artifact-free reconstructions from a single distance.</description>

      <title>Preventing overfitting in infrared ellipsometry using temperature dependence: fused silica as a case study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05323v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dispersive linear optical properties of materials are frequently described using oscillator models, where the oscillators represent interactions between light and various material resonances (vibrational, free-carrier, interband, etc.). The state-of-the-art measurement of the complex refractive index is variable-angle spectroscopic ellipsometry (VASE), where additional measurement angles and the measured depolarization of light provides much more information compared to simpler measurements such as single-angle reflectance and transmittance. Nevertheless, even state-of-the-art VASE data can be hard to uniquely fit using oscillator models, and the resulting models may be hard to interpret physically. Here, we demonstrate the use of an additional degree of freedom, temperature, to improve the accuracy, uniqueness, and physicality of oscillator models of materials. Our approach relies on the well-understood temperature dependence of material resonances, and in particular vibrational resonances in amorphous SiO2, which are expected to change monotonically from room temperature to hundreds of degrees C. We performed VASE measurements at different temperatures, independently fitted the data at each temperature, and then confirmed that our models are unique and physical by monitoring the temperature dependence of the resulting fitting parameters. Using this technique, we generated highly accurate and precise data sets and material models describing the mid-infrared complex refractive index of three different grades of fused SiO2, which can then be used for modeling of mid-infrared optical components such as thermal emitters.</description>

      <title>Volumetric B1+ field homogenization in 7 Tesla brain MRI using metasurface scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultrahigh field magnetic resonance imaging (UHF MRI) has become an indispensable tool for human brain imaging, offering excellent diagnostic accuracy while avoiding the risks associated with invasive modalities. When the radiofrequency magnetic field of the UHF MRI encounters the multifaceted complexity of the brain, characterized by wavelength-scale, dissipative, and random heterogeneous materials, detrimental mesoscopic challenges such as B1+ field inhomogeneity and local heating arise. Here we develop the metasurface design inspired by scattering theory to achieve the volumetric field homogeneity in the UHF MRI. The method focuses on finding the scattering ansatz systematically and incorporates a pruning technique to achieve the minimum number of participating modes, which guarantees stable practical implementation. Using full-wave analysis of realistic human brain models under a 7 Tesla MRI, we demonstrate more than a twofold improvement in field homogeneity and suppressed local heating, achieving better performance than even the commercial 3 Tesla MRI. The result shows a noninvasive generalization of constant intensity waves in optics, offering a universal methodology applicable to higher Tesla MRI.</description>

      <title>On-Chip Parametric Synchronization of a Dissipative Kerr Soliton Microcomb</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Synchronization of oscillators is ubiquitous in nature. Often, the synchronized oscillators couple directly, yet in some cases synchronization can arise from their parametric interactions. Here, we theoretically predict and experimentally demonstrate the parametric synchronization of a dissipative Kerr soliton frequency comb. We specifically show that the parametric interaction between the soliton and two auxiliary lasers permits the entrainment of the frequency comb repetition rate. Besides representing the first prediction and demonstration of parametric synchronization of soliton frequency combs, our scheme offers significant flexibility for all-optical metrological-scale stabilization of the comb.</description>

      <title>Magnetic quadrupole dichroism in isotropic medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05411v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For an isotropic medium, a magnetic field applied in the Voigt geometry affects the optical properties in the second order only, so its effect is much weaker than in the Faraday geometry. In this work, we show that, under resonant excitation well beyond the linear regime, the situation changes drastically: A small magnetic linear anisotropy considerably increases, and an even stronger new quadrupole dichroism emerges. The latter manifests itself as 90{\deg}-periodic azimuthal dependence of transmission and anisotropic rotation of the probe polarization plane. These effects are described microscopically in a toy model and their symmetry analysis is presented. Both are observed experimentally on the D2 resonance of cesium vapor and agree with the theoretical predictions. The large magnitude of the quadrupole dichroism makes it promising for magnetometric applications and for studying the effects of anisotropic bleaching.</description>

      <title>Origin of nonlinear photocurrents in chiral multifold semimetal CoSi unveiled by terahertz emission spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05424v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spectroscopic identification of distinct nonlinear photocurrents unveils quantum geometric properties of electron wavefunctions and the momentum-space topological structures. This is especially interesting, but still puzzling, for chiral topological semimetals with possibilities of hosting giant quantized circular photogalvanic effect. Here we report a comprehensive terahertz (THz) emission spectroscopic analysis of nonlinear photoconductivity of chiral multifold CoSi at 0.26 ~ 1 eV. We find a large linear shift conductivity (17 {\mu}A/V2), and confirm a giant injection conductivity (167 {\mu}A/V2) as a consequence of strongly interfered non-quantized contributions from the vicinity of multifold nodes with opposite chiralities. The bulk injection current excited by the pump field with a complex wavevector is shown to carry both longitudinal and transverse components. Symmetry analyses further unveil weak nonlocal photon drag effect in addition to the photogalvanic effect. This work not only highlights chiral transition metal monosilicides for mid-infrared photovoltaic applications via various nonlinear optical channels, but also consolidates the THz spectroscopy for quantitative photovoltaic research.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05488v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonlinear disordered media uniquely combine multiple scattering and second-harmonic generation. Here, we investigate the statistical properties of the nonlinear light generated within such media. We report super-Rayleigh statistics of the second-harmonic speckle intensity, and demonstrate that it is caused by the mesoscopic correlations arising in extreme scattering conditions. The measured conductance is the lowest ever observed in an isotropically scattering 3D medium, with applications in broadband second-harmonic generation, wavefront shaping in nonlinear disordered media, and photonic computing.</description>

      <title>Room-temperature self-cavity lasing from organic color centers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05504v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Color centers, which are point defects in crystals, play a crucial role in altering the optical properties of their host materials, enabling widespread applications in the field of quantum information processing. While the majority of the state-of-the-art color centers are inorganic, they come with limitations such as the challenging material preparations and insufficient amount of available centers. In contrast, organic color centers have recently gained attention due to their ease of preparations and tailorable functionalities. Here, pentacene-doped p-terphenyl (Pc:Ptp), an organic color-center system normally used for microwave quantum electronics, is demonstrated for the first time its ability of self-cavity laser emission at room temperature. The laser emission is characterized by strong polarization and high anisotropy, attributed to the unique packing of the color-center molecules within the crystal. The optical coherence is found to be a figure of merit to distinguish the processes of the amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) and lasing in Pc:Ptp. This work highlights the potential of Pc:Ptp as a compact and efficient platform for light-matter interactions , offering significant promise for enhancing the performance of solid-state quantum devices based on this organic color-center system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05689v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The optical counterparts of skyrmions have recently been constructed with diverse topological types and by different degrees of freedom, such as field, spins, and Stokes vectors, exhibiting extensive potential in modern information science. However, there is currently no method capable of generating multiple types of optical skyrmions in free space. Here, we present a simple approach for realizing hybrid optical skyrmions of electric field vectors, spin angular momentum and Stokes vectors in a same structured light field. We show that a vector beam truncated by an annular aperture can form an electric field skyrmion in the diffracted light field. In the meantime, electric field meron pairs, spin skyrmions and Stokes skyrmions can be generated by tuning spin-orbital coupling of the incident light.</description>

      <title>Optical Spiking Neurons Enable High-Speed and Energy-Efficient Optical Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05726v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical neural networks (ONNs) perform extensive computations using photons instead of electrons, resulting in passively energy-efficient and low-latency computing. Among various ONNs, the diffractive optical neural networks (DONNs) particularly excel in energy efficiency, bandwidth, and parallelism, therefore attract considerable attention. However, their performance is limited by the inherent constraints of traditional frame-based sensors, which process and produce dense and redundant information at low operating frequency. Inspired by the spiking neurons in human neural system, which utilize a thresholding mechanism to transmit information sparsely and efficiently, we propose integrating a threshold-locking method into neuromorphic vision sensors to generate sparse and binary information, achieving microsecond-level accurate perception similar to human spiking neurons. By introducing novel Binary Dual Adaptive Training (BAT) and Optically Parallel Mixture of Experts (OPMoE) inference methods, the high-speed, spike-based diffractive optical neural network (S2NN) demonstrates an ultra-fast operating speed of 3649 FPS, which is 30 fold faster than that of reported DONNs, delivering a remarkable computational speed of 417.96 TOPS and a system energy efficiency of 12.6 TOPS/W. Our work demonstrates the potential of incorporating neuromorphic architecture to facilitate optical neural network applications in real-world scenarios for both low-level and high-level machine vision tasks.</description>

      <title>Structured Random Model for Fast and Robust Phase Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05734v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phase retrieval, a nonlinear problem prevalent in imaging applications, has been extensively studied using random models, some of which with i.i.d. sensing matrix components. While these models offer robust reconstruction guarantees, they are computationally expensive and impractical for real-world scenarios. In contrast, Fourier-based models, common in applications such as ptychography and coded diffraction imaging, are computationally more efficient but lack the theoretical guarantees of random models. Here, we introduce structured random models for phase retrieval that combine the efficiency of fast Fourier transforms with the versatility of random diagonal matrices. These models emulate i.i.d. random matrices at a fraction of the computational cost. Our approach demonstrates robust reconstructions comparable to fully random models using gradient descent and spectral methods. Furthermore, we establish that a minimum of two structured layers is necessary to achieve these structured-random properties. The proposed method is suitable for optical implementation and offers an efficient and robust alternative for phase retrieval in practical imaging applications.</description>

      <title>Chip-integrated extended-cavity mode-locked laser in the visible</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05756v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mode-locked lasers are of interest for applications such as biological imaging, non-linear frequency conversion, and single-photon generation. In the infrared, chip-integrated mode-locked lasers have been demonstrated through integration of laser diodes with low-loss photonic circuits. However additional challenges, such as a higher propagation loss and smaller alignment tolerances have prevented the realization of such lasers in the visible range. Here, we demonstrate the first chip-integrated mode-locked diode laser in the visible using an integrated photonic circuit for cavity extension. Based on a gallium arsenide gain chip and a low-loss silicon nitride feedback circuit, the laser is passively mode-locked using a saturable absorber implemented by focused ion beam milling. At a center wavelength of 642 nm, the laser shows an average output power of 3.4 mW, with a spectral bandwidth of 1.5 nm at a repetition rate of 7.84 GHz.</description>

      <title>A Flexible Framework for Universal Computational Aberration Correction via Automatic Lens Library Generation and Domain Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05809v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Emerging universal Computational Aberration Correction (CAC) paradigms provide an inspiring solution to light-weight and high-quality imaging without repeated data preparation and model training to accommodate new lens designs. However, the training databases in these approaches, i.e., the lens libraries (LensLibs), suffer from their limited coverage of real-world aberration behaviors. In this work, we set up an OmniLens framework for universal CAC, considering both the generalization ability and flexibility. OmniLens extends the idea of universal CAC to a broader concept, where a base model is trained for three cases, including zero-shot CAC with the pre-trained model, few-shot CAC with a little lens-specific data for fine-tuning, and domain adaptive CAC using domain adaptation for lens-descriptions-unknown lens. In terms of OmniLens's data foundation, we first propose an Evolution-based Automatic Optical Design (EAOD) pipeline to construct LensLib automatically, coined AODLib, whose diversity is enriched by an evolution framework, with comprehensive constraints and a hybrid optimization strategy for achieving realistic aberration behaviors. For network design, we introduce the guidance of high-quality codebook priors to facilitate zero-shot CAC and few-shot CAC, which enhances the model's generalization ability, while also boosting its convergence in a few-shot case. Furthermore, based on the statistical observation of dark channel priors in optical degradation, we design an unsupervised regularization term to adapt the base model to the target descriptions-unknown lens using its aberration images without ground truth. We validate OmniLens on 4 manually designed low-end lenses with various structures and aberration behaviors. Remarkably, the base model trained on AODLib exhibits strong generalization capabilities, achieving 97% of the lens-specific performance in a zero-shot setting.</description>

      <title>Quantum Pair Generation in Nonlinear Metasurfaces with Mixed and Pure Photon Polarizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04569v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Metasurfaces are highly effective at manipulating classical light in the linear regime; however, effectively controlling the polarization of non-classical light generated from nonlinear resonant metasurfaces remains a challenge. Here, we present a solution by achieving polarization engineering of frequency-nondegenerate biphotons emitted via spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) in GaAs metasurfaces, where quasi-bound states in the continuum (qBIC) resonances were utilized for boosting the biphoton generation. By performing a comprehensive polarization tomography, we demonstrate that the polarization of the emitted photons directly reflects the qBIC mode's far-field properties. Furthermore, we show that both the type of qBIC mode and the symmetry of the meta-atoms can be tailored to control each single-photon polarization state, and that the subsequent two-photon polarization states are nearly separable, offering potential applications in the heralded generation of single photons with adjustable polarization. This work provides a significant step towards utilizing metasurfaces to not only generate quantum light but also engineer their polarization, a critical aspect for future quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Strain in 2D TMDCs induced by metal-assisted exfoliation from the polyvinilalcohol-covered substrate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05008v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have modified the metal-assisted transfer technique to obtain large-area few-layer flakes from transition metal dichalcogenides bulk crystals by introducing an initial stage - exfoliation of the bulk crystal onto an intermediate substrate, specifically a silicon wafer coated with polyvinyl alcohol. Following this, we thermally evaporate silver onto the sample and transfer the top layers of the crystal along with the silver layer to the target substrate. This technique allows the production of visually non-corrugated single- and few-layer flakes with high yield. A direct comparison of the micro-Raman and micro-photoluminescence spectra of flakes exfoliated using our method with the spectra of those exfoliated from scotch tape reveals differences in their properties. We identify signatures of deformations in the flakes exfoliated from the intermediate substrate, indicating the presence of static friction between the substrate and the flake. Our findings thus suggest a novel method to induce intrinsic deformation in 2D materials.</description>

      <title>Modeling of the micro-focused Brillouin light scattering spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05141v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although micro-focused Brillouin light scattering (BLS) has been used for more than twenty years, it lacks a complete theoretical description. This complicates the analysis of experimental data and significantly limits the information that can be obtained. To fill this knowledge gap, we have developed a semi-analytical model based on the mesoscopic continuous medium approach. The model consists of the following steps: calculation of the incident electric field and the dynamic susceptibility, calculation of the induced polarisation, and calculation of the emitted electric field and its propagation towards the detector. We demonstrate the model on the examples of the measurements of thermal and coherently excited spin waves. However, the used approach is general and can describe any micro-focused Brillouin light scattering experiment. The model can also bring new analytical approaches to mechanobiology experiments or to characterization of acoustic wave based devices.</description>

      <title>Testing the tomographic Fermi liquid hypothesis with high-order cyclotron resonance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05147v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent theoretical studies of carrier-carrier scattering in degenerate two-dimensional systems have revealed radically different relaxation times for odd and even angular harmonics of distribution function. This theoretical concept, dubbed as 'tomographic Fermi liquid', is yet challenging to test with dc electrical measurements as electron scattering weakly affects the electrical resistivity. Here, we show that linewidth and amplitude of electromagnetic absorption at the multiple harmonics of the cyclotron resonance carries all necessary information to test the tomographic Fermi liquid hypothesis. Namely, the height and inverse width of $m$-th order cyclotron resonance ($m \ge 2$) is proportional to the lifetime of $m$-th angular harmonic of electron distribution function $\tau_m$, if probed at wavelengths exceeding the cyclotron radius $R_c$. Measurements of high-order cyclotron resonance at short wavelengths order of $R_c$ also enable a direct determination of all lifetimes $\tau_m$ from a simple linear system of equations that we hereby derive. Extraction of cyclotron resonance lifetimes from an experiment on terahertz photoconductivity in graphene shows that third-order resonance is systematically narrower than second-order one, supporting the prediction of tomographic Fermi liquid hypothesis.</description>

      <title>Image color consistency in datasets: the Smooth-TPS3D method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05159v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Image color consistency is the key problem in digital imaging consistency when creating datasets. Here, we propose an improved 3D Thin-Plate Splines (TPS3D) color correction method to be used, in conjunction with color charts (i.e. Macbeth ColorChecker) or other machine-readable patterns, to achieve image consistency by post-processing. Also, we benchmark our method against its former implementation and the alternative methods reported to date with an augmented dataset based on the Gehler's ColorChecker dataset. Benchmark includes how corrected images resemble the ground-truth images and how fast these implementations are. Results demonstrate that the TPS3D is the best candidate to achieve image consistency. Furthermore, our Smooth-TPS3D method shows equivalent results compared to the original method and reduced the 11-15% of ill-conditioned scenarios which the previous method failed to less than 1%. Moreover, we demonstrate that the Smooth-TPS method is 20% faster than the original method. Finally, we discuss how different methods offer different compromises between quality, correction accuracy and computational load.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05332v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A surprising result from the theory of quantum control is the degree to which the properties of a physical system can be manipulated. Both atomic and many-body solid state models admit the possibility of creating a 'driven imposter', in which the optical response of one material mimics that of a dynamically distinct system. Here we apply these techniques to polarons in polar liquids. Such quasiparticles describe solvated electrons interacting with many-body degrees of freedom of their environment. The polaron frequency, which depends on the electron concentration in the liquid, is controlled with a pump field, rendering the polaron frequency of three different liquids identical. The experiments demonstrate the feasibility of 'polar impostorons', a so far purely theoretical phenomenon.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05419v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-classical light sources emitting bundles of N-photons with strong correlation represent versatile resources of interdisciplinary importance with applications ranging from fundamental tests of quantum mechanics to quantum information processing. Yet, high-order correlations, gN(0),quantifying photon correlation, are still limited to hundreds. Here, we report the generation of a super-bunching light source in photonic crystal fiber with g2(0) reaching 5.86*104 and g5(0) up to 2.72*108, through measuring its photon number probability distributions. under giant g2(0) values, the super-bunching light source presents upturned-tail photon distributions and ubiquitous extreme multi-photon events, where 31 photons from a single light pulse at a mean of 1.99*10-4 photons per pulse have been determined. The probability of this extreme event has been enhanced by 10139 folds compared to a coherent laser with Poissonian distribution. By varying the power of the pumping laser, both photon number distributions and corresponding high-order correlations of this light source can be substantially tailored from Poissonian to super-bunching distributions. These phenomena are attributed to the synchronized nonlinear interactions in photonic crystal fibers pumping by bright squeezed light, and the theoretical simulations agree well with the experimental results. Our research showcases the ability to achieve non-classical light sources with giant high-order correlations and extreme multi-photon events, paving the way for high-order correlation imaging, extreme nonlinear optical effects, quantum information processing, and exploring light-matter interactions with multi-photon physics.</description>

      <title>A framework to compute resonances arising from multiple scattering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05563v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Numerous natural and technological phenomena are governed by resonances. In nanophotonics, resonances often result from the interaction of several optical elements. Controlling these resonances is an excellent opportunity to provide light with properties on demand for applications ranging from sensing to quantum technologies. The inverse design of large, distributed resonators, however, is typically challenged by high computational costs when discretizing the entire system in space. Here, this limitation is overcome by harnessing prior knowledge about the individual scatterers that form the resonator and their interaction. In particular, a transition matrix multi-scattering framework is coupled with the state-of-the-art adaptive Antoulas-Anderson (AAA) algorithm to identify complex poles of the optical response function. A sample refinement strategy suitable for accurately locating a large number of poles is introduced. We tie the AAA algorithm into an automatic differentiation framework to efficiently differentiate multi-scattering resonance calculations. The resulting resonance solver allows for efficient gradient-based optimization, demonstrated here by the inverse design of an integrated exciton-polariton cavity. This contribution serves as an important step towards efficient resonance calculations in a variety of multi-scattering scenarios, such as inclusions in stratified media, periodic lattices, and scatterers with arbitrary shapes.</description>

      <title>Ramsey-Borde Atom Interferometry with a Thermal Strontium Beam for a Compact Optical Clock</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05581v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Compact optical atomic clocks have become increasingly important in field applications and clock networks. Systems based on Ramsey-Borde interferometry (RBI) with a thermal atomic beam seem promising to fill a technology gap in optical atomic clocks, as they offer higher stability than optical vapour cell clocks while being less complex than cold atomic clocks. Here, we demonstrate RBI with strontium atoms, utilizing the narrow 1S0 -&gt; 3P1 intercombination line at 689 nm, yielding a 60 kHz broad spectral feature. The obtained Ramsey fringes for varying laser power are analyzed and compared with a numerical model. The 1S0 -&gt; 1P1 transition at 461 nm is used for fluorescence detection. Analyzing the slope of the RBI signal and the fluorescence detection noise yields an estimated short-term stability of 4x10-14 / sqrt{tau}. We present our experimental setup in detail, including the atomic beam source, frequency-modulation spectroscopy to lock the 461 nm laser, laser power stabilization and the high-finesse cavity pre-stabilization of the 689 nm laser. Our system serves as a ground testbed for future clock systems in mobile and space applications.</description>

      <title>Real-time optical gas sensing with two-dimensional materials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05693v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) are highly appealing for gas sensors, lab-on-a-chip devices and bio-sensing applications because of their strong light-matter interaction and high surface-to-volume ratio. The ability to grow these van der Waals materials on different substrates and waveguide geometries opens a horizon toward scalable on-chip photonic nanodevices. Here, we report on a versatile technique for real time remote optical gas sensing using two-dimensional TMDs. The adsorption of the gas molecules on the monolayer surface provides a gateway for gas sensing based on charge-transfer-induced photoluminescence variation. For gases that are weakly adsorbed on the surface of monolayer TMDs, purging the monolayers' surface by an inert gas like N2 can desorb gases from the monolayers at room temperature. We demonstrate CO, NO and NO2 detection by monitoring photoluminescence from semiconducting MoS2 monolayers grown on SiO2/Si chips at a level of 10 ppm with fast response time. Observations are supported by our density functional theory calculations, which predict a significant interaction between these gases and MoS2 monolayers. These findings may lead to advances in remote sensing, surface-sensitive bioanalytics and lab-on-a-chip sensors.</description>

      <title>A broadband hyperspectral image sensor with high spatio-temporal resolution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.11583v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hyperspectral imaging provides high-dimensional spatial-temporal-spectral information revealing intrinsic matter characteristics. Here we report an on-chip computational hyperspectral imaging framework with high spatial and temporal resolution. By integrating different broadband modulation materials on the image sensor chip, the target spectral information is non-uniformly and intrinsically coupled on each pixel with high light throughput. Using intelligent reconstruction algorithms, multi-channel images can be recovered from each frame, realizing real-time hyperspectral imaging. Following such a framework, we for the first time fabricated a broadband VIS-NIR (400-1700 nm) hyperspectral imaging sensor using photolithography, with an average light throughput of 74.8% and 96 wavelength channels. The demonstrated resolution is 1,024*1,024 pixels at 124 fps. We demonstrated its wide applications including chlorophyll and sugar quantification for intelligent agriculture, blood oxygen and water quality monitoring for human health, textile classification and apple bruise detection for industrial automation, and remote lunar detection for astronomy. The integrated hyperspectral image sensor weighs only tens of grams, and can be assembled on various resource-limited platforms or equipped with off-the-shelf optical systems. The technique transforms the challenge of high-dimensional imaging from a high-cost manufacturing and cumbersome system to one that is solvable through on-chip compression and agile computation.</description>

      <title>Individual Nanostructures in an Epsilon-Near-Zero Material Probed with 3D-Sculpted Light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.15942v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Epsilon-near-zero (ENZ) materials, i.e., materials with a vanishing real part of the permittivity, have become an increasingly desirable platform for exploring linear and nonlinear optical phenomena in nanophotonic and on-chip environments. ENZ materials inherently enhance electric fields for properly chosen interaction scenarios, host extreme nonlinear optical effects, and lead to other intriguing phenomena. To date, studies in the optical domain have mainly focused on nanoscopically thin films of ENZ materials and their interaction with light and other nanostructured materials. Here, we experimentally and numerically explore the optical response of individual nanostructures milled into an ENZ material. For the study, we employ 3D structured light beams, allowing us to fully control polarization-dependent field enhancements enabled by a tailored illumination and a vanishing permittivity. Our studies provide insight between complex near-fields and the ENZ regime while showcasing the polarization-dependent controllability they feature. Such effects can form the basis for experimental realizations of extremely localized polarization-controlled refractive index changes, which can ultimately enable ultrafast switching processes at the level of individual nanostructures.</description>

      <title>Erratum and Addendum to `Exact Maxwell evolution equation of resonator dynamics: temporal coupled-mode theory revisited'</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00455v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a recent publication [Opt. Express \textbf{32}, 20904 (2024)], the accuracy of the main evolution equation that governs resonator dynamics in the coupled-mode theory (CMT) was questioned. Specifically, the study concluded that the driving force is proportional to the temporal derivative of the excitation field rather than the excitation field itself. This conclusion was reached with a derivation of an "exact" Maxwell evolution (EME) equation obtained directly from Maxwell's equations and was supported by comprehensive numerical tests. However, we find that the original derivation lacks mathematical rigor. In this work, we provide a direct and rigorous derivation. Besides offering a solid mathematical foundation for the EME equation, the new derivation elucidates the origin of the temporal derivative in the excitation term of CMT and clarifies the approximations in the classical CMT evolution equation using simple and general arguments.</description>

      <title>Second-order nonlocal shifts of scattered wave-packets: What can be measured by Goos-H\"anchen and Imbert-Fedorov effects ?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00375v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The scattering of wavepackets with arbitrary energy dispersion on surfaces has been analyzed. Expanding up to second order in scattering shifts, it is found that besides the known Goos-H\"anchen or Imbert-Fedorov spatial offset, as well as the Wigner delay time, new momentum and frequency shifts appear. Furthermore, the width of the scattered wave packet becomes modified as well, which can lead to a shrinking of pulses by multiple scattering. For a model of dielectric material characterized by a longitudinal and transverse dielectric function the shifts are calculated analytically. From the Goos-H\"anchen and Imbert-Fedorov shifts one can access the longitudinal and transversal dielectric function. Perfectly aligned crystal symmetry axes with respect to scattering beam shows no Imbert-Fedorov effect. It is found that the Goos-H\"anchen and Imbert-Fedorov effect are absent for homogeneous materials. Oppositely it is found that the Wigner delay time and the shrinking of the temporal pulse width allows to access the dielectric function independent on the beam geometry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16678v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an all-digital method for stabilising the phase biases in an electro-optic I/Q modulator for carrier-suppressed single-sideband modulation. Building on the method presented in S. Wald \ea, Appl. Opt. \textbf{62}, 1-7 (2023), we use the Red Pitaya STEMlab 125-14 platform to digitally generate and demodulate an auxiliary radio-frequency tone whose beat with the optical carrier probes the I/Q modulator's phase imbalances. We implement a multiple-input, multiple-output integral feedback controller which accounts for unavoidable cross-couplings in the phase biases to lock the error signals at exactly zero where optical power fluctuations have no impact on phase stability. We demonstrate $&gt;23\,\rm dB$ suppression of the optical carrier relative to the desired sideband at $+3.4\,\rm GHz$ over a period of $15$ hours and over temperature variations of $20^\circ\rm C$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.11105v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The non-Hermitian skin effect refers to the accumulation of eigenstates near the boundary in open boundary lattice models, which can be systematically characterized using the non-Bloch band theory. Here, we apply the non-Bloch band theory to investigate the stochastic reaction-diffusion process by mapping it to a non-Hermitian Kitaev chain. We exactly obtain the open boundary spectrum and the generalized Brillouin zone, and identify a robust zero mode arising from the non-Bloch topology. Notably, distinct from its Hermitian counterpart in the quantum context, the zero mode supports anomalous dynamical crossover in the Markov process. We quantitatively demonstrate the intriguing dynamical effects through the spectral decomposition of the Hamiltonian on the non-Bloch eigenstates, and confirm our findings by conducting stochastic simulations with high accuracy. Our study highlights the significant and general role of non-Bloch topology in non-equilibrium dynamics.</description>

      <title>Telling different unravelings apart via nonlinear quantum-trajectory averages</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.03452v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan-Lindblad master equation (ME) governs the density matrix of open quantum systems (OQSs). When an OQS is subjected to weak continuous measurement, its state evolves as a stochastic quantum trajectory, whose statistical average solves the ME. The ensemble of such trajectories is termed an unraveling of the ME. We propose a method to operationally distinguish unravelings produced by the same ME in different measurement scenarios, using nonlinear averages of observables over trajectories. We apply the method to the paradigmatic quantum nonlinear system of resonance fluorescence in a two-level atom. We compare the Poisson-type unraveling, induced by direct detection of photons scattered from the two-level emitter, and the Wiener-type unraveling, induced by phase-sensitive detection of the emitted field. We show that a quantum-trajectory-averaged variance is able to distinguish these measurement scenarios. We evaluate the performance of the method, which can be readily extended to more complex OQSs, under a range of realistic experimental conditions.</description>

Abstract: We consider a one-dimensional membrane-in-the-middle model for a cavity that consists of two fixed, perfect mirrors and a mobile dielectric membrane between them that has a constant electric susceptibility. We present a sequence of exact cavity angular frequencies that we call structural angular frequencies and that have the remarkable property that they are independent of the position of the membrane inside the cavity. Furthermore, the case of a thin membrane is considered and simple, approximate formulae for the angular frequencies and for the modes of the cavity are obtained. Finally, the cavity electromagnetic potential is numerically calculated and it is found that the potential is accurately described by a multiple scales solution.</description>

      <title>Frequency ratio of the $^{229\mathrm{m}}$Th nuclear isomeric transition and the $^{87}$Sr atomic clock</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.18719v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Optical atomic clocks$^{1,2}$ use electronic energy levels to precisely keep track of time. A clock based on nuclear energy levels promises a next-generation platform for precision metrology and fundamental physics studies. Thorium-229 nuclei exhibit a uniquely low energy nuclear transition within reach of state-of-the-art vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) laser light sources and have therefore been proposed for construction of the first nuclear clock$^{3,4}$. However, quantum state-resolved spectroscopy of the $^{229m}$Th isomer to determine the underlying nuclear structure and establish a direct frequency connection with existing atomic clocks has yet to be performed. Here, we use a VUV frequency comb to directly excite the narrow $^{229}$Th nuclear clock transition in a solid-state CaF$_2$ host material and determine the absolute transition frequency. We stabilize the fundamental frequency comb to the JILA $^{87}$Sr clock$^2$ and coherently upconvert the fundamental to its 7th harmonic in the VUV range using a femtosecond enhancement cavity. This VUV comb establishes a frequency link between nuclear and electronic energy levels and allows us to directly measure the frequency ratio of the $^{229}$Th nuclear clock transition and the $^{87}$Sr atomic clock. We also precisely measure the nuclear quadrupole splittings and extract intrinsic properties of the isomer. These results mark the start of nuclear-based solid-state optical clock and demonstrate the first comparison of nuclear and atomic clocks for fundamental physics studies. This work represents a confluence of precision metrology, ultrafast strong field physics, nuclear physics, and fundamental physics.</description>
