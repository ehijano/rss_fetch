      <title>Constraint maps: singularities vs free boundaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21128v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Energy-minimizing constraint maps are a natural extension of the obstacle problem within a vectorial framework. Due to inherent topological constraints, these maps manifest a diverse structure that includes singularities similar to harmonic maps, branch points reminiscent of minimal surfaces, and the intricate free-boundary behavior of the obstacle problem. The complexity of these maps poses significant challenges to their analysis.
  In this paper, we first focus on constraint maps with uniformly convex obstacles and establish continuity (and therefore higher-order regularity) within a uniform neighborhood of the free boundary. More precisely, thanks to a new quantitative unique continuation principle near singularities (which is new even in the setting of classical harmonic maps), we prove that, in the uniformly convex setting, topological singularities can only lie in the interior of the contact set. We then establish the optimality of this result.
  Second, while exploring the structure of the free boundary, we investigate the presence of branch points and show how they lead to completely new types of singularities not present in the scalar case.</description>

      <title>A mutual control problem for semilinear system via fixed point approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21131v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce and discuss the concept of a mutual control problem. Our analysis relies on a vector fixed-point approach based on the fixed-point theorems of Perov, Schauder, Leray-Schauder, and Avramescu. Additionally, for a related semi-observability problem, we employ a novel technique utilizing Bielecki equivalent norms.</description>

      <title>Feedback stabilization for entropy solutions of a 2x2 hyperbolic system of conservation laws at a junction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21137v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the p-system in Eulerian coordinates on a star-shaped network. Under suitable transmission conditions at the junction and dissipative boundary conditions in the exterior vertices, we show that the entropy solutions of the system are exponentially stabilizable. Our proof extends the strategy by Coron et al. (2017) and is based on a front-tracking algorithm used to construct approximate piecewise constant solutions whose BV norms are controlled through a suitable exponentially-weighted Glimm-type Lyapunov functional.</description>

      <title>Regularization by noise for the inviscid primitive equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The deterministic inviscid primitive equations (also called the hydrostatic Euler equations) are known to be ill-posed in Sobolev spaces and in Gevrey classes of order strictly greater than 1, and some of their analytic solutions exist only locally in time and exhibit finite-time blowup. This work demonstrates that introducing suitable random noise can restore the local well-posedness and prevent finite-time blowups. Specifically, random diffusion addresses the ill-posedness in certain Gevrey classes, allowing us to establish the local well-posedness almost surely and the global existence of solutions with high probability. In the case of random damping (linear multiplicative noise), the noise prevents analytic solutions from forming singularities in finite time, resulting in globally existing solutions with high probability.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.21354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that the first (nontrivial) Dirichlet eigenvalue of the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck operator $$ L(u)=\Delta u-\langle\nabla u,x\rangle\,, $$ as a function of the domain, is convex with respect to the Minkowski addition, and we characterize the equality cases in some classes of convex sets. We also prove that the corresponding (positive) eigenfunction is log-concave if the domain is convex.</description>

      <title>Interaction between long internal waves and free surface waves in deep water</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a density-stratified fluid composed of two immiscible layers separated by a sharp interface. We study the regime of long internal waves interacting with modulated surface wave packets and describe their resonant interaction by a system of equations where the internal wave solves a high-order Benjamin-Ono (BO) equation coupled to a linear Schr\"{o}dinger equation for the envelope of the free surface. The perturbation methods are based on the Hamiltonian formulation for the original system of irrotational Euler's equations as described in Benjamin-Bridges [J. Fluid Mech. 333, 1997] and Craig-Guyenne-Kalisch [Comm. Pure Appl. Math. 58, 2005]. We also establish a local wellposedness result for a reduced BO-Schr\"{o}dinger system using an approach developed by Linares-Ponce-Pilod [J. Diff. Eqs. 250, 2011].</description>

      <title>A diffuse-interface Landau-de Gennes model for free-boundary nematic liquid crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21437v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a diffuse-interface Landau-de Gennes free energy for free-boundary nematic liquid crystals (NLC) in three dimensions submerged in isotropic liquid, where a phase field is introduced to model the deformable interface. The energy we propose consists of the original Landau-de Gennes free energy, three penalty terms and a volume constraint. We prove the existence and regularity of minimizers to the diffuse-interface energy functional. We also prove a uniform maximum principle of the minimizer under appropriate assumptions, together with a uniqueness result for small domains. Then, we establish a sharp-interface limit where minimizers of the diffuse-interface energy converge to a minimizer of a sharp-interface energy under the framework of $\Gamma$-convergence. Finally, we conduct numerical experiments with the diffuse-interface model, the findings of which are compared with existing works.</description>

      <title>A Harnack type inequality for singular Liouville type equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21499v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We obtain a Harnack type inequality for solutions of the Liouville type equation, \begin{equation}\nonumber
  -\Delta u=|x|^{2\alpha}K(x)e^{\displaystyle u} \qquad\text{in} \,\,\, \Omega, \end{equation} where $\alpha\in(-1,0)$, $\Omega$ is a bounded domain in $\mathbb{R}^2$ and $K$ satisfies, \begin{equation}\nonumber
  0&lt;a\leq K(x)\leq b&lt;+\infty. \end{equation} This is a generalization to the singular case of a result by C.C. Chen and C.S. Lin [Comm. An. Geom. 1998], which considered the regular case $\alpha=0$. Part of the argument of Chen-Lin can be adapted to the singular case by means of an isoperimetric inequality for surfaces with conical singularities. However, the case $\alpha\in(-1,0)$ turns out to be more delicate, due to the lack of traslation invariance of the singular problem, which requires a different approach.</description>

      <title>Long-time Asymptotics for the Ablowitz-Ladik system with present of solitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we investigate some problems about the initial-value problem of the focusing Ablowitz-Ladik system, and the initial data belongs to a discrete weighted $\ell^2$ space. On the one hand, we have proved the global well-posedness for the initial-value problem. Utilizing the fact that the initial data belongs to the discrete weighted $\ell^2$ space, we construct a Riemann-Hilbert problem for the initial-value problem. By Fredholm theory, the Riemann-Hilbert problem is uniquely solved with the jump contour consisting of three circles that all center around the origin. On the other hand, based on the global well-posedness and the Riemann-Hilbert problem, we allow the solution to have the higher-order solitons, and then analyze the long-time asymptotics for the solution in different sectors on the upper-half plane.</description>

      <title>Infinitesimal behavior of Quadratically Regularized Optimal Transport and its relation with the Porous Medium Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quadratically regularized optimal transport problem has recently been considered in various applications where the coupling needs to be \emph{sparse}, i.e., the density of the coupling needs to be zero for a large subset of the product of the supports of the marginals. However, unlike the acclaimed entropy-regularized optimal transport, the effect of quadratic regularization on the transport problem is not well understood from a mathematical standpoint. In this work, we take a first step towards its understanding. We prove that the difference between the cost of optimal transport and its regularized version multiplied by the ratio $\varepsilon^{-\frac{2}{d+2}}$ converges to a nontrivial limit as the regularization parameter $\varepsilon$ tends to 0. The proof confirms a conjecture from Zhang et al. (2023) where it is claimed that a modification of the self-similar solution of the porous medium equation, the Barenblatt--Pattle solution, can be used as an approximate solution of the regularized transport cost for small values of $\varepsilon$.</description>

      <title>Elastic bodies with kinematic constraints on many small regions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21541v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the equilibrium of hyperelastic solids subjected to kinematic constraints on many small regions, which we call perforations.
  Such constraints on the displacement $u$ are given in the quite general form $u(x) \in F_x$, where $F_x$ is a closed set, and thus comprise confinement conditions, unilateral constraints, controlled displacement conditions, etc., both in the bulk and on the boundary of the body. The regions in which such conditions are active are assumed to be so small that they do not produce an overall rigid constraint, but still large enough so as to produce a non-trivial effect on the behaviour of the body. Mathematically, this is translated in an asymptotic analysis by introducing two small parameters: $\varepsilon$, describing the distance between the elements of the perforation, and $\delta$, the size of the element of the perforation. We find the critical scale at which the effect of the perforation is non-trivial and express it in terms of a $\Gamma$-limit in which the constraints are relaxed so that, in their place, a penalization term appears in the form of an integral of a function $\varphi(x,u)$. This function is determined by a blow-up procedure close to the perforation and depends on the shape of the perforation, the constraint $F_x$, and the asymptotic behaviour at infinity of the strain energy density $\sigma$. We give a concise proof of the mathematical result and numerical studies for some simple yet meaningful geometries.</description>

      <title>Spreading properties of the Fisher--KPP equation when the intrinsic growth rate is maximal in a moving patch of bounded size</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with spreading properties of space-time heterogeneous Fisher--KPP equations in one space dimension. We focus on the case of everywhere favorable environment with three different zones, a left half-line with slow or intermediate growth, a central patch with fast growth and a right half-line with slow or intermediate growth. The central patch moves at various speeds. The behavior of the front changes drastically depending on the speed of the central patch. Among other things, intriguing phenomena such as nonlocal pulling and locking may occur, which would make the behavior of the front further complicated. The problem we discuss here is closely related to questions in biomathematical modelling. By considering several special cases, we illustrate the remarkable diversity of possible behaviors. In particular, the case of a central patch with constant size and constant speed is entirely settled.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.21555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the recently proven presence of ultrametricity in physical models (certain spin glasses) and the very recent study of Turing patterns on locally ultrametric state spaces, first non-autonomous diffusion operators on such spaces, where finitely many compact p-adic spaces are joined by a graph structure, are studied, including their Dirichlet and van Neumann eigenvalues. Secondly, the Cauchy problem for the heat equation associated with these operators is solved, its solution approximated by Trotter products, and thirdly, the corresponding Feller property as well as the Markov property (a Hunt process) is established.</description>

      <title>Determination of time dependent source terms for Stokes systems in unbounded domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21589v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article is devoted to the analysis of inverse source problems for Stokes systems in unbounded domains where the corresponding velocity flow is observed on a surface. Our main objective is to study the unique determination of general class of time-dependent and vector-valued source terms with potentially unknown divergence. Taking into account the challenges inherent in this class of inverse source problems, we aim to identify the most precise conditions that ensure their resolution. Motivated by various fluid motion problems, we explore several class of boundary measurements. Our proofs are based on different arguments, including unique continuation properties for Stokes systems, approximate controllability, complex analysis, and the application of explicit harmonic functions and explicit solutions for Stokes systems. This analysis is complemented by a reconstruction algorithm and examples of numerical computations.</description>

      <title>Integrating the probe and singular sources methods: III. Mixed obstacle case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21612v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The main purpose of this paper is to develop further the integrated theory of the probe and singular sources methods (IPS) which may work for a group of inverse obstacle problems. Here as a representative and typical member of the group, an inverse obstacle problem governed by the Helmholtz equation with a fixed wave number in a bounded domain is considered. It is assumed that the solutions of the Helmholtz equation outside the set of unknown obstacles satisfy the homogeneous Dirichlet or Neumann boundary conditions on each surface of obstacles. This is the case when two extreme types of obstacles are embedded in a medium. By considering this case, not only a concise technique for IPS is introduced but also a general correspondence principle from IPS to the probe method is suggested. Besides, as a corollary it is shown that the probe method together with the singular sources method reformulated in terms of the probe method has the Side B under a smallness conditions on the wave number $k$, which is the blowing up property of a sequence computed from the associated Dirichlet-to-Neumann map.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.21677v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently it has been shown that the unique locally perimeter minimizing partitioning of the plane into three regions, where one region has finite area and the other two have infinite measure, is given by the so-called standard lens partition. Here we prove a sharp stability inequality for the standard lens; hence strengthening the local minimality of the lens partition in a quantitative form. As an application of this stability result we consider a nonlocal perturbation of an isoperimetric problem.</description>

In fact, in our case studies, we find a quasiconformal mapping that relates the elliptic measure in a domain to the harmonic measure in its image domain, and we deduce bounds for the Hausdorff dimension of the elliptic measure by the known results on the harmonic side.</description>

      <title>On the mean-field limit of the Cucker-Smale model with Random Batch Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21297v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we focus on the mean-field limit of the Random Batch Method (RBM) for the Cucker-Smale model. Different from the classical mean-field limit analysis, the chaos in this model is imposed at discrete time and is propagated to discrete time flux. We approach separately the limits of the number of particles $N\to\infty$ and the discrete time interval $\tau\to 0$ with respect to the RBM, by using the flocking property of the Cucker-Smale model and the observation in combinatorics. The Wasserstein distance is used to quantify the difference between the approximation limit and the original mean-field limit. Also, we combine the RBM with generalized Polynomial Chaos (gPC) expansion and proposed the RBM-gPC method to approximate stochastic mean-field equations, which conserves positivity and momentum of the mean-field limit with random inputs.</description>

      <title>Precomputing approach for a two-scale phase transition model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21595v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we employ analytical and numerical techniques to examine a phase transition model with moving boundaries. The model displays two relevant spatial scales pointing out to a macroscopic phase and a microscopic phase, interacting on disjoint inclusions. The shrinkage or the growth of the inclusions is governed by a modified Gibbs-Thomson law depending on the macroscopic temperature, but without accessing curvature information. We use the Hanzawa transformation to transform the problem onto a fixed reference domain. Then a fixed-point argument is employed to demonstrate the well-posedness of the system for a finite time interval. Due to the model's nonlinearities and the macroscopic parameters, which are given by differential equations that depend on the size of the inclusions, the problem is computationally expensive to solve numerically. We introduce a precomputing approach that solves multiple cell problems in an offline phase and uses an interpolation scheme afterward to determine the needed parameters. Additionally, we propose a semi-implicit time-stepping method to resolve the nonlinearity of the problem. We investigate the errors of both the precomputing and time-stepping procedures and verify the theoretical results via numerical simulations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2212.12361v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We are interested in the existence of normalized solutions to the problem \begin{equation*} \begin{cases} (-\Delta)^m u+\frac{\mu}{|y|^{2m}}u + \lambda u = g(u), \quad x = (y,z) \in \mathbb{R}^K \times \mathbb{R}^{N-K}, \\ \int_{\mathbb{R}^N} |u|^2 \, dx = \rho &gt; 0, \end{cases} \end{equation*} in the so-called at least mass critical regime. We utilize recently introduced variational techniques involving the minimization on the $L^2$-ball. Moreover, we find also a solution to the related curl-curl problem \begin{equation*}
  \begin{cases}
  \nabla\times\nabla\times\mathbf{U}+\lambda\mathbf{U}=f(\mathbf{U}), \quad x \in \mathbb{R}^N, \\ \int_{\mathbb{R}^N}|\mathbf{U}|^2\,dx=\rho,
  \end{cases} \end{equation*} which arises from the system of Maxwell equations and is of great importance in nonlinear optics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2212.13698v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A new iteration method is represented to study the interior $L_{p}$ regularity for Stokes systems both in divergence form and in non-divergence form. By the iteration, we improve the integrability of derivatives of solutions for Stokes systems step by step; after infinitely many steps, $L_{p}$ regularity is achieved; and in each step, the maximal function method is used where solutions and their derivatives are involved simultaneously in each scale. The H\"{o}lder continuity of the coefficients in spatial variables is assumed to compensate the different scalings between the solutions and their derivatives.</description>

Abstract: We show the existence of the so-called semiclassical states $\mathbf{U}:\mathbb{R}^3\to\mathbb{R}^3$ to the following curl-curl problem $$ \varepsilon^2\; \nabla \times (\nabla \times \mathbf{U}) + V(x) \mathbf{U} = g(\mathbf{U}), $$ for sufficiently small $\varepsilon &gt; 0$. We study the asymptotic behaviour of solutions as $\varepsilon\to 0^+$ and we investigate also a related nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation involving a singular potential. The problem models large permeability nonlinear materials satisfying the system of Maxwell equations.</description>

Abstract: Our motivation is to consider an electromagnetic Lagrangian density $\mathcal{L}_q$, depending on a parameter such that, for $q=1$ it corresponds to the Born-Infeld Lagrangian density and for $q=2$ it restores the Maxwell one. The model in the presence of given charge and current densities is investigated. We solve the pure magnetostatic problem for $q\in(6/5,2)$. We also study the electrostatic problem in the presence of an assigned magnetic field for $q\in[1,2)$.</description>

      <title>Approximation and uniqueness results for the nonlocal diffuse optical tomography problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06226v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the inverse problem of recovering the diffusion and absorption coefficients $(\sigma,q)$ in the nonlocal diffuse optical tomography equation $(-\text{div}( \sigma \nabla))^s u+q u =0 \text{ in }\Omega$ from the nonlocal Dirichlet-to-Neumann (DN) map $\Lambda^s_{\sigma,q}$. The purpose of this article is to establish the following approximation and uniqueness results.
  - Approximation: We show that solutions to the conductivity equation $ \text{div}( \sigma \nabla v)=0 \text{ in }\Omega$ can be approximated in $H^1(\Omega)$ by solutions to the nonlocal diffuse optical tomography equation and the DN map $\Lambda_\sigma$ related to conductivity equation can be approximated by the nonlocal DN map $\Lambda_{\sigma,q}^s$.
  - Local uniqueness: We prove that the absorption coefficient $q$ can be determined in a neighborhood $\mathcal{N}$ of the boundary $\partial\Omega$ provided $\sigma$ is already known in $\mathcal{N}$.
  - Global uniqueness: Under the same assumptions as for the local uniqueness result, and if one of the potentials vanishes in $\Omega$, then one can turn with the help of \ref{item 1 abstract} the local determination into a global uniqueness result.
  It is worth mentioning that the approximation result relies on the Caffarelli--Silvestre type extension technique and the geometric form of the Hahn--Banach theorem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15230v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider minimizers of the one-phase Bernoulli free boundary problem in domains with analytic fixed boundary. In any dimension $d$, we prove that the branching set at the boundary has Hausdorff dimension at most $d-2$. As a consequence, we also obtain an analogous estimate on the branching set for solutions to the two-phase problem under an analytic separation condition. Moreover, as a byproduct of our analysis we obtain strong boundary unique continuation results for quasilinear operators and thin-obstacle variational inequalities. The approach we use is based on the (almost-)monotonicity of a boundary Almgren-type frequency function, obtained via regularity estimates and a Calder\'on-Zygmund decomposition in the spirit of Almgren-De Lellis-Spadaro.</description>

      <title>Global Well-Posedness of Contact Lines: 2D Navier-Stokes Flow</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17895v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Based on the global a priori estimates in [Guo-Tice, J. Eur. Math. Soc. (2024)], we establish the well-posedness of a viscous fluid model satisfying the dynamic law for the contact line \begin{equation*} \mathscr{W}(\p_t\zeta(\pm\ell,t))=[\![\gamma]\!]\mp\sigma\frac{\p_1\zeta}{(1+|\p_1\zeta|^2)^{1/2}}(\pm\ell,t) \end{equation*} in 2D domain, where $\zeta(x_1,t)$ is a free surface with two contact points $\zeta(\pm\ell,t)$, $[\![\gamma]\!]$ and $\sigma$ are constants characterizing the solid-fluid-gas free energy, and the increasing $\mathscr{W}$ is the contact point velocity response function. Motivated by the energy-dissipation structure, our construction relies on the construction of a pressureless weak solution for the coupled velocity and free interface for the linearized problems, via a Galerkin approximation with a time-dependent basis and an artificial regularization for the capillary operator.</description>

      <title>Zoll magnetic systems on the two-torus: a Nash-Moser construction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.02765v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct an infinite-dimensional family of smooth integrable magnetic systems on the two-torus which are Zoll, meaning that all the unit-speed magnetic geodesics are periodic. The metric and the magnetic field of such systems are arbitrarily close to the flat metric and to a given constant magnetic field. This extends to the magnetic setting a famous result by Guillemin on the two-sphere. We characterize Zoll magnetic systems as zeros of a suitable action functional $S$, and then look for its zeros by means of a Nash-Moser implicit function theorem. This requires showing the right-invertibility of the linearized operator $\mathrm{d} S$ in a neighborhood of the flat metric and constant magnetic field, and establishing tame estimates for the right inverse. As key step we prove the invertibility of the normal operator $\mathrm{d} S\circ \mathrm{d} S^*$ which, unlike in Guillemin's case, is pseudo-differential only at the highest order. We overcome this difficulty noting that, by the asymptotic properties of Bessel functions, the lower order expansion of $\mathrm{d} S \circ \mathrm{d}S^*$ is a sum of Fourier integral operators. We then use a resolvent identity decomposition which reduces the problem to the invertibility of $\mathrm{d} S \circ \mathrm{d} S^*$ restricted to the subspace of functions corresponding to high Fourier modes. The inversion of such a restricted operator is finally achieved by making the crucial observation that lower order Fourier integral operators satisfy asymmetric tame estimates.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.02210v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct a family of complete, properly embedded, annular translators $M$ such that $M$ lies in a slab and is invariant under reflections in the vertical coordinate planes. Each translator in the family is asymptotic as $z\to -\infty$ to four vertical planes $\{y= \pm b\}$ and $\{y= \pm B\}$, where $0&lt;b \le B &lt; \infty$. We call $b$ and $B$ the inner width and the (outer) width of the translator. We show that for each $b \ge \pi/2$ and each $s&gt;0$, there is a translator in the family with inner width $b$ and with necksize $s$. (We also show that there are no translators with inner width $&lt;\pi/2$ having the properties of the examples we construct.)</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.04033v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the spectrum of the Dirac hamiltonian in one space dimension for a single electron in the electrostatic potential of a point nucleus, in the Born-Oppenheimer approximation where the nucleus is assumed fixed at the origin. The potential is screened at large distances so that it goes to zero exponentially at spatial infinity. We show that the hamiltonian is essentially self-adjoint, the essential spectrum has the usual gap $(-mc^2,mc^2)$ in it, and that there are only finitely many eigenvalues in that gap, corresponding to ground and excited states for the system. We find a one-to-one correspondence between the eigenfunctions of this hamiltonian and the heteroclinic saddle-saddle connectors of a certain dynamical system on a finite cylinder. We use this correspondence to study how the number of bound states changes with the nuclear charge.</description>

Abstract: A Cahn-Hilliard-Allen-Cahn phase-field model coupled with a heat transfer equation, particularly with full non-diagonal mobility matrices, is studied. After reformulating the problem w.r.t. the inverse of temperature, we proposed and analysed a structure-preserving approximation for the semi-discretisation in space and then a fully discrete approximation using conforming finite elements and time-stepping methods. We prove structure-preserving property and discrete stability using relative entropy methods for the semi-discrete and fully discrete case. The theoretical results are illustrated by numerical experiments.</description>

Abstract: How do decisions change with the economic environment and with time? This paper studies general nonstationary stopping problems and provides the methodological tools to answer these questions. First, we identify conditions that ensure a monotone relation between decisions' timing and outcomes. These conditions apply to a prevalent class of economic environments. Second, we develop a theory of monotone comparative statics for stopping problems, offering general and unifying qualitative insights into the decision-maker's value and stopping behavior. We apply our results to models of information acquisition, bankruptcy, irreversible investment, and option pricing to explain documented patterns at odds with current theories.</description>
