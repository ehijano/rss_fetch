      <title>Combining Extended Convolutional Autoencoders and Reservoir Computing for Accurate Reduced-Order Predictions of Atmospheric Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Forecasting atmospheric flows with traditional discretization methods, also called full order methods (e.g., finite element methods or finite volume methods), is computationally expensive. We propose to reduce the computational cost with a Reduced Order Model (ROM) that combines Extended Convolutional Autoencoders (E-CAE) and Reservoir Computing (RC). Thanks to an extended network depth, the E-CAE encodes the high-resolution data coming from the full order method into a compact latent representation and can decode it back into high-resolution with 75% lower reconstruction error than standard CAEs. The compressed data are fed to an RC network, which predicts their evolution. The advantage of RC networks is a reduced computational cost in the training phase compared to conventional predictive models. We assess our data-driven ROM through well-known 2D and 3D benchmarks for atmospheric flows. We show that our ROM accurately reconstructs and predicts the future system dynamics with errors below 6% in 2D and 8% in 3D, while significantly reducing the computational cost of a full-order simulation. Compared to other ROMs available in the literature, such as Dynamic Mode Decomposition and Proper Orthogonal Decomposition with Interpolation, our ROM is as efficient but more accurate. Thus, it is a promising alternative to high-dimensional atmospheric simulations.</description>

      <title>Corrected Trapezoidal Rules for Near-Singular Surface Integrals Applied to 3D Interfacial Stokes Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01144v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interfacial Stokes flow can be efficiently computed using the Boundary Integral Equation method. In 3D, the fluid velocity at a target point is given by a 2D surface integral over all interfaces, thus reducing the dimension of the problem. A core challenge is that for target points near, but not on, an interface, the surface integral is near-singular and standard quadratures lose accuracy. This paper presents a method to accurately compute the near-singular integrals arising in elliptic boundary value problems in 3D. It is based on a local series approximation of the integrand about a base point on the surface, obtained by orthogonal projection of the target point onto the surface. The elementary functions in the resulting series approximation can be integrated to high accuracy in a neighborhood of the base point using a recursive algorithm. The remaining integral is evaluated numerically using a standard quadrature rule, chosen here to be the 4th order Trapezoidal rule. The method is reduced to the standard quadrature plus a correction, and is uniformly of 4th order. The method is applied to resolve Stokes flow past several ellipsoidal rigid bodies. We compare the error in the velocity near the bodies, and in the time and displacement of particles traveling around the bodies, computed with and without the corrections.</description>

      <title>Derivative estimation by RKHS regularization for learning dynamics from time-series data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01289v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Learning the governing equations from time-series data has gained increasing attention due to its potential to extract useful dynamics from real-world data. Despite significant progress, it becomes challenging in the presence of noise, especially when derivatives need to be calculated. To reduce the effect of noise, we propose a method that simultaneously fits both the derivative and trajectory from noisy time-series data. Our approach formulates derivative estimation as an inverse problem involving integral operators within the forward model, and estimates the derivative function by solving a regularization problem in a vector-valued reproducing kernel Hilbert space (vRKHS). We derive an integral-form representer theorem, which enables the computation of the regularized solution by solving a finite-dimensional problem and facilitates efficiently estimating the optimal regularization parameter. By embedding the dynamics within a vRKHS and utilizing the fitted derivative and trajectory, we can recover the underlying dynamics from noisy data by solving a linear regularization problem. Several numerical experiments are conducted to validate the effectiveness and efficiency of our method.</description>

      <title>A novel semi-analytical multiple invariants-preserving integrator for conservative PDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01307v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many conservative partial differential equations such as the Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equation, and the nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger equations, the Klein-Gordon equation have more than one invariant functionals. In this paper, we propose the definition of the discrete variational derivative, based on which, a novel semi-analytical multiple invariants-preserving integrator for the conservative partial differential equations is constructed by projection technique. The proposed integrators are shown to have the same order of accuracy as the underlying integrators. For applications, some concrete mass-momentum-energy-preserving integrators are derived for the KdV equation.</description>

      <title>The optimal strong convergence rates of the truncated EM and logarithmic truncated EM methods for multi-dimensional nonlinear stochastic differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01323v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The truncated Euler--Maruyama (EM) method, developed by Mao (2015), is used to solve multi-dimensional nonlinear stochastic differential equations (SDEs). However, its convergence rate is suboptimal due to an unnecessary infinitesimal factor. The primary goal of this paper is to demonstrate the optimal convergence of the truncated EM method without infinitesimal factors. Besides, the logarithmic truncated EM method has not been studied in multi-dimensional cases, which is the other goal of this paper. We will show the optimal strong convergence order of the positivity-preserving logarithmic truncated EM method for solving multi-dimensional SDEs with positive solutions. Numerical examples are given to support our theoretical conclusions.</description>

      <title>A Bayesian approach for inverse potential problem with topological-Gaussian prior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the reconstruction of a potential coefficient in an elliptic problem from distributed observations within the Bayesian framework. In such problems, the selection of an appropriate prior distribution is crucial, particularly when the function to be inferred exhibits sharp discontinuities, as traditional Gaussian priors often prove inadequate. To tackle this challenge, we develop the topological prior (TP), a new prior constructed using persistent homology. The proposed prior utilizes persistent pairs to characterize and record the topological variations of the functions under reconstruction, thereby encoding prior information about the structure and discontinuities of the function. The TP prior, however, only exists in a discretized formulation, which leads to the absence of a well-defined posterior measure in function spaces. To resolve this issue, we propose a TP-Gaussian hybrid prior, where the TP component detects sharp discontinuities in the function, while the Gaussian distribution acts as a reference measure, ensuring a well-defined posterior measure in the function space. The proposed TP prior demonstrates effects similar to the classical total variation (TV) prior but offers greater flexibility and broader applicability due to three key advantages. First, it is defined on a general topological space, making it easily adaptable to a wider range of applications. Second, the persistent distance captures richer topological information compared to the discrete TV prior. Third, it incorporates more adjustable parameters, providing enhanced flexibility to achieve robust numerical results. These features make the TP prior a powerful tool for addressing inverse problems involving functions with sharp discontinuities.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01487v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose and study a fully implicit finite volume scheme for the pressureless Euler-Poisson-Boltzmann equations on the one dimensional torus. Especially, we design a consistent and dissipative discretization of the force term which yields an unconditional energy decay. In addition, we establish a discrete analogue of the modulated energy estimate around constant states with a small velocity. Numerical experiments are carried to illustrate our theoretical results and to assess the accuracy of our scheme. A test case of the literature is also illustrated.</description>

      <title>The Polynomial Set Associated with a Fixed Number of Matrix-Matrix Multiplications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01500v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of computing matrix polynomials $p(X)$, where $X$ is a large matrix, with as few matrix-matrix multiplications as possible. More precisely, let $ \Pi_{2^{m}}^* $ represent the set of polynomials computable with $m$ matrix-matrix multiplications, but with an arbitrary number of matrix additions and scaling operations. We characterize this set through a tabular parameterization. By deriving equivalence transformations of the tabular representation, we establish new methods that can be used to construct elements of $ \Pi_{2^{m}}^* $ and determine general properties of the set. The transformations allow us to eliminate variables and prove that the dimension is bounded by $m^2$. Numerical simulations suggest that this is a sharp bound. Consequently, we have identified a parameterization, which, to our knowledge, is the first minimal parameterization. Furthermore, we conduct a study using computational tools from algebraic geometry to determine the largest degree $d$ such that all polynomials of that degree belong to $ \Pi_{2^{m}}^* $, or its closure. In many cases, the computational setup is constructive in the sense that it can also be used to determine a specific evaluation scheme for a given polynomial.</description>

      <title>Improvement of fully-implicit two-phase pore-network models by employing generalized flux functions with additional throat variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In fully-implicit two-phase pore-network models, developing a well-converged scheme remains a major challenge, primarily due to the discontinuities in the phase conductivities. This paper addresses these numerical issues by proposing a generalized flux function that establishes a continuous flux expression for two-phase flows by introducing an additional throat variable $\Theta$. Two approaches for expressing this additional throat variable are introduced: the first applies regularization strategies, while the second constructs an additional residual constraint equation. It is shown that this approach significantly improves accuracy and ensures the temporal convergence, as demonstrated through various numerical examples.</description>

      <title>High-Order Flux Splitting Schemes for the Euler Equations of Gas Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01699v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop high-order flux splitting schemes for the one- and two-dimensional Euler equations of gas dynamics. The proposed schemes are high-order extensions of the existing first-order flux splitting schemes introduced in [ E. F. Toro, M. E. V\'azquez-Cend\'on, Comput. \&amp; Fluids, 70 (2012), pp. 1--12], where the Euler equations of gas dynamics are split into two subsystems: the advection and pressure systems. In this paper, we formulate the TV splitting within the semi-discrete framework to extend it to higher orders of accuracy for the first time. The second-order extension is obtained by using piecewise linear interpolant to reconstruct the one-sided point values of the unknowns. The third- and fifth-order schemes are developed using the finite-difference alternative weighted essentially non-oscillatory (A-WENO) framework, which is particularly effective in handling multidimensional problems and provides a more straightforward approach to constructing higher-order WENO schemes. These extensions significantly improve the resolution of discontinuities and the accuracy of numerical solutions, as demonstrated by a series of numerical experiments of both the one- and two-dimensional Euler equations of gas dynamics.</description>

      <title>Acoustic Propagation/Refraction Through Diffuse Interface Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel approach for simulating acoustic (pressure) wave propagation across different media separated by a diffuse interface through the use of a weak compressibility formulation. Our method builds on our previous work on an entropy-stable discontinuous Galerkin spectral element method for the incompressible Navier-Stokes/Cahn-Hilliard system \cite{manzanero2020entropyNSCH}, and incorporates a modified weak compressibility formulation that allows different sound speeds in each phase. We validate our method through numerical experiments, demonstrating spectral convergence for acoustic transmission and reflection coefficients in one dimension and for the angle defined by Snell's law in two dimensions. Special attention is given to quantifying the modeling errors introduced by the width of the diffuse interface. Our results show that the method successfully captures the behavior of acoustic waves across interfaces, allowing exponential convergence in transmitted waves. The transmitted angles in two dimensions are accurately captured for air-water conditions, up to the critical angle of $13^\circ$. This work represents a step forward in modeling acoustic propagation in incompressible multiphase systems, with potential applications to marine aeroacoustics.</description>

      <title>A First-Order Linear Energy Stable Scheme for the Cahn-Hilliard Equation with Dynamic Boundary Conditions under the Effect of Hyperbolic Relaxation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01762v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we focus on the Cahn-Hilliard equation with dynamic boundary conditions, by adding two hyperbolic relaxation terms to the system. We verify that the energy of the total system is decreasing with time. By adding two stabilization terms, we have constructed a first-order temporal accuracy numerical scheme, which is linear and energy stable. Then we prove that the scheme is of first-order in time by the error estimates. At last we carry out enough numerical results to validate the the temporal convergence and the energy stability of such scheme. Moreover, we have present the differences of the numerical results with and without the hyperbolic terms, which show that the hyperbolic terms can help the total energy decreasing slowly.</description>

      <title>Optimized Schwarz method for the Stokes-Darcy problem with generalized interface conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01784v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to their wide appearance in environmental settings as well as industrial and medical applications, the Stokes-Darcy problems with different sets of interface conditions establish an active research area in the community of mathematical modelers and computational scientists. For numerical simulation of such coupled problems in applications, robust and efficient computational algorithms are needed. In this work, we consider a generalization of the Beavers-Joseph interface condition recently developed using homogenization and boundary layer theory. This extension is applicable not only for the parallel flows to the fluid-porous interface as its predecessor, but also for arbitrary flow directions. To solve the Stokes-Darcy problem with these generalized interface conditions efficiently, we develop and analyze a Robin-Robin domain decomposition method using Fourier analysis to identify optimal weights in the Robin interface conditions. We study efficiency and robustness of the proposed method and provide numerical simulations which confirm the obtained theoretical results.</description>

      <title>An accelerated randomized Bregman-Kaczmarz method for strongly convex linearly constraint optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01160v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a randomized accelerated method for the minimization of a strongly convex function under linear constraints. The method is of Kaczmarz-type, i.e. it only uses a single linear equation in each iteration. To obtain acceleration we build on the fact that the Kaczmarz method is dual to a coordinate descent method. We use a recently proposed acceleration method for the randomized coordinate descent and transfer it to the primal space. This method inherits many of the attractive features of the accelerated coordinate descent method, including its worst-case convergence rates. A theoretical analysis of the convergence of the proposed method is given. Numerical experiments show that the proposed method is more efficient and faster than the existing methods for solving the same problem.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Error Bounds and Fractional-Bit Design for Fixed-Point Grover's Quantum Algorithm Emulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01430v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum computing (QC) emulators, which simulate quantum algorithms on classical hardware, are indispensable platforms for testing quantum algorithms before scalable quantum computers become widely available. A critical challenge in QC emulation is managing numerical errors from finite arithmetic precision, especially truncation errors in resource-efficient fixed-point arithmetic. Despite its importance, systematic studies quantifying how truncation errors impact quantum algorithm accuracy are limited. In this paper, we propose a rigorous quantitative framework analyzing truncation error propagation in fixed-point QC emulation, focusing on Grover's quantum search algorithm. First, we introduce a simplified two-value amplitude representation of quantum states during Grover's iterations and prove its theoretical validity. Using this representation, we derive explicit mathematical expressions characterizing truncation error accumulation across quantum gate operations. We quantify the overall emulation error by the $\ell_2$ distance between ideal and emulated probability distributions, obtaining asymptotic bounds scaling as $O(2^{n-f})$, where $n$ is the number of qubits and $f$ is fractional-bit precision. Extensive numerical simulations and empirical experiments on a practical fixed-point QC emulator confirm that observed errors precisely match our theoretical predictions. Finally, we provide a closed-form formula to determine the minimal fractional-bit precision required to achieve a specified error threshold, offering clear guidelines for emulator designers balancing accuracy and resource utilization.</description>

      <title>A Robust Model-Based Approach for Continuous-Time Policy Evaluation with Unknown L\'evy Process Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01482v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper develops a model-based framework for continuous-time policy evaluation (CTPE) in reinforcement learning, incorporating both Brownian and L\'evy noise to model stochastic dynamics influenced by rare and extreme events. Our approach formulates the policy evaluation problem as solving a partial integro-differential equation (PIDE) for the value function with unknown coefficients. A key challenge in this setting is accurately recovering the unknown coefficients in the stochastic dynamics, particularly when driven by L\'evy processes with heavy tail effects. To address this, we propose a robust numerical approach that effectively handles both unbiased and censored trajectory datasets. This method combines maximum likelihood estimation with an iterative tail correction mechanism, improving the stability and accuracy of coefficient recovery. Additionally, we establish a theoretical bound for the policy evaluation error based on coefficient recovery error. Through numerical experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our method in recovering heavy-tailed L\'evy dynamics and verify the theoretical error analysis in policy evaluation.</description>

      <title>Identity-Based Language Shift Modeling</title>

Abstract: The preservation of endangered languages is a widely discussed issue nowadays. Languages represent essential cultural heritage and can provide valuable botanical, biological, and geographical information. Therefore, it is necessary to develop efficient measures to preserve and revitalize endangered languages. However, the language shift process is complex and requires an interdisciplinary approach, including mathematical modeling techniques. This paper develops a new mathematical model that extends previous works on this topic. We introduce the factor of ethnic identity, which is a proxy for a more complex nexus of variables involved in an individual's self-identity and/or a group's identity. This proxy is socially constructed rather than solely inherited, shaped by community-determined factors, with language both indexing and creating the identity. In our model, we divide speakers into groups depending on with which language they identify themselves with. Moreover, every group includes monolinguals and bilinguals. The proposed model naturally allows us to consider cases of language coexistence and describe a broader class of linguistic situations. For example, the simulation results show that our model can result in cyclic language dynamics, drawing a parallel to cell population models. In this way, the proposed mathematical model can serve as a useful tool for developing efficient measures for language preservation and revitalization.</description>

      <title>A Unified Approach to Analysis and Design of Denoising Markov Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.01938v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Probabilistic generative models based on measure transport, such as diffusion and flow-based models, are often formulated in the language of Markovian stochastic dynamics, where the choice of the underlying process impacts both algorithmic design choices and theoretical analysis. In this paper, we aim to establish a rigorous mathematical foundation for denoising Markov models, a broad class of generative models that postulate a forward process transitioning from the target distribution to a simple, easy-to-sample distribution, alongside a backward process particularly constructed to enable efficient sampling in the reverse direction. Leveraging deep connections with nonequilibrium statistical mechanics and generalized Doob's $h$-transform, we propose a minimal set of assumptions that ensure: (1) explicit construction of the backward generator, (2) a unified variational objective directly minimizing the measure transport discrepancy, and (3) adaptations of the classical score-matching approach across diverse dynamics. Our framework unifies existing formulations of continuous and discrete diffusion models, identifies the most general form of denoising Markov models under certain regularity assumptions on forward generators, and provides a systematic recipe for designing denoising Markov models driven by arbitrary L\'evy-type processes. We illustrate the versatility and practical effectiveness of our approach through novel denoising Markov models employing geometric Brownian motion and jump processes as forward dynamics, highlighting the framework's potential flexibility and capability in modeling complex distributions.</description>

Abstract: This paper proposes a unique optimization approach for estimating the minimax rational approximation and its application for evaluating matrix functions. Our method enables the extension to generalized rational approximations and has the flexibility of adding constraints. In particular, the latter allows us to control specific properties preferred in matrix function evaluation. For example, in the case of a normal matrix, we can guarantee a bound over the condition number of the matrix, which one needs to invert for evaluating the rational matrix function. We demonstrate the efficiency of our approach for several applications of matrix functions based on direct spectrum filtering.</description>

      <title>Capturing vertical information in radially symmetric flow using hyperbolic shallow water moment equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.07952v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Models for shallow water flow often assume that the lateral velocity is constant over the water height. The recently derived shallow water moment equations are an extension of these standard shallow water equations. The extended models allow for vertical changes in the lateral velocity, resulting in a system that is more accurate in situations where the horizontal velocity varies considerably over the height of the fluid. Unfortunately, already the one-dimensional models lack global hyperbolicity, an important property of partial differential equations that ensures that disturbances have a finite propagation speed. In this paper we show that the loss of hyperbolicity also occurs in two-dimensional axisymmetric systems. First, a cylindrical moment model is obtained by starting from the cylindrical incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. We derive two-dimensional axisymmetric Shallow Water Moment Equations by imposing axisymmetry in the cylindrical model. The loss of hyperbolicity is observed by directly evaluating the propagation speeds and plotting the hyperbolicity region. A hyperbolic axisymmetric moment model is then obtained by modifying the system matrix in analogy to the one-dimensional case, for which the hyperbolicity problem has already been observed and overcome. The new model is written in analytical form and we prove that hyperbolicity can be guaranteed. To test the new model, numerical simulations with both discontinuous and continuous initial data are performed. We show that the hyperbolic model leads to less oscillations than the non-hyperbolic model in the case of a discontinuous initial height profile. The hyperbolic model is preferred over the non-hyperbolic model in this specific scenario for shorter times. Further, we observe that the error decreases when the order of the model is increased in a test case with smooth initial data.</description>

      <title>Perturbation estimates for order-one strong approximations of SDEs without globally monotone coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.00385v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To obtain strong convergence rates of numerical schemes, an overwhelming majority of existing works impose a global monotonicity condition on coefficients of SDEs. Nevertheless, there are still many SDEs from applications that do not have globally monotone coefficients. As a recent breakthrough, the authors of [Hutzenthaler, Jentzen, Ann. Probab., 2020] originally presented a perturbation theory for stochastic differential equations (SDEs), which is crucial to recovering strong convergence rates of numerical schemes in a non-globally monotone setting. However, only a convergence rate of order 1/2 was obtained there for time-stepping schemes such as a stopped increment-tamed Euler-Maruyama (SITEM) method. An interesting question arises, also raised by the aforementioned work, as to whether a higher convergence rate than 1/2 can be obtained when higher order schemes are used. The present work attempts to give a positive answer to this question. To this end, we develop some new perturbation estimates that are able to reveal the order-one strong convergence of numerical methods. As the first application of the newly developed estimates, we identify the expected order-one pathwise uniformly strong convergence of the SITEM method for additive noise driven SDEs and multiplicative noise driven second order SDEs with non-globally monotone coefficients. As the other application, we propose and analyze a positivity preserving explicit Milstein-type method for Lotka-Volterra competition model driven by multi-dimensional noise, with a pathwise uniformly strong convergence rate of order one recovered under mild assumptions. These obtained results are completely new and significantly improve the existing theory. Numerical experiments are also provided to confirm the theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>A hybrid pressure formulation of the face-centred finite volume method for viscous laminar incompressible flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04864v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work presents a hybrid pressure face-centred finite volume (FCFV) solver to simulate steady-state incompressible Navier-Stokes flows. The method leverages the robustness, in the incompressible limit, of the hybridisable discontinuous Galerkin paradigm for compressible and weakly compressible flows to derive the formulation of a novel, low-order face-based discretisation. The incompressibility constraint is enforced in a weak sense, by introducing an inter-cell mass flux defined in terms of a new, hybrid variable, representing the pressure at the cell faces. This results in a new hybridisation strategy where cell variables (velocity, pressure and deviatoric strain rate tensor) are expressed as a function of velocity and pressure at the barycentre of the cell faces. The hybrid pressure formulation provides first-order convergence of all variables, including the stress, without the need for gradient reconstruction, thus being less sensitive to cell type, stretching, distortion, and skewness than traditional low-order finite volume solvers. Numerical benchmarks of Navier-Stokes flows at low and moderate Reynolds numbers, in two and three dimensions, are presented to evaluate accuracy and robustness of the method. In particular, the hybrid pressure formulation outperforms the FCFV method when convective effects are relevant, achieving accurate predictions on significantly coarser meshes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.20872v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work presents a framework for parametric reduction in FEM, where geometry is controlled by a parameter without altering material properties or stress states. The inverse determinant in the weak form is expanded as a power series, with explicit expressions for the zeroth and first-order terms. External forcing and parameter dependence are incorporated into an enlarged autonomous system, reduced via the direct parameterization of invariant manifolds method and homological equations. The parameter is treated as an additional variable with trivial dynamics, isolated for inclusion in the ROM. This approach enables efficient parametric studies and advances reduced-order modeling in structural dynamics.</description>

      <title>Convergence of Ray- and Pixel-Driven Discretization Frameworks in the Strong Operator Topology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.03069v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tomography is a central tool in medical applications, allowing doctors to investigate patients' interior features. The Radon transform (in two dimensions) is commonly used to model the measurement process in parallel-beam CT. Suitable discretization of the Radon transform and its adjoint (called the backprojection) is crucial. The most commonly used discretization approach combines the ray-driven Radon transform with the pixel-driven backprojection, as anecdotal reports describe these as showing the best approximation performance. However, there is little rigorous understanding of induced approximation errors. These methods involve three discretization parameters: the spatial-, detector-, and angular resolutions. Most commonly, balanced resolutions are used, i.e., the same (or similar) spatial- and detector resolutions are employed. We present a novel interpretation of ray- and pixel-driven discretizations as `convolutional methods'. This allows for a structured analysis that can explain observed behavior. In particular, we prove convergence in the strong operator topology of the ray-driven Radon transform and the pixel-driven backprojection under balanced resolutions, thus theoretically justifying this approach. In particular, with high enough resolutions one can approximate the Radon transform arbitrarily well.</description>

      <title>Beyond Gaussian Assumptions: A Nonlinear Generalization of Linear Inverse Modeling</title>

Abstract: The Linear Inverse Model (LIM) is a class of data-driven methods that construct approximate linear stochastic models to represent complex observational data. The stochastic forcing can be modeled using either Gaussian white noise or Ornstein-Uhlenbeck colored noise; the corresponding models are called White-LIM and Colored-LIM, respectively. Although LIMs are widely applied in climate sciences, they inherently approximate observed distributions as Gaussian, limiting their ability to capture asymmetries.
  In this study, we extend LIMs to incorporate nonlinear dynamics, introducing White-nLIM and Colored-nLIM which allow for a more flexible and accurate representation of complex dynamics from observations. The proposed methods not only account for the nonlinear nature of the underlying system but also effectively capture the skewness of the observed distribution. Moreover, we apply these methods to a lower-dimensional representation of ENSO and demonstrate that both White-nLIM and Colored-nLIM successfully capture its nonlinear characteristic.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12925v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hamiltonian simulation becomes more challenging as the underlying unitary becomes more oscillatory. In such cases, an algorithm with commutator scaling and a weak dependence, such as logarithmic, on the derivatives of the Hamiltonian is desired. We introduce a new time-dependent Hamiltonian simulation algorithm based on the Magnus series expansion that exhibits both features. Importantly, when applied to unbounded Hamiltonian simulation in the interaction picture, we prove that the commutator in the second-order algorithm leads to a surprising fourth-order superconvergence, with an error preconstant independent of the number of spatial grids. This extends the qHOP algorithm [An, Fang, Lin, Quantum 2022] based on first-order Magnus expansion, and the proof of superconvergence is based on semiclassical analysis that is of independent interest.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we present a comprehensive analysis of the posterior covariance field in Gaussian processes, with applications to the posterior covariance matrix. The analysis is based on the Gaussian prior covariance but the approach also applies to other covariance kernels. Our geometric analysis reveals how the Gaussian kernel's bandwidth parameter and the spatial distribution of the observations influence the posterior covariance as well as the corresponding covariance matrix, enabling straightforward identification of areas with high or low covariance in magnitude. Drawing inspiration from the a posteriori error estimation techniques in adaptive finite element methods, we also propose several estimators to efficiently measure the absolute posterior covariance field, which can be used for efficient covariance matrix approximation and preconditioning. We conduct a wide range of experiments to illustrate our theoretical findings and their practical applications.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Modelling of Elasticity Tensor Fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.16714v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a novel framework for the probabilistic modelling of random fourth order material tensor fields, with a focus on tensors that are physically symmetric and positive definite (SPD), of which the elasticity tensor is a prime example. Given the critical role that spatial symmetries and invariances play in determining material behaviour, it is essential to incorporate these aspects into the probabilistic description and modelling of material properties. In particular, we focus on spatial point symmetries or invariances under rotations, a classical subject in elasticity. Following this, we formulate a stochastic modelling framework using a Lie algebra representation via a memoryless transformation that respects the requirements of positive definiteness and invariance. With this, it is shown how to generate a random ensemble of elasticity tensors that allows an independent control of strength, eigenstrain, and orientation. The procedure also accommodates the requirement to prescribe specific spatial symmetries and invariances for each member of the whole ensemble, while ensuring that the mean or expected value of the ensemble conforms to a potentially 'higher' class of spatial invariance. Furthermore, it is important to highlight that the set of SPD tensors forms a differentiable manifold, which geometrically corresponds to an open cone within the ambient space of symmetric tensors. Thus, we explore the mathematical structure of the underlying sample space of such tensors, and introduce a new distance measure or metric, called the 'elasticity metric', between the tensors. Finally, we model and visualize a one-dimensional spatial field of orthotropic Kelvin matrices using interpolation based on the elasticity metric.</description>

      <title>On the characteristic structure of the adjoint Euler equations with application to supersonic flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13007v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We review the characteristic structure of the two-dimensional adjoint Euler equations. We derive the compatibility and jump conditions along characteristics and show that the characteristic information can be used to obtain exact predictions for the adjoint variables in certain supersonic flows.</description>
