      <title>X-ray Strain and Stress Tensor Tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05796v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The microscopic distribution of strain and stress plays a crucial role for the performance, safety, and lifetime of components in aeronautics, automotive and critical infrastructure [1]. While non-destructive methods for measuring the stress close to the surface have long been long established, only a limited number of approaches for depth-resolved measurements based on x-rays or neutrons are available [2]. These feature significant limitations, including long scan times, intricate experimental set-ups, limited spatial resolution or anisotropic gauge volumes with aspect ratios of 1:10 or worse. Here, we present a method that overcomes these limitations and obtains tomographic reconstructions of the full six-dimensional strain and stress tensor components. Using a simple and wide spread experimental set-up that combines x-ray powder diffraction with single axis tomography, we achieve non-destructive determination of depth-resolved strain and stress distributions with isotropic resolution. The presented method could be of interest for additive manufacturing of metals [3,4], battery research [5], in-situ metallurgy [6] and the experimental validation of finite element simulations [7].</description>

      <title>Guidelines for designs for ultrastable laser with $\mathbf{10^{-17}}$ fractional frequency instability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06213v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lasers with long coherence time and narrow linewidth are an essential tool for quantum sensors and clocks. Ultrastable cavities and laser systems are now commercially available with fractional frequency instabilities in the mid $10^{-16}$ range. This document aims to provide technical guidance for researchers starting in the field of ultrastable lasers and to give an outlook toward the next generation of improved ultrastable lasers. These guidelines have arisen from the scope of the EMPIR project ``Next generation ultrastable lasers'' ( https://www.ptb.de/empir2021/nextlasers ) with contributions from the European project partners.</description>

      <title>Lab and Beam Tests of a SiPM-readout ASIC with a Large Dynamic Range</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18927v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A front-end readout system with a large dynamic range is required for the high-granularity crystal electromagnetic calorimeter (ECAL) at future Higgs factories. A new commercially available ASIC, MPT2321, which offers a significantly large dynamic range for the readout of the silicon photomultiplier (SiPM), has been tested in the laboratory and at a test beam facility. The fundamental performance metrics have been characterised, including response linearity, inter-calibration factor and noise performance. To quantitatively assess the dynamic range of the chip and evaluate its feasibility for SiPM readout in high-granularity crystal ECAL, a beamtest was conducted using scintillating crystals exposed to electron beams. Beamtest results showed that the chip exhibits a promising performance in terms of a good signal-to-noise ratio and a relatively large dynamic range.</description>

      <title>Impact of helium ion irradiation on the thermal properties of superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02405v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: SNSPDs are indispensable for applications ranging from quantum information processing to deep-space optical communications, owing to their high detection efficiency, low dark counts, and excellent timing resolution. However, further improving the intrinsic detection efficiency (IDE) remains crucial for optimizing SNSPD performance. Ion irradiation has recently emerged as a powerful post-fabrication method to enhance SNSPD characteristics. Here, we studied the effects of He-ion irradiation on the thermal properties of NbN SNSPDs. We systematically examine the evolution of thermal boundary conductance as a function of ion fluence (0-1.1E17 ions/cm2), observing a 57% decrease from 127 to 54 W/m^2K^4 with increasing fluence, followed by saturation at approximately 9E16 ions/cm2. At this fluence, the minimum hotspot relaxation time measurements indicate a 41% increase, rising from 17 to 24 ps, while the electron-phonon interaction time extends by 14%, from 11.2 to 12.8 ps at 10 K. TEM reveals defect formation at the NbN/SiO2 interface (6-8 nm) and He-bubble formation within the SiO2 layer (30-260 nm), contributing to the extended thermal relaxation time. These irradiation-induced modifications play a key role in enhancing the IDE of the treated devices. We further demonstrate a post-irradiation SNSPD showing a saturated IDE plateau at 2000 nm from 2.7 K to 28 mK, enabled by thermal modifications and a weakly wavelength-dependent avalanche-assisted mechanism. Our findings highlight ion irradiation as a valuable tool for thermal tailoring in SNSPDs and advance the understanding of detection physics and defect engineering in superconducting optoelectronics.</description>
