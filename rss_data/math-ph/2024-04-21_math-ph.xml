      <title>Hypotheses regarding Baxter's $T-Q$ relation for the periodic XYZ chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12615v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Baxter's $T-Q$ relation for the periodic spin-$\frac12$ XYZ chain is studied. We extensively perform numerical calculations for the $T-Q$ relation and the Bethe ansatz equations. Numerical based hypotheses are then proposed to answer some open questions regarding Baxter's $T-Q$ relation and the XYZ chain.</description>

      <title>The free energy of Dirac's vacuum in purely magnetic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12733v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The QED vacuum is a non-linear polarisable medium rather than an empty space. In this work, we present the first rigorous derivation of the one-loop effective magnetic Lagrangian at positive temperature, a non-linear functional describing the free energy of quantum vacuum in a classical magnetic field. We start by properly defining the free energy functional using the Pauli-Villars regularisation technique in order to remove the worst ultraviolet divergence which represents a well known issue of the theory. Then, we study the limit of slowly varying classical magnetic fields. In this regime, we prove the convergence of this functional to the Euler-Heisenberg formula with thermal corrections, by recovering the effective Lagrangian first derived by Dittrich in 1979.</description>

      <title>Geodesic extensions of mechanical systems with nonholonomic constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11997v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For a Lagrangian system with nonholonomic constraints, we construct extensions of the equations of motion to sets of second-order ordinary differential equations. In the case of a purely kinetic Lagrangian, we investigate the conditions under which the nonholonomic trajectories are geodesics of a Riemannian metric, while preserving the constrained Lagrangian. We interpret the algebraic and PDE conditions of this problem as infinitesimal versions of the relation between the nonholonomic exponential map and the Riemannian metric. We discuss the special case of a Chaplygin system with symmetries and we end the paper with a worked-out example.</description>

      <title>On balanced homodyne measurement -- simple proof of wave function collapse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12706v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using only elementary calculus we prove that the balanced homodyne detector measures the quadrature phase amplitude of a signal. More precisely, after the measurement of photon numbers $l$, the collapse of the composite state of a strong laser beam and a signal approximates the collapse of the signal to the eigen-state of quadrature phase amplitude with eigen-value $r$.</description>

      <title>Quantum Spacetimes from General Relativity?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13029v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a non-commutative product for curved spacetimes, that can be regarded as a generalization of the Rieffel (or Moyal-Weyl) product. This product employs the exponential map and a Poisson tensor, and the deformed product maintains associativity under the condition that the Poisson tensor $\Theta$ satisfies $\Theta^{\mu\nu}\nabla_{\nu}\Theta^{\rho\sigma}=0$, in relation to a Levi-Cevita connection. We proceed to solve the associativity condition for various physical spacetimes, uncovering non-commutative structures with compelling properties.</description>

      <title>Coupled Supersymmetry and Ladder Structures Beyond the Harmonic Oscillator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.02767</link>
      <description>arXiv:1701.02767v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The development of supersymmetric (SUSY) quantum mechanics has shown that some of the insights based on the algebraic properties of ladder operators related to the quantum mechanical harmonic oscillator carry over to the study of more general systems. At this level of generality, pairs of eigenfunctions of so-called partner Hamiltonians are transformed into each other, but the entire spectrum of any one of them cannot be deduced from this intertwining relationship in general -- except in special cases. In this paper, we present a more general structure that provides all eigenvalues for a class of Hamiltonians that do not factor into a pair of operators satisfying canonical commutation relations. Instead of a pair of partner Hamiltonians, we consider two pairs that differ by an overall shift in their spectrum. This is called coupled supersymmetry. In that case, we also develop coherent states and present some uncertainty principles which generalize the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. Coupled SUSY is explicitly realized by an infinite family of differential operators which admit orthonormal bases of eigenfunctions of generalized harmonic oscillators.</description>

      <title>Microscopic derivation of a Schr\"odinger equation in dimension one with a nonlinear point interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.09674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.09674v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive an effective equation for the dynamics of many identical bosons in dimension one in the presence of a tiny impurity. The interaction between every pair of bosons is mediated by the impurity through a positive three-body potential. Assuming a simultaneous mean-field and short-range scaling with the short-range proceeding slower than the mean-field, and choosing an initial fully condensed state, we prove propagation of chaos and obtain an effective one-particle Schr\"odinger equation with a defocusing nonlinearity concentrated at a point. More precisely, we prove convergence of one-particle density operators in the trace-class topology and estimate the fluctuations as superexponential. This is the first derivation of the so-called nonlinear delta model, widely investigated in the last decades.</description>

      <title>Instability of quadratic band degeneracies and the emergence of Dirac points</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05886v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Consider the Schr\"{o}dinger operator $H = -\Delta + V$, where the potential $V$ is $\mathbb{Z}^2$-periodic and invariant under spatial inversion, complex conjugation, and $\pi/2$ rotation. We show that, under typical small linear deformations of $V$, the quadratic band degeneracy points occurring over the high-symmetry quasimomentum $\boldsymbol{M}$ (see [24, 25]) each split into two separated degeneracies over perturbed quasimomenta $\boldsymbol{D}^+$ and $\boldsymbol{D}^-$, and that these degeneracies are Dirac points. The local character of the degenerate dispersion surfaces about the emergent Dirac points are tilted, elliptical cones. Correspondingly, the dynamics of wavepackets spectrally localized near either $\boldsymbol{D}^+$ or $\boldsymbol{D}^-$ are governed by a system of Dirac equations with an advection term. Generalizations are discussed.</description>

      <title>Star exponentials from propagators and path integrals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08815v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we address the relation between the star exponentials emerging within the Deformation Quantization formalism and Feynman's path integrals associated with propagators in quantum dynamics. In order to obtain such a relation, we start by visualizing the quantum propagator as an integral transform of the star exponential by means of the symbol corresponding to the time evolution operator and, thus, we introduce Feynman's path integral representation of the propagator as a sum over all the classical histories. The star exponential thus constructed has the advantage that it does not depend on the convergence of formal series, as commonly understood within the context of Deformation Quantization. We include some basic examples to illustrate our findings, recovering standard results reported in the literature. Further, for an arbitrary finite dimensional system, we use the star exponential introduced here in order to find a particular representation of the star product which resembles the one encountered in the context of the quantum field theory for a Poisson sigma model.</description>

      <title>On the Lorenzoni-Magri hierarchy of hydrodynamic type</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10562v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 2005 Lorenzoni and Magri showed that a hydrodynamic-type hierarchy determined by the powers of a type (1,1) tensor field (on a smooth manifold) with vanishing Nijenhuis torsion can be deformed to a more general hierarchy, with the help of a chain of conservation laws of the new hierarchy. We review this construction. The (1,1) tensor fields of the resulting hierarchy have non-vanishing Nijenhuis torsion, in general, but their Haantjes tensor vanishes.</description>

      <title>Schubert puzzles and integrability II: multiplying motivic Segre classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.00563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2102.00563v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In Schubert Puzzles and Integrability I we proved several "puzzle rules" for computing products of Schubert classes in K-theory (and sometimes equivariant K-theory) of d-step flag varieties. The principal tool was "quantum integrability", in several variants of the Yang--Baxter equation; this let us recognize the Schubert structure constants as q-&gt;0 limits of certain matrix entries in products of R- (and other) matrices of quantized affine algebra representations. In the present work we give direct cohomological interpretations of those same matrix entries but at finite q: they compute products of "motivic Segre classes", closely related to K-theoretic Maulik--Okounkov stable classes living on the cotangent bundles of the flag varieties. Without q-&gt;0, we avoid some divergences that blocked fuller understanding of d=3,4. The puzzle computations are then explained (in cohomology onlyin this work, not K-theory) in terms of Lagrangian convolutions between Nakajima quiver varieties. More specifically, the conormal bundle to the diagonal inclusion of a flag variety factors through a quiver variety that is not a cotangent bundle, and it is on that intermediate quiver variety that the R-matrix calculation occurs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.00767v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the quiver Yangians associated to general affine Dynkin diagrams. Although the quivers are generically not toric, the algebras have some similar structures. The odd reflections of the affine Dynkin diagrams should correspond to Seiberg duality of the quivers, and we investigate the relations of the dual quiver Yangians. We also mention the construction of the twisted quiver Yangians. It is conjectured that the truncations of the (twisted) quiver Yangians can give rise to certain $\mathcal{W}$-algebras. Incidentally, we give the screening currents of the $\mathcal{W}$-algebras in terms of the free field realization in the case of generalized conifolds. Moreover, we discuss the toroidal and elliptic algebras for any general quivers.</description>

      <title>d-wave Eliashberg theory with phonon softening describes superconductivity in YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_x$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.05763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.05763v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide a mathematical description, based on d-wave Eliashberg theory, of the strong correlation between the experimentally observed softening of Raman modes associated with in-plane oxygen motions and the corresponding superconducting critical temperature $T_c$, as a function of oxygen doping $x$, in YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_x$. The theoretical model provides a direct link between physical trends of soft optical $A_g$ (in-plane) oxygen modes, the level of oxygen doping $x$, and the superconducting $T_c$. Different regimes observed in the trend of $T_c$ vs doping can be related to corresponding regimes of optical phonon softening in the Raman spectra. These results provide further evidence related to the physical origin of high-temperature superconductivity in rare-earth cuprate oxides and to the significant role of electron-phonon coupling therein.</description>

      <title>When Leibniz Bialgebras are Nijenhuis?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.14267v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Leibniz algebras can be seen as a "non-commutative" analogue of Lie algebras. Nijenhuis operators on Leibniz algebras introduced by Cari\~{n}ena, Grabowski, and Marmo in [J. Phys. A: Math. Gen. 37(2004)] are (1, 1)-tensors with vanishing Nijenhuis torsion. Recently triangular Leibniz bialgebras were introduced by Tang and Sheng in [J. Noncommut. Geom. 16(2022)] via the twisting theory of twilled Leibniz algebras. In this paper we find that Leibniz algebras are very closely related to Nijenhuis operators, and prove that a triangular symplectic Leibniz bialgebra together with a dual triangular structure must possess Nijenhuis operators, which makes it possible to study the applications of Nijehhuis operators from the perspective of Leibniz algebras. At the same time, we regain the classical Leibniz Yang-Baxter equation by using the tensor form of classical $r$-matrics. At last we give the classification of triangular Leibniz bialgebras of low dimensions.</description>

      <title>Exact first-order effect of interactions on the ground-state energy of harmonically-confined fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.09013v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a system of $N$ spinless fermions, interacting with each other via a power-law interaction $\epsilon/r^n$, and trapped in an external harmonic potential $V(r) = r^2/2$, in $d=1,2,3$ dimensions. For any $0 &lt; n &lt; d+2$, we obtain the ground-state energy $E_N$ of the system perturbatively in $\epsilon$, $E_{N}=E_{N}^{\left(0\right)}+\epsilon E_{N}^{\left(1\right)}+O\left(\epsilon^{2}\right)$. We calculate $E_{N}^{\left(1\right)}$ exactly, assuming that $N$ is such that the "outer shell" is filled. For the case of $n=1$ (corresponding to a Coulomb interaction for $d=3$), we extract the $N \gg 1$ behavior of $E_{N}^{\left(1\right)}$, focusing on the corrections to the exchange term with respect to the leading-order term that is predicted from the local density approximation applied to the Thomas-Fermi approximate density distribution. The leading correction contains a logarithmic divergence, and is of particular importance in the context of density functional theory. We also study the effect of the interactions on the fermions' spatial density. Finally, we find that our result for $E_{N}^{\left(1\right)}$ significantly simplifies in the case where $n$ is even.</description>

      <title>Dirac walks on regular trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.10881v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The study of matter fields on an ensemble of random geometries is a difficult problem still in need of new methods and ideas. We will follow a point of view inspired by probability theory techniques that relies on an expansion of the two point function as a sum over random walks. An analogous expansion for Fermions on non-Euclidean geometries is still lacking. Casiday et al. [\textit{Laplace and Dirac operators on graphs}, Linear and Multilinear Algebra (2022) 1] proposed a classical "Dirac walk" diffusing on vertices and edges of an oriented graph with a square root of the graph Laplacian. In contrast to the simple random walk, each step of the walk is given a sign depending on the orientation of the edge it goes through. In a toy model, we propose here to study the Green functions, spectrum and the spectral dimension of such "Dirac walks" on the Bethe lattice, a $d$-regular tree. The recursive structure of the graph makes the problem exactly solvable. Notably, we find that the spectrum develops a gap and that the spectral dimension of the Dirac walk matches that of the simple random walk ($d_s=1$ for $d=2$ and $d_s=3$ for $d\geq 3$).</description>

Specifically, by employing the powerful setup of conformal superspace, we obtain a plethora of new results in the fields of geometric and higher symmetries, (super)conformal higher-spin theory and conformal supergravity. These findings open up numerous novel research pathways.</description>

      <title>Collision of two solitons for $1d$ Nonlinear Schrodinger Equation with the same mass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12336v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the global dynamics of the collision of two solitons having the same mass for one-dimensional Nonlinear Schr\"odinger models with multi-power nonlinearity. For any natural number k, it is verified that if the incoming speed v between the two solitary waves is small enough, then, after the collision, the two solitons will move away with an outcoming speed v_{f}=v+O(v^{k}) and the remainder of the solution will also have energy and weighted norms of order O(v^{k}). This is applied to every one-dimensional model with polynomial odd nonlinearity having a stable soliton such as the cubic NLS and the cubic-quintic NLS.</description>

      <title>Least Non-Zero Singular Value and the Distribution of Eigenvectors of non-Hermitian Random Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01149v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We obtain a tail bound for the least non-zero singular value of $A-z$ when $A$ is a random matrix and $z$ is an eigenvalue of $A$ in a neighbourhood of a given point $z_0$ in the bulk of the spectrum. The argument relies on a resolvent comparison and a tail bound for Gauss-divisible matrices. The latter can be obtained by the method of partial Schur decomposition. Using this bound we prove that any finite collection of components of a right eigenvector corresponding to an eigenvalue uniformly sampled from a neighbourhood of a point in the bulk is Gaussian. A byproduct of the calculation is an asymptotic formula for the odd moments of the absolute value of the characteristic polynomial of real Gauss-divisible matrices.</description>

      <title>Ideal Magnetohydrodynamics and Field Dislocation Mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07232v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The fully nonlinear (geometric and material) system of Field Dislocation Mechanics is reviewed to establish an exact analogy with the equations of ideal magnetohydrodynamics (ideal MHD) under suitable physically simplifying circumstances. Weak solutions with various conservation properties have been established for ideal MHD recently by Faraco, Lindberg, and Szekelyhidi using the techniques of compensated compactness of Tartar and Murat and convex integration; by the established analogy, these results would seem to be transferable to the idealization of Field Dislocation Mechanics considered. A dual variational principle is designed and discussed for this system of PDE, with the technique transferable to the study of MHD as well.</description>
