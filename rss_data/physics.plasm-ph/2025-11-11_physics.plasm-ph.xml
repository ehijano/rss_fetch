      <title>Fusion alpha particle momentum deposition in thermonuclear burn dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In inertial confinement fusion, the DT fusion alpha particles carry not only energy but also appreciable momentum that is typically neglected in models of thermonuclear burn. In the central hotspot ignition scheme, the hotspot must self-heat and propagate thermonuclear burn before disassembly. Using radiation hydrodynamics simulations with a Monte Carlo alpha particle transport model, we investigate the effect of alpha momentum deposition across sub-ignition to robustly igniting regimes by hydrodynamic scaling of current central hotspot ignition designs from the National Ignition Facility (NIF). We find that the effective alpha particle ram pressure accelerates the shell at burn, reducing hotspot compression, increasing the rate of disassembly and decreasing yield. This causes a notable (~ 30%) reduction in yield at current NIF scale, with a persistent (~ 10%) penalty at larger hydrodynamic scales. These results demonstrate that alpha momentum deposition is a significant effect for present ignition-scale implosions, necessitating its inclusion in ignition criteria, burn models, and designs for high-gain inertial confinement fusion.</description>

      <title>Beam-tracing and profile evolution for localised beams in inhomogeneous plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06255v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive the beam tracing and profile evolution for the propagation of any localised beam with arbitrary profile through an inhomogeneous cold plasma. We recover standard Gaussian beam-tracing, with an additional PDE describing the evolution of the beam's profile as it propagates through the plasma. We then solve for generic families of solutions to the PDE using ladder operators, which can be chosen to reduce to Gauss-Hermite beams in homogeneous media. We importantly obtain an exact expression for the resulting beam profile, demonstrating that Hermite modes will generally evolve into a superposition of different modes during propagation through inhomogeneous plasmas, contrary to prior work on the subject. Importantly, this approach allows us to construct an inner product with orthogonality between solutions for the beam evolution, a useful feature for future analysis of the diagnostic signal received from arbitrary beams.</description>

      <title>Conceptual design of Thomson scattering system with high wavelength resolution in magnetically confined plasmas for electron phase-space measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06330v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss the conceptual design of a spatially-resolved spectroscopy system of Thomson scattering with high wavelength resolution capable of measuring the shape of electron velocity distribution functions in magnetically confined plasmas. We design a spatially-resolved spectrometer with 2560 wavelength channels. The estimated number of scattered photons in a single spectrometer channel is much larger than unity under the setup and plasma parameters at the Compact Helical Device (CHD), indicating that the shape of scattered spectra can be directly observed. We calculate the synthetic spectra with various plasma parameters and electron velocity distribution functions. The signal-to-noise ratio and accuracy of the estimated parameter are examined using the synthetic spectra assuming Maxwellian electron velocity distribution functions. We also discuss the feasibility of detecting non-Maxwellian electron velocity distribution functions with the high wavelength resolution spectrometer.</description>

      <title>The Non-thermal Energy Window for Laser-Driven Nuclear Reactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06657v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Astrophysical nuclear reaction rates in stellar environments are governed by the Gamow window, where Maxwell-Boltzmann distributions and quantum tunneling probabilities combine to produce effective reactivity. However, this conventional formulation is inadequate for the non-thermal ion distributions generated in ultra-intense laser-plasma interactions. Here, we introduce an analytical framework, based on a Target Normal Sheath Acceleration (TNSA) mechanism, to evaluate nuclear reaction rates under these non-equilibrium conditions. We identify a new effective energy window and analytical expression of the fusion reactivity distinct from the conventional Gamow window, providing a predictive tool for laboratory astrophysics experiments designed to replicate astrophysical nuclear processes using laser-driven nuclear reactions.</description>

      <title>Reduced kinetic model for ion temperature gradient instability in tokamaks with reversed magnetic shear</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06959v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using the averaged magnetic drift model and a first-order finite Larmor radius (FLR) expansion, the eigenvalue equation for the ion temperature gradient (ITG) mode in tokamak plasmas is reduced to a Schr\"odinger-type differential equation. By invoking generalized translational invariance, the model is extended to reversed magnetic shear (RMS) configurations and benchmarked against global gyrokinetic simulations from GTC, showing good quantitative agreement. The analysis reveals a characteristic double-well potential unique to RMS profiles, which gives rise to the degeneracy between the lowest-order even and first-order odd eigenmodes when the two potential wells are sufficiently separated radially. The ITG instability is also found to resonate with the magnetic drift frequency, and its maximum growth occurs when the two rational surfaces are slightly separated. These results provide new physical insight into ITG mode behavior under reversed magnetic shear and offer a compact, accurate theoretical framework that bridges simplified analytic models and global simulations.</description>

      <title>Design and operation of APEX-LD: a compact levitated dipole for the confinement of electron-positron pair plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07191v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The objective of the APEX (A Positron-Electron eXperiment) project is to magnetically confine and study electron--positron pair plasmas. For this purpose, a levitated dipole trap (APEX-LD) has been constructed. The magnetically levitated, compact (7.5-cm radius), closed-loop, high-temperature superconducting (HTS) floating (F-)coil consists exclusively of a No-Insulation (NI) Rare-earth Barium Copper Oxide (ReBCO) winding pack, solder-potted in a gold-plated-copper case. A resealable in-vacuum cryostat facilitates cooling (via helium gas) and inductive charging of the F-coil. The 70-minute preparation cycle reliably generates persistent currents of ~60 kA-turns and an axial magnetic flux density of B_0 ~ 0.5 T. We demonstrate levitation times in excess of three hours with a vertical stability of sigma_z &lt; 20 um. Despite being subjected to routine quenches (and occasional mechanical shocks), the F-coil has proven remarkably robust. We present the results of preliminary experiments with electrons, and outline the next steps for injecting positron bunches into the device.</description>

      <title>Kerr Black Hole Shadows in Dispersive Plasma: Frequency-Dependent Geodesics and Shadow Distortions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06466v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The black hole shadow, a direct probe of the event horizon's gravitational influence, has been observationally confirmed by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT). While theoretical models of shadows in vacuum are mature, real astrophysical black holes like M87* and Sgr A* are enveloped in plasma, which can alter photon trajectories through dispersion. Current understanding, based on foundational work, indicates that only specific plasma distributions allow for an analytical treatment via the separation of the Hamilton-Jacobi equation. In this work, we build upon this framework to systematically investigate the propagation of light rays in Kerr spacetime surrounded by a pressureless, non-magnetized cold plasma. We explicitly derive the separability condition, identifying the exact class of plasma densities that permit a generalized Carter constant. For these models, we compute the photon regions and shadow boundaries, characterizing how the shadow's size and shape deviate from the vacuum case in a frequency-dependent manner. Our results provide analytical benchmarks for the distortion of shadows in dispersive media and determine the critical plasma frequency beyond which the shadow is erased, offering a direct link between observable shadow features and the properties of the ambient plasma environment and providing a foundation for studying more dynamic, non-separable plasma distributions.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Antihydrogen Production via Slow Plasma Merging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06883v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We measure the time-dependent temperature and density distribution of antiprotons and positrons while slowly combining them to make antihydrogen atoms in a nested Penning-Malmberg trap. The total antihydrogen yield and the number of atoms escaping the trap as a beam are greatest when the positron temperature is lowest and when antiprotons enter the positron plasma at the smallest radius. We control these parameters by changing the rate at which we lower the electrostatic barrier between the antiproton and positron plasmas and by heating the positrons. With the optimal settings, we produce $2.3\times 10^6$ antihydrogen atoms per $15$-minute run, surpassing the previous state of the art -- $3.1\times 10^4$ atoms in $4$ minutes -- by a factor of $20$.</description>

      <title>Upper Limit of Fusion Reactivity in Laser-Driven $p+{^{11}{\rm B}}$ Reaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07124v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the averaged fusion reactivity of the $p+{^{11}{\rm B}}$ reaction in tabletop laser experiments using a plasma expansion model. We investigate the energy distribution of proton beams accelerated by lasers as a function of electron temperature $T_e$ and the dimensionless acceleration time $\omega_{pi} t_{\rm acc}$, where $\omega_{pi}$ is the ion plasma frequency. By combining these distributions with the fusion cross-section, we identify the optimal conditions that maximize the fusion reactivity, with $\left\langle \sigma v \right\rangle = 8.12 \times 10^{-16}\,{\rm cm^3/s}$ at $k_B T_e = 10.0\,{\rm MeV}$ and $\omega_{pi} t_{\rm acc} = 0.503$. These findings suggest that an upper limit exists for the fusion reactivity achievable in laser-driven $p+{^{11}{\rm B}}$ fusion experiments, even under optimized conditions.</description>

      <title>Properties of Pair Plasmas Emerging from Electromagnetic Showers in Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18843v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electromagnetic showers from high-energy electron beams interacting with a target are a promising path to creating pair plasmas in the laboratory. Here, we solve analytically the kinetic equations describing this process. Two regimes are defined by the ratio of the target thickness $L$ to the shower length $L_{\rm{sh}}$, which depends on the electron energy and target composition. For thin targets ($L &lt; L_{\rm{sh}}$), we derive explicit expressions for the spectra of produced photons and pairs, as well as the number of pairs. For thick targets ($L &gt; L_{\rm{sh}}$), we obtain the total pair number and photon spectrum. Analytical results agree well with Geant4 simulations, and it is found that significant pair escape requires $L &lt; L_{\rm{sh}}$. The divergence, density and characteristic dimensions of the escaping pair jets are derived, and a criterion for pair plasma formation is obtained. While current laser wakefield beams are not well adapted, multi-petawatt lasers may provide new electron or photon sources suitable for laboratory pair plasma production.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.19319v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent stellarator reactor designs demonstrate mostly outward turbulent particle transport, which, without advanced fueling technology, inhibits the formation of density gradients needed for confinement. We introduce ``SQuID-$\tau$'', a self-fueling quasi-isodynamic stellarator capable of sustaining density peaking through inward particle transport caused by turbulence. Temperature and density profile predictions based on high-fidelity gyrokinetic simulations demonstrate enhanced performance, significantly relaxing constraints on the size and magnetic field strength for reactor designs.</description>

      <title>Laboratory formation of scaled astrophysical outflows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21239v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Astrophysical systems exhibit a rich diversity of outflow morphologies, yet their mechanisms and existence conditions remain among the most persistent puzzles in the field. Here we present scaled laboratory experiments based on laser-driven plasma outflow into magnetized ambient gas, which mimic five basic astrophysical outflows regulated by interstellar medium, namely collimated jets, blocked jets, elliptical bubbles, as well as spherical winds and bubbles. Their morphologies and existence conditions are found to be uniquely determined by the external Alfvenic and sonic Mach numbers Me-a and Me-s, i.e. the relative strengths of the outflow ram pressure against the magnetic/thermal pressures in the interstellar medium, with transitions occurring at Me-a ~ 2 and 0.5, as well as Me-s ~ 1. These results are confirmed by magnetohydrodynamics simulations and should also be verifiable from existing and future astronomical observations. Our findings provide a quantitative framework for understanding astrophysical outflows.</description>
