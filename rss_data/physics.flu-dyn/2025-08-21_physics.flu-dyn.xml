      <title>Singularity of the axisymmetric stagnation-point-like solution within a cylinder of the 3D Euler incompressible fluid equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14550v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we investigate analytically the formation of finite time singularities in the three dimensional incompressible Euler equations under the model of Gibbon, Fokas, and Doering for vorticity stretching within a bounded cylindrical domain and under axisymmetric conditions. We derive explicit Lagrangian solutions for the vorticity, its stretching rate, fluid pathlines, and velocity components by exploiting constants of motion associated with the field dependent infinitesimal symmetries of the system. The central finding is that the existence and nature of a finite time singularity are determined exclusively by the local geometric structure of the initial vortex stretching rate near its global minimum. Whether a singularity forms depends on how flat this profile is at the minimum. Flatter profiles delay the blowup and sufficient flatness can suppress it entirely. For power law behavior near the minimum, critical thresholds for the exponent are identified which separate regular solutions from those that develop a finite time singularity. These thresholds differ depending on whether the singularity occurs at the centre of the cylinder or on a ring away from the centre, with minima at the centre requiring higher flatness to avoid blowup. This work provides a rigorous analytical framework that elucidates how the local geometric structure of the initial conditions governs the potential for singularity formation in 3D fluid flows, offering fundamental insights into the interplay between symmetry, initial data, and the development of extreme events in idealised turbulence.</description>

      <title>Bayesian minimisation of energy consumption in turbulent pipe flow via unsteady driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Turbulence accounts for most of the energy losses associated with the pumping of fluids in pipes. Pulsatile drivings can reduce the drag and energy consumption required to supply a desired mass flux, when compared to steady driving. However, not all pulsation waveforms yield reductions. Here, we compute drag- and energy-optimal driving waveforms using direct numerical simulations and a gradient-free black-box optimisation framework. Specifically, we show that Bayesian optimisation is vastly superior to ordinary gradient-based methods in terms of computational efficiency and robustness, due to its ability to deal with noisy objective functions, as they naturally arise from the finite-time averaging of turbulent flows. We identify optimal waveforms for three Reynolds numbers and two Womersley numbers. At a Reynolds number of 8600 and a Womersley number of 10, optimal waveforms reduce total energy consumption by 22 % and drag by 37 %. These reductions are rooted in the suppression of turbulence prior to the acceleration phase, the resulting delay in turbulence onset, and the radial localization of turbulent kinetic energy and production toward the pipe centre. Our results pinpoint that the predominant, steady operation mode of pumping fluids through pipes is far from optimal.</description>

      <title>Effect of transient shell formation on Shock-induced atomization of an evaporating nanofluid droplet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14733v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the shock-induced atomisation dynamics of an acoustically levitated TM-10 nanofluid droplet subjected to a coaxially propagating blast wave and subsequent compressible vortex ring, generated using a compact wire-explosion shock source. The blast wave imposes a sharp velocity discontinuity, followed by a decaying flow field and a vortex-dominated interaction that drives droplet disintegration.
  Laser-induced heating promotes evaporation, increasing nanoparticle concentration, viscosity, and agglomeration within the droplet. Progressive evaporation leads to interfacial nanoparticle accumulation, initiating a sol-gel transition when the local volume fraction exceeds the gelation threshold, and ultimately forming a solid outer shell as the maximum packing limit is approached.
  Shock interactions are systematically examined across three evaporation stages: (i) steady liquid phase, (ii) gel-shell phase, and (iii) solid-shell phase. Each regime exhibits distinct atomisation responses due to the evolving interfacial morphology. In the gel-shell regime, deformation is resisted by the viscous shell, producing a bag-on-sheet mode, followed by puncture, jetting, and eventual shell delamination. In the solid-shell regime, interactions intensify, resulting in brittle fragmentation and catastrophic fracture.
  The findings reveal how evaporation-driven interfacial transitions fundamentally alter breakup mechanisms under transient shock loading. By linking nanoparticle transport, shell formation, and flow droplet interaction across multiple timescales, this work establishes new physical insights into the atomisation of complex, multicomponent, multiphase, and transiently evolving droplets under extreme aerodynamic conditions</description>

      <title>Resolvent model-based analyses of coherent structures in Langmuir turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14773v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an analysis of the coherent structures in Langmuir turbulence, a state of the ocean surface boundary layer driven by the interactions between water waves and wind-induced shear, via a resolvent framework. Langmuir turbulence is characterised by multiscale vortical structures, notably counter-rotating roll pairs known as Langmuir circulations. While classic linear stability analyses of the Craik-Leibovich equations have revealed key instability mechanisms underlying Langmuir circulations, the vortical rolls characteristic of Langmuir turbulence, the present work incorporates the turbulent mean state and varying eddy viscosity using data from large-eddy simulation (LES) to investigate the turbulence dynamics of fully developed Langmuir turbulence. Scale-dependent resolvent analyses reveal a new formation mechanism of two-dimensional circulating rolls and three-dimensional turbulent coherent vortices through linear amplification of sustained harmonic forcing. Moreover, the integrated energy spectra predicted by the principal resolvent modes in response to broadband harmonic forcing capture the dominant spanwise length scales that are consistent with the LES data. These results demonstrate the feasibility of resolvent analyses in capturing key features of multiscale turbulence-wave interactions in the statistical equilibrium state of Langmuir turbulence.</description>

      <title>Microrheology with rotational Brownian motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14047v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Passive rotational microrheology (RMR) for evaluating the dynamic modulus \(G^*\) of a suspending fluid through the rotational Brownian motion of a spherical probe particle is validated using direct numerical simulations (DNS) of Brownian motion in a viscoelastic fluid. Two methods of RMR are compared: an inertialess RMR based on the Generalized Stokes--Einstein relation for rotational diffusion (RGSER) and the full RMR based on the generalized Langevin equation for rotation, which accounts for fluid and particle inertia. Our analysis, performed using DNS of the fluctuating Oldroyd-B fluid, reveals that inertialess RMR accurately estimates \(G^*\) for \(\omega\lambda \alt 1\), but deviates significantly at high frequencies. In contrast, the full RMR improves \(G^*\) estimation accuracy up to the frequency \(\omega \approx \tau_{s}^{-1}=\eta_{s}/\rho_{f}a^{2}\), where fluid inertia becomes relevant. However, in the ballistic regime (\(t \ll \tau_{s}\)), particle inertia dominates, making accurate \(G^*\) evaluation challenging even with the full RMR. This study clarifies the applicability range of RMR. Additionally, rotational Brownian motion is turned out to be insensitive to periodic boundary conditions, which allows direct application to various mesoscale molecular simulations, including coarse-grained molecular dynamics, dissipative particle dynamics, and fluid dynamics simulations. In conclusion, rotational microrheology offers a promising approach for detailed rheological analysis in complex systems and conditions.</description>

      <title>Parameter-Aware Ensemble SINDy for Interpretable Symbolic SGS Closure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14085v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a scalable, parameter-aware sparse regression framework for discovering interpretable partial differential equations and subgrid-scale closures from multi-parameter simulation data. Building on SINDy (Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics), our approach addresses key limitations through four innovations: symbolic parameterisation enabling physical parameters to vary within unified regression; Dimensional Similarity Filter enforcing unit-consistency whilst reducing candidate libraries; memory-efficient Gram-matrix accumulation enabling batch processing; and ensemble consensus with coefficient stability analysis for robust model identification.
  Validation on canonical one-dimensional benchmarks demonstrates reliable recovery of governing equations across parameter ranges. Applied to filtered Burgers datasets, the framework discovers an SGS closure $\tau_{\mathrm{SGS}} = 0.1603\cdot\Delta^2\left(\frac{\partial \bar{u}}{\partial x}\right)^2$, corresponding to a Smagorinsky constant of approximately 0.4004. This represents autonomous discovery of Smagorinsky-type closure structure from data without prior theoretical assumptions.
  The discovered model achieves $R^2 = 0.886$ across filter scales and demonstrates improved prediction accuracy compared to classical closures. The framework's ability to identify physically meaningful SGS forms and calibrate coefficients offers a complementary approach to existing turbulence modelling methods, contributing to the growing field of data-driven closure discovery.</description>

      <title>Interpolatory dynamical low-rank approximation for the 3+3d Boltzmann-BGK equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15990v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce two novel interpolatory dynamical low-rank (DLR) approximation methods for the efficient time integration of the Boltzmann-BGK equation. Both methods overcome limitations of classic DLR schemes based on orthogonal projections for nonlinear equations. In particular, we demonstrate that the proposed methods can efficiently compute solutions to the full Boltzmann-BGK equation without restricting to e.g. weakly compressible or isothermal flow. The first method we propose directly applies the recently developed interpolatory projector-splitting scheme on low-rank matrix manifolds. The second method is a variant of the rank-adaptive basis update and Galerkin scheme, where the Galerkin step is replaced by a collocation step, resulting in a new scheme we call basis update and collocate (BUC). Numerical experiments in both fluid and kinetic regimes demonstrate the performance of the proposed methods. In particular we demonstrate that the methods can be used to efficiently compute low-rank solutions in the six-dimensional (three spatial and three velocity dimensions) setting on a standard laptop.</description>
