      <title>Constraining the inner boundaries of COCONUT through plasma \b{eta} and Alfv\'en speed</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10397v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Space weather modelling has been gaining importance due to our increasing dependency on technology sensitive to space weather effects, such as satellite services, air traffic and power grids. Improving the reliability, accuracy and numerical performance of space weather modelling tools, including global coronal models, is essential to develop timely and accurate forecasts and to help partly mitigate the space weather threat. Global corona models, however, require accurate boundary conditions, for the formulations of which we have very limited observational data. Unsuitable boundary condition prescriptions may lead to inconsistent features in the solution flow field and spoil the code's accuracy and performance. In this paper, we develop an adjustment to the inner boundary condition of the COCONUT global corona model to better capture the dynamics over and around the regions of stronger magnetic fields by constraining the plasma \b{eta} and the Alfv\'en speed. Using data from solar observations and solar atmospheric modelling codes such as Bifrost, we find that the baseline homogeneous boundary condition formulations for pressure and density do not capture the plasma conditions physically accurately. We develop a method to adjust these prescribed pressure and density values by placing constraints on the plasma \b{eta} and the Alfv\'en speed that act as proxies. We demonstrate that we can remove inexplicable fast streams from the solution by constraining the maximum Alfv\'en speed and the minimum plasma \b{eta} on the boundary surface. We also show that the magnetic topology is not significantly affected by this treatment otherwise. The presented technique shows the potential to ease the modelling of solar maxima, especially removing inexplicable features while, at the same time, not significantly affecting the magnetic field topology around the affected regions.</description>

      <title>A decade of the fast-varying ionospheric and magnetospheric magnetic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The time-varying geomagnetic field is a superposition of contributions from multiple internal and external current systems. A major source of geomagnetic variations at periods less than few years are current systems external to the solid Earth, namely the ionospheric and magnetospheric currents, as well as associated mantle-induced currents. The separation of these three sources is mathematically underdetermined using either ground or satellite measurements alone, but becomes tractable when the two datasets are combined. Based on this concept, we developed a new geomagnetic field modelling approach that allows us to simultaneously characterise the mid-latitude ionospheric, magnetospheric and the internal induced magnetic fields using ground and satellite observations for all local times and magnetic conditions, and without prescribing any harmonic behaviour on these current systems in time, as is typical in other models. By applying this new method to a 10-year dataset of ground observatory and multi-satellite measurements from 2014 to 2023, we obtained the time series of the spherical harmonic coefficients of the ionospheric, magnetospheric and induced fields. These new time series unravel complex non-periodic dynamics of the external magnetic fields during global geomagnetic storms, as well as periodicities in the magnetospheric coefficients linked to solar activities and periodic ionospheric magnetic fields linked to lunar daily variations, contributing to a better picture of the dynamics of the external currents and magnetosphere-ionosphere interactions. Finally, new approach provides more consistent field estimates for electromagnetic induction studies, and, owing to its flexibility and on-the-fly updates, can facilitate space weather operations.</description>

      <title>Catalogs of solar wind types and their role in solar-terrestrial physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10894v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The response of the magnetosphere to interplanetary drivers depends on their type. The reliability of their identification affects the conclusions of the analysis of connections between the solar wind and the magnetosphere. In this work, we analyze the list of moderate and strong geomagnetic storms and their interplanetary sources for the period 2009 - 2019, presented in the work of Qiu et al. It is shown that some of the events in this list were identified incorrectly, and their interpretation differs in ~20% of cases from our catalog by Yermolaev et al. (http://www.iki.rssi.ru/pub/omni/) for types of solar wind Sheath, ICME and CIR, and in ~28% of cases from the Richardson and Cane catalog for ICME. Using the unadjusted list of Qiu et al. may lead to incorrect identification of interplanetary drivers of magnetic storms and erroneous conclusions. It is recommended to use the classification of interplanetary events from catalogs of events accepted by the scientific community as reference ones.</description>

      <title>Magnetic flux emergence and solar eruptions in partially ionized plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10633v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have performed 3D MHD simulations to study the effect of partial ionization in the process of magnetic flux emergence in the Sun. In fact, we continue previous work and we now focus: 1) on the emergence of the magnetic fields above the solar photosphere and 2) on the eruptive activity, which follows the emergence into the corona. We find that in the simulations with partial ionization (PI), the structure of the emerging field consists of arch-like fieldlines with very little twist since the axis of the initial rising field remains below the photosphere. The plasma inside the emerging volume is less dense and it is moving faster compared to the fully ionized (FI) simulation. In both cases, new flux ropes (FR) are formed due to reconnection between emerging fieldlines, and they eventually erupt in an ejective manner towards the outer solar atmosphere. We are witnessing three major eruptions in both simulations. At least for the first eruption, the formation of the eruptive FR occurs in the low atmosphere in the FI case and at coronal heights in the PI case. Also, in the first PI eruption, part of the eruptive FR carries neutrals in the high atmosphere, for a short period of time. Overall, the eruptions are relatively faster in the PI case, while a considerable amount of axial flux is found above the photosphere during the eruptions in both simulations.</description>

      <title>Towards advanced forecasting of solar energetic particle events with the PARASOL model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11852v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gradual solar energetic particle (SEP) events are generally attributed to the particle acceleration in shock waves driven by coronal mass ejections (CMEs). Space-weather effects of such events are important, so there has been continuous effort to develop models able to forecast their various characteristics. Here we present the first version of a new such model with the primary goal to address energetic storm particle (ESP) events. The model, PARASOL, is built upon the PArticle Radiation Asset Directed at Interplanetary Space Exploration (PARADISE) test-particle simulation model of SEP transport, but includes a semi-analytical description of an inner (i.e., near the shock) part of the foreshock region. The semi-analytical foreshock description is constructed using simulations with the SOLar Particle Acceleration in Coronal Shocks (SOLPACS) model, which simulates proton acceleration self-consistently coupled with Alfven wave generation upstream of the shock, and subsequent fitting of the simulation results with suitable analytical functions. PARASOL requires input of solar wind and shock magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) parameters. We evaluate the performance of PARASOL by simulating the 12 July 2012 SEP event, using the EUropean Heliospheric FORecasting Information Asset (EUHFORIA) MHD simulation of the solar wind and CME in this event. The PARASOL simulation has reproduced the observed ESP event ($E \lesssim 5$ MeV) in the close vicinity of the shock within one order of magnitude in intensity.</description>

      <title>$1/f$ Noise in the Heliosphere: A Target for PUNCH Science</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02255v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a broad review of 1/f noise observations in the heliosphere, and discuss and complement the theoretical background of generic 1/f models as relevant to NASA's PUNCH mission. First observed in the voltage fluctuations of vacuum tubes, the scale-invariant 1/f spectrum has since been identified across a wide array of natural and artificial systems, including heart rate fluctuations and loudness patterns in musical compositions. In the solar wind, the interplanetary magnetic field trace spectrum exhibits 1/f scaling within the frequency range from around 2e-6 Hz to around 1e-3 Hz at 1 au. One compelling mechanism for the generation of 1/f noise is the superposition principle, where a composite 1/f spectrum arises from the superposition of a collection of individual power-law spectra characterized by a scale-invariant distribution of correlation times. In the context of the solar wind, such a superposition could originate from scale-invariant reconnection processes in the corona. Further observations have detected 1/f signatures in the photosphere and corona at frequency ranges compatible with those observed at 1 au, suggesting an even lower altitude origin of 1/f spectrum in the solar dynamo itself. This hypothesis is bolstered by dynamo experiments and simulations that indicate inverse cascade activities, which can be linked to successive flux tube reconnections beneath the corona, and are known to generate 1/f noise possibly through nonlocal interactions at the largest scales. Conversely, models positing in situ generation of $1/f$ signals face causality issues in explaining the low-frequency portion of the 1/f spectrum. Understanding 1/f noise in the solar wind may inform central problems in heliospheric physics, such as the solar dynamo, coronal heating, the origin of the solar wind, and the nature of interplanetary turbulence.</description>

      <title>Cosmic ray north-south anisotropy: rigidity spectrum and solar cycle variations observed by ground-based muon detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03182v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The north-south (NS) anisotropy of galactic cosmic rays (GCRs) is dominated by a diamagnetic drift flow of GCRs in the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF), allowing us to derive key parameters of cosmic-ray propagation, such as the density gradient and diffusion coefficient. We propose a new method to analyze the rigidity spectrum of GCR anisotropy and reveal a solar cycle variation of the NS anisotropy's spectrum using ground-based muon detectors in Nagoya, Japan, and Hobart, Australia. The physics-based correction method for the atmospheric temperature effect on muons is used to combine the different-site detectors free from local atmospheric effects. NS channel pairs in the multi-directional muon detectors are formed to enhance sensitivity to the NS anisotropy, and in this process, general graph matching in graph theory is introduced to survey optimized pairs. Moreover, Bayesian estimation with the Gaussian process allows us to unfold the rigidity spectrum without supposing any analytical function for the spectral shape. Thanks to these novel approaches, it has been discovered that the rigidity spectrum of the NS anisotropy is dynamically varying with solar activity every year. It is attributed to a rigidity-dependent variation of the radial density gradient of GCRs based on the nature of the diamagnetic drift in the IMF. The diffusion coefficient and mean-free-path length of GCRs as functions of the rigidity are also derived from the diffusion-convection flow balance. This analysis expands the estimation limit of the mean-free-path length into $\le200$ GV rigidity region from $&lt;10$ GV region achieved by solar energetic particle observations.</description>
