      <title>RHIC Program, Its Origin and Early Results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08406v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: At the Brookhaven National Laboratory, experimental efforts with heavy-ion accelerators started at the AGS synchrotron in 1984 and then at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) in 1991. This chapter of a future book describes how several scientific collaborations were established and how features of the quark-gluon plasma were revealed from the four RHIC experiments during the first five years of RHIC operation.</description>

      <title>Search for jet quenching with dijets from high-multiplicity pPb collisions at $\sqrt{s_\mathrm{NN}}$ = 8.16 TeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08507v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The first measurement of the dijet transverse momentum balance $x_j$ in proton-lead (pPb) collisions at a nucleon-nucleon center-of-mass energy of $\sqrt{s_\mathrm{NN}}$ = 8.16 TeV is presented. The $x_j$ observable, defined as the ratio of the subleading over leading jet transverse momentum in a dijet pair, is used to search for jet quenching effects. The data, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 174.6 nb$^{-1}$, were collected with the CMS detector in 2016. The $x_j$ distributions and their average values are studied as functions of the charged-particle multiplicity of the events and for various dijet rapidity selections. The latter enables probing hard scattering of partons carrying distinct nucleon momentum fractions \x in the proton- and lead-going directions. The former, aided by the high-multiplicity triggers, allows probing for potential jet quenching effects in high-multiplicity events (with up to 400 charged particles), for which collective phenomena consistent with quark-gluon plasma (QGP) droplet formation were previously observed. The ratios of $x_j$ distributions for high- to low-multiplicity events are used to quantify the possible medium effects. These ratios are consistent with simulations of the hard-scattering process that do not include QGP production. These measurements set an upper limit on medium-induced energy loss of the subleading jet of 1.26% of its transverse momentum at the 90% confidence level in high multiplicity pPb events.</description>

      <title>Schottky detection techniques for ultra-rare short-lived ions in heavy ion storage rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08017v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-destructive Schottky detectors are indispensable devices widely used in experiments at heavy-ion storage rings. In particular, they can be used to accurately determine the masses and lifetimes of short-lived exotic nuclear species. Single-ion sensitivity -- which enables highest sensitivity -- has been regularly achieved in the past utilizing resonant cavity detectors. Recent designs and analysis methods aim at pushing the limits of measurement accuracy by increasing the dimensionality of the acquired data, namely the position of the particle as well as the phase difference between several detectors. This work describes current methods and future perspectives of Schottky detection techniques focusing at their application for mass and lifetime measurements of the most rare and simultaneously short-lived radio nuclides.</description>

      <title>Off-line Commissioning of the St. Benedict Radiofrequency Quadrupole Cooler-Buncher</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08021v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The St. Benedict ion trapping system, which aims to measure the $\beta-\nu$ angular correlation parameter in superallowed-mixed mirror transitions, is under construction at the University of Notre Dame. These measurements will provide much-needed data to improve the accuracy of the $V_{ud}$ element of the CKM matrix. One of the major components of this system is the radio frequency quadrupole cooler-buncher, which is necessary to create low-emittance ion bunches for injection into the measurement Paul trap. The off-line commissioning of the cooler-buncher, using a potassium ion source, determined that the device could produce cooled ion bunches characterized by a 50-ns full-width-half-maximum time width. The commissioning results also determined the trapping efficiency to be 93(1)$\%$ and the trapping half-life to be 20.0(5) s.</description>

      <title>Kaon and Pion Fragmentation Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08142v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Drell-Levy-Yan relation is employed to obtain pion and kaon elementary fragmentation functions (EFFs) from the hadron-scale parton distribution functions (DFs) of these mesons. Two different DF sets are used: that calculated using a symmetry-preserving treatment of a vector $\times$ vector contact interaction (SCI) and the other expressing results obtained using continuum Schwinger function methods (CSMs). Thus determined, the EFFs serve as driving terms in a coupled set of hadron cascade equations, whose solution yields the complete array of hadron-scale fragmentation functions (FFs) for pion and kaon production in high energy reactions. After evolution to scales typical of experiments, the SCI and CSM FF predictions are seen to be in semiquantitative agreement. Importantly, they conform with a range of physical expectations for FF behaviour on the endpoint domains $z\simeq 0, 1$, e.g., nonsinglet FFs vanish at $z=0$ and singlet FFs diverge faster than $1/z$. Predictions for hadron multiplicities in jets are also delivered. They reveal SU$(3)$ symmetry breaking in the charged-kaon/neutral-kaon multiplicity ratio, whose size diminishes with increasing reaction energy, and show that, with increasing energy, the pion/kaon ratio in $e^+ e^- \to h X$ diminishes to a value that is independent of hadron masses.</description>

      <title>Can the strong interactions between hadrons be determined using femtoscopy?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08631v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the last decades, femtoscopic measurements from heavy-ion collisions have become a popular tool to investigate the strong interactions between hadrons. The key observables measured in such experiments are the two-hadron momentum correlations, which depend on the production mechanism of hadron pairs and the final-state interactions. Given the complexity of ultra-relativistic collision experiments, the source term describing the production mechanism can only be modeled phenomenologically based on numerous assumptions. The commonly employed approach for analyzing femtoscopic data relies on the Koonin-Pratt formula, which relates the measured correlation functions with the relative wave function of an outgoing hadron pair and a source term that is assumed to be universal. Here, we critically examine this universality assumption and show that for strongly interacting particles such as nucleons, the interpretation of femtoscopic measurements suffers from a potentially large intrinsic uncertainty. We also comment on the ongoing efforts to explore three-body interactions using this experimental technique.</description>

      <title>The Early History of the Quark-Gluon Plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08720v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the historical antecedents to the field of relativistic heavy ion physics, beginning with early attempts to model the strong interaction and ending with the endorsement of a relativistic heavy ion collider in the 1983 U.S. Long-Range Plan for Nuclear Science. Particular attention is paid to two major themes: 1) A program to study high density states of nuclear matter emerging from the 1974 Bear Mountain conference and 2) Efforts to understand the predictions of QCD for matter at high densities and/or temperatures.</description>

      <title>Comment on "Surface nuclear spin relaxation of $^{199}$Hg," [J. Chem. Phys. 120, 1511 (2004)]</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08875v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The possible use of optically pumped $^{199}$Hg nuclear spin magnetometry for fundamental physics studies, particularly in the search for electric dipole moments, remains of great interest. Understanding surface-induced relaxation is necessary for the development of both large- and small-volume cells that have a long and stable nuclear spin lifetime. Such cells are critical to several ongoing experiments, including the measurement of the neutron electric dipole moment, zero or otherwise. $^{199}$Hg, due to its large mass, has a multitude of bound surface states that affect the interaction time with the surface and are an important factor in the interpretation of previously acquired data. It is shown that the inclusion of these states brings consistency to the derived surface interaction properties.</description>

      <title>Sensitivity analysis of $\beta$-decay half-life predictions for Ge, As, Zr and Mo nuclei within the mapped interacting boson model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19480v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze parameter sensitivities of the mapped interacting boson model (IBM) and boson-fermion-fermion model (IBFFM) in the description of $\beta$-decay properties of the even-mass neutron-deficient Ge and As, and neutron-rich Zr and Mo isotopes. Based on the self-consistent mean-field calculations with a given energy density functional and a pairing interaction, the IBM Hamiltonian for even-even nuclei, single-particle energies, and occupation probabilities for unpaired nucleons, which are necessary building blocks of the IBFFM Hamiltonian and Gamow-Teller and Fermi transition operators, are completely determined. A few coupling constants of the boson-fermion and residual neutron-proton interactions are only phenomenological parameters fitted to reproduce low-energy spectra of odd-mass and odd-odd nuclei. It is found that the calculated $\log{}_{10}ft$ values for the $\beta^+$ decays $^{68}$As$\to^{68}$Ge are particularly sensitive to the quadrupole-quadrupole boson interaction strength used for the parent ($^{68}$As) nucleus. We further incorporate higher-order terms in the one-nucleon transfer operators in the boson system, and find that, while their effects are non-negligible, they do not significantly alter qualitative features of $\beta$-decay properties. We report a novel application of the mapped IBM framework to compute $\beta$-decay half-lives, and show that the observed trend along isotopic chains are reasonably reproduced.</description>
