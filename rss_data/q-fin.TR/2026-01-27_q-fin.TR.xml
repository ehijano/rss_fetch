      <title>Pregeometric Origins of Liquidity Geometry in Financial Order Books</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17245v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a structural framework for the geometry of financial order books in which liquidity, supply, and demand are treated as emergent observables rather than primitive economic variables. The market is modeled as an inflationary relational system without assumed metric, temporal, or price coordinates. Observable quantities arise only through projection, implemented here via spectral embeddings of the graph Laplacian. A one-dimensional projection induces a price-like coordinate, while the projected density defines liquidity profiles around the mid price. Under a minimal single-scale hypothesis -- excluding intrinsic length scales beyond distance to the mid and finite visibility -- we show that projected supply and demand are constrained to gamma-like functional forms. In discrete data, this prediction translates into integrated-gamma cumulative profiles. We test these results using high-frequency Level~II data for several U.S. equities and find robust agreement across assets and intraday windows. Explicit comparison with alternative cumulative models using information criteria demonstrates a systematic preference for the integrated-gamma geometry. A minimal simulation of inflationary relational dynamics reproduces the same structure without invoking agent behavior or price formation mechanisms. These results indicate that key regularities of order-book liquidity reflect geometric constraints induced by observation rather than detailed microstructural dynamics.

      <title>Learning Market Making with Closing Auctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the market-making problem on a trading session in which a continuous phase on a limit order book is followed by a closing auction. Whereas standard optimal market-making models typically rely on terminal inventory penalties to manage end-of-day risk, ignoring the significant liquidity events available in closing auctions, we propose a Deep Q-Learning framework that explicitly incorporates this mechanism. We introduce a market-making framework designed to explicitly anticipate the closing auction, continuously refining the projected clearing price as the trading session evolves. We develop a generative stochastic market model to simulate the trading session and to emulate the market. Our theoretical model and Deep Q-Learning method is applied on the generator in two settings: (1) when the mid price follows a rough Heston model with generative data from this stochastic model; and (2) when the mid price corresponds to historical data of assets from the S&amp;P 500 index and the performance of our algorithm is compared with classical benchmarks from optimal market making.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Robust Financial Trading with Adversarial Synthetic Market Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17008v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Algorithmic trading relies on machine learning models to make trading decisions. Despite strong in-sample performance, these models often degrade when confronted with evolving real-world market regimes, which can shift dramatically due to macroeconomic changes-e.g., monetary policy updates or unanticipated fluctuations in participant behavior. We identify two challenges that perpetuate this mismatch: (1) insufficient robustness in existing policy against uncertainties in high-level market fluctuations, and (2) the absence of a realistic and diverse simulation environment for training, leading to policy overfitting. To address these issues, we propose a Bayesian Robust Framework that systematically integrates a macro-conditioned generative model with robust policy learning. On the data side, to generate realistic and diverse data, we propose a macro-conditioned GAN-based generator that leverages macroeconomic indicators as primary control variables, synthesizing data with faithful temporal, cross-instrument, and macro correlations. On the policy side, to learn robust policy against market fluctuations, we cast the trading process as a two-player zero-sum Bayesian Markov game, wherein an adversarial agent simulates shifting regimes by perturbing macroeconomic indicators in the macro-conditioned generator, while the trading agent-guided by a quantile belief network-maintains and updates its belief over hidden market states. The trading agent seeks a Robust Perfect Bayesian Equilibrium via Bayesian neural fictitious self-play, stabilizing learning under adversarial market perturbations. Extensive experiments on 9 financial instruments demonstrate that our framework outperforms 9 state-of-the-art baselines. In extreme events like the COVID, our method shows improved profitability and risk management, offering a reliable solution for trading under uncertain and shifting market dynamics.</description>

      <title>Resisting Manipulative Bots in Meme Coin Copy Trading: A Multi-Agent Approach with Chain-of-Thought Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08641v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Copy trading has become the dominant entry strategy in meme coin markets. However, due to the market's extreme illiquid and volatile nature, the strategy exposes an exploitable attack surface: adversaries deploy manipulative bots to front-run trades, conceal positions, and fabricate sentiment, systematically extracting value from na\"ive copiers at scale. Despite its prevalence, bot-driven manipulation remains largely unexplored, and no robust defensive framework exists. We propose a manipulation-resistant copy-trading system based on a multi-agent architecture powered by a multi-modal, explainable large language model (LLM). Our system decomposes copy trading into three specialized agents for coin evaluation, wallet selection, and timing assessment. Evaluated on historical data from over 6,000 meme coins, our approach outperforms zero-shot and most statistic-driven baselines in prediction accuracy as well as all baselines in economic performance, achieving an average return of 14% for identified smart-money trades and an estimated copier return of 3% per trade under realistic market frictions. Overall, our results demonstrate the effectiveness of agent-based defenses and predictability of trader profitability in adversarial meme coin markets, providing a practical foundation for robust copy trading.</description>
