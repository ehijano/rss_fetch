      <title>Development of a Weakly Compressible Solver for Incompressible Two-Phase Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16390v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, a novel fully-explicit weakly compressible solver is developed for solving incompressible two-phase flows. The two-phase flow is modelled by coupling the general pressure equation, momentum conservation equations and the conservative level set advection equation. A HLLC-type Riemann solver is proposed to evaluate the convective fluxes along with a simple, consistent and oscillation-free discretization for the non-conservative terms. The solver is tested against several two-phase flow problems for its robustness and adaptability on structured as well as unstructured meshes.</description>

      <title>An explainable operator approximation framework under the guideline of Green's function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16644v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional numerical methods, such as the finite element method and finite volume method, adress partial differential equations (PDEs) by discretizing them into algebraic equations and solving these iteratively. However, this process is often computationally expensive and time-consuming. An alternative approach involves transforming PDEs into integral equations and solving them using Green's functions, which provide analytical solutions. Nevertheless, deriving Green's functions analytically is a challenging and non-trivial task, particularly for complex systems. In this study, we introduce a novel framework, termed GreensONet, which is constructed based on the strucutre of deep operator networks (DeepONet) to learn embedded Green's functions and solve PDEs via Green's integral formulation. Specifically, the Trunk Net within GreensONet is designed to approximate the unknown Green's functions of the system, while the Branch Net are utilized to approximate the auxiliary gradients of the Green's function. These outputs are subsequently employed to perform surface integrals and volume integrals, incorporating user-defined boundary conditions and source terms, respectively. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is demonstrated on three types of PDEs in bounded domains: 3D heat conduction equations, reaction-diffusion equations, and Stokes equations. Comparative results in these cases demonstrate that GreenONet's accuracy and generalization ability surpass those of existing methods, including Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINN), DeepONet, Physics-Informed DeepONet (PI-DeepONet), and Fourier Neural Operators (FNO).</description>

      <title>An automated framework for exploring and learning potential-energy surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning has become ubiquitous in materials modelling and now routinely enables large-scale atomistic simulations with quantum-mechanical accuracy. However, developing machine-learned interatomic potentials requires high-quality training data, and the manual generation and curation of such data can be a major bottleneck. Here, we introduce an automated framework for the exploration and fitting of potential-energy surfaces, implemented in an openly available software package that we call autoplex (`automatic potential-landscape explorer'). We discuss design choices, particularly the interoperability with existing software architectures, and the ability for the end user to easily use the computational workflows provided. We show wide-ranging capability demonstrations: for the titanium-oxygen system, SiO2, crystalline and liquid water, as well as phase-change memory materials. More generally, our study illustrates how automation can speed up atomistic machine learning -- with a long-term vision of making it a genuine mainstream tool in physics, chemistry, and materials science.</description>

      <title>Is AI Robust Enough for Scientific Research?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16234v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We uncover a phenomenon largely overlooked by the scientific community utilizing AI: neural networks exhibit high susceptibility to minute perturbations, resulting in significant deviations in their outputs. Through an analysis of five diverse application areas -- weather forecasting, chemical energy and force calculations, fluid dynamics, quantum chromodynamics, and wireless communication -- we demonstrate that this vulnerability is a broad and general characteristic of AI systems. This revelation exposes a hidden risk in relying on neural networks for essential scientific computations, calling further studies on their reliability and security.</description>

      <title>Machine-learnt potential highlights melting and freezing of aluminium nanoparticles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16294v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigated the complete thermodynamic cycle of aluminium nanoparticles through classical molecular dynamics simulations, spanning a wide size range from 200 atoms to 11000 atoms. The aluminium-aluminium interactions are modelled using a newly developed Bayesian Force Field (BFF) from the FLARE suite, a cutting-edge tool in our field. We discuss the database requirements to include melted nanodroplets to avoid unphysical behaviour at the phase transition. Our study provides a comprehensive understanding of structural stability up to sizes as large as $3~ 10^5$ atoms. The developed Al-BFF predicts an icosahedral stability range of up to 2000 atoms, approximately 2 nm, followed by a region of stability for decahedra, up to 25000 atoms. Beyond this size, the expected structure favours face-centred cubic (FCC) shapes. At a fixed heating/cooling rate of 100K/ns, we consistently observe a hysteresis loop, where the melting temperatures are higher than those associated with solidification. The annealing of a liquid droplet further stabilizes icosahedral structures, extending their stability range to 5000 atoms. Using a hierarchical k-means clustering, we find no evidence of surface melting but observe some mild indication of surface freezing. In any event, the liquid droplet's surface shows local structural order at all sizes.</description>

      <title>Condensed Stein Variational Gradient Descent for Uncertainty Quantification of Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16462v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a Stein variational gradient descent method to concurrently sparsify, train, and provide uncertainty quantification of a complexly parameterized model such as a neural network. It employs a graph reconciliation and condensation process to reduce complexity and increase similarity in the Stein ensemble of parameterizations. Therefore, the proposed condensed Stein variational gradient (cSVGD) method provides uncertainty quantification on parameters, not just outputs. Furthermore, the parameter reduction speeds up the convergence of the Stein gradient descent as it reduces the combinatorial complexity by aligning and differentiating the sensitivity to parameters. These properties are demonstrated with an illustrative example and an application to a representation problem in solid mechanics.</description>

      <title>Universal Machine Learning Interatomic Potentials are Ready for Phonons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16551v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There has been an ongoing race for the past couple of years to develop the best universal machine learning interatomic potential. This rapid growth has driven researchers to create increasingly accurate models for predicting energy, forces, and stresses, combining innovative architectures with big data. Here, these models are benchmarked for their performance in predicting phonon properties, which are critical for understanding the vibrational and thermal behavior of materials. Our analysis is based on around 10 000 ab initio phonon calculations, enabling us to assess performance across a range of phonon-related parameters while testing the universal applicability of these models. The results reveal that some models are already capable of predicting phonon properties with a high level of accuracy. However, others still exhibit substantial inaccuracies, even if they excel in the prediction of the energy and the forces for materials close to dynamical equilibrium. These findings highlight the importance of considering phonon-related properties in the development of universal machine learning interatomic potentials.</description>

Abstract: We present an improvement of the Gillespie Exact Stochastic Simulation Algorithm, which leverages a bitwise representation of variables to perform independent simulations in parallel. We show that the subsequent gain in computational yield is significant, and it may allow to perform simulations of non-well mixed chemical systems. We illustrate this idea with simulations of Frank model, originally introduced to explain the emergence of homochirality in prebiotic systems.</description>

Abstract: We compare traditional finite volume and Physics Informed Neural Network (PINN) solvers for elliptic (Poisson), hyperbolic (advection), and parabolic (diffusion) equations in 2d settings. We describe the challenges of using traditional and PINN solvers for electron kinetic equations in collisional plasmas. The advantages and drawbacks of PINNs over state-of-the-art traditional solvers are discussed. We also consider angular moments in spherical velocity space and the potential use of ML algorithms for reduced kinetic models in the coordinate-energy phase space based on adaptive closure relations.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16735v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a unified volumetric combustion simulator that supports general wooden structures capturing the multi-phase combustion of charring materials. Complex geometric structures can conveniently be represented in a voxel grid for the effective evaluation of volumetric effects. In addition, a signed distance field is introduced to efficiently query the surface information required to compute the insulating effect caused by the char layer. Non-charring materials such as acrylic glass or non-combustible materials such as stone can also be modeled in the simulator. Adaptive data structures are utilized to enable memory-efficient computations within our multiresolution approach. The simulator is qualitatively validated by showcasing the numerical simulation of a variety of scenes covering different kinds of structural configurations and materials. Two-way coupling of our combustion simulator and position-based dynamics is demonstrated capturing characteristic mechanical deformations caused by the combustion process. The volumetric combustion process of wooden structures is further quantitatively assessed by comparing our simulated results to sub-surface measurements of a real-world combustion experiment.</description>

Abstract: Hamilton's equations are fundamental for modeling complex physical systems, where preserving key properties such as energy and momentum is crucial for reliable long-term simulations. Geometric integrators are widely used for this purpose, but neural network-based methods that incorporate these principles remain underexplored. This work introduces SympFlow, a time-dependent symplectic neural network designed using parameterized Hamiltonian flow maps. This design allows for backward error analysis and ensures the preservation of the symplectic structure. SympFlow allows for two key applications: (i) providing a time-continuous symplectic approximation of the exact flow of a Hamiltonian system--purely based on the differential equations it satisfies, and (ii) approximating the flow map of an unknown Hamiltonian system relying on trajectory data. We demonstrate the effectiveness of SympFlow on diverse problems, including chaotic and dissipative systems, showing improved energy conservation compared to general-purpose numerical methods and accurate</description>

      <title>A Gas-Kinetic Scheme for Maxwell Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16845v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a gas-kinetic scheme using discrete velocity space to solve Maxwell equations. The kinetic model recovers Maxwell equations in the zero relaxation time limit. The scheme achieves second-order spatial and temporal accuracy in structured meshes comparable to the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method, without requiring staggered grids or leapfrog discretization. Our kinetic scheme is inherently multidimensional due to its use of kinetic beams in multiple directions, allowing larger time steps in multidimensional computations. It demonstrates better stability than FDTD when handling discontinuities and readily extends to unstructured meshes. We validate the method through various test cases including antenna simulation, sphere scattering, and flight vehicle scattering. The results align well with Riemann-solver-based solutions. Finally, we examine charge conservation for Maxwell equations through test cases.</description>

      <title>Understanding Dynamics in Coarse-Grained Models: V. Extension of Coarse-Grained Dynamics Theory to Non-Hard Sphere Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17186v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Coarse-grained (CG) modeling has gained significant attention in recent years due to its wide applicability in enhancing the spatiotemporal scales of molecular simulations. While CG simulations, often performed with Hamiltonian mechanics, faithfully recapitulate structural correlations at equilibrium, they lead to ambiguously accelerated dynamics. In the first paper of this series [J. Chem. Phys. 158, 034103 (2023)], we proposed the excess entropy scaling relationship to understand the CG dynamics. Then, in the following companion paper [J. Chem. Phys. 158, 034104 (2023)], we developed a theory to map the CG system into a dynamically-consistent hard sphere system to analytically derive an expression for fast CG dynamics. However, many chemical and physical systems do not exhibit hard sphere-like behavior, limiting the extensibility of the developed theory. In this paper, we aim to generalize the theory to the non-hard sphere system based on the Weeks-Chandler-Andersen perturbation theory. Since non-hard sphere-like CG interactions affect the excess entropy term as it deviates from the hard sphere description, we explicitly account for the extra entropy to correct the non-hard sphere nature of the system. This approach is demonstrated for two different types of interactions seen in liquids, and we further provide a generalized description for any CG models using the generalized Gaussian CG models using Gaussian basis sets. Altogether, this work allows for extending the range and applicability of the hard sphere CG dynamics theory to a myriad of CG liquids.</description>

      <title>Altermagnetism and compensated ferrimagnetism in MnPX3-based (X = S, Se) heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17232v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent research interests in the non-relativistic spin splitting of electronic band structures have led to the explorations of altermagnets and other compensated magnets. Here, we show that various types of non-relativistic spin splitting can be robustly induced by constructing Van der Waals heterostructures consisting of intra-plane anti-ferromagnetic materials and suitable substrates. Using MnPX3 (X = S, Se) as an example, which has a N\'eel magnetic order, we demonstrate that altermagnetic spin splitting arises in the AA-stacking MnPX3/MPX3 (M = Cd, Mg, Zn) heterostructures, while compensated ferrimagnetic splitting emerges in the AB-stacking configurations. Combining MnPX3 and ferroelectric substrates like CuInP2S6 results in switchable spin splitting and spin-related properties that depend on band structures, which can be tuned by applying out-of-plane electric fields to non-volatilely reversing the ferroelectric polarization. In summary, our study provides a route to induce tunable non-relativistic spin splitting in experimentally synthesizable two-dimensional materials.</description>

Abstract: We propose in this work a second-order Langevin sampler for the isothermal-isobaric ensemble (the NPT ensemble), preserving a positive volume for the simulation box. We first derive the suitable equations of motion for particles to be coupled with the overdamped Langevin equation of volume by sending the artificial mass of the periodic box to zero in the work of Liang et. al. [J. Chem. Phys. 157(14)]. We prove the well-posedness of the new system of equations and show that its invariant measure is the desired ensemble. The new continuous time equations not only justify the previous cell-rescaling methods, but also allow us to choose a suitable friction coefficient so that one has additive noise after a change of variable by taking logarithm of the volume. This observation allows us to propose a second order weak scheme that guarantees the positivity of the volume. Various numerical experiments have been performed to demonstrate the efficacy of our method.</description>

      <title>AeroDiT: Diffusion Transformers for Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes Simulations of Airfoil Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17394v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Real-time and accurate prediction of aerodynamic flow fields around airfoils is crucial for flow control and aerodynamic optimization. However, achieving this remains challenging due to the high computational costs and the non-linear nature of flow physics. Traditional Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) methods face limitations in balancing computational efficiency and accuracy, hindering their application in real-time scenarios. To address these challenges, this study presents AeroDiT, a novel surrogate model that integrates scalable diffusion models with transformer architectures to address these challenges. Trained on Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) simulation data for high Reynolds-number airfoil flows, AeroDiT accurately captures complex flow patterns while enabling real-time predictions. The model demonstrates impressive performance, with average relative L2 errors of 0.1, 0.025, and 0.050 for pressure p and velocity components ux, uy, confirming its reliability. The transformer-based structure allows for real-time predictions within seconds, outperforming traditional U-net diffusion models. This work underscores the potential of generative machine learning techniques to advance computational fluid dynamics, offering potential solutions to persistent challenges in simulating high-fidelity aerodynamic flows.</description>

      <title>Predicting the suitability of photocatalysts for water splitting using Koopmans spectral functionals: The case of TiO$_2$ polymorphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17488v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Photocatalytic water splitting has attracted considerable attention for renewable energy production. Since the first reported photocatalytic water splitting by titanium dioxide, this material remains one of the most promising photocatalysts, due to its suitable band gap and band-edge positions. However, predicting both of these properties is a challenging task for existing computational methods. Here we show how Koopmans spectral functionals can accurately predict the band structure and level alignment of rutile, anatase, and brookite TiO$_2$ using a computationally efficient workflow that only requires (a) a DFT calculation of the photocatalyst/vacuum interface and (b) a Koopmans spectral functional calculation of the bulk photocatalyst. The success of this approach for TiO$_2$ suggests that this strategy could be deployed for assessing the suitability of novel photocatalyst candidates.</description>

      <title>HPCNeuroNet: A Neuromorphic Approach Merging SNN Temporal Dynamics with Transformer Attention for FPGA-based Particle Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17571v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents the innovative HPCNeuroNet model, a pioneering fusion of Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), Transformers, and high-performance computing tailored for particle physics, particularly in particle identification from detector responses. Our approach leverages SNNs' intrinsic temporal dynamics and Transformers' robust attention mechanisms to enhance performance when discerning intricate particle interactions. At the heart of HPCNeuroNet lies the integration of the sequential dynamism inherent in SNNs with the context-aware attention capabilities of Transformers, enabling the model to precisely decode and interpret complex detector data. HPCNeuroNet is realized through the HLS4ML framework and optimized for deployment in FPGA environments. The model accuracy and scalability are also enhanced by this architectural choice. Benchmarked against machine learning models, HPCNeuroNet showcases better performance metrics, underlining its transformative potential in high-energy physics. We demonstrate that the combination of SNNs, Transformers, and FPGA-based high-performance computing in particle physics signifies a significant step forward and provides a strong foundation for future research.</description>

Abstract: In current electronic structure research endeavors such as warm dense matter or machine learning applications, efficient development necessitates non-monolithic software, providing an extendable and flexible interface. The open-source idea offers the advantage of having a source code base that can be reviewed and modified by the community. However, practical implementations can often diverge significantly from their theoretical counterpart. Leveraging the efforts of recent theoretical formulations and the features of Python, we try to mitigate these problems. We present eminus, an education- and development-friendly electronic structure package designed for convenient and customizable workflows, yet built with intelligible and modular implementations.</description>

Abstract: We describe efficient differentiation methods for computing Jacobians and gradients of a large class of matrix functions including the matrix logarithm $\log(A)$ and $p$-th roots $A^{\frac{1}{p}}$. We exploit contour integrals and conformal maps as described by (Hale et al., SIAM J. Numer. Anal. 2008) for evaluation and differentiation and analyze the computational complexity as well as numerical accuracy compared to high accuracy finite difference methods. As a demonstrator application we compute properties of structural defects in silicon crystals at positive temperatures, requiring efficient and accurate gradients of matrix trace-logarithms.</description>

      <title>Zero-temperature Monte Carlo simulations of two-dimensional quantum spin glasses guided by neural network states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05978v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A continuous-time projection quantum Monte Carlo algorithm is employed to simulate the ground state of a short-range quantum spin-glass model, namely, the two-dimensional Edwards-Anderson Hamiltonian with transverse field, featuring Gaussian nearest-neighbor couplings. We numerically demonstrate that guiding wave functions based on self-learned neural networks suppress the population control bias below modest statistical uncertainties, at least up to a hundred spins. By projecting a two-fold replicated Hamiltonian, the spin overlap is determined. A finite-size scaling analysis is performed to estimate the critical transverse field where the spin-glass transition occurs, as well as the critical exponents of the correlation length and the spin-glass susceptibility. For the latter two, good agreement is found with recent estimates from the literature for different random couplings. We also address the spin-overlap distribution within the spin-glass phase, finding that, for the workable system sizes, it displays a non-trivial double-peak shape with large weight at zero overlap.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Molecular Dynamics through Informed Resetting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10115v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a procedure for enhanced sampling of molecular dynamics simulations through informed stochastic resetting. Many phenomena, such as protein folding and crystal nucleation, occur over time scales that are inaccessible in standard simulations. We recently showed that stochastic resetting can accelerate molecular simulations that exhibit broad transition time distributions. However, standard stochastic resetting does not exploit any information about the reaction progress. For a model system and chignolin in explicit water, we demonstrate that an informed resetting protocol leads to greater accelerations than standard stochastic resetting in molecular dynamics and Metadynamics simulations. This is achieved by resetting only when a certain condition is met, e.g., when the distance from the target along the reaction coordinate is larger than some threshold. We use these accelerated simulations to infer important kinetic observables such as the unbiased mean first-passage time and direct transit time. For the latter, Metadynamics with informed resetting leads to speedups of 2-3 orders of magnitude over unbiased simulations with relative errors of only ~35-70%. Our work significantly extends the applicability of stochastic resetting for enhanced sampling of molecular simulations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.19036v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using quantum equations of motion for interacting bosons, stochastic molecular dynamics simulations with quantized momenta are performed for Lennard-Jones helium-4. The viscosity of the quantum liquid is significantly less than that of the classical liquid, being almost 5 times smaller at the lowest temperature studied. The classical and quantum liquids are identical except for Bose-Einstein condensation, which pinpoints the molecular mechanism for superfluidity. The results rely on the existence of stochastic but real particle trajectories, which has implications for the interpretation of quantum mechanics.</description>

      <title>Fast Perfekt: Regression-based refinement of fast simulation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.15992v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The availability of precise and accurate simulation is a limiting factor for interpreting and forecasting data in many fields of science and engineering. Often, one or more distinct simulation software applications are developed, each with a relative advantage in accuracy or speed. The quality of insights extracted from the data stands to increase if the accuracy of faster, more economical simulation could be improved to parity or near parity with more resource-intensive but accurate simulation. We present Fast Perfekt, a machine-learned regression that employs residual neural networks to refine the output of fast simulations. A deterministic morphing model is trained using a unique schedule that makes use of the ensemble loss function MMD, with the option of an additional pair-based loss function such as the MSE. We explore this methodology in the context of an abstract analytical model and in terms of a realistic particle physics application featuring jet properties in hadron collisions at the CERN Large Hadron Collider. The refinement makes maximum use of domain knowledge, and introduces minimal computational overhead to production.</description>

      <title>Secure numerical simulations using fully homomorphic encryption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21824v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Data privacy is a significant concern when using numerical simulations for sensitive information such as medical, financial, or engineering data. This issue becomes especially relevant in untrusted environments like public cloud infrastructures. Fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) offers a promising solution for achieving data privacy by enabling secure computations directly on encrypted data. In this paper, aimed at computational scientists, we explore the viability of FHE-based, privacy-preserving numerical simulations of partial differential equations. We begin with an overview of the CKKS scheme, a widely used FHE method for computations with real numbers. Next, we introduce our Julia-based packages OpenFHE$.$jl and SecureArithmetic$.$jl, which wrap the OpenFHE C++ library and provide a convenient interface for secure arithmetic operations. We then evaluate the accuracy and performance of key FHE operations in OpenFHE as a baseline for more complex numerical algorithms. Following that, we demonstrate the application of FHE to scientific computing by implementing two finite difference schemes for the linear advection equation. Finally, we discuss potential challenges and solutions for extending secure numerical simulations to other models and methods. Our results show that cryptographically secure numerical simulations are possible, but that careful consideration must be given to the computational overhead and the numerical errors introduced by using FHE.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11245v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report the first study using active-orbital-based and adaptive CC($P$;$Q$) approaches to describe excited electronic states. These CC($P$;$Q$) methodologies are applied, alongside their completely renormalized (CR) coupled-cluster (CC) and equation-of-motion (EOM) CC counterparts, to recover the ground- and excited-state potential cuts of the water molecule along the O-H bond-breaking coordinate obtained in the parent CC/EOMCC calculations with a full treatment of singles, doubles, and triples (CCSDT/EOMCCSDT). We demonstrate that the active-orbital-based and adaptive CC($P$;$Q$) approaches closely approximate the CCSDT/EOMCCSDT data using significantly reduced computational costs while improving the CR-CC and CR-EOMCC energetics in stretched regions of the O-H bond-breaking potentials.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the convergence of a backward Euler finite element discretization applied to a multi-domain and multi-scale elliptic-parabolic system, derived from the Doyle-Fuller-Newman model for lithium-ion batteries. We establish optimal-order error estimates for the solution in the norms $l^2(H^1)$ and $l^2(L^2(H^q_r))$, $q=0,1$. To improve computational efficiency, we propose a novel solver that accelerates the solution process and controls memory usage. Numerical experiments with realistic battery parameters validate the theoretical error rates and demonstrate the significantly superior performance of the proposed solver over existing solvers.</description>

      <title>CHIPS-FF: Evaluating Universal Machine Learning Force Fields for Material Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10516v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce CHIPS-FF (Computational High-Performance Infrastructure for Predictive Simulation-based Force Fields), a universal, open-source benchmarking platform for machine learning force fields (MLFFs). This platform provides robust evaluation beyond conventional metrics such as energy, focusing on complex properties including elastic constants, phonon spectra, defect formation energies, surface energies, and interfacial and amorphous phase properties. Utilizing 13 graph-based MLFF models including ALIGNN-FF, CHGNet, MatGL, MACE, SevenNet, ORB and OMat24, the CHIPS-FF workflow integrates the Atomic Simulation Environment (ASE) with JARVIS-Tools to facilitate automated high-throughput simulations. Our framework is tested on a set of 104 materials, including metals, semiconductors and insulators representative of those used in semiconductor components, with each MLFF evaluated for convergence, accuracy, and computational cost. Additionally, we evaluate the force-prediction accuracy of these models for close to 2 million atomic structures. By offering a streamlined, flexible benchmarking infrastructure, CHIPS-FF aims to guide the development and deployment of MLFFs for real-world semiconductor applications, bridging the gap between quantum mechanical simulations and large-scale device modeling.</description>

      <title>Non-locality detection in nano-semiconductors based on lagging models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10962v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As the transistors and consequently the chips are getting smaller, the accurate investigation of heat transport at micro/nanoscale, becomes an important issue of concern. This is due to an increase in the energy consumption and the leakage currents as a result of the miniaturization which requires taking care of the thermal behavior to make sure that the device is working in the threshold temperature regime. The current work deals with a two-dimensional framework, incorporating the nonlocality in space, for more accurate investigation of the nanoscale heat transport using the lower computational cost phenomenological macroscopical Dual Phase Lag (DPL) method. The non dimensional non-locality parameter {\gamma}, which indicates the strength of the non-locality, is embedded through the modified DPL model named as nonlocal DPL. It is obtained that for the two-dimensional silicon transistor, the {\gamma} parameter in x and y direction has the same value and like its behavior at one-dimension, is linearly dependent on the Knudsen number, being 1.5 for Kn=10 and 0.015 for Kn=0.1. Also, the phase lagging ratio, B, is found to be 0.08. It should be mentioned that the non-locality effect is more pronounced for smaller systems with higher Knudsen number in which the non-Fourier behavior is more evident but contemplating the non-locality parameter in systems with lower Knudsen number, makes the results more precise. In brief, it is confirmed that taking into account the {\gamma} parameter is noteworthy for accurately predicting the thermal behavior in micro/nano scale systems using the classical macroscopical methods.</description>
