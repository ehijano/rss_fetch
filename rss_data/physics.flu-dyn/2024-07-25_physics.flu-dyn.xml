      <title>Mixed Convection and Entropy Generation Analysis of CNT-Water Nanofluid in a Square Cavity with Cylinders and Flow Deflectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17625v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study explores the mixed convection of CNT-water nanofluid within a square cavity containing heated cylinders under the influence of a magnetic field, focusing on three geometric configurations: a single heated cylinder, two heated cylinders, and two heated cylinders with a flow deflector. The impact of various parameters, including Reynolds number (Re), Richardson number (Ri), Hartmann number (Ha), wavy wall peaks (n), nanoparticle volume fraction ({\phi}), Hartmann angle ({\gamma}), rotational speed ({\omega}), and inclination angle ({\alpha}), on thermal and fluid dynamic behaviors is analyzed. Results reveal that MWCNT nanofluids consistently achieve higher Nusselt numbers than SWCNT nanofluids, indicating superior heat transfer capabilities. Introducing a second cylinder and a flow deflector enhances thermal interactions, while increasing Ha stabilizes the flow, improving thermal performance. Wavy wall peaks further enhance fluid mixing and heat transfer efficiency. Additionally, SWCNT nanofluids exhibit higher Bejan numbers, indicating a greater dominance of thermal entropy generation over fluid friction. These findings provide valuable insights for optimizing thermal management systems in engineering applications, highlighting the importance of selecting appropriate nanofluids, geometric configurations, and magnetic field parameters to achieve optimal thermal performance and fluid stability.</description>

      <title>What makes a steady flow to favour kinematic magnetic field generation: A statistical analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17627v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To advance our understanding of the magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) processes in liquid metals, in this paper we propose an approach combining the classical methods in the dynamo theory based on numerical simulations of the partial differential equations governing the evolution of the magnetic field with the statistical methods. In this study, we intend to answer the following ``optimization'' question: Can we find a statistical explanation what makes a flow to favour magnetic field generation in the linear regime (i.e. the kinematic dynamo is considered), where the Lorenz force is neglected? The flow is assumed to be steady and incompressible, and the magnetic field generation is governed by the magnetic induction equation. The behaviour of its solution is determined by the dominant (i.e. with the largest real part) eigenvalue of the magnetic induction operator. Considering an ensemble of 2193 randomly generated flows, we solved the kinematic dynamo problem and performed an attempt to find a correlation between the dominant eigenvalue and the standard quantities used in hydrodynamics -- vorticity and kinetic helicity. We have found that there is no visible relation between the property of the flow to be a kinematic dynamo and these quantities. This enables us to conclude that the problem requires a more elaborated approach to ``recognize'' if the flow is a dynamo or not; we plan to solve it using contemporary data-driven approach based on deep neural networks.</description>

      <title>Responses to Disturbance of Supersonic Shear Layer: Input-Output Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the perturbation dynamics in a supersonic shear layer using a combination of large-eddy simulations (LES) and linear-operator-based input-output analysis. The flow consists of two streams-a main stream (Mach 1.23) and a bypass stream (Mach 1.0)-separated by a splitter plate of non-negligible thickness. We employ spectral proper orthogonal decomposition to identify the most energetic coherent structures and bispectral mode decomposition to explore the nonlinear energy cascade within the turbulent shear layer flow. Structures at the dominant frequency are also obtained from a resolvent analysis of the mean flow. We observe higher gain at the dominant frequency in resolvent analysis, indicating the dominance of Kelvin-Helmholtz (KH) instability as the primary disturbance energy-amplification mechanism. To focus on realizable actuator placement locations, we further conduct an input-output analysis by restricting a state variable and spatial location of an input and output. Various combinations of inputs and output indicate that the splitter plate trailing surface is the most sensitive location for introducing a perturbation. For all combinations, the KH instability plays a key role in amplification, which reduces significantly as the input location is moved upstream relative to the splitter plate trailing edge. Furthermore, two-dimensional nonlinear simulations with unsteady input at the upper surface of the splitter plate show remarkable similarities between pressure modes obtained through dynamic mode decomposition and those predicted from linear input-output analysis at a given frequency. This study emphasizes the strength of linear analysis and demonstrates that predicted coherent structures remain active in highly nonlinear turbulent flow. The insights gained from the input-output analysis can be further leveraged to formulate practical flow control strategies.</description>

      <title>Computational Investigation on the formation of liquid-fueled oblique detonation waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17714v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Utilizing a two-phase supersonic chemically reacting flow solver with the Eulerian-Lagrangian method implemented in OpenFOAM, this study computationally investigates the formation of liquid-fueled oblique detonation waves (ODWs) within a pre-injection oblique detonation wave engine operating at an altitude of 30 km and a velocity of Mach 9. The inflow undergoes two-stage compression, followed by uniform mixing with randomly distributed n-heptane droplets before entering the combustor. The study examines the effects of droplet breakup models, gas-liquid ratios, and on-wedge strips on the ODW formation. Results indicate that under the pure-droplet condition, the ODW fails to form within the combustor, irrespective of the breakup models used. However, increasing the proportion of n-heptane vapor in the fuel/air mixture facilitates the ODW formation, because the n-heptane vapor rapidly participates in the gaseous reactions, producing heat and accelerating the transition from low- to intermediate-temperature chemistry. Additionally, the presence of on-wedge strips enhances ODW formation by inducing a bow shock wave within the combustor, which significantly increases the temperature, directly triggering intermediate-temperature chemistry and subsequent heat-release reactions, thereby facilitating the formation of ODW.</description>

      <title>Resonant excitation of Kelvin waves by interactions of subtropical Rossby waves and the zonal mean flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17937v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Equatorial Kelvin waves can be affected by subtropical Rossby wave dynamics. Previous research has demonstrated the Kelvin wave growth in response to subtropical forcing and the resonant growth due to eddy momentum flux convergence. However, the relative importance of the wave-mean flow and wave-wave interactions for the Kelvin wave growth compared to the direct wave excitation by the external forcing has not been made clear. This study demonstrates the resonant Kelvin wave excitation by interactions of subtropical Rossby waves and the mean flow using a spherical shallow-water model. The use of Hough harmonics as basis functions makes Rossby and Kelvin waves prognostic variables of the model and allows the quantification of terms contributing to their tendencies in physical and wave space. The simulations show that Kelvin waves are resonantly excited by interactions of Rossby waves and the balanced zonal mean flow in the subtropics, provided the Rossby and Kelvin wave frequencies, which are modified by the mean flow, match. The resonance mechanism is substantiated by analytical expressions. The Kelvin wave tendencies are caused by velocity and depth tendencies: The velocity tendencies due to the meridional advection of zonal mean velocity can be outweighed by the zonal advection of Rossby wave velocity or by the depth tendencies due to Rossby wave divergence. Identifying the resonant excitation mechanism in data should contribute to the quantification of Kelvin wave variability originating in the subtropics.</description>

      <title>Travel time and energy dissipation minima in heterogeneous subsurface flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18050v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a number of results concerning conditions for minimum energy dissipation and advective travel time in porous and fractured media. First, we establish a pair of converse results concerning fluid motion along a streamline between two points of fixed head: the minimal advective time is achieved under conditions of constant energy dissipation, and minimal energy dissipation is achieved under conditions of constant velocity along the streamline (implying homogeneous conductivity in the vicinity of the streamline). We also show directly by means of variational methods that minimum advection time along a streamline with a given average conductivity is achieved when the conductivity is constant. Finally, we turn our attention to minimum advection time and energy dissipation in parallel and sequential fracture systems governed by the cubic law: for which fracture cross-section and conductivity are intimately linked. We show that, as in porous domains, flow partitioning between different pathways always acts to minimize system energy dissipation. Finally, we consider minimum advection time as a function of aperture distribution in a sequence of fracture segments. We show that, for a fixed average aperture, a uniform-aperture system displays the shortest advection time. However, we also show that any sufficiently small small perturbations in aperture away from uniformity always act to reduce advection time.</description>

      <title>Experimental and Numerical Study of Microcavity Filling Regimes for Lab-on-a-Chip Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18068v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The efficient and voidless filling of microcavities is of great importance for Lab-on-a-Chip applications. However, predicting whether microcavities will be filled or not under different circumstances is still difficult due to the local flow effects dominated by surface tension. In this work, a close-up study of the microcavity filling process is presented, shedding light on the mechanisms of the filling process using experimental insights accompanied by 3D numerical simulations. The movement of a fluid interface over a microcavity array is investigated optically under consideration of different fluids, capillary numbers, and cavity depths, revealing a regime map of different filling states. Moreover, the transient interface progression over the cavities is analyzed with attention to small-scale effects such as pinning. Besides the visual analysis of the image series, quantitative data of the dynamic contact angle and the interface progression is derived using an automated evaluation workflow. In addition to the experiments, 3D Volume-of-Fluid simulations are employed to further investigate the interface shape. It is shown that the simulations can not only predict the filling states in most cases, but also the transient movement and shape of the interface. The data and code associated with this work are publicly available at Bosch Research GitHub and at the TUDatalib data repository.</description>

      <title>Incremental Singular Value Decomposition Based Model Order Reduction of Scale Resolving Fluid Dynamic Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18093v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scale-resolving flow simulations often feature several million [thousand] spatial [temporal] discrete degrees of freedom. When storing or re-using these data, e.g., to subsequently train some sort of data-based surrogate or compute consistent adjoint flow solutions, a brute-force storage approach is practically impossible. Therefore, -- mandatory incremental -- Reduced Order Modeling (ROM) approaches are an attractive alternative since only a specific time horizon is effectively stored. This bunched flow solution is then used to enhance the already computed ROM so that the allocated memory can be released and the procedure repeats.
  This paper utilizes an incremental truncated Singular Value Decomposition (itSVD) procedure to compress flow data resulting from scale-resolving flow simulations. To this end, two scenarios are considered, referring to an academic Large Eddy Simulation (LES) around a circular cylinder at Re=1.4E+05 as well as an industrial case that employs a hybrid filtered/averaged Detached Eddy Simulation (DES) on the flow around the superstructure of a full-scale feeder ship at Re=5E+08.
  The paper's central focus is on an aspect of practical relevance: how much information of the computed scale-resolving solution should be used by the ROM, i.e., how much redundancy occurs in the resolved turbulent fluctuations that favors ROM. In the course of the tSVD employed, this goes hand in hand with the question of "how many singular values of the snapshot-matrix should be neglected (or considered)" -- without (a) re-running the simulation several times in a try-and-error procedure and (b) still obtain compressed results below the model and discretization error. An adaptive strategy is utilized to obtain a fully adaptive data reduction of O(95) percent via a computational overhead of O(10) percent with a mean accuracy of reconstructed local and global flow data of O(0.1) percent.</description>

      <title>Lagrangian flow networks for passive dispersal: tracers versus finite size particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The transport and distribution of organisms like larvae, seeds or litter in the ocean as well as particles in industrial flows is often approximated by a transport of tracer particles. We present a theoretical investigation to check the accuracy of this approximation by studying the transport of inertial particles between different islands embedded in an open hydrodynamic flow aiming at the construction of a Lagrangian flow network reflecting the connectivity between the islands. To this end we formulate a two-dimensional kinematic flow field which allows the placement of an arbitrary number of islands at arbitrary locations in a flow of prescribed direction. To account for the mixing in the flow we include a von K\'arm\'an vortex street in the wake of each island. We demonstrate that the transport probabilities of inertial particles making up the links of the Lagrangian flow network depend essentially on the properties of the particles, i.e. their Stokes number, the properties of the flow and the geometry of the setup of the islands. We find a strong segregation between aerosols and bubbles. Upon comparing the mobility of inertial particles to that of tracers or neutrally buoyant particles, it becomes apparent that the tracer approximation may not always accurately predict the probability of movement. This can lead to inconsistent forecasts regarding the fate of marine organisms, seeds, litter or particles in industrial flows.</description>

      <title>Stability analysis of periodic orbits in nonlinear dynamical systems using Chebyshev polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an algorithm to identify numerically periodic solutions of high-dimensional dynamical systems and their local stability properties. One of the most popular approaches is the Harmonic Balance Method (HBM), which expresses the cycle as a sum of Fourier modes and analyses its stability using the Hill's method. A drawback of Hill's method is that the relevant Floquet exponents have to be chosen from all the computed exponents. To overcome this problem the current work discusses the application of Chebyshev polynomials to the description of the time dependence of the periodic dynamics. The stability characteristics of the periodic orbit are directly extracted from the linearisation around the periodic orbit. The method is compared with the HBM with examples from Lorenz and Langford systems. The main advantage of the present method is that, unlike HBM, it allows for an unambiguous determination of the Floquet exponents. The method is applied to natural convection in a differentially heated cavity which demonstrates its potential for large scale problems arising from the discretisation of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations.</description>

      <title>Axisymmetric Dynamos Sustained by Ohm's Law in a Nearly-Spherical Rotating Viscous Fluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17527v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work tackles a significant challenge in dynamo theory: the possibility of long-term amplification and maintenance of an axisymmetric magnetic field. We introduce a novel model that allows for non-trivial axially-symmetric steady-state solutions for the magnetic field, particularly when the dynamo operates primarily within a "nearly-spherical" toroidal volume inside a fluid shell surrounding a solid core. In this model, Ohm's law is generalized to include the restoring friction force, which aligns the velocity of the shell with the rotational speed of the inner core and outer mantle. Our findings reveal that, in this context, Cowling's theorem and the neutral point argument are modified, leading to magnetic energy growth for a suitable choice of toroidal flow. The global equilibrium magnetic field that emerges from our model exhibits a dipolar character.</description>

      <title>Automated transport separation using the neural shifted proper orthogonal decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17539v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a neural network-based methodology for the decomposition of transport-dominated fields using the shifted proper orthogonal decomposition (sPOD). Classical sPOD methods typically require an a priori knowledge of the transport operators to determine the co-moving fields. However, in many real-life problems, such knowledge is difficult or even impossible to obtain, limiting the applicability and benefits of the sPOD. To address this issue, our approach estimates both the transport and co-moving fields simultaneously using neural networks. This is achieved by training two sub-networks dedicated to learning the transports and the co-moving fields, respectively. Applications to synthetic data and a wildland fire model illustrate the capabilities and efficiency of this neural sPOD approach, demonstrating its ability to separate the different fields effectively.</description>

      <title>Conformation and dynamics of wet tangentially-driven active filaments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17602v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the impact of hydrodynamic interactions on the conformational and dynamical properties of wet tangentially-driven active polymers using multiparticle collision dynamics simulations. By analyzing active filaments with varying degrees of flexibility, we find that fluid-mediated interactions significantly influence both their conformation and dynamics. These interactions cause polymer conformations to shrink, especially for semiflexible polymers at high activity levels, where the average size of wet chains becomes nearly three times smaller, due to formation of helix-like structures. This hydrodynamic-induced shrinkage is a hallmark of active polymers, as fluid-mediated interactions have a minimal effect on the mean conformation of passive polymers. Furthermore, for tangentially-driven polymers where activity and conformation are coupled, hydrodynamic interactions significantly enhance the orientational and translational dynamics compared to their dry counterparts.</description>

      <title>Advanced deep-reinforcement-learning methods for flow control: group-invariant and positional-encoding networks improve learning speed and quality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17822v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Flow control is key to maximize energy efficiency in a wide range of applications. However, traditional flow-control methods face significant challenges in addressing non-linear systems and high-dimensional data, limiting their application in realistic energy systems. This study advances deep-reinforcement-learning (DRL) methods for flow control, particularly focusing on integrating group-invariant networks and positional encoding into DRL architectures. Our methods leverage multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) to exploit policy invariance in space, in combination with group-invariant networks to ensure local symmetry invariance. Additionally, a positional encoding inspired by the transformer architecture is incorporated to provide location information to the agents, mitigating action constraints from strict invariance. The proposed methods are verified using a case study of Rayleigh-B\'enard convection, where the goal is to minimize the Nusselt number Nu. The group-invariant neural networks (GI-NNs) show faster convergence compared to the base MARL, achieving better average policy performance. The GI-NNs not only cut DRL training time in half but also notably enhance learning reproducibility. Positional encoding further enhances these results, effectively reducing the minimum Nu and stabilizing convergence. Interestingly, group invariant networks specialize in improving learning speed and positional encoding specializes in improving learning quality. These results demonstrate that choosing a suitable feature-representation method according to the purpose as well as the characteristics of each control problem is essential. We believe that the results of this study will not only inspire novel DRL methods with invariant and unique representations, but also provide useful insights for industrial applications.</description>

      <title>A higher-level large-eddy filtering strategy for general relativistic fluid simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18012v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nonlinear simulations of neutron star mergers are complicated by the need to represent turbulent dynamics. As we cannot (yet) perform simulations that resolve accurately both the gravitational-wave scale and the smallest scales at which magneto/hydrodynamic turbulence plays a role, we need to rely on approximations. Addressing this problem in the context of large-eddy models, we outline a coherent Lagrangian filtering framework that allows us to explore the many issues that arise, linking conceptual problems to practical implementations and the interpretation of the results. We develop understanding crucial for quantifying unavoidable uncertainties in current and future numerical relativity simulations and consider the implications for neutron-star parameter estimation and constraints on the equation of state of matter under extreme conditions.</description>

      <title>Sedimenting microrollers navigate saturated porous media</title>

Abstract: Particle sedimentation through porous media is limited by the inability of passive material to overcome surface interactions and a tortuous network of pores. This limits transport, delivery, and effectiveness of chemicals used as reactants, nutrients, pesticides, or for waste remediation. This work develops magnetically responsive microrollers that navigate the complex interstitial network of porous matter. Rather than arresting on the upward facing surfaces of the pores, particles can roll and fall further, increasing transport by orders of magnitude. This work directly investigates Janus microrollers, activated by a rotating magnetic field, rolling and sedimenting though an index-matched porous medium. The mechanism of enhanced transport is determined, and the material flux is primarily a function of microroller concentration, rotation rate, and magnetic field strength. This mechanism is most efficient using a minimum number of rotations spaced out periodically in time to reduce the required energy input to greatly enhance transport. This general mechanism of transport enhancement can be broadly applied in numerous applications because the particles delivered within the porous matrix may be comprised of a wide variety of functional materials.</description>

      <title>On interdependence of instabilities and average drop sizes in bag breakup</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.16241v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A drop exposed to cross flow of air experiences sudden accelerations which deform it rapidly ultimately proceeding to disintegrate it into smaller fragments. In this work, we examine the breakup of a drop as a bag film with a bounding rim resulting from acceleration induced Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities and characterized through the Weber number, \textit{We}, representative of the competition between the disruptive aerodynamic force imparting acceleration and the restorative surface tension force. Our analysis reveals a previously overlooked parabolic dependence ($\sim We^2$) of the combination of dimensionless instability wavelengths $({\bar{\lambda}}_{bag}^2/ {\bar{\lambda}}_{rim}^4 {\bar{\lambda}}_{film})$ developing on different segments of the deforming drop. Further, we extend these findings to deduce the dependence of the average dimensionless drop sizes for the rim, $\langle{\bar{D}}_{rim}\rangle$ and bag film, $\langle{\bar{D}}_{film}\rangle$ individually, on $We$ and see them to decrease linearly for the rim ($\sim We^{-1}$) and quadratically for the bag film ($\sim We^{-2}$). The reported work is expected to have far-reaching implications as it provides unique insights on destabilization and disintegration mechanisms based on theoretical scaling arguments involving the commonly encountered canonical geometries of a toroidal rim and a curved liquid film.</description>

      <title>Robust experimental data assimilation for the Spalart-Allmaras turbulence model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.06679v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study presents a methodology focusing on the use of computational model and experimental data fusion to improve the Spalart-Allmaras (SA) closure model for Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes solutions. In particular, our goal is to develop a technique that not only assimilates sparse experimental data to improve turbulence model performance, but also preserves generalization for unseen cases by recovering classical SA behavior. We achieve our goals using data assimilation, namely the Ensemble Kalman filtering approach (EnKF), to calibrate the coefficients of the SA model for separated flows. A holistic calibration strategy is implemented via the parameterization of the production, diffusion, and destruction terms. This calibration relies on the assimilation of experimental data collected in the form of velocity profiles, skin friction, and pressure coefficients. Despite using observational data from a single flow condition around a backward-facing step (BFS), the recalibrated SA model demonstrates generalization to other separated flows, including cases such as the 2D NASA wall mounted hump (2D-WMH) and modified BFS. Significant improvement is observed in the quantities of interest, i.e., skin friction coefficient ($C_f$) and pressure coefficient ($C_p$) for each flow tested. Finally, it is also demonstrated that the newly proposed model recovers SA proficiency for flows, such as a NACA-0012 airfoil and axisymmetric jet (ASJ), and that the individually calibrated terms in the SA model target specific flow-physics wherein the calibrated production term improves the re-circulation zone while destruction improves the recovery zone.</description>

      <title>A Priori Uncertainty Quantification of Reacting Turbulence Closure Models using Bayesian Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.18729v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While many physics-based closure model forms have been posited for the sub-filter scale (SFS) in large eddy simulation (LES), vast amounts of data available from direct numerical simulation (DNS) create opportunities to leverage data-driven modeling techniques. Albeit flexible, data-driven models still depend on the dataset and the functional form of the model chosen. Increased adoption of such models requires reliable uncertainty estimates both in the data-informed and out-of-distribution regimes. In this work, we employ Bayesian neural networks (BNNs) to capture both epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties in a reacting flow model. In particular, we model the filtered progress variable scalar dissipation rate which plays a key role in the dynamics of turbulent premixed flames. We demonstrate that BNN models can provide unique insights about the structure of uncertainty of the data-driven closure models. We also propose a method for the incorporation of out-of-distribution information in a BNN. The efficacy of the model is demonstrated by a priori evaluation on a dataset consisting of a variety of flame conditions and fuels.</description>

      <title>On the relevance of lift force modelling in turbulent wall flows with small inertial particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05346v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In particle-laden turbulent wall flows, lift forces can influence the near-wall turbulence. This has been recently observed in particle-resolved simulations, which, however, are too expensive to be used in upscaled models. Instead, point-particle simulations have been the method of choice to simulate the dynamics of these flows during the last decades. While this approach is simpler, cheaper, and physically sound for small inertial particles in turbulence, some issues remain. In the present work, we address challenges associated with lift force modelling in turbulent wall flows and the impact of lift forces in the near-wall flow. We performed direct numerical simulations (DNS) of small inertial point particles in turbulent channel flow for fixed Stokes number and mass loading while varying the particle size. Our results show that the particle dynamics in the buffer region, causing the apparent particle-to-fluid slip velocity to vanish, raises major challenges for accurately modelling lift forces. While our results confirm that lift forces have little influence on particle dynamics for sufficiently small particle sizes, for inner-scaled diameters of order one and beyond, lift forces become quite important near the wall. The different particle dynamics under lift forces results in the modulation of streamwise momentum transport in the near-wall region. We analyze this lift-induced turbulence modulation for different lift force models, and the results indicate that realistic models are critical for particle-modelled simulations to correctly predict turbulence modulation by particles in the near-wall region.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15019v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this Letter, we fill in the blanks in the theory of drops under shear flow by unifying analytical predictions for steady-state behavior proposed by Flumerfelt [R. W. Flumerfelt, J. Colloid Interface Sci. 76, 330 (1980)] for unconfined drops with interface viscosity with the one of Shapira &amp; Haber [M. Shapira and S. Haber, Int. J. Multiph. Flow. 16, 305 (1990)] for confined drops without interface viscosity. Our predictions for both steady-state drop deformation and inclination angle are broadly valid for situations involving confined/unconfined drops, with/without interface viscosity and viscosity ratio, thus making our model so general that it can include any of the above conditions.</description>

      <title>On The Implicit Large Eddy Simulation of Turbomachinery Flows Using The Flux Reconstruction Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17288v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A high-order flux reconstruction solver has been developed and validated to perform implicit large-eddy simulations of industrially representative turbomachinery flows. The T106c low-pressure turbine and VKI LS89 high-pressure turbine cases are studied. The solver uses the Rusanov Riemann solver to compute the inviscid fluxes on the wall boundaries, and HLLC or Roe to evaluate inviscid fluxes for internal faces. The impact of Riemann solvers is demonstrated in terms of accuracy and non-linear stability for turbomachinery flows. It is found that HLLC is more robust than Roe, but both Riemann solvers produce very similar results if stable solutions can be obtained. For non-linear stabilization, a local modal filter, which combines a smooth indicator and a modal filter, is used to stabilize the solution. This approach requires a tuning parameter for the smoothness criterion. Detailed analysis has been provided to guide the selection of a suitable value for different spatial orders of accuracy. This local-modal filter is also compared with the recent positivity-preserving entropy filter in terms of accuracy and stability for the LS89 turbine case. The entropy filter could stabilize the computation but is more dissipative than the local modal filter. Regarding the spanwise spacing of the grid, the case of the LS89 turbine shows that a $z^+$ of approximately $45 - 60$ is suitable for obtaining a satisfactory prediction of the heat transfer coefficient of the mean flow. This would allow for a coarse grid spacing in the spanwise direction and a cost-effective ILES aerothermal simulation for turbomachinery flows.</description>

Abstract: Poiseuille flow in cylindrical and planar geometries with a simplified, pseudoplastic (shear thinning) rheology characterized by constant viscosity plateaus above and below a transition strain rate is considered. Analytical, steady state solutions for velocity profile and volume flux are formulated. Transient flow development is addressed numerically and compared to the theory in the steady state limit. Stationary flow is approached after the momentum diffusion timescale based on the spatially dominant kinematic viscosity. For large viscosity ratio and shear thinning region confined near the domain boundary, velocity distributions are quasi-plug like with large boundary to interior strain rate ratio.</description>

      <title>Vertical impact of a water jet on a hot plate from a growing drop to spray formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17185v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we experimentally investigate the impact of a submillimetric water jet on a horizontal surface heated well above the "static" Leidenfrost temperature of water. We observe the transition from a regime where a single drop grows at the impingement point to a regime of spray formation. The main control parameter appears to be the jet Weber number ($\We$). The first regime persists until $\We \lesssim 30$ whereas the spray formation occurs for $\We \gtrsim 40$. Surprisingly, we found no influence of the hot plate's temperature on the reported phenomena. We particularly focus on the second regime, where the liquid jet spreads on the plate, forming a liquid sheet that eventually lifts off and breaks into droplets. We characterized this regime by the radius $r_c$ of the liquid sheet when it is still in contact with the plate and the angle of ejection $\theta$ of the droplets. We further examine the ejected droplets by characterizing their speed and sizes. Simple models are proposed to predict the dependencies and order of magnitudes of $r_c$ and $\theta$. We also aim to predict the critical Weber number at which the transition between the two regimes occurs. Our models show reasonable agreement with our experimental data. Finally, we compare the energy transferred from the jet to the droplets with results reported in the literature for impacts on unheated surfaces, finding a difference of nearly a factor 2.</description>

      <title>Inducing exceptional points, enhancing plasmon quality and creating correlated plasmon states with modulated Floquet parametric driving</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.02148v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a method to parametrically excite low frequency collective modes in an interacting many body system using a Floquet driving at optical frequencies with a modulated amplitude. We demonstrate that it can be used to design plasmonic time-varying media with singular dispersions. Plasmons near resonance with half the modulation frequency exhibit two lines of exceptional points connected by dispersionless states. Above a critical driving strength, resonant plasmon modes become unstable and undergo a continuous transition towards a crystal-like structure stabilized by interactions and nonlinearities. This new state breaks the discrete time translational symmetry of the drive as well as the translational and rotational spatial symmetries of the system and exhibits soft, Goldstone-like phononic excitations. Below the instability threshold, our method can be used to enhance the quality of plasmon resonances.</description>

      <title>Beware of CaBER: Filament thinning rheometry does not always give `the' relaxation time of polymer solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.08440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.08440v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The viscoelastic relaxation time of a polymer solution is often measured using Capillary Breakup Extensional Rheometry (CaBER) where a droplet is placed between two plates which are pulled apart to form a thinning filament. For a slow plate retraction protocol, required to avoid inertio-capillary oscillations for low-viscosity liquids, we show experimentally that the CaBER relaxation time $\tau_e$ inferred from the exponential thinning regime is in fact an apparent relaxation time that may increase significantly when increasing the plate diameter and the droplet volume. Similarly, we observe that $\tau_e$ increases with the plate diameter for the classical step-strain plate separation protocol of a commercial (Haake) CaBER device and increases with the nozzle diameter for a Dripping-onto-Substrate (DoS) method. This dependence on the flow history before the formation of the viscoelastic filament is in contradiction with polymer models such as Oldroyd-B that predict a filament thinning rate $1/3\tau$ ($\tau$ being the model's relaxation time) which is a material property independent of geometrical factors. We show that this is not due to artefacts such as solvent evaporation or polymer degradation and that it can only be rationalised by finite extensibility effects (FENE-P model) for a dilute polymer solution in a viscous solvent, but not for semi-dilute solutions in a low-viscosity solvent.</description>

      <title>Convergence Acceleration of Favre-Averaged Non-Linear Harmonic Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01407v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper develops a numerical procedure to accelerate the convergence of the Favre-averaged Non-Linear Harmonic (FNLH) method. The scheme provides a unified mathematical framework for solving the sparse linear systems formed by the mean flow and the time-linearized harmonic flows of FNLH in an explicit or implicit fashion. The approach explores the similarity of the sparse linear systems of FNLH and leads to a memory efficient procedure, so that its memory consumption does not depend on the number of harmonics to compute. The proposed method has been implemented in the industrial CFD solver HYDRA. Two test cases are used to conduct a comparative study of explicit and implicit schemes in terms of convergence, computational efficiency, and memory consumption. Comparisons show that the implicit scheme yields better convergence than the explicit scheme and is also roughly 7 to 10 times more computationally efficient than the explicit scheme with 4 levels of multigrid. Furthermore, the implicit scheme consumes only approximately $50\%$ of the explicit scheme with four levels of multigrid. Compared with the full annulus unsteady Reynolds averaged Navier-Stokes (URANS) simulations, the implicit scheme produces comparable results to URANS with computational time and memory consumption that are two orders of magnitude smaller.</description>
