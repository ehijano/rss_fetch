      <title>Low-Complexity Detection of Multiple Preambles in the Presence of Mobility and Delay Spread</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06355v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current wireless infrastructure is optimized to support downlink applications. This paper anticipates the emergence of applications where engineering focus shifts from downlink to uplink. The current paradigm of scheduling users on reserved uplink resources is not able to deal efficiently with unpredictable traffic patterns. As a result, 3GPP introduced the 2-step RACH as a mechanism to enable grant-free (random) initial access. The first of the two steps is preamble detection in a RACH slot, and in this paper we describe a low-complexity algorithm for simultaneous detection of multiple preambles in the presence of mobility and delay spread. We provide a pathway to standards adoption by choosing ZC sequences as preambles, as ZC sequences already appear in 5G standards. We construct preambles by using the discrete Zak transform to pass from a ZC sequence of length MN in the TD to a quasi-periodic MxN array in the DD domain. There are MN quasi-periodic Dirac pulses, each corresponding to a Zak-OTFS carrier waveform, and the ZC preamble is simply the corresponding sum of Zak-OTFS carrier waveforms. We detect multiple preambles in the presence of mobility and delay spread by sampling the received signal on the MxN period grid in the DD domain. We approach detection as a compressed sensing problem. We represent a preamble as a column of length MN in the DD domain and apply discrete shifts in delay and Doppler to produce a block with O(MN) columns in the compressed sensing matrix. The superposition of multiple preambles determines a block sparse sum of columns in the sensing matrix. The correlation properties of ZC sequences result in a highly structured compressed sensing matrix, making it possible to identify constituent preambles using OST, which has complexity O(M^3N^3). In this paper, we describe an algorithm with complexity that is O(M^2N^2) in the size of an individual column.</description>

      <title>IPP-Net: A Generalizable Deep Neural Network Model for Indoor Pathloss Radio Map Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06414v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a generalizable deep neural network model for indoor pathloss radio map prediction (termed as IPP-Net). IPP-Net is based on a UNet architecture and learned from both large-scale ray tracing simulation data and a modified 3GPP indoor hotspot model. The performance of IPP-Net is evaluated in the First Indoor Pathloss Radio Map Prediction Challenge in ICASSP 2025. The evaluation results show that IPP-Net achieves a weighted root mean square error of 9.501 dB on three competition tasks and obtains the second overall ranking.</description>

      <title>Target Detection in ISAC Systems with Active RISs: A Multi-Perspective Observation Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06449v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) has emerged as a transformative technology for 6G networks, enabling the seamless integration of communication and sensing functionalities. Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS), with their capability to adaptively reconfigure the radio environment, have shown significant potential in enhancing communication quality and enabling advanced cooperative sensing. This paper investigates a multi-RIS-assisted ISAC system and introduces a novel multi-perspective observation framework that leverages the diversity of multiple observation paths, each exhibiting distinct spatial, delay, and Doppler characteristics for both target and clutter. The proposed framework integrates symbol-level precoding (SLP) and space-time adaptive processing (STAP) to fully exploit the benefits of multi-perspective observations, enabling superior target-clutter separation and significantly improving detection accuracy. The objective is to jointly design the transmit waveform, reflection coefficients of multiple active RISs, and spatial-temporal receive filters to maximize the radar output signal-to-clutter-plus-noise ratio (SCNR) for target detection, while ensuring the quality-of-service (QoS) requirements of communication users. To address the resulting non-convex optimization problem, an effective iterative algorithm is developed, combining fractional programming (FP), majorization-minimization (MM), and the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). Extensive simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed multi-perspective observation strategy, demonstrating its advantages in improving target detection performance in challenging environments.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement Learning for Enhancing Sensing Estimation in Bistatic ISAC Systems with UAV Swarms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06454v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) framework to enhance integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) networks using unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarms as sensing radars. By framing the positioning and trajectory optimization of UAVs as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process, we develop a MARL approach that leverages centralized training with decentralized execution to maximize the overall sensing performance. Specifically, we implement a decentralized cooperative MARL strategy to enable UAVs to develop effective communication protocols, therefore enhancing their environmental awareness and operational efficiency. Additionally, we augment the MARL solution with a transmission power adaptation technique to mitigate interference between the communicating drones and optimize the communication protocol efficiency. Moreover, a transmission power adaptation technique is incorporated to mitigate interference and optimize the learned communication protocol efficiency. Despite the increased complexity, our solution demonstrates robust performance and adaptability across various scenarios, providing a scalable and cost-effective enhancement for future ISAC networks.</description>

      <title>Deep Reinforcement Learning Optimized Intelligent Resource Allocation in Active RIS-Integrated TN-NTN Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06482v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work explores the deployment of active reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (A-RIS) in integrated terrestrial and non-terrestrial networks (TN-NTN) while utilizing coordinated multipoint non-orthogonal multiple access (CoMP-NOMA). Our system model incorporates a UAV-assisted RIS in coordination with a terrestrial RIS which aims for signal enhancement. We aim to maximize the sum rate for all users in the network using a custom hybrid proximal policy optimization (H-PPO) algorithm by optimizing the UAV trajectory, base station (BS) power allocation factors, active RIS amplification factor, and phase shift matrix. We integrate edge users into NOMA pairs to achieve diversity gain, further enhancing the overall experience for edge users. Exhaustive comparisons are made with passive RIS-assisted networks to demonstrate the superior efficacy of active RIS in terms of energy efficiency, outage probability, and network sum rate.</description>

      <title>TopoFormer: Integrating Transformers and ConvLSTMs for Coastal Topography Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06494v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents \textit{TopoFormer}, a novel hybrid deep learning architecture that integrates transformer-based encoders with convolutional long short-term memory (ConvLSTM) layers for the precise prediction of topographic beach profiles referenced to elevation datums, with a particular focus on Mean Low Water Springs (MLWS) and Mean Low Water Neaps (MLWN). Accurate topographic estimation down to MLWS is critical for coastal management, navigation safety, and environmental monitoring. Leveraging a comprehensive dataset from the Wales Coastal Monitoring Centre (WCMC), consisting of over 2000 surveys across 36 coastal survey units, TopoFormer addresses key challenges in topographic prediction, including temporal variability and data gaps in survey measurements. The architecture uniquely combines multi-head attention mechanisms and ConvLSTM layers to capture both long-range dependencies and localized temporal patterns inherent in beach profiles data. TopoFormer's predictive performance was rigorously evaluated against state-of-the-art models, including DenseNet, 1D/2D CNNs, and LSTMs. While all models demonstrated strong performance, \textit{TopoFormer} achieved the lowest mean absolute error (MAE), as low as 2 cm, and provided superior accuracy in both in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) evaluations.</description>

      <title>When xURLLC Meets NOMA: A Stochastic Network Calculus Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06552v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The advent of next-generation ultra-reliable and low-latency communications (xURLLC) presents stringent and unprecedented requirements for key performance indicators (KPIs). As a disruptive technology, non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) harbors the potential to fulfill these stringent KPIs essential for xURLLC. However, the immaturity of research on the tail distributions of these KPIs significantly impedes the application of NOMA to xURLLC. Stochastic network calculus (SNC), as a potent methodology, is leveraged to provide dependable theoretical insights into tail distribution analysis and statistical QoS provisioning (SQP). In this article, we develop a NOMA-assisted uplink xURLLC network architecture that incorporates an SNC-based SQP theoretical framework (SNC-SQP) to support tail distribution analysis in terms of delay, age-of-information (AoI), and reliability. Based on SNC-SQP, an SQP-driven power optimization problem is proposed to minimize transmit power while guaranteeing xURLLC's KPIs on delay, AoI, reliability, and power consumption. Extensive simulations validate our proposed theoretical framework and demonstrate that the proposed power allocation scheme significantly reduces uplink transmit power and outperforms conventional schemes in terms of SQP performance.</description>

      <title>Sidelobe Level Reduction in the ACF of NLFM Signals Using the Smoothing Spline Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06657v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The high level of sidelobes in the autocorrelation function of the nonlinear frequency modulation signal is a challenge. One of the conventional methods to reduce the sidelobe levels is to use the principle of stationary phase. In this method, the frequency function is calculated using a selection window. The signal frequency function cannot be obtained in closed form and numerical methods must be used to find it. This is usually done using the polynomial curve fitting. In this paper, the frequency function of the signal has been obtained using the smoothing spline method. The simulation results show an improvement of 10 dB to 20 dB in the peak sidelobe level of the autocorrelation function of the nonlinear frequency modulation signal compared to the previous methods.</description>

      <title>Wavelet Integrated Convolutional Neural Network for ECG Signal Denoising</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wearable electrocardiogram (ECG) measurement using dry electrodes has a problem with high-intensity noise distortion. Hence, a robust noise reduction method is required. However, overlapping frequency bands of ECG and noise make noise reduction difficult. Hence, it is necessary to provide a mechanism that changes the characteristics of the noise based on its intensity and type. This study proposes a convolutional neural network (CNN) model with an additional wavelet transform layer that extracts the specific frequency features in a clean ECG. Testing confirms that the proposed method effectively predicts accurate ECG behavior with reduced noise by accounting for all frequency domains. In an experiment, noisy signals in the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) range of -10-10 are evaluated, demonstrating that the efficiency of the proposed method is higher when the SNR is small.</description>

      <title>Multi-Carrier Faster-Than-Nyquist Signaling for OTFS Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) modulation technique is promising for high-mobility applications to achieve reliable communications. However, the capacity of OTFS systems is generally limited by the Nyquist criterion, requiring orthogonal pulses in both time and frequency domains. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-carrier faster-than-Nyquist (MC-FTN) signaling scheme for OTFS systems. By adopting non-orthogonal pulses in both time and frequency domains, our scheme significantly improves the capacity of OTFS systems. Specifically, we firstly develop the signal models for both single-input single-output (SISO) and multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) OTFS systems. Then, we optimize the delay-Doppler (DD) domain precoding matrix at the transmitter to suppress both the inter-symbol interference (ISI) and inter-carrier interference (ICI) introduced by the MC-FTN signaling. For SISO systems, we develop an eigenvalue decomposition (EVD) precoding scheme with optimal power allocation (PA) for achieving the maximum capacity. For MIMO systems, we develop a successive interference cancellation (SIC)-based precoding scheme via decomposing the capacity maximization problem into multiple sub-capacity maximization problems with largely reduced dimensions of optimization variables. Numerical results demonstrate that our proposed MC-FTN-OTFS signaling scheme achieves significantly higher capacity than traditional Nyquist-criterion-based OTFS systems. Moreover, the SIC-based precoding scheme can effectively reduce the complexity of MIMO capacity maximization, while attaining performance close to the optimal EVD-based precoding scheme.</description>

      <title>Robust Phantom-Assisted Framework for Multi-Person Localization and Vital Signs Monitoring Using MIMO FMCW Radar</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06755v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rising prevalence of cardiovascular and respiratory disorders and an aging global population, healthcare systems face increasing pressure to adopt efficient, non-contact vital sign monitoring (NCVSM) solutions. This study introduces a robust framework for multi-person localization and vital signs monitoring, using multiple-input-multiple-output frequency-modulated continuous wave radar, addressing challenges in real-world, cluttered environments. Two key contributions are presented. First, a custom hardware phantom was developed to simulate multi-person NCVSM scenarios, utilizing recorded thoracic impedance signals to replicate realistic cardiopulmonary dynamics. The phantom's design facilitates repeatable and rapid validation of radar systems and algorithms under diverse conditions to accelerate deployment in human monitoring. Second, aided by the phantom, we designed a robust algorithm for multi-person localization utilizing joint sparsity and cardiopulmonary properties, alongside harmonics-resilient dictionary-based vital signs estimation, to mitigate interfering respiration harmonics. Additionally, an adaptive signal refinement procedure is introduced to enhance the accuracy of continuous NCVSM by leveraging the continuity of the estimates. Performance was validated and compared to existing techniques through 12 phantom trials and 12 human trials, including both single- and multi-person scenarios, demonstrating superior localization and NCVSM performance. For example, in multi-person human trials, our method achieved average respiration rate estimation accuracies of 94.14%, 98.12%, and 98.69% within error thresholds of 2, 3, and 4 breaths per minute, respectively, and heart rate accuracies of 87.10%, 94.12%, and 95.54% within the same thresholds. These results highlight the potential of this framework for reliable multi-person NCVSM in healthcare and IoT applications.</description>

      <title>Gaussian Integral based Bayesian Smoother</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06881v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work introduces the Gaussian integration to address a smoothing problem of a nonlinear stochastic state space model. The probability densities of states at each time instant are assumed to be Gaussian, and their means and covariances are evaluated by utilizing the odd-even properties of Gaussian integral, which are further utilized to realize Rauch-Tung-Striebel (RTS) smoothing expressions. Given that the Gaussian integration provides an exact solution for the integral of a polynomial function over a Gaussian probability density function, it is anticipated to provide more accurate results than other existing Gaussian approximation-based smoothers such as extended Kalman, cubature Kalman, and unscented Kalman smoothers, especially when polynomial types of nonlinearity are present in the state space models. The developed smoothing algorithm is applied to the Van der Pol oscillator, where the nonlinearity associated with their dynamics is represented using polynomial functions. Simulation results are provided to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed algorithm.</description>

      <title>OpenGERT: Open Source Automated Geometry Extraction with Geometric and Electromagnetic Sensitivity Analyses for Ray-Tracing Propagation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06945v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate RF propagation modeling in urban environments is critical for developing digital spectrum twins and optimizing wireless communication systems. We introduce OpenGERT, an open-source automated Geometry Extraction tool for Ray Tracing, which collects and processes terrain and building data from OpenStreetMap, Microsoft Global ML Building Footprints, and USGS elevation data. Using the Blender Python API, it creates detailed urban models for high-fidelity simulations with NVIDIA Sionna RT. We perform sensitivity analyses to examine how variations in building height, position, and electromagnetic material properties affect ray-tracing accuracy. Specifically, we present pairwise dispersion plots of channel statistics (path gain, mean excess delay, delay spread, link outage, and Rician K-factor) and investigate how their sensitivities change with distance from transmitters. We also visualize the variance of these statistics for selected transmitter locations to gain deeper insights. Our study covers Munich and Etoile scenes, each with 10 transmitter locations. For each location, we apply five types of perturbations: material, position, height, height-position, and all combined, with 50 perturbations each. Results show that small changes in permittivity and conductivity minimally affect channel statistics, whereas variations in building height and position significantly alter all statistics, even with noise standard deviations of 1 meter in height and 0.4 meters in position. These findings highlight the importance of precise environmental modeling for accurate propagation predictions, essential for digital spectrum twins and advanced communication networks. The code for geometry extraction and sensitivity analyses is available at github.com/serhatadik/OpenGERT/.</description>

      <title>Advancing Single-Snapshot DOA Estimation with Siamese Neural Networks for Sparse Linear Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07008v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Single-snapshot signal processing in sparse linear arrays has become increasingly vital, particularly in dynamic environments like automotive radar systems, where only limited snapshots are available. These arrays are often utilized either to cut manufacturing costs or result from unintended antenna failures, leading to challenges such as high sidelobe levels and compromised accuracy in direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation. Despite deep learning's success in tasks such as DOA estimation, the need for extensive training data to increase target numbers or improve angular resolution poses significant challenges.

      <title>Effective DoF-Oriented Optimal Antenna Spacing in Near-Field XL-MIMO Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07062v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This letter investigates the optimal antenna spacing for a near-field XL-MIMO communication system from the perspective of the array gain. Specifically, using the Green's function-based channel model, the letter analyzes the channel capacity, which is related to the effective degrees-of-freedom (EDoF). Then, the letter further investigates the applicability of two EDoF estimation methods. To increase EDoF, this letter focuses on analyzing the impact of antenna spacing. Furthermore, from the perspective of the array gain, the letter derives an approximate closed-form expression of the optimal antenna spacing, at which EDoF is maximized and the array gain at the antenna nearest to the focused antenna of the transmit array becomes zero. Finally, numerical results verify the main results of this letter.</description>

      <title>Reducing Latency by Eliminating CSIT Feedback: FDD Downlink MIMO Precoding Without CSIT Feedback for Internet-of-Things Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07094v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel framework for low-latency frequency division duplex (FDD) multi-input multi-output (MIMO) transmission with Internet of Things (IoT) communications. Our key idea is eliminating feedback associated with downlink channel state information at the transmitter (CSIT) acquisition. Instead, we propose to reconstruct downlink CSIT from uplink reference signals by exploiting the frequency invariance property on channel parameters. Nonetheless, the frequency disparity between the uplink and downlink makes it impossible to get perfect downlink CSIT, resulting in substantial interference. To address this, we formulate a max-min fairness problem and propose a rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA)-aided efficient precoding method. In particular, to fully harness the potential benefits of RSMA, we propose a method that approximates the error covariance matrix and incorporates it into the precoder optimization process. This approach effectively accounts for the impact of imperfect CSIT, enabling the design of a robust precoder that efficiently handles CSIT inaccuracies. Simulation results demonstrate that our framework outperforms other baseline methods in terms of the minimum spectral efficiency when no direct CSI feedback is used. Moreover, we show that our framework significantly reduces communication latency compared to conventional CSI feedback-based methods, underscoring its effectiveness in enhancing latency performance for IoT communications.</description>

      <title>Dual-Function Beamforming Design For Multi-Target Localization and Reliable Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the transmit beamforming design for multiple-input multiple-output systems to support both multi-target localization and multi-user communications. To enhance the target localization performance, we derive the asymptotic Cram\'{e}r-Rao bound (CRB) for target angle estimation by assuming that the receive array is linear and uniform. Then we formulate a beamforming design problem based on minimizing an upper bound on the asymptotic CRB (which is shown to be equivalent to {maximizing} the harmonic mean of the weighted beampattern responses at the target directions). Moreover, we impose a constraint on the SINR of each received communication signal to guarantee reliable communication performance. Two iterative algorithms are derived to tackle the non-convex design problem: one is based on the alternating direction method of multipliers, and the other uses the majorization-minimization technique to solve an equivalent minimax problem. Numerical results show that, through elaborate dual-function beamforming matrix design, the proposed algorithms can simultaneously achieve superior angle estimation performance as well as high-quality multi-user communications.</description>

      <title>Synesthesia of Machines Based Multi-Modal Intelligent V2V Channel Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel sixth-generation (6G) multi-modal intelligent vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) channel model from light detection and ranging (LiDAR) point clouds based on Synesthesia of Machines (SoM). To explore the mapping relationship between physical environment and electromagnetic space, a new V2V high-fidelity mixed sensing-communication integration simulation dataset with different vehicular traffic densities (VTDs) is constructed. Based on the constructed dataset, a novel scatterer recognition (ScaR) algorithm utilizing neural network SegNet is developed to recognize scatterer spatial attributes from LiDAR point clouds via SoM. In the developed ScaR algorithm, the mapping relationship between LiDAR point clouds and scatterers is explored, where the distribution of scatterers is obtained in the form of grid maps. Furthermore, scatterers are distinguished into dynamic and static scatterers based on LiDAR point cloud features, where parameters, e.g., distance, angle, and number, related to scatterers are determined. Through ScaR, dynamic and static scatterers change with the variation of LiDAR point clouds over time, which precisely models channel non-stationarity and consistency under different VTDs. Some important channel statistical properties, such as time-frequency correlation function (TF-CF) and Doppler power spectral density (DPSD), are obtained. Simulation results match well with ray-tracing (RT)-based results, thus demonstrating the necessity of exploring the mapping relationship and the utility of the proposed model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07459v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given the importance of datasets for sensing-communication integration research, a novel simulation platform for constructing communication and multi-modal sensory dataset is developed. The developed platform integrates three high-precision software, i.e., AirSim, WaveFarer, and Wireless InSite, and further achieves in-depth integration and precise alignment of them. Based on the developed platform, a new synthetic intelligent multi-modal sensing-communication dataset for Synesthesia of Machines (SoM), named SynthSoM, is proposed. The SynthSoM dataset contains various air-ground multi-link cooperative scenarios with comprehensive conditions, including multiple weather conditions, times of the day, intelligent agent densities, frequency bands, and antenna types. The SynthSoM dataset encompasses multiple data modalities, including radio-frequency (RF) channel large-scale and small-scale fading data, RF millimeter wave (mmWave) radar sensory data, and non-RF sensory data, e.g., RGB images, depth maps, and light detection and ranging (LiDAR) point clouds. The quality of SynthSoM dataset is validated via statistics-based qualitative inspection and evaluation metrics through machine learning (ML) via real-world measurements. The SynthSoM dataset is open-sourced and provides consistent data for cross-comparing SoM-related algorithms.</description>

      <title>Optimized Sampling for Non-Line-of-Sight Imaging Using Modified Fast Fourier Transforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05244v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-line-of-Sight (NLOS) imaging systems collect light at a diffuse relay surface and input this measurement into computational algorithms that output a 3D volumetric reconstruction. These algorithms utilize the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to accelerate the reconstruction process but require both input and output to be sampled spatially with uniform grids. However, the geometry of NLOS imaging inherently results in non-uniform sampling on the relay surface when using multi-pixel detector arrays, even though such arrays significantly reduce acquisition times. Furthermore, using these arrays increases the data rate required for sensor readout, posing challenges for real-world deployment. In this work, we utilize the phasor field framework to demonstrate that existing NLOS imaging setups typically oversample the relay surface spatially, explaining why the measurement can be compressed without significantly sacrificing reconstruction quality. This enables us to utilize the Non-Uniform Fast Fourier Transform (NUFFT) to reconstruct from sparse measurements acquired from irregularly sampled relay surfaces of arbitrary shapes. Furthermore, we utilize the NUFFT to reconstruct at arbitrary locations in the hidden volume, ensuring flexible sampling schemes for both the input and output. Finally, we utilize the Scaled Fast Fourier Transform (SFFT) to reconstruct larger volumes without increasing the number of samples stored in memory. All algorithms introduced in this paper preserve the computational complexity of FFT-based methods, ensuring scalability for practical NLOS imaging applications.</description>

      <title>On How Traffic Signals Impact the Fundamental Diagrams of Urban Roads</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.06306v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Being widely adopted by the transportation and planning practitioners, the fundamental diagram (FD) is the primary tool used to relate the key macroscopic traffic variables of speed, flow, and density. We empirically analyze the relation between vehicular space-mean speeds and flows given different signal settings and postulate a parsimonious parametric function form of the traditional FD where its function parameters are explicitly modeled as a function of the signal plan factors. We validate the proposed formulation using data from signalized urban road segments in Salt Lake City, Utah, USA. The proposed formulation builds our understanding of how changes to signal settings impact the FDs, and more generally the congestion patterns, of signalized urban segments.</description>

      <title>Over-the-Air FEEL with Integrated Sensing: Joint Scheduling and Beamforming Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06334v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Employing wireless systems with dual sensing and communications functionalities is becoming critical in next generation of wireless networks. In this paper, we propose a robust design for over-the-air federated edge learning (OTA-FEEL) that leverages sensing capabilities at the parameter server (PS) to mitigate the impact of target echoes on the analog model aggregation. We first derive novel expressions for the Cramer-Rao bound of the target response and mean squared error (MSE) of the estimated global model to measure radar sensing and model aggregation quality, respectively. Then, we develop a joint scheduling and beamforming framework that optimizes the OTA-FEEL performance while keeping the sensing and communication quality, determined respectively in terms of Cramer-Rao bound and achievable downlink rate, in a desired range. The resulting scheduling problem reduces to a combinatorial mixed-integer nonlinear programming problem (MINLP). We develop a low-complexity hierarchical method based on the matching pursuit algorithm used widely for sparse recovery in the literature of compressed sensing. The proposed algorithm uses a step-wise strategy to omit the least effective devices in each iteration based on a metric that captures both the aggregation and sensing quality of the system. It further invokes alternating optimization scheme to iteratively update the downlink beamforming and uplink post-processing by marginally optimizing them in each iteration. Convergence and complexity analysis of the proposed algorithm is presented. Numerical evaluations on MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm. The results show that by leveraging accurate sensing, the target echoes on the uplink signal can be effectively suppressed, ensuring the quality of model aggregation to remain intact despite the interference.</description>

      <title>Ptychography using Blind Multi-Mode PMACE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06470v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ptychography is an imaging technique that enables nanometer-scale reconstruction of complex transmittance images by scanning objects with overlapping illumination patterns. However, the illumination function is typically unknown, which presents challenges for reconstruction, especially when using partially coherent light sources.
  In this paper, we introduce Blind Multi-Mode Projected Multi-Agent Consensus Equilibrium (BM-PMACE) for blind ptychographic reconstruction. We extend the PMACE framework for distributed inverse problems to jointly estimate the complex transmittance image and multiple, unknown, partially coherent probe functions. Importantly, our method maintains local probe estimates to exploit complementary information at multiple probe locations. Our method also incorporates a dynamic strategy for integrating additional probe modes. Through experimental simulations and validations using both synthetic and measured data, we demonstrate that BM-PMACE outperforms existing approaches in reconstruction quality and convergence rate.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.06526v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems are poised to revolutionize next-generation wireless networks by enabling simultaneous sensing and communication (S\&amp;C). This survey comprehensively reviews UAV-ISAC systems, highlighting foundational concepts, key advancements, and future research directions. We explore recent advancements in UAV-based ISAC systems from various perspectives and objectives, including advanced channel estimation (CE), beam tracking, and system throughput optimization under joint sensing and communication S\&amp;C constraints. Additionally, we examine weighted sum rate (WSR) and sensing trade-offs, delay and age of information (AoI) minimization, energy efficiency (EE), and security enhancement. These applications highlight the potential of UAV-based ISAC systems to improve spectrum utilization, enhance communication reliability, reduce latency, and optimize energy consumption across diverse domains, including smart cities, disaster relief, and defense operations. The survey also features summary tables for comparative analysis of existing methodologies, emphasizing performance, limitations, and effectiveness in addressing various challenges. By synthesizing recent advancements and identifying open research challenges, this survey aims to be a valuable resource for developing efficient, adaptive, and secure UAV-based ISAC systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.06545v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Low harvested energy poses a significant challenge to sustaining continuous communication in energy harvesting (EH)-powered wireless sensor networks. This is mainly due to intermittent and limited power availability from radio frequency signals. In this paper, we introduce a novel energy-aware resource allocation problem aimed at enabling the asynchronous accumulate-then-transmit protocol, offering an alternative to the extensively studied harvest-then-transmit approach. Specifically, we jointly optimize power allocation and time fraction dedicated to EH to maximize the average long-term system throughput, accounting for both data and energy queue lengths. By leveraging inner approximation and network utility maximization techniques, we develop a simple yet efficient iterative algorithm that guarantees at least a local optimum and achieves long-term utility improvement. Numerical results highlight the proposed approach's effectiveness in terms of both queue length and sustained system throughput.</description>

Abstract: The cumulative distribution function (CDF) is fundamental due to its ability to reveal information about random variables, making it essential in studies that require privacy-preserving methods to protect sensitive data. This paper introduces a novel privacy-preserving CDF method inspired by the functional analysis and functional mechanism. Our approach projects the empirical CDF into a predefined space, approximating it using specific functions, and protects the coefficients to achieve a differentially private empirical CDF. Compared to existing methods like histogram queries and adaptive quantiles, our method is preferable in decentralized settings and scenarios where CDFs must be updated with newly collected data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.06700v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we address a crucial but often overlooked issue in applying reinforcement learning (RL) to radio resource management (RRM) in wireless communications: the mismatch between the discounted reward RL formulation and the undiscounted goal of wireless network optimization. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to systematically investigate this discrepancy, starting with a discussion of the problem formulation followed by simulations that quantify the extent of the gap. To bridge this gap, we introduce the use of average reward RL, a method that aligns more closely with the long-term objectives of RRM. We propose a new method called the Average Reward Off policy Soft Actor Critic (ARO SAC) is an adaptation of the well known Soft Actor Critic algorithm in the average reward framework. This new method achieves significant performance improvement our simulation results demonstrate a 15% gain in the system performance over the traditional discounted reward RL approach, underscoring the potential of average reward RL in enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of wireless network optimization.</description>

      <title>Integrated Sensing and Edge AI: Realizing Intelligent Perception in 6G</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.06726v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sensing and edge artificial intelligence (AI) are envisioned as two essential and interconnected functions in sixth-generation (6G) mobile networks. On the one hand, sensing-empowered applications rely on powerful AI models to extract features and understand semantics from ubiquitous wireless sensors. On the other hand, the massive amount of sensory data serves as the fuel to continuously refine edge AI models. This deep integration of sensing and edge AI has given rise to a new task-oriented paradigm known as integrated sensing and edge AI (ISEA), which features a holistic design approach to communication, AI computation, and sensing for optimal sensing-task performance. In this article, we present a comprehensive survey for ISEA. We first provide technical preliminaries for sensing, edge AI, and new communication paradigms in ISEA. Then, we study several use cases of ISEA to demonstrate its practical relevance and introduce current standardization and industrial progress. Next, the design principles, metrics, tradeoffs, and architectures of ISEA are established, followed by a thorough overview of ISEA techniques, including digital air interface, over-the-air computation, and advanced signal processing. Its interplay with various 6G advancements, e.g., new physical-layer and networking techniques, are presented. Finally, we present future research opportunities in ISEA, including the integration of foundation models, convergence of ISEA and integrated sensing and communications (ISAC), and ultra-low-latency ISEA.</description>

Abstract: The human ear offers a unique opportunity for cardiac monitoring due to its physiological and practical advantages. However, existing earable solutions require additional hardware and complex processing, posing challenges for commercial True Wireless Stereo (TWS) earbuds which are limited by their form factor and resources. In this paper, we propose TWSCardio, a novel system that repurposes the IMU sensors in TWS earbuds for cardiac monitoring. Our key finding is that these sensors can capture in-ear ballistocardiogram (BCG) signals. TWSCardio reuses the unstable Bluetooth channel to stream the IMU data to a smartphone for BCG processing. It incorporates a signal enhancement framework to address issues related to missing data and low sampling rate, while mitigating motion artifacts by fusing multi-axis information. Furthermore, it employs a region-focused signal reconstruction method to translate the multi-axis in-ear BCG signals into fine-grained seismocardiogram (SCG) signals. We have implemented TWSCardio as an efficient real-time app. Our experiments on 100 subjects verify that TWSCardio can accurately reconstruct cardiac signals while showing resilience to motion artifacts, missing data, and low sampling rates. Our case studies further demonstrate that TWSCardio can support diverse cardiac monitoring applications.</description>

      <title>OFDM-based JCAS under Attack: The Dual Threat of Spoofing and Jamming in WLAN Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06798v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study reveals the vulnerabilities of Wireless Local Area Networks (WLAN) sensing, under the scope of joint communication and sensing (JCAS), focusing on target spoofing and deceptive jamming techniques. We use orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) to explore how adversaries can exploit WLAN's sensing capabilities to inject false targets and disrupt normal operations. Unlike traditional methods that require sophisticated digital radio-frequency memory hardware, we demonstrate that much simpler software-defined radios can effectively serve as deceptive jammers in WLAN settings. Through comprehensive modeling and practical experiments, we show how deceptive jammers can manipulate the range-Doppler map (RDM) by altering signal integrity, thereby posing significant security threats to OFDM-based JCAS systems. Our findings comprehensively evaluate jammer impact on RDMs and propose several jamming strategies that vary in complexity and detectability.</description>

      <title>Kolmogorov-Arnold Recurrent Network for Short Term Load Forecasting Across Diverse Consumers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06965v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Load forecasting plays a crucial role in energy management, directly impacting grid stability, operational efficiency, cost reduction, and environmental sustainability. Traditional Vanilla Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) face issues such as vanishing and exploding gradients, whereas sophisticated RNNs such as LSTMs have shown considerable success in this domain. However, these models often struggle to accurately capture complex and sudden variations in energy consumption, and their applicability is typically limited to specific consumer types, such as offices or schools. To address these challenges, this paper proposes the Kolmogorov-Arnold Recurrent Network (KARN), a novel load forecasting approach that combines the flexibility of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks with RNN's temporal modeling capabilities. KARN utilizes learnable temporal spline functions and edge-based activations to better model non-linear relationships in load data, making it adaptable across a diverse range of consumer types. The proposed KARN model was rigorously evaluated on a variety of real-world datasets, including student residences, detached homes, a home with electric vehicle charging, a townhouse, and industrial buildings. Across all these consumer categories, KARN consistently outperformed traditional Vanilla RNNs, while it surpassed LSTM and Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) in six buildings. The results demonstrate KARN's superior accuracy and applicability, making it a promising tool for enhancing load forecasting in diverse energy management scenarios.</description>

      <title>Downlink OFDM-FAMA in 5G-NR Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.06974v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fluid antenna multiple access (FAMA), enabled by the fluid antenna system (FAS), offers a new and straightforward solution to massive connectivity. Previous results on FAMA were primarily based on narrowband channels. This paper studies the adoption of FAMA within the fifth-generation (5G) orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) framework, referred to as OFDM-FAMA, and evaluate its performance in broadband multipath channels. We first design the OFDM-FAMA system, taking into account 5G channel coding and OFDM modulation. Then the system's achievable rate is analyzed, and an algorithm to approximate the FAS configuration at each user is proposed based on the rate. Extensive link-level simulation results reveal that OFDM-FAMA can significantly improve the multiplexing gain over the OFDM system with fixed-position antenna (FPA) users, especially when robust channel coding is applied and the number of radio-frequency (RF) chains at each user is small.</description>

      <title>Erasing Noise in Signal Detection with Diffusion Model: From Theory to Application</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07030v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, a signal detection method based on the denoise diffusion model (DM) is proposed, which outperforms the maximum likelihood (ML) estimation method that has long been regarded as the optimal signal detection technique. Theoretically, a novel mathematical theory for intelligent signal detection based on stochastic differential equations (SDEs) is established in this paper, demonstrating the effectiveness of DM in reducing the additive white Gaussian noise in received signals. Moreover, a mathematical relationship between the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and the timestep in DM is established, revealing that for any given SNR, a corresponding optimal timestep can be identified. Furthermore, to address potential issues with out-of-distribution inputs in the DM, we employ a mathematical scaling technique that allows the trained DM to handle signal detection across a wide range of SNRs without any fine-tuning. Building on the above theoretical foundation, we propose a DM-based signal detection method, with the diffusion transformer (DiT) serving as the backbone neural network, whose computational complexity of this method is $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$. Simulation results demonstrate that, for BPSK and QAM modulation schemes, the DM-based method achieves a significantly lower symbol error rate (SER) compared to ML estimation, while maintaining a much lower computational complexity.</description>

      <title>Beam Structured Turbo Receiver for HF Skywave Massive MIMO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07041v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate receiver design for high frequency (HF) skywave massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communications. We first establish a modified beam based channel model (BBCM) by performing uniform sampling for directional cosine with deterministic sampling interval, where the beam matrix is constructed using a phase-shifted discrete Fourier transform (DFT) matrix. Based on the modified BBCM, we propose a beam structured turbo receiver (BSTR) involving low-dimensional beam domain signal detection for grouped user terminals (UTs), which is proved to be asymptotically optimal in terms of minimizing mean-squared error (MSE). Moreover, we extend it to windowed BSTR by introducing a windowing approach for interference suppression and complexity reduction, and propose a well-designed energy-focusing window. We also present an efficient implementation of the windowed BSTR by exploiting the structure properties of the beam matrix and the beam domain channel sparsity. Simulation results validate the superior performance of the proposed receivers but with remarkably low complexity.</description>

      <title>Knowledge Distillation and Enhanced Subdomain Adaptation Using Graph Convolutional Network for Resource-Constrained Bearing Fault Diagnosis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07173v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bearing fault diagnosis under varying working conditions faces challenges, including a lack of labeled data, distribution discrepancies, and resource constraints. To address these issues, we propose a progressive knowledge distillation framework that transfers knowledge from a complex teacher model, utilizing a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) with Autoregressive moving average (ARMA) filters, to a compact and efficient student model. To mitigate distribution discrepancies and labeling uncertainty, we introduce Enhanced Local Maximum Mean Squared Discrepancy (ELMMSD), which leverages mean and variance statistics in the Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS) and incorporates a priori probability distributions between labels. This approach increases the distance between clustering centers, bridges subdomain gaps, and enhances subdomain alignment reliability. Experimental results on benchmark datasets (CWRU and JNU) demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior diagnostic accuracy while significantly reducing computational costs. Comprehensive ablation studies validate the effectiveness of each component, highlighting the robustness and adaptability of the approach across diverse working conditions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07215v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-channel acoustic signal processing is a well-established and powerful tool to exploit the spatial diversity between a target signal and non-target or noise sources for signal enhancement. However, the textbook solutions for optimal data-dependent spatial filtering rest on the knowledge of second-order statistical moments of the signals, which have traditionally been difficult to acquire. In this contribution, we compare model-based, purely data-driven, and hybrid approaches to parameter estimation and filtering, where the latter tries to combine the benefits of model-based signal processing and data-driven deep learning to overcome their individual deficiencies. We illustrate the underlying design principles with examples from noise reduction, source separation, and dereverberation.</description>

      <title>Movable Antenna Enhanced Integrated Sensing and Communication Via Antenna Position Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07318v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose an integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system aided by the movable-antenna (MA) array, which can improve the communication and sensing performance via flexible antenna movement over conventional fixed-position antenna (FPA) array. First, we consider the downlink multiuser communication, where each user is randomly distributed within a given three-dimensional zone with local movement. To reduce the overhead of frequent antenna movement, the antenna position vector (APV) is designed based on users' statistical channel state information (CSI), so that the antennas only need to be moved in a large timescale. Then, for target sensing, the Cramer-Rao bounds (CRBs) of the estimation mean square error for different spatial angles of arrival (AoAs) are derived as functions of MAs' positions. Based on the above, we formulate an optimization problem to maximize the expected minimum achievable rate among all communication users, with given constraints on the maximum acceptable CRB thresholds for target sensing. An alternating optimization algorithm is proposed to iteratively optimize one of the horizontal and vertical APVs of the MA array with the other being fixed. Numerical results demonstrate that our proposed MA arrays can significantly enlarge the trade-off region between communication and sensing performance compared to conventional FPA arrays with different inter-antenna spacing. It is also revealed that the steering vectors of the designed MA arrays exhibit low correlation in the angular domain, thus effectively reducing channel correlation among communication users to enhance their achievable rates, while alleviating ambiguity in target angle estimation to achieve improved sensing accuracy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07337v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study presents an ML approach for classifying digital radio operating modes evaluated on real-world transmissions. We generated 98 different parameterized radio signals from 17 digital operating modes, transmitted each of them on the 70 cm (UHF) amateur radio band, and recorded our transmissions with two different architectures of SDR receivers. Three lightweight ML models were trained exclusively on spectrograms of limited non-transmitted signals with random characters as payloads. This training involved an online data augmentation pipeline to simulate various radio channel impairments. Our best model, EfficientNetB0, achieved an accuracy of 93.80% across the 17 operating modes and 85.47% across all 98 parameterized radio signals, evaluated on our real-world transmissions with Wikipedia articles as payloads. Furthermore, we analyzed the impact of varying signal durations &amp; the number of FFT bins on classification, assessed the effectiveness of our simulated channel impairments, and tested our models across multiple simulated SNRs.</description>

      <title>Completing Sets of Prototype Transfer Functions for Subspace-based Direction of Arrival Estimation of Multiple Speakers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07524v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To estimate the direction of arrival (DOA) of multiple speakers, subspace-based prototype transfer function matching methods such as multiple signal classification (MUSIC) or relative transfer function (RTF) vector matching are commonly employed. In general, these methods require calibrated microphone arrays, which are characterized by a known array geometry or a set of known prototype transfer functions for several directions. In this paper, we consider a partially calibrated microphone array, composed of a calibrated binaural hearing aid and a (non-calibrated) external microphone at an unknown location with no available set of prototype transfer functions. We propose a procedure for completing sets of prototype transfer functions by exploiting the orthogonality of subspaces, allowing to apply matching-based DOA estimation methods with partially calibrated microphone arrays. For the MUSIC and RTF vector matching methods, experimental results for two speakers in noisy and reverberant environments clearly demonstrate that for all locations of the external microphone DOAs can be estimated more accurately with completed sets of prototype transfer functions than with incomplete sets.

Abstract: Path loss prediction is a beneficial tool for efficient use of the radio frequency spectrum. Building on prior research on high-resolution map-based path loss models, this paper studies convolutional neural network input representations in more detail. We investigate different methods of representing scalar features in convolutional neural networks. Specifically, we compare using frequency and distance as input channels to convolutional layers or as scalar inputs to regression layers. We assess model performance using three different feature configurations and find that representing scalar features as image channels results in the strongest generalization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04726v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The development of Crud-Induced Power Shift (CIPS) is an operational challenge in Pressurized Water Reactors that is due to the development of crud on the fuel rod cladding. The available predictive tools developed previously, usually based on fundamental physics, are computationally expensive and have shown differing degrees of accuracy. This work proposes a completely top-down approach to predict CIPS instances on an assembly level with reactor-specific calibration built-in. Built using artificial neural networks, this work uses a three-dimensional convolutional approach to leverage the image-like layout of the input data. As a classifier, the convolutional neural network model predicts whether a given assembly will experience CIPS as well as the time of occurrence during a given cycle. This surrogate model is both trained and tested using a combination of calculated core model parameters and measured plant data from Unit 1 of the Catawba Nuclear Station. After the evaluation of its performance using various metrics, Monte Carlo dropout is employed for extensive uncertainty quantification of the model predictions. The results indicate that this methodology could be a viable approach in predicting CIPS with an assembly-level resolution across both clean and afflicted cycles, while using limited computational resources.</description>

      <title>DNN-based Enhanced DOA Sensing via Massive MIMO Receiver with Switches-based Hybrid Architecture</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.14297v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Switches-based hybrid architecture has attracted much attention, especially in directional-of-arrival (DOA) sensing, due to its ability of significantly reducing the hardware cost by compressing massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) arrays with switching networks. However, this structure will lead to a degradation in the degrees of freedom (DOF) and accuracy of DOA estimation. To address these two issues, we first propose a switches-based sparse hybrid array (SW-SHA). In this method, we design a dynamic switching network to form a synthesized sparse array, i.e., SW-SHA, that can enlarge the virtual aperture obtained by the difference co-array, thereby significantly enhancing the DOF. Second, in order to improve the DOA estimation accuracy of switches-based hybrid arrays, a deep neural network (DNN)-based method called ASN-DNN is proposed. It includes an antenna selection network (ASN) for optimizing the switch connections based on the criterion of minimizing the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) under the peak sidelobe level (PSL) constraint and a DNN for DOA estimation. Then by integrating ASN and DNN into an iterative process, the ASN-DNN is obtained. Furthermore, the closed-form expression of CRLB for DOA estimation is derived to evaluate the performance lower bound of switches-based hybrid arrays and provide a benchmark for ASN-DNN. The simulation results show the proposed ASN-DNN can achieve a greater performance than traditional methods, especially in the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regions.</description>

Abstract: Direct position estimation (DPE) is an effective solution to the MP issue at the signal processing level. Unlike two-step positioning (2SP) receivers, DPE directly solves for the receiver position, velocity, and time (PVT) in the navigation domain, without the estimation of intermediate measurements, thus allowing it to provide more robust and accurate PVT estimates in the presence of multipath (MP) and weak signals. But GNSS positioning with DPE is mostly left unapplied commercially, and continuing research into DPE has remained relatively stagnant over the past few years. To encourage further research on DPE by the GNSS community, we propose a DPE plug-in module that can be integrated into the conventional 2SP software-defined receivers (SDRs). Programmed in MATLAB, the proposed DPE plug-in module is aimed for better understanding and familiarity of a practical implementation of DPE. Its plug-in module architecture allows it to be incorporated with 2SP MATLAB SDRs, both vector tracking and scalar tracking with minimum changes, making it easy to use, and provides greater flexibility for researchers using various 2SP SDRs. We propose to further improve the performance of DPE against MP by incorporating Multipath Mitigation Technology (MMT) into DPE. Referred to as MMT-DPE, it is proposed as a variant of DPE that adds the MP components into DPE signal model by integrating MMT cost function into DPE, with the aim to better suit DPE for urban environment applications. Results show that while in MP-only conditions, an MMT-integrated 2SP (MMT-2SP) has similar performance with MMT-DPE, the proposed MMT-DPE manages to show great superiority against NLOS, making it the preferable option for applications in urban environments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17752v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Radio deployments and spectrum planning benefit from path loss predictions. Obstructions along a communications link are often considered implicitly or through derived metrics such as representative clutter height or total obstruction depth. In this paper, we propose a path-specific path loss prediction method that uses convolutional neural networks to automatically perform feature extraction from high-resolution obstruction height maps. Our methods result in low prediction error in a variety of environments without requiring derived metrics.</description>

      <title>RMTransformer: Accurate Radio Map Construction and Coverage Prediction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.05190v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Radio map, or pathloss map prediction, is a crucial method for wireless network modeling and management. By leveraging deep learning to construct pathloss patterns from geographical maps, an accurate digital replica of the transmission environment could be established with less computational overhead and lower prediction error compared to traditional model-driven techniques. While existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods predominantly rely on convolutional architectures, this paper introduces a hybrid transformer-convolution model, termed RMTransformer, to enhance the accuracy of radio map prediction. The proposed model features a multi-scale transformer-based encoder for efficient feature extraction and a convolution-based decoder for precise pixel-level image reconstruction. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme significantly improves prediction accuracy, and over a 30% reduction in root mean square error (RMSE) is achieved compared to typical SOTA approaches.</description>

      <title>A Novel Training Framework for Physics-informed Neural Networks: Towards Real-time Applications in Ultrafast Ultrasound Blood Flow Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.04755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.04755v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ultrafast ultrasound blood flow imaging is a state-of-the-art technique for depiction of complex blood flow dynamics in vivo through thousands of full-view image data (or, timestamps) acquired per second. Physics-informed Neural Network (PINN) is one of the most preeminent solvers of the Navier-Stokes equations, widely used as the governing equation of blood flow. However, that current approaches rely on full Navier-Stokes equations is impractical for ultrafast ultrasound. We hereby propose a novel PINN training framework for solving the Navier-Stokes equations. It involves discretizing Navier-Stokes equations into steady state and sequentially solving them with test-time adaptation. The novel training framework is coined as SeqPINN. Upon its success, we propose a parallel training scheme for all timestamps based on averaged constant stochastic gradient descent as initialization. Uncertainty estimation through Stochastic Weight Averaging Gaussian is then used as an indicator of generalizability of the initialization. This algorithm, named SP-PINN, further expedites training of PINN while achieving comparable accuracy with SeqPINN. The performance of SeqPINN and SP-PINN was evaluated through finite-element simulations and in vitro phantoms of single-branch and trifurcate blood vessels. Results show that both algorithms were manyfold faster than the original design of PINN, while respectively achieving Root Mean Square Errors of 0.63 cm/s and 0.81 cm/s on the straight vessel and 1.35 cm/s and 1.63 cm/s on the trifurcate vessel when recovering blood flow velocities. The successful implementation of SeqPINN and SP-PINN open the gate for real-time training of PINN for Navier-Stokes equations and subsequently reliable imaging-based blood flow assessment in clinical practice.</description>

      <title>Frame Codes for the Block-Erasure Channel -- Extended Version</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01172v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Analog codes add redundancy by expanding the dimension using real/complex-valued operations. Frame theory provides a mathematical basis for constructing such codes, with diverse applications in non-orthogonal code-division multiple access (NOMA-CDMA), distributed computation, multiple description source coding, space-time coding (STC), and more. The channel model corresponding to these applications is a combination of noise and erasures. Recent analyses showed a useful connection between spectral random-matrix theory and large equiangular tight frames (ETFs) under random uniform erasures. In this work we generalize this model to a channel where the erasures come in blocks. This particularly fits NOMA-CDMA with multiple transmit antennas for each user and STC with known spatial grouping. We present a method to adjust ETF codes to suit block erasures, and find minimum intra-block-correlation frames which outperform ETFs in this setting.</description>

      <title>Monotone Lipschitz-Gradient Denoiser: Explainability of Operator Regularization Approaches Free From Lipschitz Constant Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04676v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses explainability of the operator-regularization approach under the use of monotone Lipschitz-gradient (MoL-Grad) denoiser -- an operator that can be expressed as the Lipschitz continuous gradient of a differentiable convex function. We prove that an operator is a MoL-Grad denoiser if and only if it is the ``single-valued'' proximity operator of a weakly convex function. An extension of Moreau's decomposition is also shown with respect to a weakly convex function and the conjugate of its convexified function. Under these arguments, two specific algorithms, the forward-backward splitting algorithm and the primal-dual splitting algorithm, are considered, both employing MoL-Grad denoisers. These algorithms generate a sequence of vectors converging weakly, under conditions, to a minimizer of a certain cost function which involves an ``implicit regularizer'' induced by the denoiser. Unlike the previous studies of operator regularization, our framework requires no control of the Lipschitz constant in learning the denoiser. The theoretical findings are supported by simulations.</description>

      <title>Cost-optimized probabilistic maintenance for condition monitoring of wind turbines with rare failures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09385v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a method, a model, and a form of presenting model results for condition monitoring of a small set of wind turbines with rare failures. The main new ingredient of the method is to sample failure thresholds according to the profit they give to an operating company. The model is a multiple linear regression with seasonal components and external regressors, representing all sensor components except for the selected one. To overcome the scarcity of the training data, we use the median sensor values from all available turbines in their healthy state. The cumulated deviation from the normal behavior model obtained for this median turbine is calibrated for each turbine at the beginning of the test period and after known failures. The proposed form of presenting results is to set a scale for possible costs, control for random maintenance, and show a whole distribution of costs depending on the free model parameters. We make a case study on an open dataset with SCADA data from multiple sensors and show that considering the influence of turbine components is more critical than seasonality. The distribution, the average, and the standard deviation of maintenance costs can be very different for similar minimal costs. Random maintenance can be more profitable than reactive maintenance and other approaches. Our predictive maintenance model outperforms random maintenance and competitors for the whole set of considered turbines, giving substantial savings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.09763v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study offers a revolutionary strategy to developing wheelchairs based on the Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) that incorporates Artificial Intelligence (AI) using a The device uses electroencephalogram (EEG) data to mimic wheelchair navigation. Five different models were trained on a pre-filtered dataset that was divided into fixed-length windows using a sliding window technique. Each window contained statistical measurements, FFT coefficients for different frequency bands, and a label identifying the activity carried out during that window that was taken from an open-source Kaggle repository. The XGBoost model outperformed the other models, CatBoost, GRU, SVC, and XGBoost, with an accuracy of 60%. The CatBoost model with a major difference between training and testing accuracy shows overfitting, and similarly, the best-performing model, with SVC, was implemented in a tkinter GUI. The wheelchair movement could be simulated in various directions, and a Raspberry Pi-powered wheelchair system for brain-computer interface is proposed here.</description>

      <title>Blind Estimation of Sub-band Acoustic Parameters from Ambisonics Recordings using Spectro-Spatial Covariance Features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03172v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Estimating frequency-varying acoustic parameters is essential for enhancing immersive perception in realistic spatial audio creation. In this paper, we propose a unified framework that blindly estimates reverberation time (T60), direct-to-reverberant ratio (DRR), and clarity (C50) across 10 frequency bands using first-order Ambisonics (FOA) speech recordings as inputs. The proposed framework utilizes a novel feature named Spectro-Spatial Covariance Vector (SSCV), efficiently representing temporal, spectral as well as spatial information of the FOA signal. Our models significantly outperform existing single-channel methods with only spectral information, reducing estimation errors by more than half for all three acoustic parameters. Additionally, we introduce FOA-Conv3D, a novel back-end network for effectively utilising the SSCV feature with a 3D convolutional encoder. FOA-Conv3D outperforms the convolutional neural network (CNN) and recurrent convolutional neural network (CRNN) backends, achieving lower estimation errors and accounting for a higher proportion of variance (PoV) for all 3 acoustic parameters.</description>

      <title>Machine-Learning Enabled Multidimensional Data Utilization in Multi-Resonance Biosensors: A Pathway to Enhanced Accuracy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20245v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A novel framework is proposed that combines multi-resonance biosensors with machine learning (ML) to significantly enhance the accuracy of parameter prediction in biosensing. Unlike traditional single-resonance systems, which are limited to one-dimensional datasets, this approach leverages multi-dimensional data generated by a custom-designed nanostructure, a periodic array of silicon nanorods with a triangular cross-section over an aluminum reflector. High bulk sensitivity values are achieved for this multi-resonant structure, with certain resonant peaks reaching up to 1706 nm/RIU. The predictive power of multiple resonant peaks from transverse magnetic (TM) and transverse electric (TE) polarizations is evaluated using Ridge Regression modeling. Systematic analysis reveals that incorporating multiple resonances yields up to three orders of magnitude improvement in refractive index detection precision compared to single-peak analyses. This precision enhancement is achieved without modifications to the biosensor hardware, highlighting the potential of data-centric strategies in biosensing. The findings establish a new paradigm in biosensing, demonstrating that the synergy between multi-resonance data acquisition and ML-based analysis can significantly enhance detection accuracy. This study provides a scalable pathway for advancing high-precision biosensing technologies.</description>
