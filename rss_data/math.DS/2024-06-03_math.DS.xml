      <title>Hyperspatiality for isomorphisms of stabilized automorphism groups of shifts of finite type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a homeomorphism $T \colon X \to X$ of a compact metric space $X$, the stabilized automorphism group $\textrm{Aut}^{\infty}(T)$ of the system $(X,T)$ is the group of self-homeomorphisms of $X$ which commute with some power of $T$. We study the question of spatiality for stabilized automorphism groups of shifts of finite type. We prove that any isomorphism $\Psi \colon \textrm{Aut}^{\infty}(\sigma_{m}) \to \textrm{Aut}^{\infty}(\sigma_{n})$ between stabilized automorphism groups of full shifts is spatially induced by a homeomorphism $\hat{\Psi}$ between respective stabilized spaces of chain recurrent subshifts. This spatialization in particular gives a bijection between the sets of periodic points which intertwines some powers of the shifts, and this bijection recovers the isomorphism at the level of the faithful actions on the sets of periodic points. We also prove that the outer automorphism group of $\textrm{Aut}^{\infty}(\sigma_{n})$ is uncountable, and deduce several other properties of $\textrm{Aut}^{\infty}(\sigma_{n})$ using the spatiality results.</description>

      <title>Henderson-like interval maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20533v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study interval maps with zero topological entropy that are crooked; i.e. whose inverse limit is the pseudo-arc. We show that there are uncountably many pairwise non-conjugate zero entropy crooked interval maps with different sets of fixed points. We also show that there are uncountably many crooked maps that are pairwise non-conjugate and have exactly two fixed points. Furthermore, we provide a characterization of crooked interval maps that are under (above) the diagonal.</description>

      <title>Limit sets, internal chain transitivity and orbital shadowing of tree-shifts defined on Markov-Cayley trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the concepts of $\omega$-limit sets and pseudo orbits for a tree-shift defined on a Markov-Cayley tree, extending the results of tree-shifts defined on $d$-trees [5,6]. Firstly, we establish the relationships between $\omega$-limit sets and we introduce a modified definition of $\omega$-limit set based on complete prefix sets (Theorems 1.4 and 1.9). Secondly, we introduce the concept of projected pseudo orbits and investigate the concept of the shadowing property (Theorems 1.12 and 1.14).</description>

      <title>A criterion to detect a nontrivial homology of an invariant set of a flow in $\mathbb{R}^3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20945v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider a flow in $\mathbb{R}^3$ and let $K$ be the biggest invariant subset of some compact region of interest $N \subseteq \mathbb{R}^3$. The set $K$ is often not computable, but the way the flow crosses the boundary of $N$ can provide indirect information about it. For example, classical tools such as Wa\.{z}ewski's principle or the Poincar\'e-Hopf theorem can be used to detect whether $K$ is nonempty or contains rest points, respectively. We present a criterion that can establish whether $K$ has a nontrivial homology by looking at the subset of the boundary of $N$ along which the flow is tangent to $N$. We prove that the criterion is as sharp as possible with the information it uses as an input. We also show that it is algorithmically checkable.</description>

      <title>Towards a Fluid computer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20999v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1991, Moore [20] raised a question about whether hydrodynamics is capable of performing computations. Similarly, in 2016, Tao [25] asked whether a mechanical system, including a fluid flow, can simulate a universal Turing machine. In this expository article, we review the construction in [8] of a "Fluid computer" in dimension 3 that combines techniques in symbolic dynamics with the connection between steady Euler flows and contact geometry unveiled by Etnyre and Ghrist. In addition, we argue that the metric that renders the vector field Beltrami cannot be critical in the Chern-Hamilton sense [9]. We also sketch the completely different construction for the Euclidean metric in $\mathbb R^3$ as given in [7]. These results reveal the existence of undecidable fluid particle paths. We conclude the article with a list of open problems.</description>

      <title>Optimization, guidance, and control of low-thrust transfers from the Lunar Gateway to low lunar orbit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20449v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Gateway will represent a primary space system useful for the Artemis program, Earth-Moon transportation, and deep space exploration. It is expected to serve as a staging location on the way to the lunar surface. This study focuses on low-thrust transfer dynamics, from the Near-Rectilinear Halo Orbit traveled by Gateway to a specified Low-altitude Lunar Orbit (LLO). This research addresses: (i) determination of the minimum-time low-thrust trajectory and (ii) design, implementation, and testing of a guidance and control architecture, for a space vehicle that travels from Gateway to LLO. Orbit dynamics is described in terms of modified equinoctial elements, in the context of a high-fidelity ephemeris model. The minimum-time trajectory from Gateway to a specified lunar orbit is detected through an indirect heuristic approach, which uses the analytical conditions arising in optimal control theory in conjunction with a heuristic technique. However, future missions will pursue a growing level of autonomy, and this circumstance implies the mandatory design of an efficient feedback guidance scheme, capable of compensating for nonnominal flight conditions. This research proposes nonlinear orbit control as a viable option for autonomous explicit guidance of low-thrust transfers from Gateway to LLO. This approach allows defining a feedback law that enjoys quasi-global stability properties without requiring any offline reference trajectory. The overall spacecraft dynamics is modeled including attitude control and actuation. The latter is demanded to an array of reaction wheels, arranged in a pyramidal configuration. Guidance, attitude control, and actuation are implemented in an iterative scheme. Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate that the guidance and control architecture is effective with random starting points from Gateway and the temporary unavailability of the propulsion system.</description>

      <title>Reach-Avoid Control Synthesis for a Quadrotor UAV with Formal Safety Guarantees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20502v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reach-avoid specifications are one of the most common tasks in autonomous aerial vehicle (UAV) applications. Despite the intensive research and development associated with control of aerial vehicles, generating feasible trajectories though complex environments and tracking them with formal safety guarantees remain challenging. In this paper, we propose a control framework for a quadrotor UAV that enables accomplishing reach-avoid tasks with formal safety guarantees. In this proposed framework, we integrate geometric control theory for tracking and polynomial trajectory generation using Bezier curves, where tracking errors are accounted for in the trajectory synthesis process. To estimate the tracking errors, we revisit the stability analysis of the closed-loop quadrotor system, when geometric control is implemented. We show that the tracking error dynamics exhibit local exponential stability when geometric control is implemented with any positive control gains, and we derive tight uniform bounds of the tracking error. We also introduce sufficient conditions to be imposed on the desired trajectory utilizing the derived uniform bounds to ensure the well-definedness of the closed-loop system. For the trajectory synthesis, we present an efficient algorithm that enables constructing a safe tube by means of sampling-based planning and safe hyper-rectangular set computations. Then, we compute the trajectory, given as a piecewise continuous Bezier curve, through the safe tube, where a heuristic efficient approach that utilizes iterative linear programming is employed. We present extensive numerical simulations with a cluttered environment to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework in reach-avoid planning scenarios.</description>

      <title>On the classical Lagrange and Markov spectra: new results on the local dimension and the geometry of the difference set</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20581v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $L$ and $M$ denote the classical Lagrange and Markov spectra, respectively. It is known that $L\subset M$ and that $M\setminus L\neq\varnothing$. Inspired by three questions asked by the third author in previous work investigating the fractal geometric properties of the Lagrange and Markov spectra, we investigate the function $d_{loc}(t)$ that gives the local Hausdorff dimension at a point $t$ of $L'$. Specifically, we construct several intervals (having non-trivial intersection with $L'$) on which $d_{loc}$ is non-decreasing. We also prove that the respective intersections of $M'$ and $M''$ with these intervals coincide. Furthermore, we completely characterize the local dimension of both spectra when restricted to those intervals. Finally, we demonstrate the largest known elements of the difference set $M\setminus L$ and describe two new maximal gaps of $M$ nearby.</description>

      <title>Weak-Form Inference for Hybrid Dynamical Systems in Ecology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20591v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Species subject to predation and environmental threats commonly exhibit variable periods of population boom and bust over long timescales. Understanding and predicting such behavior, especially given the inherent heterogeneity and stochasticity of exogenous driving factors over short timescales, is an ongoing challenge. A modeling paradigm gaining popularity in the ecological sciences for such multi-scale effects is to couple short-term continuous dynamics to long-term discrete updates. We develop a data-driven method utilizing weak-form equation learning to extract such hybrid governing equations for population dynamics and to estimate the requisite parameters using sparse intermittent measurements of the discrete and continuous variables. The method produces a set of short-term continuous dynamical system equations parametrized by long-term variables, and long-term discrete equations parametrized by short-term variables, allowing direct assessment of interdependencies between the two time scales. We demonstrate the utility of the method on a variety of ecological scenarios and provide extensive tests using models previously derived for epizootics experienced by the North American spongy moth (Lymantria dispar dispar).</description>

      <title>VENI, VINDy, VICI: a variational reduced-order modeling framework with uncertainty quantification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20905v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The simulation of many complex phenomena in engineering and science requires solving expensive, high-dimensional systems of partial differential equations (PDEs). To circumvent this, reduced-order models (ROMs) have been developed to speed up computations. However, when governing equations are unknown or partially known, typically ROMs lack interpretability and reliability of the predicted solutions.
  In this work we present a data-driven, non-intrusive framework for building ROMs where the latent variables and dynamics are identified in an interpretable manner and uncertainty is quantified. Starting from a limited amount of high-dimensional, noisy data the proposed framework constructs an efficient ROM by leveraging variational autoencoders for dimensionality reduction along with a newly introduced, variational version of sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy), which we refer to as Variational Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (VINDy).
  In detail, the method consists of Variational Encoding of Noisy Inputs (VENI) to identify the distribution of reduced coordinates. Simultaneously, we learn the distribution of the coefficients of a pre-determined set of candidate functions by VINDy. Once trained offline, the identified model can be queried for new parameter instances and new initial conditions to compute the corresponding full-time solutions. The probabilistic setup enables uncertainty quantification as the online testing consists of Variational Inference naturally providing Certainty Intervals (VICI). In this work we showcase the effectiveness of the newly proposed VINDy method in identifying interpretable and accurate dynamical system for the R\"ossler system with different noise intensities and sources. Then the performance of the overall method - named VENI, VINDy, VICI - is tested on PDE benchmarks including structural mechanics and fluid dynamics.</description>

      <title>Beyond Conventional Parametric Modeling: Data-Driven Framework for Estimation and Prediction of Time Activity Curves in Dynamic PET Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.21021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.21021v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dynamic Positron Emission Tomography (dPET) imaging and Time-Activity Curve (TAC) analyses are essential for understanding and quantifying the biodistribution of radiopharmaceuticals over time and space. Traditional compartmental modeling, while foundational, commonly struggles to fully capture the complexities of biological systems, including non-linear dynamics and variability. This study introduces an innovative data-driven neural network-based framework, inspired by Reaction Diffusion systems, designed to address these limitations. Our approach, which adaptively fits TACs from dPET, enables the direct calibration of diffusion coefficients and reaction terms from observed data, offering significant improvements in predictive accuracy and robustness over traditional methods, especially in complex biological scenarios. By more accurately modeling the spatio-temporal dynamics of radiopharmaceuticals, our method advances modeling of pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic processes, enabling new possibilities in quantitative nuclear medicine.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian Floer theory on surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.11231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2102.11231v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop connections between the qualitative dynamics of Hamiltonian isotopies on a surface $\Sigma$ and their chain-level Floer theory using ideas drawn from Hofer-Wysocki-Zehnder's theory of finite energy foliations. We associate to every collection of capped $1$-periodic orbits which is `maximally unlinked relative the Morse range' a singular foliation on $S^1 \times \Sigma$ which is positively transverse to the vector field $\partial_t \oplus X^H$ and which is assembled in a straight-forward way from the relevant Floer moduli spaces. This provides a Floer-theoretic method for producing foliations of the type which appear in Le Calvez's theory of positively transverse foliations for surface homeomorphisms. Additionally, we provide a purely topological characterization of those Floer chains which both represent the fundamental class in $CF_*(H,J)$, and which lie in the image of some chain-level PSS map. This leads to the definition of a novel family of spectral invariants which share many of the same formal properties as the Oh-Schwarz spectral invariants, and we compute the novel spectral invariant associated to the fundamental class in entirely dynamical terms. This significantly extends a project initiated by Humili\`{e}re-Le Roux-Seyfaddini in arXiv:1502.03834.</description>
