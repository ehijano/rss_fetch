      <title>A Lazy Abstraction Algorithm for Markov Decision Processes: Theory and Initial Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00824v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Analysis of Markov Decision Processes (MDP) is often hindered by state space explosion. Abstraction is a well-established technique in model checking to mitigate this issue. This paper presents a novel lazy abstraction method for MDP analysis based on adaptive simulation graphs. Refinement is performed only when new parts of the state space are explored, which makes partial exploration techniques like Bounded Real-Time Dynamic Programming (BRTDP) retain more merged states. Therefore, we propose a combination of lazy abstraction and BRTDP. To evaluate the performance of our algorithm, we conduct initial experiments using the Quantitative Verification Benchmark Set.</description>

      <title>On Efficient Algorithms For Partial Quantifier Elimination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01307v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Earlier, we introduced Partial Quantifier Elimination (PQE). It is a $\mathit{generalization}$ of regular quantifier elimination where one can take a $\mathit{part}$ of the formula out of the scope of quantifiers. We apply PQE to CNF formulas of propositional logic with existential quantifiers. The appeal of PQE is that many problems like equivalence checking and model checking can be solved in terms of PQE and the latter can be very efficient. The main flaw of current PQE solvers is that they do not $\mathit{reuse}$ learned information. The problem here is that these PQE solvers are based on the notion of clause redundancy and the latter is a $\mathit{structural}$ rather than $\mathit{semantic}$ property. In this paper, we provide two important theoretical results that enable reusing the information learned by a PQE solver. Such reusing can dramatically boost the efficiency of PQE like conflict clause learning boosts SAT solving.</description>

      <title>Modal Separability of Fixpoint Formulae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01497v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study modal separability for fixpoint formulae: given two mutually exclusive fixpoint formulae $\varphi,\varphi'$, decide whether there is a modal formula $\psi$ that separates them, that is, that satisfies $\varphi\models\psi\models\neg\varphi'$. This problem has applications for finding simple reasons for inconsistency. Our main contributions are tight complexity bounds for deciding modal separability and optimal ways to compute a separator if it exists. More precisely, it is EXPTIME-complete in general and PSPACE-complete over words. Separators can be computed in doubly exponential time in general and in exponential time over words, and this is optimal as well. The results for general structures transfer to arbitrary, finitely branching, and finite trees. The word case results hold for finite, infinite, and arbitrary words.</description>

      <title>Globally Interpretable Classifiers via Boolean Formulas with Dynamic Propositions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01114v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Interpretability and explainability are among the most important challenges of modern artificial intelligence, being mentioned even in various legislative sources. In this article, we develop a method for extracting immediately human interpretable classifiers from tabular data. The classifiers are given in the form of short Boolean formulas built with propositions that can either be directly extracted from categorical attributes or dynamically computed from numeric ones. Our method is implemented using Answer Set Programming. We investigate seven datasets and compare our results to ones obtainable by state-of-the-art classifiers for tabular data, namely, XGBoost and random forests. Over all datasets, the accuracies obtainable by our method are similar to the reference methods. The advantage of our classifiers in all cases is that they are very short and immediately human intelligible as opposed to the black-box nature of the reference methods.</description>

      <title>Large Scale Geometries of Infinite Strings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.03800</link>
      <description>arXiv:1908.03800v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce geometric consideration into the theory of formal languages. We aim to shed light on our understanding of global patterns that occur on infinite strings. We utilise methods of geometric group theory. Our emphasis is on large scale geometries. Two infinite strings have the same large scale geometry if there are colour preserving bi-Lipschitz maps with distortions between the strings. Call these maps quasi-isometries. Introduction of large scale geometries poses several questions. The first question asks to study the partial order induced by quasi-isometries. This partial order compares large scale geometries; as such it presents an algebraic tool for classification of global patterns. We prove there is a greatest large scale geometry and infinitely many minimal large scale geometries. The second question is related to understanding the quasi-isometric maps on various classes of strings. The third question investigates the sets of large scale geometries of strings accepted by computational models, e.g. B\"uchi automata. We provide an algorithm that describes large scale geometries of strings accepted by B\"uchi automata. This links large scale geometries with automata theory. The fourth question studies the complexity of the quasi-isometry problem. We show the problem is $\Sigma_3^0$-complete thus providing a bridge with computability theory. Finally, the fifth question asks to build algebraic structures that are invariants of large scale geometries. We invoke asymptotic cones, a key concept in geometric group theory, defined via model-theoretic notion of ultra-product. Partly, we study asymptotic cones of algorithmically random strings thus connecting the topic with algorithmic randomness.</description>

      <title>Automated Expected Amortised Cost Analysis of Probabilistic Data Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.03537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.03537v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we present the first fully-automated expected amortised cost analysis of self-adjusting data structures, that is, of randomised splay trees, randomised splay heaps and randomised meldable heaps, which so far have only (semi-) manually been analysed in the literature. Our analysis is stated as a type-and-effect system for a first-order functional programming language with support for sampling over discrete distributions, non-deterministic choice and a ticking operator. The latter allows for the specification of fine-grained cost models. We state two soundness theorems based on two different -- but strongly related -- typing rules of ticking, which account differently for the cost of non-terminating computations. Finally we provide a prototype implementation able to fully automatically analyse the aforementioned case studies.</description>

      <title>PFL: a Probabilistic Logic for Fault Trees</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.17314v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Safety-critical infrastructures must operate in a safe and reliable way. Fault tree analysis is a widespread method used for risk assessment of these systems: fault trees (FTs) are required by, e.g., the Federal Aviation Administration and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. In spite of their popularity, little work has been done on formulating structural queries about FT and analyzing these, e.g., when evaluating potential scenarios, and to give practitioners instruments to formulate queries on FTs in an understandable yet powerful way. In this paper, we aim to fill this gap by extending BFL [32], a logic that reasons about Boolean FTs. To do so, we introduce a Probabilistic Fault tree Logic (PFL). PFL is a simple, yet expressive logic that supports easier formulation of complex scenarios and specification of FT properties that comprise probabilities. Alongside PFL, we present LangPFL, a domain specific language to further ease property specification. We showcase PFL and LangPFL by applying them to a COVID-19 related FT and to a FT for an oil/gas pipeline. Finally, we present theory and model checking algorithms based on binary decision diagrams (BDDs).</description>

      <title>Technical Report: Time-Bounded Resilience</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.05585v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Most research on formal system design has focused on optimizing various measures of efficiency. However, insufficient attention has been given to the design of systems optimizing resilience, the ability of systems to adapt to unexpected changes or adversarial disruptions. In our prior work, we formalized the intuitive notion of resilience as a property of cyber-physical systems by using a multiset rewriting language with explicit time. In the present paper, we study the computational complexity of a formalization of time-bounded resilience problems for the class of $\eta$-simple progressing planning scenarios, where, intuitively, it is simple to check that a system configuration is critical, and only a finite number of actions can be carried out in a bounded time period. We show that, in the time-bounded model with $n$ (potentially adversarially chosen) updates, the corresponding time-bounded resilience problem for this class of systems is complete for the $\Sigma^P_{2n+1}$ class of the polynomial hierarchy, PH. To support the formal models and complexity results, we perform automated experiments for time-bounded verification using the rewriting logic tool Maude.</description>

      <title>Consistent ultrafinitist logic</title>

      <description>arXiv:2106.13309v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ultrafinitism postulates that we can only compute on relatively short objects, and numbers beyond certain value are not available. This approach would also forbid many forms of infinitary reasoning and allow to remove certain paradoxes stemming from enumeration theorems. However, philosophers still disagree of whether such a finitist logic would be consistent. We present preliminary work on a proof system based on Curry-Howard isomorphism. We also try to present some well-known theorems that stop being true in such systems, whereas opposite statements become provable. This approach presents certain impossibility results as logical paradoxes stemming from a profligate use of transfinite reasoning.</description>

      <title>Many-one reducibility with realizability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16027v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we propose a new classification of $\Sigma^0_2$ formulas under the realizability interpretation of many-one reducibility (i.e., Levin reducibility). For example, ${\sf Fin}$, the decision of being eventually zero for sequences, is many-one/Levin complete among $\Sigma^0_2$ formulas of the form $\exists n\forall m\geq n.\varphi(m,x)$, where $\varphi$ is decidable. The decision of boundedness for sequences ${\sf BddSeq}$ and for width of posets ${\sf FinWidth}$ are many-one/Levin complete among $\Sigma^0_2$ formulas of the form $\exists n\forall m\geq n\forall k.\varphi(m,k,x)$, where $\varphi$ is decidable. However, unlike the classical many-one reducibility, none of the above is $\Sigma^0_2$-complete. The decision of non-density of linear order ${\sf NonDense}$ is truly $\Sigma^0_2$-complete.</description>

      <title>Boosting Few-Pixel Robustness Verification via Covering Verification Designs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10924v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Proving local robustness is crucial to increase the reliability of neural networks. While many verifiers prove robustness in $L_\infty$ $\epsilon$-balls, very little work deals with robustness verification in $L_0$ $\epsilon$-balls, capturing robustness to few pixel attacks. This verification introduces a combinatorial challenge, because the space of pixels to perturb is discrete and of exponential size. A previous work relies on covering designs to identify sets for defining $L_\infty$ neighborhoods, which if proven robust imply that the $L_0$ $\epsilon$-ball is robust. However, the number of neighborhoods to verify remains very high, leading to a high analysis time. We propose covering verification designs, a combinatorial design that tailors effective but analysis-incompatible coverings to $L_0$ robustness verification. The challenge is that computing a covering verification design introduces a high time and memory overhead, which is intensified in our setting, where multiple candidate coverings are required to identify how to reduce the overall analysis time. We introduce CoVerD, an $L_0$ robustness verifier that selects between different candidate coverings without constructing them, but by predicting their block size distribution. This prediction relies on a theorem providing closed-form expressions for the mean and variance of this distribution. CoVerD constructs the chosen covering verification design on-the-fly, while keeping the memory consumption minimal and enabling to parallelize the analysis. The experimental results show that CoVerD reduces the verification time on average by up to 5.1x compared to prior work and that it scales to larger $L_0$ $\epsilon$-balls.</description>

      <title>Set Descriptive Complexity of Solvable Functions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19304v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a recent article, we introduced and studied a precise class of dynamical systems called solvable systems. These systems present a dynamic ruled by discontinuous ordinary differential equations with solvable right-hand terms and unique evolution. They correspond to a class of systems for which a transfinite method exist to compute the solution. We also presented several examples including a nontrivial one whose solution yields, at an integer time, a real encoding of the halting set for Turing machines; therefore showcasing that the behavior of solvable systems might describe ordinal Turing computations. In the current article, we study in more depth solvable systems, using tools from descriptive set theory. By establishing a correspondence with the class of well-founded trees, we construct a coanalytic ranking over the set of solvable functions and discuss its relation with other existing rankings for differentiable functions, in particular with the Kechris-Woodin, Denjoy and Zalcwasser ranking. We prove that our ranking is unbounded below the first uncountable ordinal.</description>
