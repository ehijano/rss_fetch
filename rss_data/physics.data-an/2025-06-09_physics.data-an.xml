      <title>Structure functions and flatness of streamwise velocity in a turbulent channel flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05436v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we present a multiscale characterization of the streamwise velocity of a turbulent channel flow. We study the 2nd and 4th order structure functions and the flatness for scales ranging from the dissipative to the integral domains and for a wide range of distances to the walls spanning four distinct regions of the channel. We characterize the impact of the shear stress induced by the walls on these statistics. Far from the walls, in the outer layer, the impact of the boundaries on the flow is negligible and the flow statistics follow the Kolmogorov-Obukhov theory. In the viscous, buffer and logarithmic regions, the inertial domain can be split in two subdomains of scales with two different statistical behaviors. In the logarithmic region, the scaling of the structure functions agrees with the model of Davidson et al. 2006 but the scaling of the flatness seems to better correspond to the characterization of intermittency proposed by Kolmogorov and Obukhov in 1962. The structure functions and flatness of the streamwise velocity in the buffer and viscous regions are studied for the first time. We show the strong non-Gaussianity of the velocity flow at any scale in the viscous layer with strong intermittent events that may correspond to high shear-induced dissipation.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Random Concentrated Optimization Without Convexity Assumption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23864v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a new random method to minimize deterministic continuous functions over subsets $\mathcal{S}$ of high-dimensional space $\mathbb{R}^K$ without assuming convexity. Our procedure alternates between a Global Search (GS) regime to identify candidates and a Concentrated Search (CS) regime to improve an eligible candidate in the constraint set $\mathcal{S}$. Beyond the alternation between those completely different regimes, the originality of our approach lies in leveraging high dimensionality. We demonstrate rigorous concentration properties under the $CS$ regime. In parallel, we also show that $GS$ reaches any point in $\mathcal{S}$ in finite time. Finally, we demonstrate the relevance of our new method by giving two concrete applications. The first deals with the reduction of the $\ell_{1}-$norm of a LASSO solution. Secondly, we compress a neural network by pruning weights while maintaining performance; our approach achieves significant weight reduction with minimal performance loss, offering an effective solution for network optimization.</description>

      <title>Computing well-balanced spanning trees of unweighted networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.06628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.06628v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A spanning tree of a network or graph is a subgraph that connects all nodes with the least number or weight of edges. The spanning tree is one of the most straightforward techniques for network simplification and sampling, and for discovering its backbone or skeleton. Prim's algorithm and Kruskal's algorithm are well-known algorithms for computing a spanning tree of a weighted network, and are therefore also the default procedure for unweighted networks in the most popular network libraries. In this paper, we empirically study the performance of these algorithms on unweighted networks and compare them with different priority-first search algorithms. We show that the structure of a network, such as the distances between the nodes, is better preserved by a simpler algorithm based on breadth-first search. The spanning trees are also most compact and well-balanced as measured by classical graph indices. We support our findings with experiments on synthetic graphs and more than a thousand real networks, and demonstrate practical applications of the computed spanning trees. We conclude that if a spanning tree is to maintain the structure of an unweighted network, the breadth-first search algorithm should be the preferred choice, and it should be implemented as such in network libraries.</description>

      <title>Risk and Reward of Transitioning from a National to a Zonal Electricity Market in Great Britain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04107v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: More spatially granular electricity wholesale markets promise more efficient operation and better asset siting in highly renewable power systems. Great Britain is considering moving from its current single-price national wholesale market to a zonal design. Existing studies reach varying and difficult-to-reconcile conclusions about the desirability of a zonal market in GB, partly because they rely on models that vary in their transparency and assumptions about future power systems. Using a novel open-source electricity market model, calibrated to match observed network behaviour, this article quantifies consumer savings, unit-level producer surplus impacts, and broader socioeconomic benefits that would have arisen had a six-zone market operated in Great Britain during 2022-2024. In the absence of mitigating policies, it is estimated that during those three years GB consumers would save approximately {\pounds}9.4/MWh (equalling an average of more than {\pounds}2.3B per year), but generators in northern regions would experience revenue reductions of 30-40\%. Policy interventions can restore these units' national market revenues to up to 97\% while still preserving around {\pounds}3.1/MWh in consumer savings (about {\pounds}750M per year). It is further estimated that the current system could achieve approximately {\pounds}380-{\pounds}770 million in annual welfare gain during 2022-2024 through improved operational efficiency alone. The drivers behind these benefits, notably wind curtailment volumes, are expected to become more pronounced towards 2030, suggesting that purely operationally achieved annual benefits of around {\pounds}1-2 billion beyond 2029 are likely. It is found that the scale of these benefits would outweigh the potential downsides related to increases in the cost of capital that have been estimated elsewhere.</description>
