      <title>The (Exact) Price of Cardinality for Indivisible Goods: A Parametric Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We adopt a parametric approach to analyze the worst-case degradation in social welfare when the allocation of indivisible goods is constrained to be fair. Specifically, we are concerned with cardinality-constrained allocations, which require that each agent has at most $k$ items in their allocated bundle. We propose the notion of the price of cardinality, which captures the worst-case multiplicative loss of utilitarian or egalitarian social welfare resulting from imposing the cardinality constraint. We then characterize tight or almost-tight bounds on the price of cardinality as exact functions of the instance parameters, demonstrating how the social welfare improves as $k$ is increased. In particular, one of our main results refines and generalizes the existing asymptotic bound on the price of balancedness, as studied by Bei et al. [BLMS21]. We also further extend our analysis to the problem where the items are partitioned into disjoint categories, and each category has its own cardinality constraint. Through a parametric study of the price of cardinality, we provide a framework which aids decision makers in choosing an ideal level of cardinality-based fairness, using their knowledge of the potential loss of utilitarian and egalitarian social welfare.</description>

      <title>Stackelberg Game Based Performance Optimization in Digital Twin Assisted Federated Learning over NOMA Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01584v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite the advantage of preserving data privacy, federated learning (FL) still suffers from the straggler issue due to the limited computing resources of distributed clients and the unreliable wireless communication environment. By effectively imitating the distributed resources, digital twin (DT) shows great potential in alleviating this issue. In this paper, we leverage DT in the FL framework over non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) network to assist FL training process, considering malicious attacks on model updates from clients. A reputationbased client selection scheme is proposed, which accounts for client heterogeneity in multiple aspects and effectively mitigates the risks of poisoning attacks in FL systems. To minimize the total latency and energy consumption in the proposed system, we then formulate a Stackelberg game by considering clients and the server as the leader and the follower, respectively. Specifically, the leader aims to minimize the energy consumption while the objective of the follower is to minimize the total latency during FL training. The Stackelberg equilibrium is achieved to obtain the optimal solutions. We first derive the strategies for the followerlevel problem and include them in the leader-level problem which is then solved via problem decomposition. Simulation results verify the superior performance of the proposed scheme.</description>

      <title>Steganography and Probabilistic Risk Analysis: A Game Theoretical Framework for Quantifying Adversary Advantage and Impact</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17950v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In high-risk environments where unlawful surveillance is prevalent, securing confidential communications is critical. This study introduces a novel steganographic game-theoretic model to analyze the strategic interactions between a defending company and an adversary. By framing the scenario as a non-cooperative game, there is systematic evaluation of optimal strategies for both parties, incorporating costs and benefits such as implementation expenses, potential data leaks, and operational advantages. The derived equilibrium probabilities enable the assessment of success rates, illustrating conditions under which the company benefits from hiding messages or faces increased risks when not implementing steganography. Sensitivity analysis explores how changes in key parameters impact these strategies, enhancing the understanding of decision-making in secure communications. Furthermore, the introduction of an adversary model that quantifies the adversary's advantage using conditional probabilities derived from success rates allows for a quantitative measure of the adversary's effectiveness based on the defender's strategies. By integrating the adversary's advantage into a novel risk analysis framework and employing Monte Carlo simulations, dynamic interactions are captured across advantage scenarios, considering factors like impact factor, steganography effectiveness, and equilibrium probabilities. This comprehensive framework offers practical insights into optimizing security strategies by quantifying potential risk reductions when the adversary is disadvantaged, providing a clear methodology for assessing and mitigating adversarial threats in complex security environments.</description>
