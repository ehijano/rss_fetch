      <title>RIS-Aided Cooperative Mobile Edge Computing: Computation Efficiency Maximization via Joint Uplink and Downlink Resource Allocation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In mobile edge computing (MEC) systems, the wireless channel condition is a critical factor affecting both the communication power consumption and computation rate of the offloading tasks. This paper exploits the idea of cooperative transmission and employing reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) in MEC to improve the channel condition and maximize computation efficiency (CE). The resulting problem couples various wireless resources in both uplink and downlink, which calls for the joint design of the user association, receive/downlink beamforming vectors, transmit power of users, task partition strategies for local computing and offloading, and uplink/downlink phase shifts at the RIS. To tackle the challenges brought by the combinatorial optimization problem, the group sparsity structure of the beamforming vectors determined by user association is exploited. Furthermore, while the CE does not explicitly depend on the downlink phase shifts, instead of simply finding a feasible solution, we exploit the hidden relationship between them and convert this relationship into an explicit form for optimization. Then the resulting problem is solved via the alternating maximization framework, and the nonconvexity of each subproblem is handled individually. Simulation results show that cooperative transmission and RIS deployment can significantly improve the CE and demonstrate the importance of optimizing the downlink phase shifts with an explicit form.</description>

      <title>Output-Constrained Lossy Source Coding With Application to Rate-Distortion-Perception Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14849v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The distortion-rate function of output-constrained lossy source coding with limited common randomness is analyzed for the special case of squared error distortion measure. An explicit expression is obtained when both source and reconstruction distributions are Gaussian. This further leads to a partial characterization of the information-theoretic limit of quadratic Gaussian rate-distortion-perception coding with the perception measure given by Kullback-Leibler divergence or squared quadratic Wasserstein distance.</description>

      <title>Secure Outage Analysis for RIS-Aided MISO Systems with Randomly Located Eavesdroppers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14911v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the physical layer security of an RIS-assisted multiple-antenna communication system with randomly located eavesdroppers. The exact distributions of the received signal-to-noise-ratios (SNRs) at the legitimate user and the eavesdroppers located according to a Poisson point process (PPP) are derived, and a closed-form expression for the secrecy outage probability (SOP) is obtained. It is revealed that the secrecy performance is mainly affected by the number of RIS reflecting elements, and the impact of the transmit antennas and transmit power at the base station is marginal. In addition, when the locations of the randomly located eavesdroppers are unknown, deploying the RIS closer to the legitimate user rather than to the base station is shown to be more efficient. We also perform an analytical study demonstrating that the secrecy diversity order depends on the path loss exponent of the RIS-to-ground links. Finally, numerical simulations are conducted to verify the accuracy of these theoretical observations.</description>

      <title>Primary Rate Maximization in Movable Antennas Empowered Symbiotic Radio Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14943v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a movable antenna (MA) empowered scheme for symbiotic radio (SR) communication systems. Specifically, multiple antennas at the primary transmitter (PT) can be flexibly moved to favorable locations to boost the channel conditions of the primary and secondary transmissions. The primary transmission is achieved by the active transmission from the PT to the primary user (PU), while the backscatter device (BD) takes a ride over the incident signal from the PT to passively send the secondary signal to the PU. Under this setup, we consider a primary rate maximization problem by jointly optimizing the transmit beamforming and the positions of MAs at the PT under a practical bit error rate constraint on the secondary transmission. Then, an alternating optimization framework with the utilization of the successive convex approximation, semi-definite processing and simulated annealing (SA) modified particle swarm optimization (SA-PSO) methods is proposed to find the solution of the transmit beamforming and MAs' positions. Finally, numerical results are provided to demonstrate the performance improvement provided by the proposed MA empowered scheme and the proposed algorithm.</description>

      <title>Range-Angle Estimation for FDA-MIMO System With Frequency Offset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14978v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Frequency diverse array multiple-input multiple-output (FDA-MIMO) radar differs from the traditional phased array (PA) radar, and can form range-angle-dependent beampattern and differentiate between closely spaced targets sharing the same angle but occupying distinct range cells. In the FDA-MIMO radar, target range estimation is achieved by employing a subtle frequency variation between adjacent array antennas, so the estimation performance is degraded severely in a practical scenario with frequency offset. In this paper, the range-angle estimation problem for FDA-MIMO radar is considered with frequency offsets in both transmitting and receiving arrays. First, we build a system model for the FDA-MIMO radar with transmitting and receiving frequency offsets. Then, the frequency offset is transferred into an equalized additional noise. The noise characteristics are analyzed in detail theoretically, together with the influence on the range-angle estimation. Moreover, since the effect of the transmitting frequency offset is similar to additional colored noise, denoising algorithms are introduced to mitigate the performance deterioration caused by the frequency offset. Finally, Cram\'{e}r-Rao lower bounds (CRLB) for the range-angle estimation are derived in the scenario with the frequency offsets. Simulation results show the analysis of frequency offset and the corresponding estimation performance using different algorithms.</description>

      <title>STAR-RIS Assisted Downlink Active and Uplink Backscatter Communications with NOMA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15120v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A simultaneously transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent surface (STAR-RIS) assisted downlink (DL) active and uplink (UL) backscatter communication (BackCom) framework is proposed. More particularly, a full-duplex (FD) base station (BS) communicates with the DL users via the STAR-RIS's transmission link, while exciting and receiving the information from the UL BackCom devices with the aid of the STAR-RIS's reflection link. Non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) is exploited in both DL and UL communications for improving the spectrum efficiency. The system weighted sum rate maximization problem is formulated for jointly optimizing the FD BS active receive and transmit beamforming, the STAR- RIS passive beamforming, and the DL NOMA decoding orders, subject to the DL user's individual rate constraint. To tackle this challenging non-convex problem, we propose an alternating optimization (AO) based algorithm for the joint active and passive beamforming design with a given DL NOMA decoding order. To address the potential high computational complexity required for exhaustive searching all the NOMA decoding orders, an efficient NOMA user ordering scheme is further developed. Finally, numerical results demonstrate that: i) compared with the baseline schemes employing conventional RISs or space division multiple access, the proposed scheme achieves higher performance gains; and ii) higher UL rate gain is obtained at a cost of DL performance degradation, as a remedy, a more flexible performance tradeoff can be achieved by introducing the STAR-RIS.</description>

      <title>Coexisting Passive RIS and Active Relay Assisted NOMA Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A novel coexisting passive reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) and active decode-and-forward (DF) relay assisted non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) transmission framework is proposed. In particular, two communication protocols are conceived, namely Hybrid NOMA (H-NOMA) and Full NOMA (F-NOMA). Based on the proposed two protocols, both the sum rate maximization and max-min rate fairness problems are formulated for jointly optimizing the power allocation at the access point and relay as well as the passive beamforming design at the RIS. To tackle the non-convex problems, an alternating optimization (AO) based algorithm is first developed, where the transmit power and the RIS phase-shift are alternatingly optimized by leveraging the two-dimensional search and rank-relaxed difference-of-convex (DC) programming, respectively. Then, a two-layer penalty based joint optimization (JO) algorithm is developed to jointly optimize the resource allocation coefficients within each iteration. Finally, numerical results demonstrate that: i) the proposed coexisting RIS and relay assisted transmission framework is capable of achieving a significant user performance improvement than conventional schemes without RIS or relay; ii) compared with the AO algorithm, the JO algorithm requires less execution time at the cost of a slight performance loss; and iii) the H-NOMA and F-NOMA protocols are generally preferable for ensuring user rate fairness and enhancing user sum rate, respectively.</description>

      <title>Uplink soft handover for LEO constellations: how strong the inter-satellite link should be</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15131v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a constellation of low-earth-orbit (LEO) satellites connected to a handheld device on the ground. Due to the very large orbital speed, an effective handover strategy becomes of paramount importance. In particular, we study the benefits of soft handover in the uplink from the physical-layer point of view. We give a realistic model for both the ground-to-satellite and the inter-satellite links, following the 3GPP channel model for the former. We suppose that, during handover from a serving satellite to a target satellite, one of the two satellites forwards the received signal from the ground user to the other, thus acting as a relay. We quantify through simulations the loss of hard handover, compared to soft handover. For the latter, we test both amplify-and-forward (AF) and decode-and-forward (DF) relaying techniques and verify that, at least in the simulated conditions, DF does not repay, in terms of block error rate (BLER), the increase of complexity with respect to AF. Also, we study the effect of the LEO constellation size on the network BLER. Finally, we show that, with soft handover, the impact of misalignment on the inter-satellite link is severe, especially at optical frequencies.</description>

      <title>Robust Resource Allocation for STAR-RIS Assisted SWIPT Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A simultaneously transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent surface (STAR-RIS) assisted simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) system is proposed. More particularly, an STAR-RIS is deployed to assist in the information/power transfer from a multi-antenna access point (AP) to multiple single-antenna information users (IUs) and energy users (EUs), where two practical STAR-RIS operating protocols, namely energy splitting (ES) and time switching (TS), are employed. Under the imperfect channel state information (CSI) condition, a multi-objective optimization problem (MOOP) framework, that simultaneously maximizes the minimum data rate and minimum harvested power, is employed to investigate the fundamental rate-energy trade-off between IUs and EUs. To obtain the optimal robust resource allocation strategy, the MOOP is first transformed into a single-objective optimization problem (SOOP) via the {\epsilon}-constraint method, which is then reformulated by approximating semi-infinite inequality constraints with the S-procedure. For ES, an alternating optimization (AO)-based algorithm is proposed to jointly design AP active beamforming and STAR-RIS passive beamforming, where a penalty method is leveraged in STAR-RIS beamforming design. Furthermore, the developed algorithm is extended to optimize the time allocation policy and beamforming vectors in a two-layer iterative manner for TS. Numerical results reveal that: 1) deploying STAR-RISs achieves a significant performance gain over conventional RISs, especially in terms of harvested power for EUs; 2) the ES protocol obtains a better user fairness performance when focusing only on IUs or EUs, while the TS protocol yields a better balance between IUs and EUs; 3) the imperfect CSI affects IUs more significantly than EUs, whereas TS can confer a more robust design to attenuate these effects.</description>

      <title>Channel Orthogonalization with Reconfigurable Surfaces: General Models, Theoretical Limits, and Effective Configuration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15165v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We envision a future in which multi-antenna technology effectively exploits the spatial domain as a set of non-interfering orthogonal resources, allowing for flexible resource allocation and efficient modulation/demodulation. Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) has emerged as a promising technology which allows shaping the propagation environment for improved performance. This paper studies the ability of three extended types of reconfigurable surface (RS), including the recently proposed beyond diagonal RIS (BD-RIS), to achieve perfectly orthogonal channels in a general multi-user multiple-input multiple-output (MU-MIMO) scenario. We propose practical implementations for the three types of RS consisting of passive components, and obtain the corresponding restrictions on their reconfigurability. We then use these restrictions to derive closed-form conditions for achieving arbitrary (orthogonal) channels. We also study the problem of optimal orthogonal channel selection for achieving high channel gain without active amplification at the RS, and we propose some methods with satisfying performance. Finally, we provide efficient channel estimation and RS configuration techniques such that all the computation, including the channel selection, may be performed at the base station (BS). The numerical results showcase the potential and practicality of RS channel orthogonalization, thus taking a step towards orthogonal spatial domain multiplexing (OSDM).</description>

      <title>Mutual Information of a class of Poisson-type Channels using Markov Renewal Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15221v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The mutual information (MI) of Poisson-type channels has been linked to a filtering problem since the 70s, but its evaluation for specific continuous-time, discrete-state systems remains a demanding task. As an advantage, Markov renewal processes (MrP) retain their renewal property under state space filtering. This offers a way to solve the filtering problem analytically for small systems. We consider a class of communication systems $X \to Y$ that can be derived from a MrP by a custom filtering procedure. For the subclasses, where (i) $Y$ is a renewal process or (ii) $(X,Y)$ belongs to a class of MrPs, we provide an evolution equation for finite transmission duration $T&gt;0$ and limit theorems for $T \to \infty$ that facilitate simulation-free evaluation of the MI $\mathbb{I}(X_{[0,T]}; Y_{[0,T]})$ and its associated mutual information rate (MIR). In other cases, simulation cost is significantly reduced. We show that systems with an additional $X$-modulating level $C$, which statically chooses between different processes $X_{[0,T]}(c)$, can naturally be included in our framework thereby giving an expression for $\mathbb{I}(C; Y_{[0,T]})$. The theoretical framework is showcased in an application to bacterial gene expression, where filtering is analytically tractable.</description>

      <title>Information Rates of Successive Interference Cancellation for Optical Fiber</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.15240v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Successive interference cancellation (SIC) is used to approach the achievable information rates (AIRs) of joint detection and decoding for long-haul optical fiber links. The AIRs of memoryless ring constellations are compared to those of circularly symmetric complex Gaussian modulation for surrogate channel models with correlated phase noise. Simulations are performed for 1000 km of standard single-mode fiber with ideal Raman amplification. In this setup, 32 rings and 16 SIC-stages with Gaussian message-passing receivers achieve the AIR peaks of previous work. The computational complexity scales in proportion to the number of SIC-stages, where one stage has the complexity of separate detection and decoding.</description>

      <title>Construction of Complete Complementary Codes over Small Alphabet</title>

      <description>arXiv:2102.10517v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Complete complementary codes (CCCs) play a vital role not only in wireless communication, particularly in multicarrier systems where achieving an interference-free environment is of paramount importance, but also in the construction of other codes that necessitate appropriate functions to meet the diverse demands within today's landscape of wireless communication evaluation. This research is focused on the area of constructing $q$-ary functions for both of {traditional and spectrally null constraint (SNC) CCCs}\footnote{When no codes in CCCs having zero components, we call it as traditonal CCCs, else, we call it as SNC-CCCs in this pape.} of flexible length, set size and alphabet. We construct traditional CCCs with lengths, defined as $L = \prod_{i=1}^k p_i^{m_i}$, set sizes, defined as $K = \prod_{i=1}^k p_i^{n_i+1}$, and an alphabet size of $q=\prod_{i=1}^k p_i$, such that $p_1&lt;p_2&lt;\cdots&lt;p_k $. The parameters $m_1, m_2, \ldots, m_k$ (each greater than or equal to $2$) are positive integers, while $n_1, n_2, \ldots, n_k$ are non-negative integers satisfying $n_i \leq m_i-1$, and the variable $k$ represents a positive integer. To achieve these specific parameters, we define $q$-ary functions over a domain $\mathbf{Z}_{p_1}^{m_1}\times \cdots \times \mathbf{Z}_{p_k}^{m_k}$ that is considered a proper subset of $\mathbb{Z}_{q}^m$ and encompasses $\prod_{i=1}^k p_i^{m_i}$ vectors, where $\mathbf{Z}_{p_i}^{m_i}=\{0,1,\hdots,p_i-1\}^{m_i}$, and the value of $m$ is derived from the sum of $m_1, m_2, \ldots, m_k$. This organization of the domain allows us to encompass all conceivable integer-valued length sequences over the alphabet $\mathbb{Z}_q$. It has been demonstrated that by constraining a $q$-ary function that generates traditional CCCs, we can derive SNC-CCCs with identical length and alphabet, yet a smaller or equal set size compared to the traditional CCCs.</description>

      <title>Randomly punctured Reed--Solomon codes achieve list-decoding capacity over linear-sized fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.09445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.09445v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reed--Solomon codes are a classic family of error-correcting codes consisting of evaluations of low-degree polynomials over a finite field on some sequence of distinct field elements. They are widely known for their optimal unique-decoding capabilities, but their list-decoding capabilities are not fully understood. Given the prevalence of Reed-Solomon codes, a fundamental question in coding theory is determining if Reed--Solomon codes can optimally achieve list-decoding capacity.
  A recent breakthrough by Brakensiek, Gopi, and Makam, established that Reed--Solomon codes are combinatorially list-decodable all the way to capacity. However, their results hold for randomly-punctured Reed--Solomon codes over an exponentially large field size $2^{O(n)}$, where $n$ is the block length of the code. A natural question is whether Reed--Solomon codes can still achieve capacity over smaller fields. Recently, Guo and Zhang showed that Reed--Solomon codes are list-decodable to capacity with field size $O(n^2)$. We show that Reed--Solomon codes are list-decodable to capacity with linear field size $O(n)$, which is optimal up to the constant factor. We also give evidence that the ratio between the alphabet size $q$ and code length $n$ cannot be bounded by an absolute constant. Our techniques also show that random linear codes are list-decodable up to (the alphabet-independent) capacity with optimal list-size $O(1/\varepsilon)$ and near-optimal alphabet size $2^{O(1/\varepsilon^2)}$, where $\varepsilon$ is the gap to capacity. As far as we are aware, list-decoding up to capacity with optimal list-size $O(1/\varepsilon)$ was previously not known to be achievable with any linear code over a constant alphabet size (even non-constructively). Our proofs are based on the ideas of Guo and Zhang, and we additionally exploit symmetries of reduced intersection matrices.</description>

      <title>On Secrecy Performance of RIS-Assisted MISO Systems over Rician Channels with Spatially Random Eavesdroppers</title>

Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) technology is emerging as a promising technique for performance enhancement for next-generation wireless networks. This paper investigates the physical layer security of an RIS-assisted multiple-antenna communication system in the presence of random spatially distributed eavesdroppers. The RIS-to-ground channels are assumed to experience Rician fading. Using stochastic geometry, exact distributions of the received signal-to-noise-ratios (SNRs) at the legitimate user and the eavesdroppers located according to a Poisson point process (PPP) are derived, and closed-form expressions for the secrecy outage probability (SOP) and the ergodic secrecy capacity (ESC) are obtained to provide insightful guidelines for system design. First, the secrecy diversity order is obtained as $\frac{2}{\alpha_2}$, where $\alpha_2$ denotes the path loss exponent of the RIS-to-ground links. Then, it is revealed that the secrecy performance is mainly affected by the number of RIS reflecting elements, $N$, and the impact of the number of transmit antennas and transmit power at the base station is marginal. In addition, when the locations of the randomly located eavesdroppers are unknown, deploying the RIS closer to the legitimate user rather than to the base station is shown to be more efficient. Moreover, it is also found that the density of randomly located eavesdroppers, $\lambda_e$, has an additive effect on the asymptotic ESC performance given by $\log_2{\left({1}/{\lambda_e}\right)}$. Finally, numerical simulations are conducted to verify the accuracy of these theoretical observations.</description>

      <title>Coverage and Rate Analysis for Integrated Sensing and Communication Networks</title>

Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) is increasingly recognized as a pivotal technology for next-generation cellular networks, offering mutual benefits in both sensing and communication capabilities. This advancement necessitates a re-examination of the fundamental limits within networks where these two functions coexist via shared spectrum and infrastructures. However, traditional stochastic geometry-based performance analyses are confined to either communication or sensing networks separately. This paper bridges this gap by introducing a generalized stochastic geometry framework in ISAC networks. Based on this framework, we define and calculate the coverage and ergodic rate of sensing and communication performance under resource constraints. Then, we shed light on the fundamental limits of ISAC networks by presenting theoretical results for the coverage rate of the unified performance, taking into account the coupling effects of dual functions in coexistence networks. Further, we obtain the analytical formulations for evaluating the ergodic sensing rate constrained by the maximum communication rate, and the ergodic communication rate constrained by the maximum sensing rate. Extensive numerical results validate the accuracy of all theoretical derivations, and also indicate that denser networks significantly enhance ISAC coverage. Specifically, increasing the base station density from $1$ $\text{km}^{-2}$ to $10$ $\text{km}^{-2}$ can boost the ISAC coverage rate from $1.4\%$ to $39.8\%$. Further, results also reveal that with the increase of the constrained sensing rate, the ergodic communication rate improves significantly, but the reverse is not obvious.</description>

      <title>Learning-Based One-Bit Maximum Likelihood Detection for Massive MIMO Systems: Dithering-Aided Adaptive Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.07696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.07696v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a learning-based detection framework for uplink massive multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO) systems with one-bit analog-to-digital converters. The learning-based detection only requires counting the occurrences of the quantized outputs of -1 and +1 for estimating a likelihood probability at each antenna. Accordingly, the key advantage of this approach is to perform maximum likelihood detection without explicit channel estimation which has been one of the primary challenges of one-bit quantized systems. However, due to the quasi-deterministic reception in the high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime, one-bit observations in the high SNR regime are biased to either +1 or -1, and thus, the learning requires excessive training to estimate the small likelihood probabilities. To address this drawback, we propose a dither-and-learning technique to estimate likelihood functions from dithered signals. First, we add a dithering signal to artificially decrease the SNR and then infer the likelihood function from the quantized dithered signals by using an SNR estimate derived from a deep neural network-based estimator which is trained offline. We extend our technique by developing an adaptive dither-and-learning method that updates the dithering power according to the patterns observed in the quantized dithered signals. The proposed framework is also applied to channel-coded MIMO systems by computing a bit-wise and user-wise log-likelihood ratio from the refined likelihood probabilities. Simulation results validate the performance of the proposed methods in both uncoded and coded systems.</description>
