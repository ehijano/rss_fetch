      <title>Apparent Selection Pressure for Channel Capacity in Bacterial Chemotactic Sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02446v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bacterial chemotactic sensing converts noisy chemical signals into running and tumbling. We analyze the static sensing limits of mixed Tar/Tsr chemoreceptor clusters in individual Escherichia coli cells using a heterogeneous Monod-Wyman-Changeux (MWC) model. By sweeping a seven-dimensional parameter space, we compute three sensing performance metrics-channel capacity, effective Hill coefficient, and dynamic range. Across E. coli-like parameter regimes, we consistently observe pronounced local maxima of channel capacity, whereas neither the effective Hill coefficient nor the dynamic range exhibit comparable optimization. The capacity-achieving input distribution is bimodal, which implies that individual cells maximize information by sampling both low- and high concentration regimes. Together, these results suggest that, at the individual-cell level, channel capacity may be selected for in E. coli receptor clusters.</description>

      <title>Multi-scale Graph Autoregressive Modeling: Molecular Property Prediction via Next Token Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02530v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present Connection-Aware Motif Sequencing (CamS), a graph-to-sequence representation that enables decoder-only Transformers to learn molecular graphs via standard next-token prediction (NTP). For molecular property prediction, SMILES-based NTP scales well but lacks explicit topology, whereas graph-native masked modeling captures connectivity but risks disrupting the pivotal chemical details (e.g., activity cliffs). CamS bridges this gap by serializing molecular graphs into structure-rich causal sequences. CamS first mines data-driven connection-aware motifs. It then serializes motifs via scaffold-rooted breadth-first search (BFS) to establish a stable core-to-periphery order. Crucially, CamS enables hierarchical modeling by concatenating sequences from fine to coarse motif scales, allowing the model to condition global scaffolds on dense, uncorrupted local structural evidence. We instantiate CamS-LLaMA by pre-training a vanilla LLaMA backbone on CamS sequences. It achieves state-of-the-art performance on MoleculeNet and the activity-cliff benchmark MoleculeACE, outperforming both SMILES-based language models and strong graph baselines. Interpretability analysis confirms that our multi-scale causal serialization effectively drives attention toward cliff-determining differences.</description>

      <title>Exploring Multi-Objective Trade-offs in Reference Compound Selection for Validation Studies of Toxicity Assays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07140v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Validation studies that assess the applicability and reliability of analytical and predictive methods rely on reference sets whose composition implicitly encodes multiple competing design objectives. Because these trade-offs are typically addressed through expert judgment, their structure often remains implicit, making it difficult to systematically examine how design choices shape evaluation outcomes. Here, we formulate reference set construction as an explicit multi-objective design problem. We define interpretable objective functions capturing structural, physicochemical, and response-related diversity, and employ a genetic algorithm as an exploratory solver to visualize the resulting trade-off structure. Rather than prescribing optimal or recommended reference sets, this framework enables systematic exploration of feasible designs and explicit comparison of their positions within a multi-dimensional design space. We apply this formulation to validation studies of toxicity assays as a representative real-world case. Using illustrative analyses under fixed modeling protocols, we show that reference set selection functions as an independent design axis that determines what properties of model behavior are observed under evaluation, without attributing such effects to model performance itself. Together, this work provides a general framework for making implicit trade-offs in reference set construction explicit. By complementing established expert-driven practices, the proposed approach supports more transparent discussion and interpretation of evaluation design choices across experimental validation settings.</description>

      <title>Quantifying task-relevant representational similarity using decision variable correlation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02164v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Previous studies have compared neural activities in the visual cortex to representations in deep neural networks trained on image classification. Interestingly, while some suggest that their representations are highly similar, others argued the opposite. Here, we propose a new approach to characterize the similarity of the decision strategies of two observers (models or brains) using decision variable correlation (DVC). DVC quantifies the image-by-image correlation between the decoded decisions based on the internal neural representations in a classification task. Thus, it can capture task-relevant information rather than general representational alignment. We evaluate DVC using monkey V4/IT recordings and network models trained on image classification tasks. We find that model-model similarity is comparable to monkey-monkey similarity, whereas model-monkey similarity is consistently lower. Strikingly, DVC decreases with increasing network performance on ImageNet-1k. Adversarial training does not improve model-monkey similarity in task-relevant dimensions assessed using DVC, although it markedly increases the model-model similarity. Similarly, pre-training on larger datasets does not improve model-monkey similarity. These results suggest a divergence between the task-relevant representations in monkey V4/IT and those learned by models trained on image classification tasks.</description>

      <title>The Color-Clinical Decoupling: Why Perceptual Calibration Fails Clinical Biomarkers in Smartphone Dermatology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21988v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Smartphone-based tele-dermatology assumes that colorimetric calibration ensures clinical reliability, yet this remains untested for underrepresented skin phototypes. We investigated whether standard calibration translates to reliable clinical biomarkers using 43,425 images from 965 Korean subjects (Fitzpatrick III-IV) across DSLR, tablet, and smartphone devices. While Linear Color Correction Matrix (CCM) normalization reduced color error by 67-77% -- achieving near-clinical accuracy (Delta E &lt; 2.3) -- this success did not translate to biomarker reliability.
  We identify a phenomenon termed "color-clinical decoupling": despite perceptual accuracy, the Individual Typology Angle (ITA) showed poor inter-device agreement (ICC = 0.40), while the Melanin Index achieved good agreement (ICC = 0.77). This decoupling is driven by the ITA formula's sensitivity to b* channel noise and is further compounded by anatomical variance. Facial region accounts for 25.2% of color variance -- 3.6x greater than device effects (7.0%) -- challenging the efficacy of single-patch calibration. Our results demonstrate that current colorimetric standards are insufficient for clinical-grade biomarker extraction, necessitating region-aware protocols for mobile dermatology.</description>
