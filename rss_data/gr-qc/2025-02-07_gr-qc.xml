      <title>Cosmology on the Generalized Proca Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03483v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This thesis employs the dynamical systems approach to explore two cosmological models: an anisotropic dark energy scenario in a Bianchi-I background and the Generalized SU(2) Proca (GSU2P) theory in a flat FLRW background. In the first case, a numerical framework is developed to analyze the interaction between a scalar tachyon field and a vector field, identifying parameter regions that allow anisotropic accelerated attractors. The second case examines the viability of GSU2P as a driver of inflation and late-time acceleration. Our analysis reveals fundamental limitations, including the absence of stable attractors and smooth cosmological transitions, ultimately ruling out the model as a complete description of the Universe's expansion. This work highlights the effectiveness of dynamical systems techniques in assessing alternative cosmological scenarios and underscores the need for refined theoretical frameworks aligned with observational constraints.</description>

      <title>Exploring $\phi$CDM model dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03486v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the $\phi$CDM model, and we compare to the concordance model. We provide their epoch evolution, we perform a dynamical analysis to each model, and a comparative analysis between the two models. We revitalise these two models, since we study them in systems with higher number of variables. Furthermore, the $\phi$CDM model is more complete than the one that we found in the literature, since we take into account all the so far discovered epochs, radiation, matter, and dark energy epochs. In contrast in the literature there is no study including the radiation epoch for this model. We find that both models can describe the generally accepted scenario of cosmic evolution, and current observations. Both models, describe qualitative and quantitative current observations about the epoch behaviour of the species of the universe. We find the $\phi$CDM model has the following exotic transition from a \textit{dominant radiation energy density ratio} epoch and a \textit{low dominant matter energy density ratio and high dominant radiation energy density ratio} epoch, towards a \textit{dominant scalar potential energy density ratio} epoch, in the matter-potential-scalar plane.</description>

      <title>On a star with static conformally flat geometry inside</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03488v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The properties of a star with constant positive energy density inside (as for the Schwarzschild interior geometry) and a negative pressure are investigated, using a static conformally flat spacetime. Because of the negative pressure, the gravitational field inside is repulsive. Ricci and Kretschmann curvature invariants are finite. The energy conditions for the stress tensor of the perfect fluid are satisfied, excepting the strong energy condition which is not obeyed for $r&lt;R/\sqrt{2}$, where $R$ is the radius of the object. The radial timelike geodesics are studied.</description>

      <title>Primordial Gravitational Waves in Quadratic Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03543v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quadratic gravity is a fourth-order (in derivatives) theory that can serve as an attractive upgrade to the standard description of gravity provided by General Relativity, thanks to its renormalizability and its built-in description of primordial inflation. We bring quadratic gravity into a second-order form by introducing an auxiliary tensor field and we consider the primordial tensor fluctuations (gravitational waves) in the theory around a Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker background. After a canonical quantization of the perturbations, we calculate the tensor power spectrum in quasi de Sitter spacetime. We find that the spectral index $n_t$ and the amplitude $A_t$ of the tensor power spectrum are both suppressed by the factor $(1 + 2{\bf H}^2_*/m_\text{gh}^2)^{-1}$, where ${\bf H}_*$ is the Hubble rate at horizon exit and $m_\text{gh}$ is the mass of the spin-two ghost. This restores the slow-roll consistency condition familiar from single-field inflation models, where the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ is equal to $-8n_t$ in the lowest nontrivial order in the slow-roll approximation. We also discuss the well-known issue of the ghost problem in fourth-order theories and how it pertains to the results at hand.</description>

      <title>Tilt in quadratic gravity II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03653v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a tilted fluid component on a Bianchi V geometry in the theories of General Relativity (GR) and Quadratic Gravity (QG). The numerical time evolution is to the future. As is well known, QG contains the Ruzmaikina-Ruzmaikin (RR) solution. This solution describes the slow-roll regime of Starobinsky's inflationary model, which is currently the best one due to the excellent agreement with Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation (CMBR) data. In QG, we found universes that can be attracted to the RR solution or recollapse toward the isotropic singularity attractor. If the Equation of State (EoS) parameter is ultra-radiative w&gt;1/3, the tilt variable increases both in RR and Milne for QG or GR, respectively. In both cases, the fluid expansion and acceleration diverge, while the vorticity initially increases and then decreases to zero.</description>

      <title>Novel echoes from black holes in conformal Weyl gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03706v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We reveal a novel class of echoes from black holes in conformal Weyl gravity and show that they are generated due to the large-scale structure of the cosmos, rather than near-horizon modifications of black holes as well as wormhole spacetimes. To this end, we take into account the evolution of a massive scalar perturbation on the background geometry of conformal Weyl black holes and show that the corresponding effective potential enjoys a double-peak barrier against the incident scalar waves. We perform the calculations for the time evolution profiles of scalar perturbations to understand how the linear term in the metric function and the cosmological constant produce echoes. The Prony method is also employed to calculate the quasinormal frequencies of the early-stage quasinormal ringing phase.</description>

      <title>Accretion disk dynamics in Teleparallel Born-Infeld gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Teleparallel Born-Infeld gravity (TBI) is a modified theory of gravity that aims to maintain second-order field equations, leading to alternative scenarios for strong gravity and cosmological settings. In this study, we examine the impact of TBI gravity on the physical characteristics of thin (Novikov-Thorne) accretion disks, focusing on quantities such as flux, pressure, temperature, etc. We also examine the spectral luminosity, comparing it to disks around the Schwarzschild black holes. The analysis indicates that smaller values of $\lambda$ lead to more noticeable effects in the inner disk regions. By comparing the theoretical predictions to observational data in the low-frequency regime, we demonstrate ability of the model to align with real astrophysical systems and distinguish subtle differences between TBI gravity and general relativity. Furthermore, the results suggest that observations of X-ray spectra from the inner disk regions can provide valuable insights into the properties of TBI gravity, potentially offering constraints on this modified gravity theory through future astrophysical observations.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Bayesian model selection for equation of state of cold neutron stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a computational framework, Bayesian Evidence calculation fOr Model Selection (BEOMS) to evaluate multiple Bayesian model selection methods in the context of determining the equation of state (EOS) for cold neutron star (NS), focusing on their performance with current and next-generation gravitational wave (GW) observatories. We conduct a systematic comparison of various EOS models by using posterior distributions obtained from EOS-agnostic Bayesian inference of binary parameters applied to GWs from a population of binary neutron star (BNS) mergers. The cumulative evidence for each model is calculated in a multi-dimensional parameter space characterized by neutron star masses and tidal deformabilities. Our findings indicate that Bayesian model selection is most effective when performed in the two-dimensional subspace of component mass and tidal deformability, requiring fewer events to distinguish between EOS models with high confidence. Furthermore, we establish a relationship between the precision of tidal deformability measurements and the accuracy of model selection, taking into account the evolving sensitivities of current and planned GW observatories. BEOMS offers computational efficiency and can be adapted to execute model selection for gravitational wave data from other sources.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03866v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have revisited the gradient-flow in information geometry from the perspective of Weyl symmetry. The gradient-flow equations are derived from the proposed action which is invariant under the Weyl's gauge transformations. In Weyl integrable geometry, we have related Amari's $\alpha$-connections in IG to the Weyl invariant connection on the Riemannian manifold equipped with the scaled metric.</description>

      <title>Equivalence principles in Weyl transverse gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03888v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There exist two consistent theories of massless, self-interacting gravitons, which differ by their local symmetries: general relativity and Weyl transverse gravity. We show that these two theories are also the only two metric descriptions of gravity in 4 spacetime dimensions which obey the equivalence principle for test gravitational physics. We further analyse how the weaker formulations of the equivalence principle are realised in Weyl transverse gravity (and its generalisations). The analysis sheds light on the behaviour of matter fields in this theory.</description>

      <title>pyEFPE: An improved post-Newtonian waveform model for inspiralling precessing-eccentric compact binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03929v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The measurement of spin-precession and orbital eccentricity in gravitational-wave (GW) signals is a key priority in GW astronomy, as these effects not only provide insights into the astrophysical formation and evolution of compact binaries but also, if neglected, could introduce significant biases in parameter estimation, searches, and tests of General Relativity. Despite the growing potential of upcoming LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA observing runs and future detectors to measure eccentric-precessing signals, accurately and efficiently modeling them remains a challenge. In this work, we present pyEFPE, a frequency-domain post-Newtonian (PN) waveform model for the inspiral of precessing-eccentric compact binaries. pyEFPE improves upon previous models by introducing analytical expressions for the Fourier mode amplitudes, enhancing the numerical stability of the multiple scale analysis framework, and adding recently derived PN corrections, critical to accurately describe signals in GW detectors. Additionally, we simplify the numerical implementation and introduce a scheme to interpolate the amplitudes, achieving a speedup of up to ~O(20) in the waveform computations, making the model practical for data analysis applications. We thoroughly validate pyEFPE by comparing it to other waveform models in the quasi-circular and eccentric-spin-aligned limits, finding good agreement. Additionally, we demonstrate pyEFPE's capability to analyze simulated GW events, accurately recovering the parameters of signals described by both pyEFPE and IMRPhenomXP. While pyEFPE still lacks important physical effects, such as higher-order PN corrections, higher-order modes, mode asymmetries, tidal interactions or the merger-ringdown phase, it represents a significant step towards more complete waveform models, offering a flexible and efficient framework that can be extended in future work to incorporate these effects.</description>

      <title>Axisymmetric stability of neutron stars as extreme rotators in massive scalar-tensor theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Differentially rotating scalarized neutron stars, mimickers of binary merger remnants, can possess an enormous angular momentum larger than what could possibly be sustained in a neutron star in general relativity by about one order of magnitude. A natural question to ask is whether these solutions are stable and thus can realize in a binary coalescence. With this motivation in mind, we examine the criterion of dynamical stability against axisymmetric perturbations for these ultra-rotators by numerically tracking their nonlinear evolution in an axisymmetric setup. We demonstrate that the turning-point criterion still serves as a sufficient condition for asymmetric (in)stability. Our findings open an interesting question of whether the merger of two scalarized neutron stars can produce (possibly short-lived) ultra-highly rotating merger remnants.</description>

      <title>Time delay interferometry with minimal null frequencies and shortened time span</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03983v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In Paper I, we introduced an alternative second-generation time-delay interferometry (TDI) configuration, hybrid Relay, designed to minimize null frequencies and enhance data analysis for massive binary black hole (MBBH). In Paper II, we further improved its performance in noise characterization by replacing its null stream with a specialized stable channel, $C^{12}_3$. In this work, we propose a novel TDI configuration, labeled PD4L, which features minimal null frequencies and a reduced time span. Unlike the hybrid Relay or the second-generation Michelson, which require a maximum delay of $7L$ (where $L$ is the ranging time of interferometric arm), the PD4L synthesizes data only within $3L$ delay. This shorter time span brings several advantages: 1) reducing margins at boundaries of data segments, 2) mitigating frequency aliasing in the high frequency band, and 3) shortening the tail at the end of a signal. To assess its effectiveness in data analysis, we perform parameter inference for a rapidly chirping gravitational wave signal from a MBBH. As a more compact TDI structure, PD4L achieves more accurate parameters estimation in the frequency-domain compared to the hybrid Relay. Additionally, PD4L's null stream exhibits minimal null frequencies, identical to its science channels, while maintaining a more stable noise spectrum than the $C^{12}_3$. We further evaluate its capability in noise characterization. The results demonstrate that although the stability of noise spectra in science channels is slightly lower compared to that of hybrid Relay, PD4L can still reliably infer noise parameters for data durations of up to four months. These investigations and comparisons suggest that PD4L is a promising TDI scheme, particularly for the higher frequency band.</description>

      <title>$\tt GrayHawk$: A public code for calculating the Gray Body Factors of massless fields around spherically symmetric Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04041v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce and describe $\tt GrayHawk$, a publicly available Mathematica-based tool designed for the efficient computation of gray-body factors for spherically symmetric and asymptotically flat black holes. This program provides users with a rapid and reliable means to compute gray-body factors for massless fields with spin \(s = 0, 1/2, 1, 2\) in modes specified by the angular quantum number \(l\), given a black hole metric and the associated parameter values. $\tt GrayHawk$ is preloaded with seven different black hole metrics, offering immediate applicability to a variety of theoretical models. Additionally, its modular structure allows users to extend its functionality easily by incorporating alternative metrics or configurations. This versatility makes $\tt GrayHawk$ a powerful and adaptable resource for researchers studying black hole physics and Hawking radiation. The codes described in this work are publicly available at https://github.com/marcocalza89/GrayHawk.</description>

      <title>Geodesic Trajectories and Photon Sphere Analysis of Magnetically Charged Black Holes in Nonlinear Electrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the gravitational lensing properties of magnetically charged black holes within the framework of nonlinear electrodynamics. We derive the deflection angle and examine the influence of the nonlinear electrodynamics parameter $\xi$ on light bending. Initially, we employ a geometric approach based on the Gauss-Bonnet theorem to analyze the gravitational deflection of both null and timelike particles. This method encapsulates the global characteristics of the lensing effect in an elegant manner. In the subsequent part of the work, we explore the impact of nonlinear electromagnetic corrections on the black hole shadow. Using numerical techniques, we study the behavior of the photon sphere and demonstrate that a reduction in the photon sphere radius leads to a correspondingly smaller shadow. We compare these results with those for the Schwarzschild and Reissner-Nordstr\"om black holes, highlighting the distinctive features introduced by nonlinear electrodynamics. Furthermore, we examine the strong deflection limit for light trajectories near these black holes, focusing on the roles of both the magnetic charge $Q$ and the nonlinear parameter $\xi$. Our analysis reveals that the combined effects of $Q$ and $\xi$ enhance the strong deflection angle, resulting in a more pronounced lensing effect than that predicted by the classical Reissner--Nordstr\"om solution. These findings suggest that the nonlinear interactions may provide a potential observational signature for identifying NED black holes.</description>

      <title>Fundamental Oscillations of Massive Boson Stars and Distinguishability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Massive Boson Stars are self-gravitating configurations of self-interacting scalar fields. The equation of state of massive boson stars and their masses, radii, modeled by a self-interacting scalar field with potential of the form $V(\phi) = \frac{1}{2}m^2|\phi|^2 + \frac{1}{4}\lambda |\phi|^4$ are known to follow scaling relations. The non-radial fundamental oscillations of such massive BSs have been studied only for a few select model parameters so far. In this work, we demonstrate for the first time that the $f$-mode characteristics also follow a scaling in the strong interaction limit ($\lambda \gg m^2/M_{Pl}^2$). This opens up the outstanding prospect of studying the $f$-modes of massive BSs throughout the scalar DM parameter space. We study the implications of this finding by carrying out a detailed study of massive BS $f$-modes in a separate work. Here, having introduced this scaling, we use it to compare boson star oscillations with the neutron star and black hole quasinormal modes, thus providing a smoking gun for the distinguishability of BSs using gravitational waves.</description>

      <title>Fundamental Oscillations of Massive Boson Stars -- II</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.04068v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Boson Stars (BSs) are macroscopic self-gravitating configurations made of complex scalar fields. These exotic compact objects (ECO) would manifest as dark Boson stars and can contribute to a certain fraction of the dark matter (DM) in the universe. In this work, we study the fundamental non-radial oscillations ($f$-modes) of massive BSs and the associated gravitational wave (GW) emission. We consider massive scalar BSs having the potential of the form $V(\phi) = \frac{1}{2}m^2|\phi|^2 + \frac{1}{4}\lambda |\phi|^4$, restricting to the strong-coupling regime ($\lambda \gg m^2/M_{Pl}^2$) where solutions resembling fermionic stars are known to exist. We first review the available parameter space for scalar DM that can form massive BSs and enlist various constraints. We fit and provide simple analytical relations connecting various macroscopic observables for BSs, which can be directly incorporated into future studies of massive BSs throughout the strong coupling regime without requiring any numerical computation. We then solve for the non-radial $l=2$ fundamental quasinormal modes ($f$-modes) for massive BSs. Scaling relations for $f$-mode equations have been reported in another work. Using these, we perform a complete study of these oscillations spanning the entire available parameter space of massive BSs and provide analytical fits for the $f$-mode characteristics. We further study the universal relations for BSs and reveal the parameter space that is sensitive to the current and future planned GW detectors. We find that different parts of the parameters space can, in principle, be probed by the LISA, LIGO, and NEMO detectors. Finally, we briefly discuss the detectability of $f$-modes from BSs that have not been explored before.</description>

      <title>Causality in the maximally extended extreme Reissner--Nordstr\"{o}m spacetime with identifications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In continuation of the similarly titled paper on the $e^2 &lt; m^2$ Reissner -- Nordstr\"{o}m (RN) metric (arXiv 2409.03786), in this paper it was verified whether it is possible to send (by means of timelike and null geodesics) messages to one's own past in the maximally extended {\it extreme} ($e^2 = m^2$) RN spacetime with the asymptotically flat regions being identified. Numerical examples show that timelike and nonradial null geodesics originating outside the horizon have their turning points to the future of the past light cone of the future copy of the emitter. This means that they cannot reach the causal past of the emitter's future copy. Ingoing radial null geodesics hit the singularity at $r = 0$ and stop there. So, unlike in the $e^2 &lt; m^2$ case, identification of the asymptotically flat regions does not lead to causality breaches. A formal mathematical proof of this thesis (as opposed to the numerical examples given in this paper) is still lacking and desired.</description>

      <title>Black Hole Evaporation in Loop Quantum Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04252v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The conference \emph{Black Holes Inside and Out} marked the 50th anniversary of Hawking's seminal paper on black hole radiance. It was clear already from Hawking's analysis that a proper quantum gravity theory would be essential for a more complete understanding of the evaporation process. This task was undertaken in Loop Quantum Gravity (LQG) two decades ago and by now the literature on the subject is quite rich. The goal of this contribution is to summarize a mainstream perspective that has emerged. The intended audience is the broader gravitational physics community, rather than quantum gravity experts. Therefore, the emphasis is on conceptual issues, especially on the key features that distinguish the LQG approach, and on concrete results that underlie the paradigm that has emerged. This is \emph{not} meant to be an exhaustive review. Rather, it is a broad-brush stroke portrait of the present status. Further details can be found in the references listed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.03481v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider soft graviton scattering for a theory where Einstein's gravity is minimally coupled to a scalar field in the presence of a cosmological constant, i.e. in a background de Sitter space. Employing a perturbative expansion assuming a small cosmological constant, we compute the leading and subleading corrections to Weinberg's soft graviton amplitude in the static patch of de Sitter space. We observe similar universal features of the soft graviton amplitude as found in \cite{Sayali_Diksha} for the soft photons.</description>

      <title>Soft gravitons as Goldstone modes of spontaneously broken asymptotic symmetries in de Sitter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03520v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: I demonstrate that soft graviton modes in de Sitter are the Goldstone modes of the spontaneously broken asymptotic symmetry group of de Sitter. I then show that any local measurement, including the effects of the environment, will collapse the symmetric state onto the broken state in the large volume limit. In any discussion involving observers, de Sitter is, therefore, best described globally by the broken phase, while local observers, in the small volume limit, can not discriminate between different degenerate global vacuum states, and are therefore best described by the symmetric state. This illuminates the physical nature of soft graviton modes in de Sitter.</description>

      <title>From noncommutative Yang-Mills to noncommutative gravity through a classical double copy map</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03521v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compute the first nontrivial noncommutative correction to the Einstein-Hilbert Lagrangian, which arises from the double copy of noncommutative Yang-Mills theory (ncYM). We start by considering linear and quadratic $\theta$-corrections up to cubic order in fields in ncYM theory and in arbitrary $D$ dimensions. We compute the first nontrivial corrections to the three-points vertex operators and use them to construct a double copy theory of the form ncYM $\times$ ncYM. The resulting theory is given by a double geometrical formalism which includes noncommutative corrections to the perturbative cubic double field theory (DFT) formulation, where the star product of the theory is doubled in agreement with the doubling of the physical coordinates of the theory. Upon solving the level matching condition the noncommutative products are identified and they produced $\theta^2$-corrections to the cubic DFT action. We analyze the pure gravitational limit of this formulation considering $D=4$ and imposing the transverse-traceless gauge.</description>

      <title>Population Synthesis of Gravitational Wave Sources</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.03523v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The simulation of gravitational wave source populations and their progenitors is an endeavor more than eighty years in the making. This is in part due to a wide variety of theoretical uncertainties that must be taken into account when describing how stellar populations evolve over cosmic time to produce double stellar remnant binaries. Population synthesis software has been developed as a means to investigate these uncertainties under a wide variety of physical assumptions and stellar population formation environments. In this chapter we discuss the development history of population synthesis software with a special focus on work aimed at understanding the formation of gravitational wave populations. We detail the assortment of population synthesis tools in use today that simulate GW populations which are born and evolve in different astrophysical environments. We further discuss the GW population rates and features associated with each environment that have been predicted for both ground and space-based GW detectors. We finish with considerations of future work that combines possible constraints from electromagnetic surveys that may provide key findings that break current degeneracies in population synthesis predictions of GW source populations.</description>

      <title>Traversable AdS Wormhole via Non-local Double Trace or Janus Deformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03531v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study (i) Janus deformations and (ii) non-local double trace deformations of a pair of CFTs, as two different ways to construct CFT duals of traversable AdS wormholes. First we construct a simple model of traversable wormholes by gluing two Poincar\'e AdS geometries and BTZ black holes and compute holographic two point functions and (pseudo) entanglement entropy. We point out that a Janus gravity solution describe a traversable wormhole when the deformation parameter takes imaginary values. On the other hand, we show that double trace deformations between two decoupled CFTs can reproduce two point functions of traversable AdS wormholes. By considering the case where the double trace deformation is given by a non-local $T\overline{T}$ deformation, we analyze the dual gravity which implies emergence of wormholes. We present toy model of these deformed CFTs by using free scalars and obtain qualitative behavior expected for them. We argue that the crucial difference between the two constructions is that a global time slice of wormhole is described by a pure state for Janus deformations, while it is a mixed state for the double trace deformations.</description>

      <title>The Proper Motion of Strongly Lensed Binary Neutron Star Mergers in LIGO/Virgo/Kagra can be Constrained by Measuring Doppler Induced Gravitational Wave Dephasing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03547v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Strongly lensed binary neutron star (NS-NS) mergers are expected to be observed once LIGO/Virgo/Kagra reaches the planned A+ or proposed A\# sensitivity. We demonstrate that the relative transverse velocity of the source-lens system can be constrained by comparing the phase of the two associated gravitational wave (GW) images, using both semi-analytical and numerical Bayesian methods. For A+ sensitivity, a one-sigma NS-NS merger signal in magnification $(\mu=200)$ and redshift $(z_{\rm S}=1)$ will carry a marginally detectable dephasing signature for a source transverse velocity of $\sim 1800$ km/s. This is comparable to the velocity dispersion of large galaxy clusters. Assuming the same population distribution, the most likely source parameters of $\mu=100$ and $z_{\rm S}=1.4$ are always expected to showcase detectable dephasing imprints for A\# sensitivity, provided they are moving with transverse velocities larger than $\sim 2000$ km/s. We conclude that a first measurement of the relative transverse velocity of a source via GW dephasing methods is likely only a few years away.</description>

      <title>Complementary signatures of $\alpha-$attractor inflation in CMB and cosmic string Gravitational Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03557v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When cosmic strings are formed during inflation, they regrow to reach a scaling regime, leaving distinct imprints on the stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB). Such signatures, associated with specific primordial features, can be detected by upcoming gravitational wave observatories, such as the LISA and Einstein Telescope (ET). Our analysis explores scenarios in which cosmic strings form either before or during inflation. We examine how the number of e-folds experienced by cosmic strings during inflation correlates with the predictions of inflationary models observable in cosmic microwave background (CMB) measurements. This correlation provides a testable link between inflationary physics and the associated gravitational wave signals in a complementary manner. Focusing on $\alpha$-attractor models of inflation, with the Polynomial $\alpha$-attractor serving as an illustrative example, we find constraints, for instance, on the spectral index $n_s$ to $0.962 \lesssim n_s \lesssim 0.972$ for polynomial exponent $n=1$, $0.956 \lesssim n_s \lesssim 0.968$ for $n=2$, $0.954 \lesssim n_s \lesssim 0.965$ for $n=3$, and $0.963 \lesssim n_s \lesssim 0.964$ for $n=4$, which along with the GW signals from LISA, are capable of detecting local cosmic strings that have experienced $\sim 34 - 47$ e-folds of inflation consistent with current Planck data and are also testable in upcoming CMB experiments such as LiteBIRD and CMB-S4.</description>

      <title>Observable Primordial Gravitational Waves from Non-minimally Coupled $R^2$ Palatini Modified Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03573v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We probe the spectrum of primordial gravitational waves (GWs) produced during the eras of hyperkination, kination, and reheating in a non-minimally coupled, $\mathcal{L} \propto (1+ \xi \chi /M_{\text{Pl}})^t (R+\alpha R^2)$, modified gravity using the Palatini formulation. We consider a runaway potential, which gives an era of kinetic domination after the end of inflation. The coupling order $t$ is varied to examine a large class of theories up to $\chi^2 R^2$. For models with $t&gt;0$, reheating is not achieved naturally; hence, we supplement such theories with a reheating mechanism based on the interaction of inflaton and radiation produced at the end of inflation due to cosmological expansion. We demonstrate that the energy density of the GWs is enhanced as a function of the coupling during kination for all considered theories, and a short-lived phase of hyperkination truncates the boost and avoids the over-production of GWs. Hyperkination, and thus the $R^2$ term, should be deemed necessary in all theories with a runaway potential as it prevents the GW enhancement during kination from destabilizing the Big Bang Nucleosynthesis. The spectrum remains flat for the period of hyperkination and reheating. We examine the available parameter space for which the theories remain valid and place bounds on the Hubble parameter ($H$) and radiation energy density ($\Omega_r^{\text{end}}$) at the end of inflation. We find that as we decrease the order of the coupling, the spectra shift towards a more observable regime of future GW experiments. The observation of the plateau during reheating will constrain the $H$ and $\Omega_r^{\text{end}}$ values, while the spectral shape of the boost obtained during kination will confirm the nature of the theory. The bounds from hyperkination lie in the kHz-GHz frequency range whose detection can be positively anticipated via resonant cavities.</description>

Abstract: Astrophysical observations of the cosmos allow us to probe extreme physics and answer foundational questions on our universe. Modern astronomy is increasingly operating under a holistic approach, probing the same question with multiple diagnostics including how sources vary over time, how they appear across the electromagnetic spectrum, and through their other signatures, including gravitational waves, neutrinos, cosmic rays, and dust on Earth. Astrophysical observations are now reaching the point where approximate physics models are insufficient. Key sources of interest are explosive transients, whose understanding requires multidisciplinary studies at the intersection of astrophysics, gravity, nuclear science, plasma physics, fluid dynamics and turbulence, computation, particle physics, atomic, molecular, and optical science, condensed matter and materials science, radiation transport, and high energy density physics. This white paper provides an overview of the major scientific advances that lay at the intersection of physics and astronomy and are best probed through time-domain and multimessenger astrophysics, an exploration of how multidisciplinary science can be fostered, and introductory descriptions of the relevant scientific disciplines and key astrophysical sources of interest.</description>

      <title>Holographic confining theories on space-times with constant positive curvature</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.04036v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Varying the curvature, quantum phase transitions are investigated in holographic confining QFTs defined on a fixed constant positive curvature background. We find a competition between two branches of solutions and a phase transition as one varies the space-time curvature. The low-curvature phase has the same kind of IR geometry as the flat-space solution, while the high-curvature phase has a regular interior. We argue that, depending on the leading asymptotic exponent of the scalar potential, the transition may be first-order or higher-order.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.04061v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the light ray transform acting on tensors on a stationary Lorentzian manifold. Our main result is injectivity up to the natural obstruction as long as the associated magnetic vector field satisfies a finite degree property with respect to the vertical Fourier decomposition on the unit tangent bundle. This is based on an explicit relationship between the geodesic vector field of the Lorentzian manifold and the magnetic vector field.</description>

      <title>Probing Spin-Orbit Resonances with the Binary Black Hole Population</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04278v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Measurements of the binary black hole spin distribution from the growing catalog of gravitational-wave observations can help elucidate the astrophysical processes shaping the formation and evolution of these systems. Spin-orbit resonances are one process of interest, in which the component spin vectors and the orbital angular momentum align into a common plane and jointly precess about the total angular momentum of the system. These resonances, which occur preferentially in systems formed via isolated binary evolution with strong tidal effects, lead to excesses in the distribution of the azimuthal angle between the projections of the component spin vectors onto the orbital plane at $\phi_{12}=0,\pm\pi$. Previous analyses have demonstrated that this parameter is particularly difficult to constrain for individual binaries. In this work, we conduct the first hierarchical analysis modeling the population-level distribution of $\phi_{12}$ simultaneously with the other mass and spin parameters for simulated binary black hole populations to determine whether spin-orbit resonances can be reliably constrained. While we are unlikely to find definitive evidence for spin-orbit resonances with a population of the size expected by the end of the ongoing LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA fourth observing run, we correctly recover the various $\phi_{12}$ distributions we simulate within uncertainties. We find that we can place meaningful constraints on the relative excesses at $\phi_{12}=0,\pm\pi$, which encodes information about mass transfer in the formation of the binary. We can also distinguish between fully isotropic spin angle distributions and those with features in the spin azimuth and tilt distributions. Thus, we show that population-level measurements of the $\phi_{12}$ distribution offer a reliable, novel way to probe binary formation channels, dynamics, and mass transfer with gravitational-wave observations.</description>

      <title>Creation of wormholes during the cosmological bounce</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.06142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.06142v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we demonstrate that wormholes can in principle be naturally created during the cosmological bounce without the need for the exotic matter or any kind of additional modifications of the gravitational sector, apart from the one enabling the cosmological bounce. This result is general and does not depend on the details of the modifications of gravitational equations needed to support the bounce. To study the possible existence of wormholes around the cosmological bounce we introduce general modifications of Einstein's field equations need to support the bouncing solutions. In this regime we show that it is possible to construct a cosmological wormhole solution supported by matter, radiation and vacuum energy, satisfying the Weak Energy Condition (WEC), which asymptotically approaches the Friedmann-Lema\^{i}tre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) metric. However, at a specific cosmological time, which depends on the parameters of the bouncing cosmological model, the WEC describing the matter needed to support such wormholes is spontaneously violated. This means that such wormholes could potentially exist in large numbers during some period around the bounce, significantly changing the causal structure of space-time, and then vanish afterwards.</description>

      <title>Distinctive GWBs from eccentric inspiraling SMBH binaries with a DM spike</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.14041v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent detections of a low-frequency gravitational wave background (GWB) from various pulsar-timing-array (PTA) observations have renewed the interest in the inspiraling supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs), whose population is believed to be the most promising candidate with possible generalizations from including either orbital eccentricity or dark matter (DM) spike. In this paper, we show that the inclusion of both can further display distinctive features detectable in future PTA observations. With a typical initial eccentricity $e_0\sim\mathcal{O}(0.1)$ for the inspiraling SMBHBs, even a shallow DM spike can easily drive the orbital eccentricity close to $1$, leaving behind a large turnover eccentricity when GWs begin to dominate the orbital circularization. In particular, the DM spike index $\gamma_\mathrm{sp}$ universally manifests itself in the characteristic strain by $h_c\sim f^{7/6-\gamma_\mathrm{sp}/3}$ in the far infrared and features a novel oscillation structure at low frequencies. Future PTA detection of such characteristics would be the smoking gun for the DM spike and even reveal the nature of DM.</description>

      <title>Kramer's Escape Rate and Phase Transition Dynamics in AdS Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17849v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Traditional static methods in phase transition studies, provide good insights into the thermodynamics of black holes. However, they practically lose sight of the dynamic aspects and temporal sequence of events. The Kramer's escape rate, central to our research, offers a somewhat dynamic approach to phase transition. We examine the free energy landscapes for black holes under the influence of 'dark' and 'stringy dark' structures, assessing how additional parameters affect the escape rates and dynamics of the transition during the first-order phase transition from small to large black holes. In our analysis, we consider the escape rate as a function of the black hole radius and study its variations. We will observe that, on one hand, the escape rate well represents our assumption based on the movement from zero, increasing to a maximum point, and then decreasing back to zero as reactive structures become active during the phase transition interval. However, the critical point in this method is the encounter with a specific and distinct point. This is where the diagram of the direct process (escape rate from small to large black holes) intersects with the reverse process (large to small black holes), becoming equally probable (contact point). The point, which seems improbable at the onset of the phase transition or very negligible, gains more significance as the process progresses. This increase indicates the dominance of a region where the escape rate from larger black holes to smaller ones prevails. The predominance of the reverse process, which increases as we approach the end of the process and is necessarily accompanied by a variation in radius, may be considered as a natural reaction of the black hole against the 'phase change' action. A reaction which attempting to prevent any uncontrolled radial growth that could jeopardize the stability of the black hole.</description>

Abstract: The interplay between thermodynamics, general relativity and quantum mechanics has long intrigued researchers. Recently, important advances have been obtained in thermodynamics, mainly regarding its application to the quantum domain through fluctuation theorems. In this letter, we apply Fermi normal coordinates to report a fully general relativistic detailed quantum fluctuation theorem based on the two point measurement scheme. We demonstrate how the spacetime curvature can produce entropy in a localized quantum system moving in a general spacetime. The example of a quantum harmonic oscillator living in an expanding universe is presented. This result implies that entropy production is strongly observer dependent and deeply connects the arrow of time with the causal structure of the spacetime.</description>

Abstract: We review the description of classical gravitational scatterings of two compact objects by means of the eikonal framework. This encodes via scattering amplitudes both the motion of the bodies and the gravitational-wave signals that such systems produce. As an application, we combine the next-to-leading post-Minkowskian (PM) waveform derived in the post-Newtonian (PN) limit with the 4PM static loss due to the linear memory effect to reproduce known results for the total angular mometum loss in the center-of-mass frame up to $\mathcal O(G^4)$ and 2.5PN order. We also provide similar expressions for the change in the system's mass dipole, discussing the subtleties related to its sensitivity to the Coulombic components of the field and to the nonlinear memory effect.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05838v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Primordial black holes (PBHs) may form before cosmological first-order phase transitions, leading to inevitable collisions between PBHs and bubble walls. In this Letter, we have simulated for the first time the co-evolution of an expanding scalar wall passing through a black hole with full numerical relativity. This black hole-bubble wall collision yields multiple far-reaching phenomena including the PBH mass growth, gravitational wave radiations, and momentum recoil that endows PBHs with additional velocities, approximately doubling the formation rate for PBH binaries and hence strengthening the observational constraints on the PBH abundances.</description>

      <title>Forecast Analysis of Astrophysical Stochastic Gravitational Wave Background beyond general relativity: A Case Study on Brans-Dicke Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12328v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Scalar-tensor gravity, exemplified by Brans-Dicke (BD) gravity, introduces additional scalar polarization modes that contribute scalar radiation alongside tensor modes. We conduct a comprehensive analysis of how gravitational wave generation and propagation effects under Brans-Dicke gravity are encoded into the astrophysical stochastic gravitational wave background (AGWB). We perform end-to-end analyses of realistic populations of simulated coalescing binary systems to generate AGWB mock data with third-generation gravitational wave detectors and conducted a complete Bayesian analysis for the first time. We find the uncertainties in the population properties of binary black holes (BBH) significantly affect the ability to constrain BD gravity. Furthermore, we explore the detectability of potential scalar backgrounds that originates from binary neutron star (BNS) and neutron-star-black-hole (NSBH) mergers, with NSBH systems expected to modify the spectral index of the scalar background and introduce oscillatory behavior. We show that the observations of the AGWB enable the separation of mixed tensor and scalar polarization modes with comparable sensitivity to each mode. However, the scalar background is expected to remain substantially weaker than the tensor background, even in scenarios where BD gravity exhibits significant deviations from general relativity (GR), resulting only upper limits can be placed on the scalar background. We conclude that for ambiguous populations, employing waveform matching with individual sources provides a more robust approach to constrain BD gravity.</description>

      <title>End equilibrium state of a spherical gravitational collapse in the presence of matter and scalar field</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01110v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the possibilities of modeling a spherically symmetric static spacetime that can emerge as the end state of gravitational collapse, by considering it to be seeded by a composite fluid made of matter and a scalar field. In this scenario, the matter represents dark matter, while the scalar field represents dark energy. On certain scales, dark energy is believed to significantly influence the structure formation of dark matter. Various models describe the possible impacts of dark energy on structure formation under different scenarios. By investigating an inhomogeneous scalar field representing dark energy, coupled with dark matter, we demonstrate that this two-component fluid can seed spacetimes forming the final equilibrium state. We derive solutions for the scalar field and potential for Joshi-Malafarina-Narayan (JMN) spacetimes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.13993v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the transition rate of a static Unruh-DeWitt detector in two $(2+1)$-dimensional black hole spacetimes that are isometric to the static Ba\~nados-Teitelboim-Zanelli black hole outside the horizon but have no asymptotically locally anti-de Sitter exterior behind the horizon. The spacetimes are the $\mathbb{R}\text{P}^{2}$ geon, with spatial topology $\mathbb{R}\text{P}^{2}\setminus\{\text{point at infinity}\}$, and the Swedish geon of \AA{}minneborg \emph{et al\/}, with spatial topology $T^{2}\setminus\{\text{point at infinity}\}$. For a conformal scalar field, prepared in the Hartle-Hawking-type state that is induced from the global vacuum on the anti-de Sitter covering space, we show numerically that the detector's transition rate distinguishes the two spacetimes, particularly at late exterior times, and we trace this phenomenon to the differences in the isometries that are broken by the quotient construction from the universal covering space. Our results provide an example in which information about the interior topology of a black hole is accessible to a quantum observer outside the black hole.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.06628v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study four classical tests of Schwarzschild space-time with Lorentzian distribution in non-commutative geometry. We performed detailed calculations of the first-order corrections induced by the non-commutative parameter on planetary orbital precession, light deflection, radar wave delay, and gravitational redshift. The study showed that the impact of the non-commutative parameter on the time-like geodesics is significantly greater than its effect on the null geodesics. By using a series of precise experimental observations, the allowable range for the non-commutative parameter is ultimately constrained within $\Theta \leq 0.067579\ \mathrm{m}^{2}$, which is given by Mercury's orbital precession. This result aligns with the view that $\sqrt{\Theta}$ is of the order of the Planck length. Moreover, this constrained parameter range exceeds the Planck scale by a significant margin.</description>

      <title>The stability of the greybody factor of Hayward black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07734v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the stability of the greybody factor of Hayward black holes by adding a small bump to the effective potential. Since the greybody factor depends on frequency, we introduce the $\mathcal{G}$-factor and $\mathcal{H}$-factor to quantitatively characterize its stability. We study the stability of the greybody factor within the equal amplitude method and the equal energy method, respectively. Here, the equal amplitude method can be directly imposed by fixing the amplitude of the bump, while the equal energy method requires a physical definition of the energy of the bump with the assistance of hyperboloidal framework. For both methods, when the location of the bump is close to the event horizon of the black hole, and the closer it is to the peak of the original potential, the larger are $\mathcal{G}$-factor and $\mathcal{H}$-factor, and they are bounded by the magnitude of the amplitude or the energy. More importantly, for the equal amplitude method, two factors tend to a specific value as the location of the bump increases. In contrast, for the equal energy method, two factors converge to zero as the location of the bump increases. Notably, the $\mathcal{G}$-factor and the $\mathcal{H}$-factor are insensitive to the regular parameter of Hayward black hole. Therefore, our results indicate that the greybody factor is stable under specific perturbations.</description>

      <title>Shadows and accretion disk images of charged rotating black hole in modified gravity theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10315v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the shadow and images of the accretion disk of Kerr-Newman (KN) black hole (BH) in modified gravity (MOG) theory by using backward ray-tracing method. And, the influence of spin parameter ($a$), charge ($Q$), and MOG parameter ($\alpha$) on the observed features of BHs are carefully addressed. Interestingly, as $\alpha$ increases, the flat edge of the BH's shadow gradually becomes more rounded, the size of shadow enlarges, and the deviation rate ($\delta s$) correspondingly decreases. By tracing the photon around BH, we observe that the trajectory of photon exhibits distortion behavior, i.e., the formation of two "tails" near the Einstein ring, which elongate as $a$ increases. For the accretion disk, it shows that the inner shadow expands with $\alpha$, while decreases with $Q$. The increase of $\alpha$ exhibits an increasing effect on redshift. At the same parameter level, $\alpha$ has a more obvious effect on inner shadow and image of BH by comparing with that of $Q$. Our study implies that both $\alpha$ and $Q$ have relatively significant effects on the image of the KN-MOG BH with the thin disk accretion, but the influence of $\alpha$ is much greater. So, this indicates that $\alpha$ plays a dominant role in this spacetime.</description>

      <title>Vacuum polarization effects in the background of a deformed compact object and implications for photon velocity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15399v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies the impact of vacuum polarization on light propagation in the background of a distorted, deformed compact object. Focusing on a spacetime containing two quadrupole parameters associated with the central object and external fields, we explore how these parameters influence observable effects as dynamical degrees of freedom. In this setup, we investigate electromagnetic birefringence, noting distinct polarization-dependent photon velocity variations and gravitational lens effects. Although current resolution may limit detection, future high-precision observations could reveal these quantum electrodynamics (QED) induced birefringence effects, advancing our understanding of vacuum birefringence in astrophysical contexts. We further analyze the dependence of shadow properties on the model's variables, using observational data from Sgr A*.</description>

      <title>Vacuum Magnetospheres around Kerr Black Holes with a Thin Disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00474v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct a model for stationary and axisymmetric black hole magnetospheres by solving the vacuum Maxwell equations in Kerr backgrounds. The poloidal magnetic field is generated by a toroidal electric current in a thin disk on the equatorial plane with an inner edge, and the poloidal electric field is induced due to the black hole spin. We assume a current distribution whose direction reverses at a radius on the disk. The magnetospheric structure is divided into the inner region and the outer one due to the current reversal. In the inner region, some magnetic field lines connect the black hole and the disk, and others surround the inner edge of the disk. In the outer region, the field lines connect the disk and infinity. We investigate the black hole spin dependence of the magnetospheric structure. In the magnetosphere around the Kerr black hole, the electric fields are generated by the black hole spin. In our model, the charge distribution is induced on the disk and the event horizon. Except near the black hole, the electric field strength is proportional to the black hole spin, while the direction of the electric field remains almost the same regardless of the spin. On the other hand, the electromagnetic field near the event horizon strongly depends on the spin. In the maximally rotating case, the magnetic field lines are expelled from the event horizon and the electric equipotential surface coincides with the horizon.</description>

      <title>Bifurcations in Bosonic Stars: chains and rings from spherical solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05342v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the bifurcation phenomena between spherical and axisymmetric bosonic stars. By numerically solving for the zero-modes of spherical bosonic stars under specific axially symmetric perturbations, we discover that excited state spherical bosonic stars bifurcate into two types of axisymmetric bosonic stars under $\ell=2$ perturbations, with matter distributions resembling chains and rings, respectively. Meanwhile, $\ell=4$ axisymmetric perturbations lead spherical scalar bosonic stars to bifurcate into a new type of axisymmetric bosonic stars, exhibiting a mixed chain-like and ring-like matter distribution, which we refer to as gyroscope-like. Additionally, for the first time, we have constructed chains of scalar bosonic stars with 7 constituents and their corresponding ring-like scalar bosonic stars. Our results provide an explanation for the bifurcations in bosonic stars from the perspective of perturbations, and by analyzing physical quantities such as quadrupoles and energy densities we systematically discuss the impact of axisymmetric perturbations on spherical bosonic stars.</description>

Abstract: The classical world structures borne by spacetimes endowed with torsionful affinities are reviewed. Subsequently, the definition and symmetry properties of a typical pair of Witten curvature spinors for such spacetimes are exhibited along with a comprehensive two-component spinor transcription of Einstein-Cartan's theory. A full description of the correspondence principle that interrelates Einstein-Cartan's theory and general relativity is likewise presented.</description>

      <title>Statistical biases in parameterized searches for gravitational-wave polarizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16788v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In tests of gravity using gravitational waves (GWs), GW events analyzed are often selected based on specific criteria, particularly the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). However, such event selection can introduce bias into parameter estimation unless the selection effect is appropriately taken into account in the analysis. In this paper, we investigate how event selection with certain prior information affects parameter inference within the scalar-tensor polarization framework, focusing on the measurement of the scalar mode amplitude parameters. We find that for the Tensor+Scalar(dipole) model, the amplitude of the scalar dipole radiation is overestimated when its true value is nonzero while there is no false deviation in the absence of the scalar mode. The same bias is expected to occur also for the Tensor+Scalar(quadrupole) model. However, error typically exceeds the bias as the scalar quadrupole mode is difficult to be distinguished from the tensor mode.</description>

      <title>Revisiting primordial black holes formation from preheating instabilities: the case of Starobinsky inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.02754v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years, the formation of primordial black holes (PBH) in the early universe inflationary cosmology has garnered significant attention. One plausible scenario for primordial black hole (PBH) formation arises during the preheating stage following inflation. Notably, this scenario does not necessitate any ad-hoc fine-tuning of the scalar field potential. This paper focuses on the growth of primordial density perturbation and the consequent possibility of PBH formation in the preheating stage of the Starobinsky model for inflation. The typical mechanism for PBH formation during preheating is based on the collapse of primordial fluctuations that become super-horizon during inflation (type I) and re-enter the particle horizon in the different phases of cosmic expansion. In this work, we show that there exists a certain range of modes that remain in the sub-horizon (not exited) during inflation (type II modes) but evolve identically to type I modes if they fall into the instability band, leading to large density perturbation above the threshold and can potentially also contribute to the PBH formation. We detail the conditions determining the possible collapse of type I and/or type II modes whose wavelengths are larger than the Jeans length we derive from the effective sound speed of scalar field fluctuations. Since the preheating stage is an 'inflaton' (approximately) matter-dominated phase, we follow the framework of the critical collapse of fluctuations and compute the mass fraction using the well-known Press-Schechter and the Khlopov-Polnarev formalisms, and compare the two. Finally, we comment on the implications of our study for the investigations concerned with primordial accretion and consequent PBH contribution to the dark matter.</description>

      <title>Parity-breaking galaxy 4-point function from lensing by chiral gravitational waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03994v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent searches for parity breaking in the galaxy four-point correlation function, as well as the prospects for greatly improved sensitivity to parity breaking in forthcoming surveys, motivate the search for physical mechanisms that could produce such a signal. Here we show that a parity-violating galaxy four-point correlation function may be induced by lensing by a chiral gravitational-wave background. We estimate the amplitude of a signal that would be detectable with a current galaxy survey, taking into account constraints to the primordial gravitational-wave-background amplitude. We find that this mechanism is unlikely to produce a signal large enough to be seen with a galaxy survey but note that it may come within reach with future 21cm observations.</description>

      <title>The hierarchical three-body problem at $\mathcal{O} (G^2)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08850v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Employing techniques from scattering amplitudes and effective field theory, we model the dynamics of hierarchical triples, which are three-body systems composed of two bodies separated by a distance $r$ and a third body a distance $\rho$ away, with $r \ll \rho$. We apply the method of regions to systematically expand in the small ratio $r/\rho$ and illustrate this approach for evaluating Fourier transform integrals, which have been the bottleneck for deriving complete results in position space. In the limit where the distant third body is much heavier than the other two, we derive new analytic results in position space for the three-body conservative potential at $\mathcal{O}(G^2)$ and at leading and next-to-leading order in $r/\rho$. We also derive new results for arbitrary masses in the rest frame of the distant particle. Our results are exact in velocity, and can be used in analyses involving both bound and unbound hierarchical triples in astrophysical systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11501v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we construct Yang-Mills theory in the $\kappa$-space-time. We derive Yang-Mills equations in the $\kappa$-deformed space-time, valid up to first order in the deformation parameter $a$, using the generalisation of Feynman's approach. We first derive the $\kappa$-deformed Wong's equation and using it, in the Jacobi identity involving velocities and coordinates of $\kappa$-deformed space-time, we derive the $\kappa$-deformed homogeneous Yang-Mills equations. We then construct the Lagrangian for Yang-Mills theory in $\kappa$-deformed space-time and show that it is invariant under SU(N) transformation. We also derive the expression for the force experienced by an isospin-carrying particle in the presence of Yang-Mills field in the $\kappa$-space-time.</description>

      <title>De Sitter space constraints on brane tensions and couplings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14529v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We argue for the existence of bounds on the tensions of $p$-branes in de Sitter space in terms of the Hubble rate and the strength of a class of Chern-Simons-like couplings. The world-volume couplings involve Abelian 1-form gauge fields in the bulk and possibly field strengths intrinsic to the brane. In many cases these couplings are the D-brane Chern-Simons terms present in string theory, while in other cases they are the interactions of axion domain walls with $U(1)$ fields. Our arguments use the same logic and assumptions as the recent Festina Lente proposal (thus utilizing the properties of Nariai de Sitter black holes) and generalize it to extended objects, thereby providing a bottom-up set of constraints independent of any particular UV completion. We compare these bounds to the properties of (wrapped) D-branes in Type II string theory in the weak coupling limit, under the assumption that these properties are not modified significantly in de Sitter constructions. We find that all constraints are satisfied by D-branes, providing further evidence for the Festina Lente conjecture. For the particular case of 2-branes with Chern-Simons interactions we obtain a bound, which however can be evaded if the theory contains a light axion. Similarly, we find the bounds do not apply to axion domain walls due to the presence of the axion.</description>

      <title>Quantum Cross-section of Near-extremal Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17470v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore how to detect the large quantum fluctuations in the throat of a near-extremal black hole, where the dynamics are governed by the Schwarzian theory. To this end, we scatter a low-frequency wave of a massless, minimal scalar off the black hole and calculate the absorption cross-section. In the semiclassical regime, where the Schwarzian is weakly coupled, we recover the universal result that the cross-section equals the horizon area. However, in the strongly coupled regime, where quantum fluctuations dominate, we find that the absorption cross-section exceeds the semiclassical prediction. This result may seem counterintuitive, given that the density of black hole states is suppressed in this regime. Nevertheless, two effects outweigh this suppression. First, quantum fluctuations enhance absorption transitions between individual states, with the effect becoming stronger closer to the ground state. Second, these fluctuations significantly reduce stimulated emission. We conclude that a measurement showing an enhanced absorption cross-section serves as a clear signature of the large quantum fluctuations in the geometry.</description>
