      <title>Big Wins, Small Net Gains: Direct and Spillover Effects of First Industry Entries in Puerto Rico</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19469v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I study how first sizable industry entries reshape local and neighboring labor markets in Puerto Rico. Using over a decade of quarterly municipality--industry data (2014Q1--2025Q1), I identify ``first sizable entries'' as large, persistent jumps in establishments, covered employment, and wage bill, and treat these as shocks to local industry presence at the municipio--industry level. Methodologically, I combine staggered-adoption difference-in-differences estimators that are robust to heterogeneous treatment timing with an imputation-based event-study approach, and I use a doubly robust difference-in-differences framework that explicitly allows for interference through pre-specified exposure mappings on a contiguity graph. The estimates show large and persistent direct gains in covered employment and wage bill in the treated municipality--industry cells over 0--16 quarters. Same-industry neighbors experience sizable short-run gains that reverse over the medium run, while within-municipality cross-industry and neighbor all-industries spillovers are small and imprecisely estimated. Once these spillovers are taken into account and spatially robust inference and sensitivity checks are applied, the net regional 0--16 quarter effect on covered employment is positive but modest in magnitude and estimated with considerable uncertainty. The results imply that first sizable entries generate substantial local gains where they occur, but much smaller and less precisely measured net employment gains for the broader regional economy, highlighting the importance of accounting for spatial spillovers when evaluating place-based policies.</description>

      <title>Cash Transfers in the Perinatal Period and Child Welfare System Involvement Among Infants: Evidence from the Rx Kids Program in Flint, Michigan</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Infants are most vulnerable to child maltreatment, which may be due in part to economic instability during the perinatal period. In 2024, Rx Kids was launched in Flint, Michigan, achieving near 100% aggregate take up and providing every expectant mother with unconditional cash transfers during pregnancy and infancy. Synthetic difference-in-differences was used to compare changes in allegations of maltreatment within the first six months of life in Flint before and after implementation of Rx Kids relative to the corresponding change in control cities without the program. In the three years prior to the implementation of Rx Kids, the proportion of infants with a maltreatment allegation within the first six months of life was 21.7% in Flint and 19.5% among control cities. After implementation of Rx Kids in 2024, the maltreatment allegation rate dropped to 15.5% in Flint, falling below the maltreatment allegation rate of 20.6% among the control cities. Rx Kids was associated with a statistically significant 7.0 percentage-point decrease in the maltreatment allegation rate (p = 0.021), corresponding to a 32% decrease relative to the pre-intervention period. There was a decrease in the rate of neglect-related, non-neglect-related, and substantiated allegations; these were directionally consistent with the primary outcome but not statistically significant. Results were robust to alternative model specifications. The Rx Kids prenatal and infant cash prescription program led to a significant reduction in allegations of maltreatment among infants. These findings provide important evidence about the role of economic stability in preventing child welfare system involvement.</description>

      <title>Total Factor Productivity and its determinants: an analysis of the relationship at firm level through unsupervised learning techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19627v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper is related to the identification of firm's features which serve as determinants for firm's total factor productivity through unsupervised learning techniques (principal component analysis, self organizing maps, clustering). This bottom-up approach can effectively manage the problem of the heterogeneity of the firms and provides new ways to look at firms' standard classifications. Using the large sample provided by the ORBIS database, the analyses covers the years before the outbreak of Covid-19 (2015-2019) and the immediate post-Covid period (year 2020). It has been shown that in both periods, the main determinants of productivity growth are related to profitability, credit/debts measures, cost and capital efficiency, and effort and outcome of the R&amp;D activity conducted by the firms. Finally, a linear relationship between determinants and productivity growth has been found.</description>

      <title>Spiral of Silence: How Neutral Moderation Polarizes Content Creation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19680v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates how content moderation affects content creation in an ideologically diverse online environments. We develop a model in which users act as both creators and consumers, differing in their ideological affiliation and propensity to produce toxic content. Affective polarization, i.e., users' aversion to ideologically opposed content, interacts with moderation in unintended ways. We show that even ideologically neutral moderation that targets only toxicity can suppress non-toxic content creation, particularly from ideological minorities. Our analysis reveals a content-level externality: when toxic content is removed, non-toxic posts gain exposure. While creators from the ideological majority group sometimes benefit from this exposure, they do not internalize the negative spillovers, i.e., increased out-group animosity toward minority creators. This can discourage minority creation and polarize the content supply, ultimately leaving minority users in a more ideologically imbalanced environment: a mechanism reminiscent of the "spiral of silence." Thus, our model offers an alternative perspective to a common debate: what appears as bias in moderation needs not reflect bias in rules, but can instead emerge endogenously as self-censorship in equilibrium. We also extend the model to explore how content personalization interacts with moderation policies.</description>

      <title>Solving Heterogeneous Agent Models with Physics-informed Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding household behaviour is essential for modelling macroeconomic dynamics and designing effective policy. While heterogeneous agent models offer a more realistic alternative to representative agent frameworks, their implementation poses significant computational challenges, particularly in continuous time. The Aiyagari-Bewley-Huggett (ABH) framework, recast as a system of partial differential equations, typically relies on grid-based solvers that suffer from the curse of dimensionality, high computational cost, and numerical inaccuracies. This paper introduces the ABH-PINN solver, an approach based on Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs), which embeds the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman and Kolmogorov Forward equations directly into the neural network training objective. By replacing grid-based approximation with mesh-free, differentiable function learning, the ABH-PINN solver benefits from the advantages of PINNs of improved scalability, smoother solutions, and computational efficiency. Preliminary results show that the PINN-based approach is able to obtain economically valid results matching the established finite-difference solvers.</description>

      <title>When Should Neural Data Inform Welfare? A Critical Framework for Policy Uses of Neuroeconomics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19548v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neuroeconomics promises to ground welfare analysis in neural and computational evidence about how people value outcomes, learn from experience and exercise self-control. At the same time, policy and commercial actors increasingly invoke neural data to justify paternalistic regulation, "brain-based" interventions and new welfare measures. This paper asks under what conditions neural data can legitimately inform welfare judgements for policy rather than merely describing behaviour. I develop a non-empirical, model-based framework that links three levels: neural signals, computational decision models and normative welfare criteria. Within an actor-critic reinforcement-learning model, I formalise the inference path from neural activity to latent values and prediction errors and then to welfare claims. I show that neural evidence constrains welfare judgements only when the neural-computational mapping is well validated, the decision model identifies "true" interests versus context-dependent mistakes, and the welfare criterion is explicitly specified and defended. Applying the framework to addiction, neuromarketing and environmental policy, I derive a Neuroeconomic Welfare Inference Checklist for regulators and for designers of NeuroAI systems. The analysis treats brains and artificial agents as value-learning systems while showing that internal reward signals, whether biological or artificial, are computational quantities and cannot be treated as welfare measures without an explicit normative model.</description>

      <title>Keeping in Place After the Storm-Emergency Assistance and Evictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14548v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We offer evidence that federal emergency assistance (FEMA) in the days following natural disasters mitigate evictions in comparison to similar emergency scenarios where FEMA aid is not provided. We find an approximate 10.9% increase in overall evictions after hurricane natural disaster events driven in large part by areas in close proximity of the hurricane path that do not receive FEMA rental assistance. Furthermore, we also show that FEMA aid acts as a liquidity buffer to other forms of emergency credit, specifically we find that both transactions volumes and defaults decrease during hurricane events in locations that do receive FEMA aid. This effect largely reverses in areas that do not receive FEMA aid, where the magnitude of transaction volumes drop by less and default rates remain similar relative to the baseline. Overall, this suggests that the availability of emergency liquidity during natural disaster events is indeed a binding constraint with real household financial consequences, in particular through our documented channel of evictions and in usage of high-cost credit.</description>

      <title>Simulating Macroeconomic Expectations using LLM Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17648v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a novel framework for simulating macroeconomic expectations using LLM Agents. By constructing LLM Agents equipped with various functional modules, we replicate three representative survey experiments involving several expectations across different types of economic agents. Our results show that although the expectations simulated by LLM Agents are more homogeneous than those of humans, they consistently outperform LLMs relying simply on prompt engineering, and possess human-like mental mechanisms. Evaluation reveals that these capabilities stem from the contributions of their components, offering guidelines for their architectural design. Our approach complements traditional methods and provides new insights into AI behavioral science in macroeconomic research</description>

      <title>Clarifying Trinko as Precedent in EHR and AI Memory Duty to Deal Cases: A New Institutional Economics Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18664v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By clarifying the bases for the Verizon Communications Inc. v. Law Offices of Curtis V. Trinko, LLP, 2004 opinion, we hope to reduce two distinct errors. The false positive error is citing Trinko as precedent when it is not. This error is so prevalent it has earned the nickname of Trinko Creep. The false negative error is not citing Trinko when it should be. We argue that this error will be growing in the future as Trinko should be precedent in cases involving regulated access rights to sensitive consumer data in electronic health records and Agentic AI Long Term Memory.</description>
