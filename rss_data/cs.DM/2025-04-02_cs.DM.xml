      <title>Lower bounding the MaxCut of high girth 3-regular graphs using the QAOA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12789v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study MaxCut on 3-regular graphs of minimum girth $g$ for various $g$'s. We obtain new lower bounds on the maximum cut achievable in such graphs by analyzing the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA). For $g \geq 16$, at depth $p \geq 7$, the QAOA improves on previously known lower bounds. Our bounds are established through classical numerical analysis of the QAOA's expected performance. This analysis does not produce the actual cuts but establishes their existence. When implemented on a quantum computer, the QAOA provides an efficient algorithm for finding such cuts, using a constant-depth quantum circuit. To our knowledge, this gives an exponential speedup over the best known classical algorithm guaranteed to achieve cuts of this size on graphs of this girth. We also apply the QAOA to the Maximum Independent Set problem on the same class of graphs.</description>

      <title>Reconstructing graphs with subgraph compositions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00169v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We generalize the problem of reconstructing strings from their substring compositions first introduced by Acharya et al. in 2015 motivated by polymer-based advanced data storage systems utilizing mass spectrometry. Namely, we see strings as labeled path graphs, and as such try to reconstruct labeled graphs. For a given integer t, the subgraph compositions contain either vectors of labels for each connected subgraph of order t (t-multiset-compositions) or the sum of all labels of all connected subgraphs of order t (t-sum-composition). We ask whether, given a graph of which we know the structure and an oracle whom you can query for compositions, we can reconstruct the labeling of the graph. If it is possible, then the graph is reconstructable; otherwise, it is confusable, and two labeled graphs with the same compositions are called equicomposable. We prove that reconstructing through a brute-force algorithm is wildly inefficient, before giving methods for reconstructing several graph classes using as few compositions as possible. We also give negative results, finding the smallest confusable graphs and trees, as well as families with a large number of equicomposable non-isomorphic graphs. An interesting result occurs when twinning one leaf of a path: some paths are confusable, creating a twin out of a leaf sees the graph alternating between reconstructable and confusable depending on the parity of the path, and creating a false twin out of a leaf makes the graph reconstructable using only sum-compositions in all cases.</description>

      <title>Preparing graph states forbidding a vertex-minor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00291v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Measurement based quantum computing is preformed by adding non-Clifford measurements to a prepared stabilizer states. Entangling gates like CZ are likely to have lower fidelities due to the nature of interacting qubits, so when preparing a stabilizer state, we wish to minimize the number of required entangling states. This naturally introduces the notion of CZ-distance.
  Every stabilizer state is local-Clifford equivalent to a graph state, so we may focus on graph states $\left\vert G \right\rangle$. As a lower bound for general graphs, there exist $n$-vertex graphs $G$ such that the CZ-distance of $\left\vert G \right\rangle$ is $\Omega(n^2 / \log n)$. We obtain significantly improved bounds when $G$ is contained within certain proper classes of graphs. For instance, we prove that if $G$ is a $n$-vertex circle graph with clique number $\omega$, then $\left\vert G \right\rangle$ has CZ-distance at most $4n \log \omega + 7n$. We prove that if $G$ is an $n$-vertex graph of rank-width at most $k$, then $\left\vert G \right\rangle$ has CZ-distance at most $(2^{2^{k+1}} + 1) n$. More generally, this is obtained via a bound of $(k+2)n$ that we prove for graphs of twin-width at most $k$.
  We also study how bounded-rank perturbations and low-rank cuts affect the CZ-distance. As a consequence, we prove that Geelen's Weak Structural Conjecture for vertex-minors implies that if $G$ is an $n$-vertex graph contained in some fixed proper vertex-minor-closed class of graphs, then $\left\vert G \right\rangle$ has CZ-distance at most $O(n\log n)$. Since graph states of locally equivalent graphs are local Clifford equivalent, proper vertex-minor-closed classes of graphs are natural and very general in this setting.</description>

      <title>A Tutte-type canonical decomposition of 4-connected graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00760v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide a unique decomposition of every 4-connected graph into parts that are either quasi-5-connected, cycles of triangle-torsos and 3-connected torsos on $\leq 5$ vertices, generalised double-wheels, or thickened $K_{4,m}$'s. The decomposition can be described in terms of a tree-decomposition but with edges allowed in the adhesion-sets. Our construction is explicit, canonical, and exhibits a defining property of the Tutte-decomposition.
  As a corollary, we obtain a new Tutte-type canonical decomposition of 3-connected graphs into parts that are either quasi-4-connected, generalised wheels or thickened $K_{3,m}$'s. This decomposition is similar yet different from the tri-separation decomposition.
  As an application of the decomposition for 4-connectivity, we obtain a new theorem characterising all 4-connected vertex-transitive finite graphs as quasi-5-connected, the $K_4$-expansion of a quasi-5-connected graph, or on a short explicit list of graphs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.00932v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the class $\mathcal{C}^d$ of sphere intersection graphs in $\mathbb{R}^d$ for $d \geq 2$. We show that for each integer $t$, the class of all graphs in $\mathcal{C}^d$ that exclude $K_{t,t}$ as a subgraph has strongly sublinear separators. We also prove that $\mathcal{C}^d$ has asymptotic dimension at most $2d+2$.</description>

      <title>Causal Models for Growing Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01012v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Real-world networks grow over time; statistical models based on node exchangeability are not appropriate. Instead of constraining the structure of the \textit{distribution} of edges, we propose that the relevant symmetries refer to the \textit{causal structure} between them. We first enumerate the 96 causal directed acyclic graph (DAG) models over pairs of nodes (dyad variables) in a growing network with finite ancestral sets that are invariant to node deletion. We then partition them into 21 classes with ancestral sets that are closed under node marginalization. Several of these classes are remarkably amenable to distributed and asynchronous evaluation. As an example, we highlight a simple model that exhibits flexible power-law degree distributions and emergent phase transitions in sparsity, which we characterize analytically. With few parameters and much conditional independence, our proposed framework provides natural baseline models for causal inference in relational data.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian path and Hamiltonian cycle are solvable in polynomial time in graphs of bounded independence number</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.09228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.09228v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A Hamiltonian path (a Hamiltonian cycle) in a graph is a path (a cycle, respectively) that traverses all of its vertices. The problems of deciding their existence in an input graph are well-known to be NP-complete, in fact, they belong to the first problems shown to be computationally hard when the theory of NP-completeness was being developed. A lot of research has been devoted to the complexity of Hamiltonian path and Hamiltonian cycle problems for special graph classes, yet only a handful of positive results are known. The complexities of both of these problems have been open even for $4K_1$-free graphs, i.e., graphs of independence number at most $3$. We answer this question in the general setting of graphs of bounded independence number.
  We also consider a newly introduced problem called \emph{Hamiltonian-$\ell$-Linkage} which is related to the notions of a path cover and of a linkage in a graph. This problem asks if given $\ell$ pairs of vertices in an input graph can be connected by disjoint paths that altogether traverse all vertices of the graph. For $\ell=1$, Hamiltonian-1-Linkage asks for existence of a Hamiltonian path connecting a given pair of vertices. Our main result reads that for every pair of integers $k$ and $\ell$, the Hamiltonian-$\ell$-Linkage problem is polynomial time solvable for graphs of independence number not exceeding $k$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.12417v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A De Bruijn cycle is a cyclic sequence in which every word of length $n$ over an alphabet $\mathcal{A}$ appears exactly once. De Bruijn tori are a two-dimensional analogue. Motivated by recent progress on universal partial cycles and words, which shorten De Bruijn cycles using a wildcard character, we introduce universal partial tori and matrices. We find them computationally and construct infinitely many of them using one-dimensional variants of universal cycles, including a new variant called a universal partial family.</description>

      <title>Every Graph is Essential to Large Treewidth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14775v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that for every graph $H$, there is a hereditary weakly sparse graph class $\mathcal C_H$ of unbounded treewidth such that the $H$-free (i.e., excluding $H$ as an induced subgraph) graphs of $\mathcal C_H$ have bounded treewidth. This refutes several conjectures and critically thwarts the quest for the unavoidable induced subgraphs in classes of unbounded treewidth, a wished-for counterpart of the Grid Minor theorem. We actually show a stronger result: For every positive integer $t$, there is a hereditary graph class $\mathcal C_t$ of unbounded treewidth such that for any graph $H$ of treewidth at most $t$, the $H$-free graphs of $\mathcal C_t$ have bounded treewidth. Our construction is a variant of so-called layered wheels. We also introduce a framework of abstract layered wheels, based on their most salient properties. In particular, we streamline and extend key lemmas previously shown on individual layered wheels. We believe that this should greatly help develop this topic, which appears to be a very strong yet underexploited source of counterexamples.</description>

      <title>Graph parameters that are coarsely equivalent to path-length</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05661v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Two graph parameters are said to be coarsely equivalent if they are within constant factors from each other for every graph $G$. Recently, several graph parameters were shown to be coarsely equivalent to tree-length. Recall that the length of a tree-decomposition ${\cal T}(G)$ of a graph $G$ is the largest diameter of a bag in ${\cal T}(G)$, and the tree-length $tl(G)$ of $G$ is the minimum of the length, over all tree-decompositions of $G$. Similarly, the length of a path-decomposition ${\cal P}(G)$ of a graph $G$ is the largest diameter of a bag in ${\cal P}(G)$, and the path-length $pl(G)$ of $G$ is the minimum of the length, over all path-decompositions of $G$. In this paper, we present several graph parameters that are coarsely equivalent to path-length. Among other results, we show that the path-length of a graph $G$ is small if and only if one of the following equivalent conditions is true: (a) $G$ can be embedded to an unweighted caterpillar tree (equivalently, to a graph of path-width one) with a small additive distortion; (b) there is a constant $r\ge 0$ such that for every triple of vertices $u,v,w$ of $G$, disk of radius $r$ centered at one of them intercepts all paths connecting two others; (c) $G$ has a $k$-dominating shortest path with small $k\ge 0$; (d) $G$ has a $k'$-dominating pair with small $k'\ge 0$; (e) some power $G^\mu$ of $G$ is an AT-free (or even a cocomparability) graph for a small integer $\mu\ge 0$.</description>
