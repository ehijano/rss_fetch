      <title>MM-HSD: Multi-Modal Hate Speech Detection in Videos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While hate speech detection (HSD) has been extensively studied in text, existing multi-modal approaches remain limited, particularly in videos. As modalities are not always individually informative, simple fusion methods fail to fully capture inter-modal dependencies. Moreover, previous work often omits relevant modalities such as on-screen text and audio, which may contain subtle hateful content and thus provide essential cues, both individually and in combination with others. In this paper, we present MM-HSD, a multi-modal model for HSD in videos that integrates video frames, audio, and text derived from speech transcripts and from frames (i.e.~on-screen text) together with features extracted by Cross-Modal Attention (CMA). We are the first to use CMA as an early feature extractor for HSD in videos, to systematically compare query/key configurations, and to evaluate the interactions between different modalities in the CMA block. Our approach leads to improved performance when on-screen text is used as a query and the rest of the modalities serve as a key. Experiments on the HateMM dataset show that MM-HSD outperforms state-of-the-art methods on M-F1 score (0.874), using concatenation of transcript, audio, video, on-screen text, and CMA for feature extraction on raw embeddings of the modalities.

      <title>diveXplore at the Video Browser Showdown 2024</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20560v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: According to our experience from VBS2023 and the feedback from the IVR4B special session at CBMI2023, we have largely revised the diveXplore system for VBS2024. It now integrates OpenCLIP trained on the LAION-2B dataset for image/text embeddings that are used for free-text and visual similarity search, a query server that is able to distribute different queries and merge the results, a user interface optimized for fast browsing, as well as an exploration view for large clusters of similar videos (e.g., weddings, paraglider events, snow and ice scenery, etc.).</description>

      <title>Less is More - diveXplore 5.0 at VBS 2021</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20569v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As a longstanding participating system in the annual Video Browser Showdown (VBS2017-VBS2020) as well as in two iterations of the more recently established Lifelog Search Challenge (LSC2018-LSC2019), diveXplore is developed as a feature-rich Deep Interactive Video Exploration system. After its initial successful employment as a competitive tool at the challenges, its performance, however, declined as new features were introduced increasing its overall complexity. We mainly attribute this to the fact that many additions to the system needed to revolve around the system's core element - an interactive self-organizing browseable featuremap, which, as an integral component did not accommodate the addition of new features well. Therefore, counteracting said performance decline, the VBS 2021 version constitutes a completely rebuilt version 5.0, implemented from scratch with the aim of greatly reducing the system's complexity as well as keeping proven useful features in a modular manner.</description>

      <title>diveXplore 6.0: ITEC's Interactive Video Exploration System at VBS 2022</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20687v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Continuously participating since the sixth Video Browser Showdown (VBS2017), diveXplore is a veteran interactive search system that throughout its lifetime has offered and evaluated numerous features. After undergoing major refactoring for the most recent VBS2021, however, the system since version 5.0 is less feature rich, yet, more modern, leaner and faster than the original system. This proved to be a sensible decision as the new system showed increasing performance in VBS2021 when compared to the most recent former competitions. With version 6.0 we reconsider shot segmentation, map search and introduce new features for improving concept as well as temporal context search.</description>

      <title>AdaDPCC: Adaptive Rate Control and Rate-Distortion-Complexity Optimization for Dynamic Point Cloud Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamic point cloud compression (DPCC) is crucial in applications like autonomous driving and AR/VR. Current compression methods face challenges with complexity management and rate control. This paper introduces a novel dynamic coding framework that supports variable bitrate and computational complexities. Our approach includes a slimmable framework with multiple coding routes, allowing for efficient Rate-Distortion-Complexity Optimization (RDCO) within a single model. To address data sparsity in inter-frame prediction, we propose the coarse-to-fine motion estimation and compensation module that deconstructs geometric information while expanding the perceptive field. Additionally, we propose a precise rate control module that content-adaptively navigates point cloud frames through various coding routes to meet target bitrates. The experimental results demonstrate that our approach reduces the average BD-Rate by 5.81% and improves the BD-PSNR by 0.42 dB compared to the state-of-the-art method, while keeping the average bitrate error at 0.40%. Moreover, the average coding time is reduced by up to 44.6% compared to D-DPCC, underscoring its efficiency in real-time and bitrate-constrained DPCC scenarios. Our code is available at https://git.openi.org.cn/OpenPointCloud/Ada_DPCC.</description>

      <title>Mitigating Hallucinations in Multimodal LLMs via Object-aware Preference Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20181v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) emerge as a unified interface to address a multitude of tasks, ranging from NLP to computer vision. Despite showcasing state-of-the-art results in many benchmarks, a long-standing issue is the tendency of MLLMs to hallucinate, that is to generate answers to the user's query that are not reflected in the visual input. In this paper, we address the problem of hallucinations as an alignment problem, seeking to steer the MLLM so that it prefers generating content without hallucinations. In contrast to recent approaches that require complicated pipelines to build synthetic preference data for alignment training, often relying on proprietary models, we capitalize on the well-known CHAIR metric, originally proposed to gauge the degree of hallucinations in image captioning. Given a pair of generated answers, we leverage CHAIR to distinguish winner and loser options (i.e., non-hallucinated and hallucinated samples) and fine-tune off-the-shelf MLLMs via Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). The resulting method, which we refer to as CHAIR-DPO, effectively diminishes the amount of hallucinated answers on several hallucination benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of fine-tuning the MLLM with a CHAIR-based reward. Source code and trained models are publicly available at https://github.com/aimagelab/CHAIR-DPO.</description>

      <title>Efficient and Privacy-Protecting Background Removal for 2D Video Streaming using iPhone 15 Pro Max LiDAR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20250v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) technology in consumer-grade mobile devices can be used as a replacement for traditional background removal and compositing techniques. Unlike approaches such as chroma keying and trained AI models, LiDAR's depth information is independent of subject lighting, and performs equally well in low-light and well-lit environments. We integrate the LiDAR and color cameras on the iPhone 15 Pro Max with GPU-based image processing. We use Apple's SwiftUI and Swift frameworks for user interface and backend development, and Metal Shader Language (MSL) for realtime image enhancement at the standard iPhone streaming frame rate of 60 frames per second. The only meaningful limitations of the technology are the streaming bandwidth of the depth data, which currently reduces the depth map resolution to 320x240, and any pre-existing limitations of the LiDAR IR laser to reflect accurate depth from some materials. If the LiDAR resolution on a mobile device like the iPhone can be improved to match the color image resolution, LiDAR could feasibly become the preeminent method of background removal for video applications and photography.</description>

      <title>Towards Inclusive Communication: A Unified LLM-Based Framework for Sign Language, Lip Movements, and Audio Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20476v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Audio is the primary modality for human communication and has driven the success of Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) technologies. However, such systems remain inherently inaccessible to individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing. Visual alternatives such as sign language and lip reading offer effective substitutes, and recent advances in Sign Language Translation (SLT) and Visual Speech Recognition (VSR) have improved audio-less communication. Yet, these modalities have largely been studied in isolation, and their integration within a unified framework remains underexplored. In this paper, we introduce the first unified framework capable of handling diverse combinations of sign language, lip movements, and audio for spoken-language text generation. We focus on three main objectives: (i) designing a unified, modality-agnostic architecture capable of effectively processing heterogeneous inputs; (ii) exploring the underexamined synergy among modalities, particularly the role of lip movements as non-manual cues in sign language comprehension; and (iii) achieving performance on par with or superior to state-of-the-art models specialized for individual tasks. Building on this framework, we achieve performance on par with or better than task-specific state-of-the-art models across SLT, VSR, ASR, and AVSR. Furthermore, our analysis reveals that explicitly modeling lip movements as a separate modality significantly improves SLT performance.</description>

      <title>MoTAS: MoE-Guided Feature Selection from TTS-Augmented Speech for Enhanced Multimodal Alzheimer's Early Screening</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20513v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Early screening for Alzheimer's Disease (AD) through speech presents a promising non-invasive approach. However, challenges such as limited data and the lack of fine-grained, adaptive feature selection often hinder performance. To address these issues, we propose MoTAS, a robust framework designed to enhance AD screening efficiency. MoTAS leverages Text-to-Speech (TTS) augmentation to increase data volume and employs a Mixture of Experts (MoE) mechanism to improve multimodal feature selection, jointly enhancing model generalization. The process begins with automatic speech recognition (ASR) to obtain accurate transcriptions. TTS is then used to synthesize speech that enriches the dataset. After extracting acoustic and text embeddings, the MoE mechanism dynamically selects the most informative features, optimizing feature fusion for improved classification. Evaluated on the ADReSSo dataset, MoTAS achieves a leading accuracy of 85.71\%, outperforming existing baselines. Ablation studies further validate the individual contributions of TTS augmentation and MoE in boosting classification performance. These findings highlight the practical value of MoTAS in real-world AD screening scenarios, particularly in data-limited settings.</description>

      <title>Amadeus: Autoregressive Model with Bidirectional Attribute Modelling for Symbolic Music</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20665v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Existing state-of-the-art symbolic music generation models predominantly adopt autoregressive or hierarchical autoregressive architectures, modelling symbolic music as a sequence of attribute tokens with unidirectional temporal dependencies, under the assumption of a fixed, strict dependency structure among these attributes. However, we observe that using different attributes as the initial token in these models leads to comparable performance. This suggests that the attributes of a musical note are, in essence, a concurrent and unordered set, rather than a temporally dependent sequence. Based on this insight, we introduce Amadeus, a novel symbolic music generation framework. Amadeus adopts a two-level architecture: an autoregressive model for note sequences and a bidirectional discrete diffusion model for attributes. To enhance performance, we propose Music Latent Space Discriminability Enhancement Strategy(MLSDES), incorporating contrastive learning constraints that amplify discriminability of intermediate music representations. The Conditional Information Enhancement Module (CIEM) simultaneously strengthens note latent vector representation via attention mechanisms, enabling more precise note decoding. We conduct extensive experiments on unconditional and text-conditioned generation tasks. Amadeus significantly outperforms SOTA models across multiple metrics while achieving at least 4$\times$ speed-up. Furthermore, we demonstrate training-free, fine-grained note attribute control feasibility using our model. To explore the upper performance bound of the Amadeus architecture, we compile the largest open-source symbolic music dataset to date, AMD (Amadeus MIDI Dataset), supporting both pre-training and fine-tuning.</description>

      <title>"Humor, Art, or Misinformation?": A Multimodal Dataset for Intent-Aware Synthetic Image Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20670v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal AI have enabled progress in detecting synthetic and out-of-context content. However, existing efforts largely overlook the intent behind AI-generated images. To fill this gap, we introduce S-HArM, a multimodal dataset for intent-aware classification, comprising 9,576 "in the wild" image-text pairs from Twitter/X and Reddit, labeled as Humor/Satire, Art, or Misinformation. Additionally, we explore three prompting strategies (image-guided, description-guided, and multimodally-guided) to construct a large-scale synthetic training dataset with Stable Diffusion. We conduct an extensive comparative study including modality fusion, contrastive learning, reconstruction networks, attention mechanisms, and large vision-language models. Our results show that models trained on image- and multimodally-guided data generalize better to "in the wild" content, due to preserved visual context. However, overall performance remains limited, highlighting the complexity of inferring intent and the need for specialized architectures.</description>

      <title>Learning Primitive Embodied World Models: Towards Scalable Robotic Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20840v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While video-generation-based embodied world models have gained increasing attention, their reliance on large-scale embodied interaction data remains a key bottleneck. The scarcity, difficulty of collection, and high dimensionality of embodied data fundamentally limit the alignment granularity between language and actions and exacerbate the challenge of long-horizon video generation--hindering generative models from achieving a "GPT moment" in the embodied domain. There is a naive observation: the diversity of embodied data far exceeds the relatively small space of possible primitive motions. Based on this insight, we propose a novel paradigm for world modeling--Primitive Embodied World Models (PEWM). By restricting video generation to fixed short horizons, our approach 1) enables fine-grained alignment between linguistic concepts and visual representations of robotic actions, 2) reduces learning complexity, 3) improves data efficiency in embodied data collection, and 4) decreases inference latency. By equipping with a modular Vision-Language Model (VLM) planner and a Start-Goal heatmap Guidance mechanism (SGG), PEWM further enables flexible closed-loop control and supports compositional generalization of primitive-level policies over extended, complex tasks. Our framework leverages the spatiotemporal vision priors in video models and the semantic awareness of VLMs to bridge the gap between fine-grained physical interaction and high-level reasoning, paving the way toward scalable, interpretable, and general-purpose embodied intelligence.</description>

      <title>FakeParts: a New Family of AI-Generated DeepFakes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21052v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce FakeParts, a new class of deepfakes characterized by subtle, localized manipulations to specific spatial regions or temporal segments of otherwise authentic videos. Unlike fully synthetic content, these partial manipulations, ranging from altered facial expressions to object substitutions and background modifications, blend seamlessly with real elements, making them particularly deceptive and difficult to detect. To address the critical gap in detection capabilities, we present FakePartsBench, the first large-scale benchmark dataset specifically designed to capture the full spectrum of partial deepfakes. Comprising over 25K videos with pixel-level and frame-level manipulation annotations, our dataset enables comprehensive evaluation of detection methods. Our user studies demonstrate that FakeParts reduces human detection accuracy by over 30% compared to traditional deepfakes, with similar performance degradation observed in state-of-the-art detection models. This work identifies an urgent vulnerability in current deepfake detection approaches and provides the necessary resources to develop more robust methods for partial video manipulations.</description>

      <title>OLKAVS: An Open Large-Scale Korean Audio-Visual Speech Dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.06375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.06375v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inspired by humans comprehending speech in a multi-modal manner, various audio-visual datasets have been constructed. However, most existing datasets focus on English, induce dependencies with various prediction models during dataset preparation, and have only a small number of multi-view videos. To mitigate the limitations, we recently developed the Open Large-scale Korean Audio-Visual Speech (OLKAVS) dataset, which is the largest among publicly available audio-visual speech datasets. The dataset contains 1,150 hours of transcribed audio from 1,107 Korean speakers in a studio setup with nine different viewpoints and various noise situations. We also provide the pre-trained baseline models for two tasks, audio-visual speech recognition and lip reading. We conducted experiments based on the models to verify the effectiveness of multi-modal and multi-view training over uni-modal and frontal-view-only training. We expect the OLKAVS dataset to facilitate multi-modal research in broader areas such as Korean speech recognition, speaker recognition, pronunciation level classification, and mouth motion analysis.</description>

      <title>TAG-WM: Tamper-Aware Generative Image Watermarking via Diffusion Inversion Sensitivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23484v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: AI-generated content (AIGC) enables efficient visual creation but raises copyright and authenticity risks. As a common technique for integrity verification and source tracing, digital image watermarking is regarded as a potential solution to above issues. However, the widespread adoption and advancing capabilities of generative image editing tools have amplified malicious tampering risks, while simultaneously posing new challenges to passive tampering detection and watermark robustness. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a Tamper-Aware Generative image WaterMarking method named TAG-WM. The proposed method comprises four key modules: a dual-mark joint sampling (DMJS) algorithm for embedding copyright and localization watermarks into the latent space while preserving generative quality, the watermark latent reconstruction (WLR) utilizing reversed DMJS, a dense variation region detector (DVRD) leveraging diffusion inversion sensitivity to identify tampered areas via statistical deviation analysis, and the tamper-aware decoding (TAD) guided by localization results. The experimental results demonstrate that TAG-WM achieves state-of-the-art performance in both tampering robustness and localization capability even under distortion, while preserving lossless generation quality and maintaining a watermark capacity of 256 bits.

      <title>A Highly Clean Recipe Dataset with Ingredient States Annotation for State Probing Task</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17232v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are trained on a vast amount of procedural texts, but they do not directly observe real-world phenomena. In the context of cooking recipes, this poses a challenge, as intermediate states of ingredients are often omitted, making it difficult for models to track ingredient states and understand recipes accurately. In this paper, we apply state probing, a method for evaluating a language model's understanding of the world, to the domain of cooking. We propose a new task and dataset for evaluating how well LLMs can recognize intermediate ingredient states during cooking procedures. We first construct a new Japanese recipe dataset with clear and accurate annotations of ingredient state changes, collected from well-structured and controlled recipe texts. Using this dataset, we design three novel tasks to evaluate whether LLMs can track ingredient state transitions and identify ingredients present at intermediate steps. Our experiments with widely used LLMs, such as Llama3.1-70B and Qwen2.5-72B, show that learning ingredient state knowledge improves their understanding of cooking processes, achieving performance comparable to commercial LLMs. The dataset are publicly available at: https://huggingface.co/datasets/mashi6n/nhkrecipe-100-anno-1</description>

      <title>Seeing is Believing: Emotion-Aware Audio-Visual Language Modeling for Expressive Speech Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16188v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an Audio-Visual Language Model (AVLM) for expressive speech generation by integrating full-face visual cues into a pre-trained expressive speech model. We explore multiple visual encoders and multimodal fusion strategies during pre-training to identify the most effective integration approach. Subsequent fine-tuning on emotion recognition and expressive dialogue tasks yields substantial gains over speech-only baselines (e.g., +5 F1 in emotion recognition). AVLM highlights the value of expressive visual information in guiding speech generation and offers a foundation for end-to-end multimodal conversational systems.</description>
