      <title>Reconstruction of network dynamics from partial observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13088v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the reconstruction of time series from dynamical networks that are partially observed. In particular, we address the extent to which the time series at a node of the network can be successfully reconstructed when measuring from another node, or subset of nodes, corrupted by observational noise. We will assume the dynamical equations of the network are known, and that the dynamics are not necessarily low-dimensional. The case of linear dynamics is treated first, and leads to a definition of observation error magnification factor (OEMF) that measures the magnification of noise in the reconstruction process. Subsequently, the definition is applied to nonlinear and chaotic dynamics. Comparison of OEMF for different target/observer combinations can lead to better understanding of how to optimally observe a network. As part of the study, a computational method for reconstructing time series from partial observations is presented and analyzed.</description>

      <title>Scale-bridging within a complex model hierarchy for investigation of a metal-fueled circular energy economy by use of Bayesian model calibration with model error quantification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13092v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chemical reactor network (CRN) modeling is a promising approach for scale-bridging within a model hierarchy covering a huge range of scales from micro to macro in the scope of developing an innovative metal-fueled circular energy economy. This holds if valid information from CRNs, being models of reduced complexity, can be obtained on a much denser set of operating conditions than available from experiments and elaborated simulation methods like Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). An approach for CRN calibration including model error quantification from recent literature is used for developing a CRN model of a laboratory reactor for flash ironmaking, using data from the literature. By introducing a meta model of a CRN parameter, it has been possible to calibrate a simple CRN model on an extended set of operating conditions with satisfactory results. This way, the employed coupled calibration and uncertainty quantification framework seems promising for the task of scale-bridging in the model hierarchy under investigation. Challenges for the further extension of the present work into that direction are discussed.</description>

      <title>Uncovering Obscured Phonon Dynamics from Powder Inelastic Neutron Scattering using Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13507v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study of phonon dynamics is pivotal for understanding material properties, yet it faces challenges due to the irreversible information loss inherent in powder inelastic neutron scattering spectra and the limitations of traditional analysis methods. In this study, we present a machine learning framework designed to reveal obscured phonon dynamics from powder spectra. Using a variational autoencoder, we obtain a disentangled latent representation of spectra and successfully extract force constants for reconstructing phonon dispersions. Notably, our model demonstrates effective applicability to experimental data even when trained exclusively on physics-based simulations. The fine-tuning with experimental spectra further mitigates issues arising from domain shift. Analysis of latent space underscores the model's versatility and generalizability, affirming its suitability for complex system applications. Furthermore, our framework's two-stage design is promising for developing a universal pre-trained feature extractor. This approach has the potential to revolutionize neutron measurements of phonon dynamics, offering researchers a potent tool to decipher intricate spectra and gain valuable insights into the intrinsic physics of materials.</description>

      <title>Basis Function Dependence of Estimation Precision for Synchrotron-Radiation-Based M\"ossbauer Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13916v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: M\"ossbauer spectroscopy is a technique employed to investigate the microscopic properties of materials using transitions between energy levels in the nuclei. Conventionally, in synchrotron-radiation-based M\"ossbauer spectroscopy, the measurement window is decided by the researcher heuristically, although this decision has a significant impact on the shape of the measurement spectra. In this paper, we propose a method for evaluating the precision of the spectral position by introducing Bayesian estimation. The proposed method makes it possible to select the best measurement window by calculating the precision of M\"ossbauer spectroscopy from the data. Based on the results, the precision of the M\"ossbauer center shifts improved by more than three times compared with the results achieved with the conventional simple fitting method using the Lorentzian function.</description>

      <title>Preserving linear invariants in ensemble filtering methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14328v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Formulating dynamical models for physical phenomena is essential for understanding the interplay between the different mechanisms and predicting the evolution of physical states. However, a dynamical model alone is often insufficient to address these fundamental tasks, as it suffers from model errors and uncertainties. One common remedy is to rely on data assimilation, where the state estimate is updated with observations of the true system. Ensemble filters sequentially assimilate observations by updating a set of samples over time. They operate in two steps: a forecast step that propagates each sample through the dynamical model and an analysis step that updates the samples with incoming observations. For accurate and robust predictions of dynamical systems, discrete solutions must preserve their critical invariants. While modern numerical solvers satisfy these invariants, existing invariant-preserving analysis steps are limited to Gaussian settings and are often not compatible with classical regularization techniques of ensemble filters, e.g., inflation and covariance tapering. The present work focuses on preserving linear invariants, such as mass, stoichiometric balance of chemical species, and electrical charges. Using tools from measure transport theory (Spantini et al., 2022, SIAM Review), we introduce a generic class of nonlinear ensemble filters that automatically preserve desired linear invariants in non-Gaussian filtering problems. By specializing this framework to the Gaussian setting, we recover a constrained formulation of the Kalman filter. Then, we show how to combine existing regularization techniques for the ensemble Kalman filter (Evensen, 1994, J. Geophys. Res.) with the preservation of the linear invariants. Finally, we assess the benefits of preserving linear invariants for the ensemble Kalman filter and nonlinear ensemble filters.</description>

      <title>Bounds on the rates of statistical divergences and mutual information via stochastic thermodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.05597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.05597v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Statistical divergences are important tools in data analysis, information theory, and statistical physics, and there exist well known inequalities on their bounds. However, in many circumstances involving temporal evolution, one needs limitations on the rates of such quantities, instead. Here, several general upper bounds on the rates of some f-divergences are derived, valid for any type of stochastic dynamics (both Markovian and non-Markovian), in terms of information-like and/or thermodynamic observables. As special cases, the analytical bounds on the rate of mutual information are obtained. The major role in all those limitations is played by temporal Fisher information, characterizing the speed of global system dynamics, and some of them contain entropy production, suggesting a link with stochastic thermodynamics. Indeed, the derived inequalities can be used for estimation of minimal dissipation and global speed in thermodynamic stochastic systems. Specific applications of these inequalities in physics and neuroscience are given, which include the bounds on the rates of free energy and work in nonequilibrium systems, limits on the speed of information gain in learning synapses, as well as the bounds on the speed of predictive inference and learning rate. Overall, the derived bounds can be applied to any complex network of interacting elements, where predictability and thermodynamics of network dynamics are of prime concern.</description>

      <title>The Bayes factor surface for searches for new physics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.11710v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Bayes factor surface is a new way to present results from experimental searches for new physics. Searches are regularly expressed in terms of phenomenological parameters - such as the mass and cross-section of a weakly interacting massive particle. Bayes factor surfaces indicate the strength of evidence for or against models relative to the background only model in terms of the phenomenological parameters that they predict. They provide a clear and direct measure of evidence, may be easily reinterpreted, but do not depend on choices of prior or parameterization. We demonstrate the Bayes factor surface with examples from dark matter, cosmology, and collider physics.</description>

      <title>Machine learning assisted optical diagnostics on a cylindrical atmospheric pressure surface dielectric barrier discharge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06817v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The present study explores combining machine learning (ML) algorithms with standard optical diagnostics (such as time-integrated emission spectroscopy and imaging) to accurately predict operating conditions and assess the emission uniformity of a cylindrical surface Dielectric Barrier Discharge (SDBD). It is demonstrated that ML can be complementary with these optical diagnostics and identify peculiarities associated with the discharge emission pattern at different high voltage waveforms (AC and pulsed) and amplitudes. By employing unsupervised (Principal Component Analysis (PCA)) and supervised (Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) neural networks) algorithms, the applied voltage waveform and amplitude are categorised and predicted based on correlations/differences identified within large amounts of corresponding data. PCA allowed us to effectively classify the voltage waveforms and amplitudes applied to the SDBD through a transformation of the spectroscopic/imaging data into principal components (PCs) and their projection to a two-dimensional PC space. Furthermore, an accurate prediction of the voltage amplitude is achieved using the MLP which is trained with PCA-preprocessed data. A particularly interesting aspect of this concept involves examining the uniformity of the emission pattern of the discharge. This is achieved by analysing spectroscopic data recorded at four different regions around the SDBD surface using the two ML-based techniques. These discoveries are instrumental in enhancing plasma-induced processes. They open up new avenues for real-time control, monitoring, and optimization of plasma-based applications across diverse fields such as flow control for the present SDBD.</description>
