      <title>The Importance of Standardizing Spectra in the Era of Large Spectroscopic Surveys: A Case Study of M Dwarfs in SDSS-V</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15309v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: SDSS-V will obtain 100,000s of medium-resolution, optical spectra of M dwarfs with the BOSS instrument. M dwarfs have complex atmospheres, and their spectra contain many wide and dense, overlapping molecular features, so determining accurate stellar parameters by fitting models has been difficult. To circumvent this, other surveys have employed machine learning methods to transfer measurements of stellar parameters from high-resolution spectra to their medium-resolution counterparts. These methods provide large catalogs of stellar parameters but, if not addressed properly, are plagued by biases which are, in part, due to the normalization of the spectra. Typical spectral normalization removes the continuum but preserves the relative depths of the absorption features, but optical M dwarf spectra are almost entirely made up of molecular absorption, which makes this difficult. Here, we develop a standardization method that instead defines a pseudo-continuum. We use the spectrum's alpha shape to find the points which lie between the absorption features and apply local polynomial regression to find this pseudo-continuum. To tune the hyperparameters of this method, we create BOSS-like spectra from BT-NextGen models to replicate instrumental, signal-to-noise, and reddening effects. We find that in both this generated set and a validation set of the SDSS-V data, our method performs better than alternative standardizations by producing spectra that are both more uniform for M dwarfs with similar stellar parameters and more easily distinguished compared to M dwarfs of differing parameters. These results from our method will be crucial for better determining stellar parameters of M dwarfs using generative models.</description>

      <title>VVV-WIT-13: an eruptive young star with cool molecular features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Here we investigate an infrared eruptive source, identified from the decade-long VISTA Variables in the Via Lactea survey (VVV). We named this target after a group of variable sources discovered by VVV, as VVV-WIT-13, with WIT standing for "What Is This?", due to its unique photometric variation behaviour and the mysterious origin of the outburst. This target exhibited an outburst with a 5.7 mag amplitude in the Ks-band, remained on its brightness plateau for 3.5 years, and then rapidly faded to its pre-eruptive brightness afterwards. We aim to reveal the variable nature and outburst origin of VVV-WIT-13 by presenting our follow-up photometric and spectroscopic observations along with theoretical models. We gathered photometric time series in both near- and mid-infrared wavelengths. We obtained near-infrared spectra during the outburst and decaying stages on XSHOOTER/VLT and FIRE/Magellan, and then fitted the detected molecular absorption features using models from ExoMol. We applied 2D numerical simulations to re-create the observables of the eruptive phenomenon. We observe deep AlO absorption bands in the infrared spectra of VVV-WIT-13, during the outburst stage, along with other more common absorption bands (e.g. CO). Our best-fit model suggests a 600 K temperature of the AlO absorption band. In the decaying stage, the AlO bands disappeared, whilst broad blue-shifted H2 lines arose, a common indicator of stellar wind and outflow. The observational evidence suggests that the CO and TiO features originate from an outflow or a wind environment. We find that VVV-WIT-13 is an eruptive young star with instability occurring in the accretion disk. One favoured theoretical explanation of this event is a disrupted gas clump at a distance of 3 au from the source. If confirmed, this would be the first such event observed in real time.</description>

      <title>Understanding post-RGB binaries through stable mass transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15580v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Post-RGB and post-AGB binaries consist of a primary star that has recently evolved off either the RGB or AGB after losing most of its envelope, and a main-sequence companion. They are distinguished by luminosities below and above the RGB tip, respectively. These systems host a stable, dusty circumbinary disc, characterised by a near-infrared excess. Observed Galactic post-AGB and post-RGB binaries have orbital periods and eccentricities inconsistent with binary population synthesis models. Here, we focus on post-RGB binaries, testing whether stable mass transfer can explain their orbital periods by comparing models with the known sample of 38 Galactic post-RGB binaries. We systematically determined luminosities of Galactic post-RGB and post-AGB binaries through SED fitting. We computed evolution models for low- and intermediate-mass binaries with RGB donors at two metallicities using MESA. We selected stable mass transfer models producing primaries with effective temperatures within the observed range. From these models, we find that low-mass post-RGB binaries should follow strict luminosity-orbital period relations. The Galactic post-RGB binaries seem consistent with these relations if their orbits remained eccentric during mass transfer and if the donor filled its Roche lobe at periastron. However, our models are unable to explain the eccentricities themselves. Moreover, post-mass-transfer ages from our models are much longer than predicted dissipation timescales of circumbinary discs. Stable mass transfer seems to explain the orbital periods of Galactic post-RGB binaries. This formation channel can be tested further by obtaining orbits of additional Galactic systems and Magellanic Cloud candidates via long-term radial velocity monitoring. Gaia DR 4 will improve luminosities of Galactic post-RGB binaries, enabling more accurate comparison with luminosity-orbital period relations.</description>

      <title>Identification and characterization of nascent planetary nebulae with OH and H$_2$O masers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stars like the Sun expel their outer layers and form planetary nebulae (PNe) as they evolve into white dwarfs. PNe exhibit diverse morphologies, the origins of which are not fully understood. PNe with OH (OHPNe) and H$_{2}$O (H$_{2}$OPNe) masers are thought to be nascent PNe. However, the number of known OHPNe and H$_{2}$OPNe remains small, and only in eight cases the position of the maser emission has been found to coincide with the PN, using the high astrometric accuracy of interferometric observations. In order to identify more OHPNe and H$_{2}$OPNe, we used public databases and our own ATCA/VLA observations to match the positions of OH and H$_{2}$O masers with known PNe and radio continuum emitters, considering radio continuum emission as a possible tracer of the photoionized gas that characterizes PNe. Here we report the confirmation of positional coincidence of maser emission with one more PN, and 12 PN candidates. Moreover, we have confirmed three evolved stars as `water fountains' (WFs) hosting H$_2$O masers. These WFs are associated with radio continuum emission, but their possible nature as PNe has not yet been confirmed. Although a final characterization of maser-emitting PNe as a group still requires confirmation of more objects, their distribution in the infrared color-color diagrams suggests that they are a heterogeneous group of PNe. In particular, the new OHPN IRAS 07027$-$7934 has been reported to contain a late [WC]-type central star, while the maser emission implies an O-rich envelope. This property is found in only one other known maser-emitting PN, although we found evidence that other confirmed and candidate OHPNe may also have mixed chemistry, since they show emission from polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. The new WF IRAS 18443$-$0231 shows radio continuum that is dominated by strong and variable non-thermal emission, as in magnetized outflows.</description>

      <title>HiPERCAM and TESS observations of the rapidly rotating M7V star LP 89--187</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15941v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discovery of a significant number of rapidly rotating low mass stars showing no or few flares in TESS observations was a surprise as rapid rotation has previously been taken as implying high stellar activity. Here we present TESS and HiPERCAM $u_{s}g_{s}r_{s}i_{s}z_{s}$ observations of one of these stars LP 89--187 which has a rotation period of 0.117 d. TESS data covering three sectors (64.6 d) only show three flares which have energies a few $\times10^{33}$ erg, whilst HiPERCAM observations, which cover 0.78 of the rotation period, show no evidence for flares more energetic than $\sim10^{31}$ erg. Intriguingly, other surveys show LP 89--187 has shown weak H$\alpha$ in emission. We compare the flare energy distribution of LP 89--187 with low mass stars in the $\beta$ Pic moving group, which have an age of $\sim$24 Myr. We find LP 89--187 has a lower flare rate than the $\beta$ Pic stars. In addition, we find that TRAPPIST-1 analogue stars, which are likely significantly older than the $\beta$ Pic stars, show fewer flares with energies $&gt;10^{33}$ erg in TESS data. We examine the relationship between amplitude and period for a sample of low mass stars and find that more rapid rotators have a higher amplitude.</description>

      <title>Flare energetics, CME launch and heliospheric propagation for the May 2024 events, as derived from ensemble MHD modelling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16144v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many questions must be answered before understanding the relationship between the emerging magnetic flux through the solar surface and the extreme geoeffective events. The main ingredients for getting X-ray class flares and large interplanetary Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs) are the build-up of electric current in the corona, the existence of magnetic free energy, magnetic energy/helicity ratio, twist, and magnetic stress in active regions (ARs). The upper limit of solar energy in the space research era, as well as the potential for experiencing superflares and extreme solar events, can be predicted using MHD simulations of CMEs.
  To address this problem, we consider the recent events of May 2024 and use three MHD models: 1) OHM ("Observationally driven High order scheme Magnetohydrodynamic code") for investigating the magnetic evolutions at a synthetic dipole structure. 2) TMF (time-dependent magneto-friction) for setting up an initial non-potential magnetic field in the active region. A zero-beta MHD model for tracing the magnetic evolution of active regions. 3) EUHFORIA (''European heliospheric forecasting information asset'') for interplanetary CME propagations.
  For the eruptive flares with CMEs, magnetic solar energy is computed along with data-constrained MHD simulations for the May 2024 events. We show the consistency between the data-initiated realistic simulation of the May 2024 big event and energy scalings from an idealised simulation of a bipolar eruption using OHM. The estimated free magnetic energy did not surpass $5.2 \times 10^{32}\;$erg. Good arrival time predictions ($&lt;3$ hours) are achieved with the EUHFORIA simulation with the cone model. We note the interest in coupling all the chains of codes from the Sun to the Earth and developing different approaches to test the results.</description>

      <title>Kinematics of Stellar Streams from Globular Clusters Depend on Black Hole Retention and Star Mass: A Selection Effect for Dark Matter Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15307v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Velocity dispersion ($\sigma$) in stellar streams from globular clusters (GCs) is sensitive to heating by Galactic substructure, including dark matter (DM) subhalos. Recent studies have compared $\sigma$ in observed and modeled streams to probe DM properties, but have relied on stream models that neglect strong encounters, black holes (BHs), and mass segregation in GCs. Such phenomena may inflate stream $\sigma$ or introduce selection effects -- e.g., a $\sigma$ that depends on star mass ($m$). We investigate this prospect using Monte Carlo $N$-body simulations of GCs under static Galactic tides to generate mock streams with realistic mass and velocity distributions. We find $\sigma$ correlates with $m$, especially after core collapse (the GC's observable increase in central density upon ejecting its BHs), rising from $1.2$--$2.2\,{\rm km\,s}^{-1}$ between $m=0.3$--$0.8\,M_\odot$, with typical kinematic cuts on stream membership. Similar in magnitude to heating by Galactic substructure, this enhancement occurs because the GC's loss of BHs allows its most-massive stars to occupy its dense center, raising their likelihood of strong ejection via binary interactions and adding broad, exponential wings to the stream's velocity distribution. Streams' kinematics thus probe properties (density, BH retention) of their progenitor GCs. Our results also imply observations of streams from some GCs, especially those not subject to highly episodic mass loss, may select for higher $\sigma$ than predicted by models neglecting $\sigma$'s $m$-dependence. This would cause observed $\sigma$ in streams -- already on the low side of expectations for cold DM -- to further favor alternatives such as warm, ultralight, or self-interacting DM.</description>

      <title>A high geometric albedo and small size of the Haumea cluster member (24835) 1995 SM55 from a stellar occultation and photometric observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15384v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Trans-Neptunian objects (TNOs) are among the most ancient bodies of the solar system. Understanding their physical properties is key to constraining their origin and the evolution of the outer regions beyond Neptune. Stellar occultations provide highly accurate size and shape information. (24835) 1995 SM55 is one of the few members of the Haumea cluster and thus of particular interest. We aimed to determine its projected size, absolute magnitude, and geometric albedo, and to compare these with Haumea. A stellar occultation on 25 February 2024 was observed from five sites, with seven positive detections and 33 negative chords. An elliptical fit to the occultation chords yields semi-axes of $(104.3 \pm 0.4) \times (83.5 \pm 0.5)$ km, giving an area-equivalent diameter of $186.7 \pm 1.8$ km, smaller than the 250 km upper limit from Herschel thermal data. Photometry provides an absolute magnitude $H_V = 4.55 \pm 0.03$, a phase slope of $0.04 \pm 0.02$ mag/deg, and a $V-R = 0.37 \pm 0.05$. The rotational variability has an amplitude $\Delta m = 0.05$ mag, but the period remains uncertain. Combining occultation and photometry, we derive a geometric albedo $p_V = 0.80 \pm 0.04$, one of the highest values measured for a TNO. This value is slightly higher than that of Haumea, consistent with the interpretation that 1995 SM55 belongs to the Haumea cluster.</description>

      <title>A misaligned protostellar disk fed by gas streamers in a barred spiral-like massive dense core</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15527v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-mass stars, born in massive dense cores (MDCs), profoundly impact the cosmic ecosystem through feedback processes and metal enrichment, yet little is known about how MDCs assemble and transfer mass across scales to form high-mass young stellar objects (HMYSOs). Using multi-scale (40-2500 au) observations of an MDC hosting an HMYSO, we identify a coherent dynamical structure analogous to barred spiral galaxies: three 20,000 au spiral arms feed a 7,500 au central bar, which channels gas to a 2,000 au pseudodisk. Further accretion proceeds through the inner structures, including a Keplerian disk and an inner disk (100 au), which are thought to be driving a collimated bipolar outflow. This is the first time that these multi-scale structures (spiral arms, bar, streamers, envelope, disk, and outflow) have been simultaneously observed as a physically coherent structure within an MDC. Our discovery suggests that well-organized hierarchical structures play a crucial role during the gas accretion and angular momentum build-up of a massive disk.</description>

      <title>Observational Astrophysics Research through Cross Institutional Research Partnerships</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15743v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Undergraduate research in STEM can be a transformative experience, especially for Community College students, many of whom come from under-represented backgrounds. However, undergraduate research at Community Colleges is relatively rare, due in part to their focus on teaching excellence. Research partnerships with four year colleges about exciting and accessible science topics, facilitated by researchers such as postdoctoral fellows, can be a powerful path forward. We describe our program, the Dead Stars Society (DSS), as a successful example of such a research partnership, focused on the topic of observational astronomy, specifically stellar science with the Vera C. Rubin Observatory, and X-ray astronomy with Chandra, NICER and NuSTAR.</description>

      <title>ATREIDES I. Embarking on a trek across the exo-Neptunian landscape with the TOI-421 system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15746v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The distribution of close-in exoplanets is shaped by the interplay between atmospheric and dynamical processes. The Neptunian Desert, Ridge, and Savanna illustrate the sensitivity of these worlds to such processes, making them ideal to disentangle their roles. Determining how many Neptunes were brought close-in by early disk-driven migration (DDM; maintaining primordial spin-orbit alignment) or late high-eccentricity migration (HEM; generating large misalignments) is essential to understand how much atmosphere they lost. We propose a unified view of the Neptunian landscape to guide its exploration, speculating that the Ridge is a hot spot for evolutionary processes. Low-density Neptunes would mainly undergo DDM, getting fully eroded at shorter periods than the Ridge, while denser Neptunes would be brought to the Ridge and Desert by HEM. We embark on this exploration via ATREIDES, which relies on spectroscopy and photometry of 60 close-in Neptunes, their reduction with robust pipelines, and their interpretation through internal structure, atmospheric, and evolutionary models. We carried out a systematic RM census with VLT/ESPRESSO to measure the distribution of 3D spin-orbit angles, correlate its shape with system properties and thus relate the fraction of aligned-misaligned systems to DDM, HEM, and atmospheric erosion. Our first target, TOI-421c, lies in the Savanna with a neighboring sub-Neptune TOI-421b. We measured their 3D spin-orbit angles (Psib = 57+11-15 deg; Psic = 44.9+4.4-4.1 deg). Together with the eccentricity and possibly large mutual inclination of their orbits, this hints at a chaotic dynamical origin that could result from DDM followed by HEM. ATREIDES will provide the community with a wealth of constraints for formation and evolution models. We welcome collaborations that will contribute to pushing our understanding of the Neptunian landscape forward.</description>

      <title>MINDS: The very low-mass star and brown dwarf sample II. Probing disk settling, dust properties, and dust-gas interplay with JWST/MIRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16004</link>

Abstract: Disks around very low-mass stars (VLMS) provide environments for the formation of Earth-like planets. Mid-infrared observations have revealed that these disks exhibit weak silicate features and strong hydrocarbon emissions. This study characterizes the dust properties and geometrical structures of VLMS and brown dwarf (BD) disks, observed by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST)/Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI), and connects these to gas column density and potential evolutionary stages. We analyze mid-infrared spectra of ten VLMS and BD disks as a part of the MIRI mid-Infrared Disk Survey (MINDS) program. Spectral slopes and silicate band strengths are compared with hydrocarbon emission line ratios, which probe the gas column density. Moreover, the Dust Continuum Kit with Line emission from Gas is used to quantify grain sizes, dust compositions, and crystallinity in the disk surface. The disks are classified into less, more, and fully settled geometries based on their mid-infrared spectral slopes and silicate band strengths. Less-settled disks show a relatively strong silicate band, high spectral slopes, and low crystallinity, and are dominated by 5 $\mu$m-sized grains. More-settled disks have weaker silicate band, low spectral slope, enhanced crystallinity, and higher mass fractions of smaller grains. Fully-settled disks exhibit little or no silicate emission and negative spectral slopes. An overall trend of increasing gas column density with decreasing spectral slope suggests that more molecular gas is exposed when the dust opacity decreases due to dust settling. Our findings may reflect possible evolutionary pathways with dust settling and thermal processing or may point to inner-disk clearing or a collisional cascade. These results highlight the need for broader samples to understand the link between dust and gas appearance in regions where Earth-like planets form.</description>

      <title>Discovery of carbon monoxide emission from five debris disks around young A-type stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16104v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Over the past fifteen years, surveys mainly at millimeter wavelengths have led to the discovery of $\sim$20 gas-bearing debris disks, most of them surrounding young intermediate-mass stars. Exploring the properties and origin of this gas could be fundamental to better understanding the transition between the protoplanetary and debris disk phases, the evolution of icy planetesimal belts, and the formation of planetary atmospheres. To expand the list of known CO-bearing debris disks and to improve our knowledge of the environmental conditions under which they can form, we targeted twelve dust-rich debris disks around young ($&lt;$50 Myr) intermediate-mass stars. Using the ALMA 12-m Array we performed millimeter continuum and CO line observations to search for dust and gas and to measure their quantity and spatial distribution. We discovered CO gas in five disks. Two of them have a low CO content of a few times 10$^{-5}$ M$_\oplus$, similar to that of $\beta$ Pic. The other three disks, however, are CO-rich with $M_\mathrm{CO}&gt;10^{-3}$ M$_\oplus$. By combining our results with those of other studies we concluded, in agreement with previous findings, that the detection rate of CO gas is significantly higher for disks around stars with $6.5~L_\odot&lt;L_*&lt;21.9~L_\odot$ ($\sim$A8$-$A0 spectral type) than for disks around less luminous stars ($0.18~L_\odot&lt;L_*&lt;6.4~L_\odot$, K7$-$A9). A comparison of the measured CO masses and the estimated mass loss rates of solids in disks with low CO content ($&lt;$10$^{-4}$ M$_\oplus$) suggests that collisions may play a role in CO gas production in such systems. Interestingly, however, the estimated mass loss rates of CO-rich debris disks are not higher than those of systems with low CO content. In light of this finding, we speculate on what could lead to the formation of CO-rich debris disks.</description>

      <title>CAPOS: The bulge Cluster APOGEE Survey VI. Characterizing multiple stellar populations and chemical abundances in the bulge globular cluster NGC 6569</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16168v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context. The CAPOS project aims to obtain accurate mean abundances and radial velocities for many elements, and it explores the multiple population (MP) phenomenon in Galactic bulge globular clusters (BGCs). NGC 6569 is one of the CAPOS targets. Aims. This study provides a detailed high-resolution spectroscopic analysis of NGC 6569 to derive precise abundances for elements of different nucleosynthetic origins and to unveil its MPs by focusing on key spectral features. Methods. We analyzed APOGEE-2 near-infrared spectra of 11 giant members with the BACCHUS code, deriving abundances for 12 elements (C, N, O, Mg, Si, Ca, Ti, Fe, Ni, Al, Ce, Nd). Isochrone fitting with Gaia+2MASS photometry was used to estimate atmospheric parameters, cluster distance, and extinction. Results. We obtained [Fe/H] = -0.91 $\pm$ 0.06, consistent with APOGEE pipeline values; the scatter lies within uncertainties. The cluster shows [$\alpha$/Fe] = 0.36 $\pm$ 0.06 dex, similar to other GCs. Al appears homogeneous, while N is strongly enriched ([N/Fe] = 0.68 $\pm$ 0.34) with a spread of 0.90 dex, yielding two populations anticorrelated in C. The n-capture elements Ce and Nd are overabundant compared to the Sun but consistent with GCs of similar metallicity, with $\langle$[Ce/Nd]$\rangle$ = -0.17 $\pm$ 0.12. We also measure RV = -49.75 $\pm$ 3.68 km s$^{-1}$, consistent with previous works, while d$_\odot$ = 12.4 $\pm$ 1.45 kpc and E(B-V) = 0.68 are both higher than literature values. Conclusions. MPs in NGC 6569 are confirmed through a clear C-N anticorrelation. The cluster shows [$\alpha$/Fe] enhancement from Type II SNe and no Mg-Al-Si anticorrelation, suggesting rapid and homogeneous formation. The $\langle$[Ce/Nd]$\rangle$ ratio points to contributions from r-process events such as neutron star mergers, while overall Ce and Nd abundances are reported here for the first time in this cluster.</description>

      <title>Binary-lens Microlensing Degeneracy: Impact on Planetary Sensitivity and Mass-ratio Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16191v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational microlensing is a unique method for discovering cold planets across a broad mass range. Reliable statistics of the microlensing planets require accurate sensitivity estimates. However, the impact of the degeneracies in binary-lens single-source (2L1S) models that affect many actual planet detections is often omitted in sensitivity estimates, leading to potential self-inconsistency of the statistics studies. In this work, we evaluate the effect of the 2L1S degeneracies on planetary sensitivity by simulating a series of typical microlensing events and comprehensively replicating a realistic planet detection pipeline, including the anomaly identification, global 2L1S model search, and degenerate model comparison. We find that for a pure-survey statistical sample, the 2L1S degeneracies reduce the overall planetary sensitivity by $5\sim10\%$, with the effect increasing at higher planet-host mass ratios. This bias leads to an underestimation of planet occurrence rates and a flattening of the inferred mass-ratio function slope. This effect will be critical for upcoming space-based microlensing surveys like the Roman or Earth 2.0 missions, which are expected to discover $\mathcal{O}(10^3)$ planets. We also discuss the computational challenges and propose potential approaches for future applications.</description>

      <title>On the Spatial Distribution of Luminous Blue Variables, B[e] Supergiants, and Wolf-Rayet stars in the Large Magellanic Cloud</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17114v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examine the spatial distributions of LBVs, B[e] supergiants, and W-R stars in the LMC, to clarify their relative ages, evolutionary states, and relationships. This survey employs a reference catalog that was not available for previous work, comprising more than 3900 of the LMC's most luminous stars. Our analysis shows that LBVs, B[e] supergiants, and WR's have spatial distributions like normal stars with the same spectral types and luminosities. Most LBVs are not isolated, nor do they require binary or multiple status to explain their spatial relationship to other populations. There are two likely exceptions: one lower-luminosity LBV and one LBV candidate are relatively isolated and may have velocities that require additional acceleration. The B[e] supergiants are spatially and kinematically more dispersed than LBVs, suggesting that they belong to an older population. The most luminous early-type WN's are most closely associated with the evolved late O-type supergiants. The high luminosity late WNs, and WNh stars however, are highly concentrated in the 30 Dor region which biases the analysis. The less luminous WNs and WCs are associated with a mix of evolved late B, A-type, and yellow supergiants which may be in a post-red-supergiant phase. Spatial distributions of the less luminous WN, WC, and WN3/O3 stars reinforce proposed evolutionary links among those subtypes. Our analysis also demonstrates the importance of using a comprehensive census, with reference populations clearly defined by spectral type and luminosity, and how small number statistics, especially combined with spatial clustering, can invalidate some commonly-cited statistical tests.</description>

      <title>Compression and Reconnection Investigations of the MagnetoPause (CRIMP): A Mission Concept to Uncover the Impact of Mesoscale Reconnection and Plasma Outflow Processes at the Dayside Magnetopause</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09722v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Compression and Reconnection Investigations of the Magnetopause (CRIMP) mission is a Heliophysics Medium-Class Explorer (MIDEX) Announcement of Opportunity (AO) mission concept designed to study mesoscale structures and particle outflow along Earth's magnetopause using two identical spacecraft. CRIMP would uncover the impact of magnetosheath mesoscale drivers, dayside magnetopause mesoscale phenomenological processes and structures, and localized plasma outflows on magnetic reconnection and the energy transfer process in the dayside magnetosphere. CRIMP accomplishes this through uniquely phased spacecraft configurations that allow multipoint, contemporaneous measurements at the magnetopause. This enables an unparalleled look at mesoscale spatial differences along the dayside magnetopause on the scale of 1-3 Earth Radii (Re). Through these measurements, CRMIP will uncover how local mass density enhancements affect global reconnection, how mesoscale structures drive magnetopause dynamics, and if the magnetopause acts as a perfectly absorbing boundary for radiation belt electrons. This allows CRIMP to determine the spatial scale, extent, and temporal evolution of energy and mass transfer processes at the magnetopause - crucial measurements to determine how the solar wind energy input in the magnetosphere is transmitted between regions and across scales. This concept was conceived as a part of the 2024 NASA Heliophysics Mission Design School.</description>

      <title>HST Deep Upper Limits Rule Out a Surviving Massive Binary Companion to the Type Ic Supernova 2012fh</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21027v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Current explanations of the mass-loss mechanism for stripped-envelope supernovae remain divided between single and binary progenitor systems. Here we obtain deep ultraviolet (UV) imaging with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) of the Type Ic SN 2012fh to search for the presence of a surviving companion star to the progenitor. We synthesize these observations with archival HST imaging, ground-based spectroscopy, and previous analyses from the literature to provide three independent constraints on the progenitor system. We fit the color-magnitude diagram of the surrounding population to constrain the most likely age of the system to be $&lt;20$ Myr. Analysis of spectra of SN 2012fh provide an estimate of the He core mass of the progenitor star, $&gt;5.6$ M$_{\odot}$. We analyze deep HST images at the precise location after the SN faded to constrain the luminosity of any remaining main-sequence binary companion to be $\log(L/L_{\odot}) \lesssim 3.35$. Combining observational constraints with current binary population synthesis models excludes the presence of a faint stellar companion to SN 2012fh at the $\lesssim10\%$ level. The progenitor was therefore either effectively isolated at the time of explosion or orbited by a black-hole companion. The latter scenario dominates if we only consider models that produce successful supernovae.</description>
