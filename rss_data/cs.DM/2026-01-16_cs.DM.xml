      <title>On 3-Connected Planar Graphs with Unique Orientable Circuit Double Covers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10171v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A circuit double cover of a bridgeless graph is a collection of even subgraphs such that every edge is contained in exactly two subgraphs of the given collection. Such a circuit double cover describes an embedding of the corresponding graph onto a surface. In this paper, we investigate the well-known Orientable Strong Embedding Conjecture. This conjecture proposes that every bridgeless graph has a circuit double cover describing an embedding on an orientable surface. In a recent paper, we have proved that a 3-connected cubic planar graph G has exactly one orientable circuit double cover if and only if G is the dual graph of an Apollonian network. In this paper, we extend this result by demonstrating that this characterisation applies to any 3-connected planar graph, regardless of whether it is cubic.</description>

      <title>Morse sequences on stacks and flooding sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01384v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper builds upon the framework of \emph{Morse sequences}, a simple and effective approach to discrete Morse theory. A Morse sequence on a simplicial complex consists of a sequence of nested subcomplexes generated by expansions and fillings-two operations originally introduced by Whitehead. Expansions preserve homotopy, while fillings introduce critical simplexes that capture essential topological features. We extend the notion of Morse sequences to \emph{stacks}, which are monotonic functions defined on simplicial complexes, and define \emph{Morse sequences on stacks} as those whose expansions preserve the homotopy of all sublevel sets. This extension leads to a generalization of the fundamental collapse theorem to weighted simplicial complexes. Within this framework, we focus on a refined class of sequences called \emph{flooding sequences}, which exhibit an ordering behavior similar to that of classical watershed algorithms. Although not every Morse sequence on a stack is a flooding sequence, we show that the gradient vector field associated with any Morse sequence can be recovered through a flooding sequence. Finally, we present algorithmic schemes for computing flooding sequences using cosimplicial complexes.</description>

      <title>Pinwheel Scheduling with Real Periods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24068v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a sequence of tasks, each with a positive integer period, the pinwheel scheduling problem involves finding a valid schedule in the sense that the schedule performs one task per day and each task is performed at least once every consecutive days of its period. It had been conjectured by Chan and Chin in 1993 that there exists a valid schedule for any sequence of tasks with density, the sum of the reciprocals of each period, at most $\frac{5}{6}$. Recently, Kawamura settled this conjecture affirmatively. In this paper we consider an extended version with real periods proposed by Kawamura, in which a valid schedule must perform each task $i$ having a real period~$a_{i}$ at least $l$ times in any consecutive $\lceil l a_{i} \rceil$ days for all positive integer $l$. We show that any sequence of tasks such that the periods take three distinct real values and the density is at most $\frac{5}{6}$ admits a valid schedule. We hereby conjecture that the conjecture of Chan and Chin is true also for real periods.</description>

      <title>Reuniting $\chi$-boundedness with polynomial $\chi$-boundedness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.11167v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A class $\mathcal{F}$ of graphs is $\chi$-bounded if there is a function $f$ such that $\chi(H)\le f(\omega(H))$ for all induced subgraphs $H$ of a graph in $\mathcal{F}$. If $f$ can be chosen to be a polynomial, we say that $\mathcal{F}$ is polynomially $\chi$-bounded. Esperet proposed a conjecture that every $\chi$-bounded class of graphs is polynomially $\chi$-bounded. This conjecture has been disproved; it has been shown that there are classes of graphs that are $\chi$-bounded but not polynomially $\chi$-bounded. Nevertheless, inspired by Esperet's conjecture, we introduce Pollyanna classes of graphs. A class $\mathcal{C}$ of graphs is Pollyanna if $\mathcal{C}\cap \mathcal{F}$ is polynomially $\chi$-bounded for every $\chi$-bounded class $\mathcal{F}$ of graphs. We prove that several classes of graphs are Pollyanna and also present some proper classes of graphs that are not Pollyanna.</description>
