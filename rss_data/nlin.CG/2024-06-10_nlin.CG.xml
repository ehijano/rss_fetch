      <title>The Invertibility of Cellular Automata with Menory: Correcting Errors and New Conclusions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05642v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cellular automata with memory (CAM) are widely used in fields such as image processing, pattern recognition, simulation, and cryptography. The invertibility of CAM is generally considered to be chaotic. Paper [Invertible behavior in elementary cellular automata with memory, Juan C. Seck-Tuoh-Mora et al., Information Sciences, 2012] presented necessary and sufficient conditions for the invertibility of elementary CAM, but it contains a critical error: it classifies identity CAM as non-invertible, whereas identity CAM is undoubtedly invertible. By integrating Amoroso's algorithm and cycle graphs, we provide the correct necessary and sufficient conditions for the invertibility of one-dimensional CAM. Additionally, we link CAM to a specific type of cellular automaton that is isomorphic to CAM, behaves identically, and has easily determinable invertibility. This makes it a promising alternative tool for CAM applications.</description>

      <title>Self-Reproduction and Evolution in Cellular Automata: 25 Years after Evoloops</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.03961v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The year of 2024 marks the 25th anniversary of the publication of evoloops, an evolutionary variant of Chris Langton's self-reproducing loops which proved constructively that Darwinian evolution of self-reproducing organisms by variation and natural selection is possible within deterministic cellular automata. Over the last few decades, this line of Artificial Life research has since undergone several important developments. Although it experienced a relative dormancy of activities for a while, the recent rise of interest in open-ended evolution and the success of continuous cellular automata models have brought researchers' attention back to how to make spatio-temporal patterns self-reproduce and evolve within spatially distributed computational media. This article provides a review of the relevant literature on this topic over the past 25 years and highlights the major accomplishments made so far, the challenges being faced, and promising future research directions.</description>
