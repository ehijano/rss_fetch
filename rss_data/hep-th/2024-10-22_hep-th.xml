      <title>Infrared Regularization of Very Special Relativity Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14794v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend the $\tmop{Sim}(2)$ invariant infrared regularization of Very Special Relativity models, that we have proposed recently, to include $\gamma_5$ Dirac matrix. Then, we solve the Very Special Relativity Schwinger model, find the chiral anomaly, and clarify its meaning in the new context. In addition, we show that the triangle anomaly in four space-time dimensions agrees with the same object in standard quantum electrodynamics. Finally, we apply the infrared regularization to compute the large N limit of the Very Special Relativity Gross--Neveu model.</description>

      <title>Hopf link invariants and integrable hierarchies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14823v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The goal of this note is to study integrable properties of a generating function of the HOMFLY-PT invariants of the Hopf link colored with different representations. We demonstrate that such a generating function is a $\tau$-function of the KP hierarchy. Furthermore, this Hopf generating function in the case of composite representations, which is a generating function of the 4-point functions in topological string (corresponding to the resolved conifold with branes on the four external legs), is a $\tau$-function of the universal character(UC) hierarchy put on the topological locus. We also briefly discuss a simple matrix model associated with the UC hierarchy.</description>

      <title>The Hilbert space of de Sitter JT: a case study for canonical methods in quantum gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14824v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study de Sitter JT gravity in the canonical formulation to illustrate constructions of Hilbert spaces in quantum gravity, which is challenging due to the Hamiltonian constraints. The key ideas include representing states as "invariants" (solutions to the Wheeler-DeWitt equation) or dual "co-invariants" (equivalence classes under gauge transformations), defining a physical inner product by group averaging, and relating this to Klein-Gordon inner products via gauge-fixing conditions. We identify a rich Hilbert space with positive-definite inner product which splits into distinct sectors, mirroring a similar structure in the classical phase space. Many (but not all) of these sectors are described exactly (in a constant extrinsic curvature gauge) by a mini-superspace theory, a quantum mechanical theory with a single constraint.</description>

      <title>1/2 BPS Wilson loops in non-conformal N = 2 gauge theories and localization: a three-loop analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the 1/2 BPS circular Wilson loop in four-dimensional SU(N), $N = 2$ SYM theories with massless hypermultiplets and non-vanishing $\beta$-function. Using super-symmetric localization on $S_4$ , we map the path-integral associated with this observable onto an interacting matrix model. Despite the breaking of conformal symmetry at the quantum level, we show that, within a specific regime, the matrix model predictions remain consistent with the perturbative results in flat space up to order $g^6$ . At this order, our analysis reveals that the reorganization of Feynman diagrams based on the matrix model interaction potential, widely tested in (super)conformal models, also applies to these non-conformal set-ups and is realized by interference mechanisms.</description>

      <title>$AdS_3 \times S^3$ Background from Poisson-Lie T-Duality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15053v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We proceed to construct a dual pair for the $AdS_3 \times S^3$ background by applying non-Abelian T-duality (here as Poisson-Lie (PL) T-duality on a semi-Abelian double). By using a certain parametrization of the $4$-dimensional Lie group ${A}_2 \otimes 2{A}_1$ and by a suitable choice of spectator-dependent matrices, the original $\sigma$-model including the $AdS_3 \times S^3$ metric and a non-trivial $B$-field are constructed. The dual background constructed by means of the PL T-duality with the spectators is an asymptotically flat one with a potential black hole interpretation supported by a non-trivial $H$-flux whose metric contains the true singularity with a single horizon. The question of classical integrability of the non-Abelian T-dual $\sigma$-models under consideration is addressed, and their corresponding Lax pairs are found, depending on some spectral parameters. Finally, the conformal invariance conditions of the models are checked up to two-loop order, and it has been concluded that the resulting model is indeed a solution of supergravity.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Higher Spin Symmetries II: Noether Realization in Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15219v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we construct a non-perturbative action of the higher spin symmetry algebra on the gravitational phase space. We introduce a symmetry algebroid $\mathcal{T}$ which allows us to include radiation in an algebraic framework. We show that $\mathcal{T}$ admits a non-linear realization on the asymptotic phase space generated by a Noether charge defined non-perturbatively for all spins. Besides, this Noether charge is conserved in the absence of radiation. Moreover, at non radiative cuts, the algebroid can be restricted to the wedge symmetry algebra studied in ArXiv:2409.12178. The key ingredient for our construction is to consider field and time dependent symmetry parameters constrained to evolve according to equations of motion dual to (a truncation of) the asymptotic Einstein's equations. This result then guarantees that the underlying symmetry algebra is also represented canonically.</description>

      <title>Self-Energy Approximation for the Running Coupling Constant in Thermal $\phi^4$ Theory using Imaginary Time Formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15300v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The running coupling constant is calculated using the imaginary time formalism (ITF) of thermal field theory under the self-energy approximation. In the process, each Feynman diagram in thermal field theory is rewritten as the summation of non-thermal diagrams with coefficients that are functions of mass and temperature. By employing the same mass scale and coupling constant for both the non-thermal QFT and ITF, we derive a relation between them. Also, we calculate the self-energy using ITF, which is equated to the same as that of non-thermal QFT under the zero external momentum limit. This can provide a new expression for the coupling constant. Combining this result with the $\beta(g)$ and $\gamma_m(g)$ function relations of the renormalization group equations gives rise to a thermal-dependent coupling constant and running mass. Using these results, the free energy density is evaluated for two-loop order and compared with quasiparticle model.</description>

      <title>Nonresonant renormalization scheme for twist-$2$ operators in SU($N$) Yang-Mills theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15366v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, the short-distance asymptotics of the generating functional of $n$-point correlators of twist-$2$ operators in SU($N$) Yang-Mills (YM) theory has been worked out in [1]. The above computation relies on a basis change of renormalized twist-$2$ operators, where $-\gamma(g)/ \beta(g)$ reduces to $\gamma_0/ (\beta_0\,g)$ to all orders of perturbation theory, with $\gamma_0$ diagonal, $\gamma(g) = \gamma_0 g^2+\ldots$ the anomalous-dimension matrix and $\beta(g) = -\beta_0 g^3+\ldots$ the beta function. The construction is based on a novel geometric interpretation of operator mixing [2], under the assumption that the eigenvalues of the matrix $\gamma_0/ \beta_0$ satisfy the nonresonant condition $\lambda_i-\lambda_j\neq 2k$, with $\lambda_i$ in nonincreasing order and $k\in \mathbb{N}^+$. The nonresonant condition has been numerically verified up to $i,j=10^4$ in [1]. In the present paper we provide a number theoretic proof of the nonresonant condition for twist-$2$ operators essentially based on the classic result that Harmonic numbers are not integers. Our proof in YM theory can be extended with minor modifications to twist-$2$ operators in $\mathcal{N}=1$ SUSY YM theory, large-$N$ QCD with massless quarks and massless QCD-like theories.</description>

      <title>Spin One Matter Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is shown how spin one vector matter fields can be coupled to a Yang-Mills theory. Such matter fields are defined as belonging to a representation $R$ of the Yang-Mills gauge algebra $\mathfrak{g}$. It is also demanded that these fields together with the original gauge fields be the gauge fields of an embedding total gauge algebra $\mathfrak{g}_{\rm tot}$. The existence of a physically consistent Yang-Mills action for the total algebra is finally required. These conditions are rather restrictive, as shown in some examples: non-trivial solutions may or may not exist depending on the choice of the original algebra $\mathfrak{g}$ and of the representation $R$. The case of the initial algebra $\mathfrak{g}$ = $\mathfrak{u}(1)\oplus\mathfrak{su}(2)$ is treated in more detail.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.15412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We recalculate the force exerted by an antikink on a kink when their overlapping tail fields are close to either a quadratic or quartic minimum of the field theory potential. Our uniform method of calculation exploits the modified Bogomolny equation satisfied by an accelerating kink. This method has been used before in special cases, but is shown here to have broad applicability.</description>

      <title>On-shell Recursion Relations for Tree-level Closed String Amplitudes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15448v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive a general expression for on-shell recursion relations of closed string tree-level amplitudes. Starting with the string amplitudes written in the form of the Koba-Nielsen integral, we apply the BCFW shift to deform them. In contrast to open string amplitudes, where poles are explicitly determined by the integration over vertex positions, we utilize Schwinger's parametrization to handle the pole structure in closed strings. Our analysis reveals that the shifted amplitudes contain $\delta$-function poles, which yield simple poles upon taking residues. This allows us to present a general expression for the on-shell recursion relation for closed strings. Additionally, we offer an alternative method for computing the residue of the shifted amplitudes by factorizing an $n$-point closed string amplitude into two lower-point amplitudes. This is achieved by inserting a completeness relation that includes all possible closed string states in the Fock space. Our results are consistent with those previously obtained.</description>

      <title>Effect of an Expanding Charged Cloud on two-particle Bose-Einstein Correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15525v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In high-energy physics, quantum statistical correlation measurements are very important for getting a good picture of how a particle-emitting source is structured in space and time, as well as its thermodynamic properties and inner dynamics. It is necessary to take into account the various final state effects since they have the potential to alter the observed femtoscopic correlation functions. Protons are affected mostly by the strong interaction, whereas other charged particles are mostly influenced by the Coulomb interaction. The interaction of the particles under investigation with the fireball or the expanding cloud of the other particles in the final state might also have significant consequences. This may cause the particle's trajectory to shift. This phenomenon can be viewed as an Aharonov-Bohm effect since the pair's alternate tracks reveal a closed loop with an internal field. We investigate a numerical solution for a toy model to study the modifications of Bose-Einstien correlation function strength, which is sensitive to this effect</description>

      <title>Mirror symmetry for circle compactified 4d $A_1$ class-$S$ theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15695v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this letter, we propose a 4d mirror symmetry for the class-$\mathcal{S}$ theories which relates the representation theory of the chiral quantization of the Higgs branch and the geometry of the Coulomb branch. We study the representation theory by using the 4d/VOA correspondence, (defect) Schur indices and (flavor) modular differential equations, and match the data with the fixed manifolds of the Hitchin moduli spaces. This correspondence extends the connection between Higgs and Coulomb branch of Argyres-Douglas theories, and can provide systematic guidance for the study of the representation theory of vertex operator algebras by exploiting results from Hitchin systems.</description>

Abstract: Integrating out supersymmetric M2 branes wrapped on two-cycles in Calabi-Yau manifolds is an important calculation: it allows the determination of, and in some ways defines, the free energy of topological strings. In these notes, based on a short course aimed at graduate students, we go through various aspects of this calculation in detail. The end result is a recently proposed new formula for the topological string free energy.</description>

      <title>Swampland Statistics for Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15830v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we approach certain black hole issues, including remnants, by providing a statistical description based on the weak gravity conjecture in the swampland program. Inspired by the Pauli exclusion principal in the context of the Fermi sphere, we derive an inequality which can be exploited to verify the instability manifestation of the black holes via a characteristic function. For several species, we show that this function is in agreement with the weak gravity swampland conjecture. Then, we deal with the cutoff issue as an interval estimation problem by putting an upper bound on the black hole mass scale matching with certain results reported in the literature. Using the developed formalism for the proposed instability scenarios, we provide a suppression mechanism to the remnant production rate. Furthermore, we reconsider the stability study of the Reissner-Nordstrom black holes. Among others, we show that the proposed instabilities prohibit naked singularity behaviors</description>

      <title>Energy-Momentum tensor correlators in $\phi^4$ theory I: The spin-zero sector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16040v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the construction of the renormalized trace $\Theta$ of the Energy-Momentum tensor in the four-dimensional $\lambda\phi^4$ theory,using dimensional regularization in $d=4-\ve$ dimensions. We first construct several basic correlators such as $\braket{\phi^2 \phi\phi}$, $\braket{\phi^4 \phi \phi}$ to order $\lambda^2$ and from these the correlators $\braket{K_I \phi \phi}$ and $\braket{K_I K_J}$ with $K_I$ the basis of dimension $d$ operators. We then match the limit of their expressions on the Wilson-Fisher fixed point to the corresponding expressions obtained in Conformal Field Theory. Then, using the 3-point function $\braket{\Theta\phi\phi}$, we construct the operator $\Theta$ as a certain linear combination of the basis operators, using the requirements that $\Theta$ should vanish on the fixed point and that it should have zero anomalous dimension. Finally, we compute the 2-point function $\braket{\Theta\Theta}$ and we show that it obeys an eigenvalue equation that gives additional information about the internal structure of the Energy-Momentum tensor operator to what is already contained in its Callan-Symanzik equation.</description>

      <title>Direct derivation of gauged $\mathcal N=1$ supergravity in ten dimensions to all orders in fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16046v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It has been known for some time that generalised geometry provides a particularly elegant rewriting of the action and symmetries of 10-dimensional supergravity theories, up to the lowest nontrivial order in fermions. By exhibiting the full symmetry calculations in the second-order formalism, we show in the $\mathcal N=1$ case that this analysis can be upgraded to all orders in fermions and we obtain a strikingly simple form of the action as well as of the supersymmetry transformations, featuring overall only five higher-fermionic terms. Surprisingly, even after expressing the action in terms of classical (non-generalised geometric) variables one obtains a simplification of the usual formulae. This in particular confirms that generalised geometry provides the natural set of variables for studying (the massless level of) string theory. We also show how this new reformulation implies the compatibility of the Poisson-Lie T-duality with the equations of motion of the full supergravity theory.</description>

      <title>Holographic Weyl Anomaly in 8d from General Higher Curvature Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We calculate the holographic central charges for general higher curvature gravity theory dual to eight dimensional CFT. To do this, we first elaborate the general form of Weyl anomaly in 8d CFT and find 11 non-trivial linearly independent curvature combinations, one of which is Euler density and the rest are Weyl invariants, including 7 non-differentiated ones and 3 differentiated ones. The Weyl invariants are constructed as invariant polynomials of curvature tensor and covariant derivatives. We denote $W_{(n)}$ as the Weyl invariant that contains a polynormial term with a minimum of $n$ curvature tensors. Interestingly, since there are a total of 12 Weyl invariants in 8d, our finding means two of them are trivial and expressible as total derivatives. The resulting central charges are expressed in terms of 15 theory-dependent constants. Remarkably, we find that the $W_{(2)}$ invariant corresponds to the $c$-charge that is proportional to $C_T$, while the two $W_{(3)}$'s are related to three-point function parameters of energy-momentum tensor. This suggests a possible connection between the $c$-charges of $W_{(n)}$'s and the $n$-point functions of energy-momentum tensor.</description>

      <title>Holographic dictionary for Lifshitz and hyperscaling violating black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a novel holographic dictionary for the thermodynamics of black holes with Lifshitz and hyperscaling violating asymptotics, generalizing the dictionary for Anti-de Sitter black holes. Using our dictionary we show that the holographic Euler equation is dual to a generalized Smarr formula for these black holes, and we find a precise match between the extended bulk and boundary first law. Notably, the dictionary for the central charge appearing in the Euler relation depends on the hyperscaling violating parameter, but not on the Lifshitz dynamical exponent.</description>

      <title>Deformation of Matrix Geometry via Landau Level Evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a scheme for the construction of deformed matrix geometries using Landau models. The level projection method cannot be applied straightforwardly to extract matrix geometries to the Landau models on deformed manifolds, as they do not generally exhibit degenerate energy levels (Landau levels). We overcome this problem by exploiting the idea of spectral flow. Taking a symmetric matrix geometry as a reference point of the spectral flow, we evolve the matrix geometry by deforming the Landau model. In this process, unitarity is automatically preserved. The explicit matrix realization of the coordinates is derived straightforwardly even for a non-perturbative deformation. We clarify the basic properties of the matrix geometries through the analysis of concrete models. The matrix geometries of an expanding two-sphere and ellipsoids are investigated using the non-relativistic and relativistic Landau models. The obtained ellipsoidal matrix geometries show behavior quantitatively different in each Landau level, but qualitatively similar to their classical counterpart. The difference between the ellipsoidal matrix geometry and the fuzzy ellipsoid is investigated numerically.</description>

      <title>IR finite correlation functions in de Sitter space, a smooth massless limit, and an autonomous equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore two-point and four-point correlation functions of a massive scalar field on the flat de Sitter background in the long-wavelength approximation. By employing the Yang-Feldman-type equation, we compute the two-point correlation function up to the three-loop level and the four-point correlation function up to the two-loop one. In contrast to the standard theory of a massive scalar field based on the de Sitter-invariant vacuum, we develop the vacuum-independent reasoning that may not possess de Sitter invariance but results in a smooth massless limit of the correlation function's infrared part. Our elaboration affords to calculate correlation functions of a free massive scalar field and to proceed with quantum corrections, relying only on the known two-point correlation function's infrared part of a free massless one. Remarkably, the two-point correlation function of a free massive scalar field coincides with the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck stochastic process's one and has a clear physical interpretation. We compared our results with those obtained with the Schwinger-Keldysh diagrammatic technique, Starobinsky's stochastic approach, and the Hartree-Fock approximation. At last, we have constructed a renormalization group-inspired autonomous equation for the two-point correlation function. Integrating its approximate version, one obtains the non-analytic expression with respect to a self-interaction coupling constant $\lambda$. That solution reproduces the correct perturbative series up to the two-loop level. At the late-time limit, it almost coincides with the result of Starobinsky's stochastic approach in the whole interval of a new dimensionless parameter $0 \leq \tfrac{\pi^2 m^4}{3\lambda H^4} &lt; \infty$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.16228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this short paper we want to generalize some recent concepts related to stubs in open string field theory. First, we modify the auxiliary field method by Erbin and Firat [#Erbin2023] to non-BPZ even sliver frame stubs. We then also show that the construction is consistent at the full quantum level without any additional assumptions. Finally, we apply the method explicitly to the tachyon vacuum and the simplest identity-like solution.</description>

      <title>An upper limit to the lifetime of stellar remnants from gravitational pair production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14734v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Black holes are assumed to decay via Hawking radiation. Recently we found evidence that spacetime curvature alone without the need for an event horizon leads to black hole evaporation. Here we investigate the evaporation rate and decay time of a non-rotating star of constant density due to spacetime curvature-induced pair production and apply this to compact stellar remnants such as neutron stars and white dwarfs. We calculate the creation of virtual pairs of massless scalar particles in spherically symmetric asymptotically flat curved spacetimes. This calculation is based on covariant perturbation theory with the quantum field representing, e.g.,\ gravitons or photons. We find that in this picture the evaporation timescale, $\tau$, of massive objects scales with the average mass density, $\rho$, as $\tau\propto\rho^{-3/2}$. The maximum age of neutron stars, $\tau\sim 10^{68}\,\text{yr}$, is comparable to that of low-mass stellar black holes. White dwarfs, supermassive black holes, and dark matter supercluster halos evaporate on longer, but also finite timescales. Neutron stars and white dwarfs decay similarly to black holes, ending in an explosive event when they become unstable. This sets a general upper limit for the lifetime of matter in the universe, which is much longer than the Hubble--Lema\^itre time. Primordial objects with densities above $\rho_\text{max} \approx 3\times 10^{53}\,\text{g/}\text{cm}^3$, however, should have dissolved by now. As a consequence, fossil remnants from a previous universe could be present in our current universe only if the recurrence time of star forming universes is smaller than about $\sim 10^{68}\,\text{years}$.</description>

      <title>Algebraic Approaches to Cosmological Integrals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.14757v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cosmological correlators encode statistical properties of the initial conditions of our universe. Mathematically, they can often be written as Mellin integrals of a certain rational function associated to graphs, namely the flat space wavefunction. The singularities of these cosmological integrals are parameterized by binary hyperplane arrangements. Using different algebraic tools, we shed light on the differential and difference equations satisfied by these integrals. Moreover, we study a multivariate version of partial fractioning of the flat space wavefunction, and propose a graph-based algorithm to compute this decomposition.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.14801v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Massive scalar fields are promising candidates to address many unresolved problems in fundamental physics. We report the first model-agnostic Bayesian search of massive scalar fields in LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA gravitational-wave data. We find no evidence for such fields and place the most stringent upper limits on their coupling for scalar masses $\lesssim 2\times10^{-12}\,{\rm eV}$. We exemplify the strength of these bounds by applying them to massive scalar-Gauss-Bonnet gravity, finding the tightest constraints on the coupling constant to date, $\sqrt{\alpha_{\rm GB}}\lesssim 1\,{\rm km}$ for scalar masses $\lesssim 10^{-13}\,{\rm eV}$ to 90% confidence.</description>

      <title>Degrees of Freedom of New General Relativity: Type 2, Type 3, Type 5, and Type 8</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15056v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the degrees of freedom of new general relativity. This theory is a three-parameter theory and is classified into nine irreducible types according to the rotation symmetry of $SO(3)$ on each leaf of ADM-foliation. In this work, we focus on unveiling the degrees of freedom of the physically interesting types of NGR: Type 2, Type 3, Type 5, and Type 8, which contain the gravitational propagating degrees of freedom. First, we revisit the theory based on the gauge approach to gravity and reformulate the Lagrangian of the theory. Second, we review the irreducible decomposition of the theory while focusing on the Hamiltonian and the primary constraints in each type. Third, we perform the Dirac-Bergmann analysis to unveil the degrees of freedom of the theory in the case of Type 2, Type 3, Type 5, and Type 8. We find a novel new behavior of constraints in Type 8, which is classified as second-class but not to determine any Lagrange multipliers and to provide the gauge invariance of the theory under the satisfaction of a specific condition of the multipliers. The degrees of freedom of Type 2, Type 3, and Type 5 are unveiled as six, five, and seven, respectively. The degrees of freedom of Type 8 is either four under a specific condition to the Lagrange multipliers or six in the generic case. Finally, we conclude this work with several future perspectives.</description>

      <title>Elastic scattering of electron by a Yukawa potential in non-commutative spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15220v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the elastic scattering of an electron by a Yukawa potential within the framework of non-commutative (NC) geometry. We first derive the NC correction to the Yukawa potential at leading order in the NC parameter, resulting in a modified potential resembling a screened Kratzer potential. This potential reduces to the standard Kratzer form when considering the NC correction to the Coulomb potential. Subsequently, we calculate the NC correction to the electron scattering amplitude using the first-order Born approximation. We then analyze the effects of NC geometry on both the differential and total cross sections for elastic scattering. Our results indicate that non-commutativity enhances the differential cross section at small scattering angles and naturally gives rise to a Kratzer-like potential, reflecting the quantum nature of spacetime. Additionally, we establish a direct relationship between the system's energy level and the bound on the NC parameter. Specifically, for an ultra-relativistic incident electron scattering by a heavy molecule, we derive a new lower bound on $\Theta$ of the order of $10^{-28}\,\text{m}$.</description>

      <title>The Maximal Gravitational Wave Signal from Asteroid-Mass Primordial Black Hole Mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15400v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Primordial black holes can be the entirety of the dark matter in a broad, approximately five-orders-of-magnitude-wide mass range, the ``asteroid mass range'', between $10^{-16}\ M_{\rm Sun}$ -- where constraints originate from evaporation -- and $10^{-11}\ M_{\rm Sun}$ -- from microlensing. A direct detection in this mass range is very challenging with any known observational or experimental methods. Here we point out that, unlike previously asserted in the literature, a transient gravitational wave signal from the inspiral phase of light black hole mergers is in principle detectable with current and future high-frequency gravitational wave detectors, including but not limited to ADMX. The largest detection rates are associated with binaries from non-monochromatic mass functions in early-formed three-body systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.15904v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we study the Oppenheimer-Snyder (OS) gravitational collapse in the general framework of scale-dependent gravity. We explore the collapse in spherically symmetric solutions suggested both by asymptotically safe gravity (positive $\om$-parameter) and by scale-dependent gravity (negative $\om$-parameter), when a singularity at a finite positive radial coordinate is developed. The inner geometry of the collapsing star is described, as usual, by the spatially flat Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) metric, and matter is uniformly distributed without any assumptions about its equation of state. The outer asymptotically-safe/scale-dependent black hole metric is smoothly matched to the inner geometry, and this yields the equation of motion of the star surface, the energy density, pressure, and equation of state of the collapsing matter. We study in detail the proper-time evolution of the event and apparent horizons. Finally, the constraints of the energy conditions on the equation of state, and its properties, are considered and discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.16210v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the massive gauge field within spacetime context from a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ quotient of the constant curvature black hole. We investigate how the matter field's back reaction affects the spacetime geometry, considering perturbations in the metric up to the first order. The stress-energy tensor's expectation value can be precisely calculated by evaluating its pull-back onto the covering space. By appropriately selecting boundary conditions for the massive vector field along a non-contractible cycle of the quotient manifold, achieving a negative average energy along a null geodesic becomes feasible, enabling a traversable wormhole.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.16264v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study spherical evolution in scalar-Gauss-Bonnet gravity with additional Ricci coupling and use the gauge-invariant approach of Ref.~\cite{Reall:2021voz} to track well-posedness. Our results show that loss of hyperbolicity when it occurs, is due to the behaviour of physical degrees of freedom. They provide further support to the idea that this behaviour can be tamed by additional interactions of scalar. We also point out a limitation of this gauge-invariant approach: the fact that field redefinitions can change the character of the evolution equations.</description>

      <title>Multiparticle scalar dark matter with $\mathbb{Z}_N$ symmetry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.16275v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: More than one dark sector particle transforming under the same symmetry provides one stable dark matter (DM) component which undergoes co-annihilation with the heavier particle(s) decaying to DM. Specific assumptions on the kinematics and on the coupling parameters may render the heavier component(s) stable and contribute as DM. The choices of the charges of the dark sector fields under transformation play a crucial role in the resultant phenomenology. In this paper, we systematically address the possibility of obtaining two scalar DM components under $\mathbb{Z}_N$ symmetry. We consider both the possibilities of DM being weakly interacting massive particle (WIMP) or pseudofeebly interacting massive particle (pFIMP). We elaborate upon $\mathbb{Z}_3$ symmetric model, confronting the relic density allowed parameter space with recent most direct and indirect search bounds and prospects. We also highlight the possible distinction of the allowed parameter space in single component and two component cases, as well as between WIMP-WIMP and WIMP-pFIMP scenarios.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2006.09777v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This is a review of exceptional field theory: a generalisation of Kaluza-Klein theory that unifies the metric and $p$-form gauge field degrees of freedom of supergravity into a generalised or extended geometry, whose additional coordinates may be viewed as conjugate to brane winding modes. This unifies the maximal supergravities, treating their previously-hidden exceptional Lie symmetries as a fundamental geometric symmetry. Duality orbits of solutions simplify into single objects, that in many cases have simple geometric interpretations, for instance as wave or monopole-type solutions. It also provides a route to explore exotic or non-geometric aspects of M-theory, such as exotic branes, U-folds, and more novel sorts of non-Riemannian spaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2301.13182v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There are various reasons why adding stubs to the vertices of open string field theory (OSFT) is interesting: Not only the stubs can tame certain singularities and make the theory more well-behaved, but also the new theory shares a lot of similarities with closed string field theory, which helps to improve our understanding of its structure and possible solutions. In this paper we explore two natural ways of implementing stubs into the framework of OSFT, resulting in an A-infinity-algebra giving rise to infinitely many vertices. We find two distinct consistent actions, both generated by a field redefinition, interestingly sharing the same equations of motion. In the last section we illustrate their relationship and physical meaning by applying our construction to nearly marginal solutions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.13069v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate thick-brane solutions within the five-dimensional bumblebee gravity in the presence of a real scalar field. Specifically, we implement the Lorentz symmetry breaking scenario within this context and obtain brane-like structures. Since the contribution of the bumblebee field is expected to be weak, we solve the field equations in the small-parameter regime. In this situation, we develop a first-order framework to describe the brane. The results show that the function which drives the bumblebee field may engender a lumplike structure whose shape depends on the parameters. On one hand, the effect of the non-minimal coupling, controlled by $\xi$, between the bumblebee field and gravity shifts the field from the vacuum expectation value. On the other hand, the aether parameter, $\beta$, is responsible for modifying the solution inside the brane.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.02525v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a new family of IR dualities in three space-time dimensions with eight supercharges. In contrast to 3d mirror symmetry, these dualities map Coulomb branches to Coulomb branches and Higgs branches to Higgs branches in the deep IR. For a large class of quiver gauge theories with an emergent Coulomb branch global symmetry, one can construct a sequence of such dualities by step-wise implementing a set of quiver mutations. The duality sequence gives a set of quiver gauge theories which flow to the same IR fixed point - a phenomenon we refer to as IR N-ality. We show that this set of N-al quivers always contains a theory for which the rank of the IR Coulomb branch symmetry is manifest in the UV. For a special subclass of theories, the emergent symmetry algebra itself can be read off from the quiver description of the aforementioned theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.03577v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the low-energy limit, the near region of a generic Kerr black hole has been conjectured to be holographically dual to a two-dimensional conformal field theory. In this paper, we consider a test object orbiting in the near region of a nonextremal Kerr black hole. We first couple it to a massless scalar field. The resulting scalar radiation at the horizon is computed from the perspectives of gravity and dual conformal field theory. Considering the influence of nonzero temperature, the agreement of both computations is found. Then, we generalize the analysis to the gravitational radiation and find agreement again. The agreement supports the conjectured holography and provides a potential theoretical tool for gravitational wave computations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.13145v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study axion-photon couplings in compactifications of type IIB string theory. We find that these couplings are systematically suppressed compared to the inverse axion periodicity, as a result of two effects. First, couplings to the QED theta angle are suppressed for axion mass eigenstates that are light compared to the mass scale set by stringy instantons on the cycle supporting QED. Second, in compactifications with many axions the intersection matrix is sparse, making kinetic mixing weak. We study the resulting phenomenology in an ensemble of $200{,}000$ toy models constructed from the Kreuzer-Skarke database up to the maximum Hodge number $h^{1,1}=491$. We examine freeze-in production and decay of thermal axions, birefringence of the cosmic microwave background, X-ray spectrum oscillations, and constraints on the QCD axion from supernovae. We conclude that compactifications in this corner of the landscape involve many invisible axions, as well as a handful that may be detectable via photon couplings.</description>

      <title>Metric Flows with Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.19870v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a general theory of flows in the space of Riemannian metrics induced by neural network gradient descent. This is motivated in part by recent advances in approximating Calabi-Yau metrics with neural networks and is enabled by recent advances in understanding flows in the space of neural networks. We derive the corresponding metric flow equations, which are governed by a metric neural tangent kernel, a complicated, non-local object that evolves in time. However, many architectures admit an infinite-width limit in which the kernel becomes fixed and the dynamics simplify. Additional assumptions can induce locality in the flow, which allows for the realization of Perelman's formulation of Ricci flow that was used to resolve the 3d Poincar\'e conjecture. We demonstrate that such fixed kernel regimes lead to poor learning of numerical Calabi-Yau metrics, as is expected since the associated neural networks do not learn features. Conversely, we demonstrate that well-learned numerical metrics at finite-width exhibit an evolving metric-NTK, associated with feature learning. Our theory of neural network metric flows therefore explains why neural networks are better at learning Calabi-Yau metrics than fixed kernel methods, such as the Ricci flow.</description>

Abstract: Field transformations for the quantum effective action lead to different pictures of a given physical situation, as describing a given evolution of the universe by different geometries. Field transformations for functional flow equations can reveal important physical features, as the appearance of bound states. They also allow for technical simplifications. We make a critical assessment of the virtues and shortcomings of different versions of field transformations. Key issues are demonstrated by the quantum field theory for scalars with a field-dependent coefficient of the kinetic term. Our findings confirm the principle of field relativity for gravity and cosmology based on the quantum effective action.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.15003v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rigorous conditions to obtain sensible predictions in non (proper) renormalizable Quantum Field Theories were derived a long time ago, most notably in the works of Steven Weinberg. In this paper we explicitly illustrate the challenges met in carrying this program within the Affine Gravity framework, in particular when attempting to pinpoint viable particle propagation. We explore the one-loop structure of some ghost and tachyon-free vector theories to illustrate the role of structural constraints in their interactions, even in the absence of gauge symmetries. Despite the presence of soft-breaking terms, we show how hopes of casting a vector model within the predictive frame of effective field methods hinges on adopting a gauge-like treatment of their interactions.</description>

      <title>Gravity-Induced Photon Interactions and Infrared Consistency in any Dimensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07254v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compute the four-photon ($F^4$) operators generated by loops of charged particles of spin $0$, $\frac{1}{2}$, $1$ in the presence of gravity and in any spacetime dimension $d$. To this end, we expand the one-loop effective action via the heat kernel coefficients, which provide both the gravity-induced renormalization of the $F^4$ operators and the low-energy Einstein-Maxwell effective field theory (EFT) produced by massive charged particles. We set positivity bounds on the $F^4$ operators using standard arguments from extremal black holes (for $d\geq 4$) and from infrared (IR) consistency of four-photon scattering (for $d\geq 3$). In the latter we assume that the graviton $t$-channel pole may be discarded, an assumption supported by the near equivalence with the black hole bound for any $d\geq 4$. Reduction of the operator basis is achieved using that the Gauss-Bonnet combination vanishes at quadratic order for any $d$. The positivity bounds constrain the charge-to-mass ratio of the heavy particles. If the Planckian $F^4$ operators are sufficiently small or negative, such bounds produce a version of the $d$-dimensional Weak Gravity Conjecture (WGC) in most but not all dimensions. In $d=9,10$, it turns out that the WGC fails to imply extremal black hole decay in the infrared EFT, making mandatory the existence of sufficiently large Planckian $F^4$ operators. In the special case of $d=6$, we find that the gravity-induced beta functions of $F^4$ operators from charged particles of any spin are positive. This implies that, surprisingly, the EFT of massless charged particles is apparently infrared-inconsistent in $d=6$. In the massive $d=6$ case, consistency is restored by WGC-like bounds that are logarithmically enhanced.</description>

Abstract: The perturbative LARGE volume scenario (LVS) is a promising moduli stabilisation scheme in which the overall volume modulus of the compactifying Calabi-Yau (CY) threefold is dynamically stabilised to exponentially large values via using only perturbative corrections. In this article, using an orientifold of a K3-fibred CY threefold, we present the global embedding of an inflationary model proposed in the framework of perturbative LVS, in which the overall volume modulus acts as the inflaton field rolling on a nearly flat potential induced by a combination of the ${\alpha^\prime}^3$-corrections and the so-called {\it log-loop} effects. Given that having a concrete global construction facilitates explicit expressions for a set of sub-leading corrections, as a next step, we present a detailed analysis investigating the robustness of the single-field inflationary model against such corrections, in particular those arising from the winding-type string loop corrections and the higher derivative F$^4$-corrections.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08504v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the combined effects of spatial curvature and topology on the properties of the vacuum state for a charged scalar field localized on rotationally symmetric 2D curved tubes. For a general spatial geometry and for quasiperiodicity condition with a general phase, the representation of the Hadamard function is provided where the topological contribution is explicitly extracted. As an important local characteristic of the vacuum state the expectation value of the current density is studied. The vacuum current is a periodic function of the magnetic flux enclosed by the tube with the period of flux quantum. The general formula is specified for constant radius and conical tubes. As another application, we consider the Hadamard function and the vacuum current density for a scalar field on the Beltrami pseudosphere. Several representations are provided for the corresponding expectation value. For small values of the proper radius of the tube, compared with the curvature radius, the effect of spatial curvature on the vacuum current is weak and the leading term in the corresponding expansion coincides with the current density on a constant radius tube. The effect of curvature is essential for proper radii of the tube larger than the radius of spatial curvature. In this limit the fall-off of the current density, as a function of the proper radius, follows a power-law for both massless and massive fields. This behavior is in clear contrast to the one for a constant radius tube with exponential decay for massive fields. We also compare the vacuum currents on the Beltrami pseudosphere and on locally de Sitter and anti-de Sitter 2D tubes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15588v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We obtain the off-shell nilpotent Becchi-Rouet-Stora-Tyutin (BRST) and anti-BRST symmetry transformations (corresponding to the infinitesimal classical gauge symmetry transformations) for the modified massive three $(2+1)$-dimensional (3D) Abelian 2-form gauge theory with a single pseudo-scalar field. The latter field (having the negative kinetic term and a well-defined mass) has already been shown (i) to exist in the modified version of the standard 3D St${\ddot u}$ckelberg formalism (on the solid mathematical grounds), (ii) to be a possible candidate for the ``phantom" field of some of the cosmological models of the Universe, and (iii) to be a possible candidate for dark matter. A couple of highlights of our present endeavor are (i) the observation that, even though the pseudo-scalar field does not transform under the gauge and (anti-)BRST symmetry transformations, it appears in the first-class constraints which annihilate the physical states at the quantum level, and (ii) the Noether conserved (anti-)BRST charges are found to be non-nilpotent. In our present investigation, we derive (i) the coupled (but equivalent) BRST and anti-BRST invariant Lagrangian densities, (ii) the conserved and off-shell nilpotent versions of the (anti-)BRST charges and the conserved ghost charge, (iii) the (anti-)BRST invariant Curci-Ferrari (CF) type restrictions, and (iv) the standard BRST algebra amongst the conserved and nilpotent (anti-)BRST charges and conserved ghost charge of our theory.</description>

Abstract: We present a global embedding of the Fibre inflation model in perturbative large volume scenario (LVS) in which the inflationary potential is induced via a combination of string-loop corrections and higher derivative F$^4$-effects. The minimal Fibre inflation model developed in the standard LVS generically faces some strong bounds on the inflaton field range arising from the K\"ahler cone constraints, which subsequently creates a challenge for realising the cosmological observables while consistently respecting the underlying supergravity approximations. The main attractive feature of this proposal is to naturally alleviate this issue by embedding Fibre inflation in perturbative LVS.</description>

      <title>Soft Limits of Gluon and Graviton Correlators in Anti-de Sitter Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16052v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive formulae for the soft limit of tree-level gluon and graviton correlators in Anti-de Sitter space, which arise from Feynman diagrams encoding the Weinberg soft theorems in flat space. Other types of diagrams can also contribute to the soft limit at leading order in the soft momentum, but have a different pole structure. We derive these results at four points using explicit formulae recently obtained from the cosmological bootstrap and double copy, and extend them to any multiplicity using bootstrap techniques in Mellin-momentum space.</description>

      <title>Exact Results for Scaling Dimensions of Neutral Operators in scalar CFTs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01414v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We determine the scaling dimension $\Delta_n$ for the class of composite operators $\phi^n$ in the $\lambda \phi^4$ theory in $d=4-\epsilon$ taking the double scaling limit $n\rightarrow \infty$ and $\lambda \rightarrow 0$ with fixed $\lambda n$ via a semiclassical approach. Our results resum the leading power of $n$ at any loop order. In the small $\lambda n$ regime we reproduce the known diagrammatic results and predict the infinite series of higher-order terms. For intermediate values of $\lambda n$ we find that $\Delta_n/n$ increases monotonically approaching a $(\lambda n)^{1/3}$ behavior in the $\lambda n \to \infty$ limit. We further generalize our results to neutral operators in the $\phi^4$ in $d=4-\epsilon$, $\phi^3$ in $d=6-\epsilon$, and $\phi^6$ in $d=3-\epsilon$ theories with $O(N)$ symmetry.</description>

      <title>Correlation Functions and Trace Anomalies in Weakly Relevant Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16825v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study abstract weakly relevant flows in a general number of dimensions. They arguably provide the simplest example of renormalization group (RG) flows between two non-trivial fixed points. We compute several two-point correlation functions in position space valid along the whole RG flow. This is done by using conformal perturbation theory together with the solution of the Callan-Symanzik equation. From the explicit expressions of the two-point functions of conserved currents and the stress-tensor we extract the change in the central charges between the UV and IR fixed points. This immediately gives us $\Delta c$, the change of the $c-$trace anomaly between the UV and IR fixed points in 4d. We also discuss three-point functions.
  We couple weakly relevant flows to non-dynamical dilaton and graviton background fields in 4d. We compute the three-dilaton vertex in terms of the scalar two-point function and extract the value of $\Delta a$, the change of the $a$-trace anomaly between the UV and IR fixed points. We also compute the graviton-graviton-dilaton vertex in terms of the three-point function of two stress-tensors and a scalar, and extract the value of $\Delta c$.
  The $\Delta c$ values obtained with the two different methods agree.</description>

      <title>Dissipation in the $1/D$ expansion for planar matrix models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05981v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the thermal behavior of a large number of matrix degrees of freedom in the planar limit. We work in $0+1$ dimensions, with $D$ matrices, and use $1/D$ as an expansion parameter. This can be thought of as a non-commutative large-$D$ vector model, with two independent quartic couplings for the two different orderings of the matrices. We compute a thermal two-point correlator to ${\cal O}(1/D)$ and find that the degeneracy present at large $D$ is lifted, with energy levels split by an amount $\sim 1/\sqrt{D}$. This implies a timescale for thermal dissipation $\sim \sqrt{D}$. At high temperatures dissipation is predominantly due to one of the two quartic couplings.</description>

Abstract: We study the symmetry properties of infinite spin fields in $\rm{AdS}_4$ space which are involved in the Lagrangian model proposed in arXiv:2403.14446 where the main role is played by operator constraints. It is shown that the conditions defining infinite spin states in $\rm{AdS}_4$ space are $\mathrm{SO}(2,3)$-invariant. It is found that in the model under consideration the Casimir operators are completely fixed by the constraint operators and only one of the Casimir operators is independent. It is shown that in this model, infinite spin fields in $\rm{AdS}_4$ space are described by the most degenerate representations of the $\mathrm{SO}(2,3)$ group.</description>

      <title>Horizon causality from holographic scattering in asymptotically dS$_3$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.09050v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the AdS/CFT correspondence, direct scattering in the bulk may not have a local boundary analog. A nonlocal implementation on the boundary requires $O(1/G_N)$ mutual information. This statement is formalized by the connected wedge theorem, which can be proven using general relativity within AdS$_3$ but also by applying quantum information theory on the boundary, suggesting that the theorem applies to any holographic duality. We examine scattering within the static patch of asymptotically dS$_3$ spacetime, which is conjectured to be described by a quantum theory on the stretched horizon in static patch holography. We prove that causality on the horizon should be induced from null infinities $\mathcal{I}^{\pm}$ to maintain consistency with the theorem. Specifically, signals propagating in the static patch are associated with local operators at $\mathcal{I}^{\pm}$. Our results suggest a novel connection between static patch holography and the dS/CFT correspondence.</description>

      <title>Web of Four-Dimensional Dualities and Symmetry Topological Field Theories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10036v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study $\mathbb{Z}_N$ one-form center symmetries in four-dimensional gauge theories using the symmetry topological field theory (SymTFT). In this context, the associated TFT in the five-dimensional bulk is the BF model. We revisit its canonical quantization and construct topological boundary states on several important classes of four manifolds that are spin, non-spin and torsional. We highlight a web of four-dimensional dualities, which can be naturally interpreted within the SymTFT framework. We also point out an intriguing class of four-dimensional gauge theories that exhibit mixed 't Hooft anomaly between one-form symmetries. In the second part of this work, we extend the SymTFT to account for various quantities protected by supersymmetry (SUSY) in SUSY gauge theories. We proposed that their behaviour under various symmetry operations are entirely captured by the topological boundary of the SymTFT, resulting in strong constraints. Concrete examples are considered, including the Witten index, the lens space index and the Donaldson-Witten and Vafa-Witten partition functions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.11618v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a reducible ${\cal N}=4$, $d=1$ multiplet described by a real superfield as a coupling of the mirror ${\bf (1, 4, 3)}$ and ordinary ${\bf (3, 4, 1)}$ multiplets. Employing this so-called "long multiplet", we construct a coupled system of dynamical and semi-dynamical multiplets. We show that the corresponding {\it on-shell} model reproduces the model of Fedoruk, Ivanov and Lechtenfeld presented in 2012. Furthermore, there is a hidden supersymmetry acting on the long multiplet that extends the full world-line supersymmetry to SU(2$|$2). In other words, the ${\cal N}=4$ long multiplet can be derived from an irreducible SU(2$|$2) multiplet.</description>

      <title>Recursions and ODEs for the correlators in integrable systems and random matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.14904v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An integrable system is often formulated as a flat connection, satisfying a Lax equation. It is given in terms of compatible systems having a common solution called the ``wave function" $\Psi$ living in a Lie group $G$, which satisfies some differential equations with rational coefficients. From this wave function, it is usual to define a sequence of ``correlators" $W_n$, that play an important role in many applications in mathematical physics. Here, we show how to systematically obtain ordinary differential equations (ODE) and recursion relations with polynomial coefficients for the correlators.
  An application is random matrix theory, where the wave functions are the expectation value of the characteristic polynomial, they form a family of orthogonal polynomials, and are known to satisfy an integrable system. The correlators are then the correlation functions of resolvents or of eigenvalue densities. We give the ODE and recursion on the matrix size that they satisfy. In addition, we discuss generic Fuchsian systems, namely, Schlesinger systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.14926v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We have investigated the modular binary octahedral group $2O$ as a flavor symmetry to explain the structure of Standard Model. The vector-valued modular forms in all irreducible representations of this group are constructed. We have classified all possible fermion masses models based on the modular binary octahedral group $2O$. A comprehensive numerical analysis is performed, and we present some benchmark quark/lepton masses models in well agreement with the experimental data. Notably we find a minimal modular invariant model for leptons and quarks, which is able to explain simultaneously the masses and mixing parameters of both quarks and leptons in terms of 14 real free parameters including the modulus $\tau$. The fermion mass hierarchies around the vicinity of the modular fixed points are explored.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.11938v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study, we present a novel extension to the Klinkhamer vacuum-defect model by incorporating a fifth spatial dimension. This modification results in the formulation of a comprehensive five-dimensional wormhole space-time. Crucially, this extension preserves its classification as a vacuum solution to the field equations, thereby automatically satisfying all energy conditions. We demonstrate that this five-dimensional vacuum-defect space-time can be expressed in a pure canonical form, and thus, locally reduces to five-dimensional Minkowski space. Finally, we explore the geodesic equations in the vicinity of this five-dimensional vacuum-defect wormhole, offering insights into its intriguing properties.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.07971v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For neutron stars, there exist universal relations insensitive to the equation of states, the so called I-Love-Q relations, which show the connections among the moment of inertia, tidal Love number and quadrupole moment. In this paper, we show that these relations also apply to dark stars, bosonic or fermionic. The relations can be extended to higher ranges of the variables, clarifying the deviations for dark stars in the literature, as those curves all approximate the ones generated by a polytropic equation of state, when taking the low density (pressure) limit. Besides, we find that for equation of states with scaling symmetries, the I-Love-Q curves do not change when adjusting the scaling parameters.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.15200v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We define predictive states and predictive complexity for quantum systems composed of distinct subsystems. This complexity is a generalization of entanglement entropy. It is inspired by the statistical or forecasting complexity of predictive state analysis of stochastic and complex systems theory, but is intrinsically quantum. Predictive states of a subsystem are formed by equivalence classes of state vectors in the exterior Hilbert space that effectively predict the same future behavior of that subsystem for some time. As an illustrative example, we present calculations in the dynamics of an isotropic Heisenberg model spin chain and show that, in comparison to the entanglement entropy, the predictive complexity better signifies dynamically important events, such as magnon collisions. It can also serve as a local order parameter that can distinguish long and short range entanglement.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14962v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work investigates how the closed channel of a Feshbach resonance is characterised by experimental observables. Surprisingly, it is found that the two-body observables associated with the Feshbach resonance can be insensitive to the properties of the closed channel. In particular, it is impossible in this situation to determine the energy of the bound state causing the resonance from the usual experimental data. This is the case for all magnetic Feshbach resonances in ultracold atoms, due to their deep two-body interaction potentials. This insensitivity highlights a major difference with Feshbach resonances that involve shallow interaction potentials, such as hadron resonances. It appears however that short-range two-body correlations and three-body observables are affected by a parameter of the closed channel called the "closed-channel scattering length". A photoassociation experiment is proposed to measure this parameter in ultracold atom systems.</description>

      <title>Universal properties of the evolution of the Universe in modified loop quantum cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06745v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we systematically study the evolution of the Universe in the framework of a modified loop quantum cosmological model (mLQC-I) with various inflationary potentials, including chaotic, Starobinsky, generalized Starobinsky, polynomials of the first and second kinds, generalized T- models and natural inflation. In all these models, the big bang singularity is replaced by a quantum bounce, and the evolution of the Universe both before and after the bounce is universal and weakly depends on the inflationary potentials, as long as the evolution is dominated by the kinetic energy of the inflaton at the bounce. In particular, the evolution in the pre-bounce region can be universally divided into three different phases: pre-bouncing, pre-transition, and pre-de Sitter. The pre-bouncing phase occurs immediately before the quantum bounce, during which the evolution of the Universe is dominated by the kinetic energy of the inflaton. Thus, the equation of state of the inflaton is about one, w = 1. Soon, the inflation potential takes over, so w rapidly falls from one to negative one. This pre-transition phase is very short and quickly turns into the pre-de Sitter phase, whereby the effective cosmological constant with a Planck size takes over and dominates the rest of the contracting phase. In the entire pre-bounce regime, the evolution of the expansion factor and the inflaton can be approximated by analytical solutions, which are universal and independent of the inflation potentials.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07764v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The analytical Chapman-Enskog formula for calculating the shear viscosity $\eta$ of a relativistic ideal gas, such as a massless quark-gluon plasma, has consistently demonstrated good agreement with the numerical results obtained using the Green-Kubo relation under both isotropic and anisotropic two-body scatterings. However, past analyses of massless, multicomponent quark-gluon plasma have focused on an effective single-component "gluon gas." The Chapman-Enskog formula for multicomponent mixtures with nonzero yet adjustable masses was previously developed for simpler cases of isotropic scatterings. This study aims to obtain the Chapman-Enskog shear viscosity formula for a massless, multicomponent mixture under general anisotropic scatterings. Since the shear viscosity depends on a linearized collision kernel, an approximation formula for the linearized collision kernel is derived under elastic and anisotropic $l+k\rightarrow l+k$ scatterings. This derived approximation agrees very well with the isotropic two-body kernels provided in previous works for both like and different species. Furthermore, for multicomponent mixtures beyond two species types, an alternative expansion method of the $N$-component Chapman-Enskog viscosity is presented. This is applied to a two-component "binary" mixture and compared with the conventional formula for binary viscosity. The agreement between the two, for interacting and noninteracting binary mixtures, varies from moderate to well.</description>

      <title>Thermal state preparation of the SYK model using a variational quantum algorithm</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15545v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the preparation of thermal states of the dense and sparse Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model using a variational quantum algorithm for $6 \le N \le 12$ Majorana fermions over a wide range of temperatures. Utilizing IBM's 127-qubit quantum processor, we perform benchmark computations for the dense SYK model with $N = 6$, showing good agreement with exact results. The preparation of thermal states of a non-local random Hamiltonian with all-to-all coupling using the simulator and quantum hardware represents a significant step toward future computations of thermal out-of-time order correlators in quantum many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Relativistic theory of the viscosity of fluids across the entire energy spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18434v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The shear viscosity is a fundamental transport property of matter. Here we derive a general theory of the viscosity of gases based on the relativistic Langevin equation (deduced from a relativistic Lagrangian) and nonaffine linear response theory. The proposed relativistic theory is able to recover the viscosity of non-relativistic classical gases, with all its key dependencies on mass, temperature, particle diameter and Boltzmann constant, in the limit of Lorentz factor $\gamma=1$. It also unveils the relativistic enhancement mechanism of viscosity. In the limit of ultrarelativistic fluids, the theory provides a new analytical formula which reproduces the cubic increase of viscosity with temperature in agreement with various estimates for hot dense matter and the QGP-type fluid.</description>

      <title>Refined Thermodynamics of Black Holes with Proper Conserved Charges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04002v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Field equations of a classical, geometric, theory of gravity, augmented with some semiclassical considerations strongly suggest that the gravitational field representing a stationary black hole can be simply described with a few thermodynamical coordinates and their conjugates that obey the four laws of thermodynamics plus the Smarr formula and the reverse isoperimetric inequality that bounds the maximum entropy for a given effective volume of space. The thermodynamics of black holes is a promising window to the quantum nature of black holes; hence, it is important to understand all the details of these laws. The identification and the meaning of these thermodynamic coordinates depend on the gravity theory under consideration. For example, the existence of dimensionful coupling constants, such as the cosmological constant, changes the scaling properties of the theory, its solutions, and the laws of thermodynamics. Here we show, using the background Killing charge method, which applies to the black hole solutions of any gravity theory that has a maximally symmetric vacuum, to define the mass and angular momentum, instead of using the Komar mass and the angular momentum, how the thermodynamics of black holes such as the $D$ dimensional Kerr-AdS black holes in cosmological Einstein's theory and the spherically symmetric black holes in the Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet theory changes. We give the effective volume of black holes even without a cosmological constant.</description>

      <title>Shear Viscosity of Collider-Produced QCD Matter I: AMY Formalism vs. A Modified Relaxation Time Approximation in 0-flavor SU(3) Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16856v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The AMY formalism is widely used to describe the transport coefficients of asymptotically hot and dense QCD matter, such as shear viscosity $\eta$. In literature prior to AMY, the viscosity of an asymptotically hot QCD plasma was expressed by a $q^2$ momentum transfer-weighted relaxation time approximation. Recent studies that compared numerical transport calculations and analytical expressions for $\eta$ demonstrated that asymptotically high temperatures and densities induce anisotropic scatterings, which are exhibited in the quark-gluon plasma produced by relativistic heavy ion collisions. In these studies, the QGP was treated as a Maxwell-Boltzmann-distributed gluon gas with added (anti-)quark degrees of freedom. One such method used in the comparison was the ``modified'' $q^2$ transport-weighted RTA. In this study, a comparison between the AMY formalism (both numerical calculations and next-leading-log expression) and the modified RTA expression for $\eta$ is made in 0-flavor SU(3) theory for collider-produced QGP. The comparison between numerical AMY calculations and the modified RTA method shows perfect agreement under the temperatures relevant for collider-produced QGP. Additionally, AMY is compared with the Chapman-Enskog method, which is well understood to better describe anisotropic collider-produced QGP.</description>

      <title>Gravity from entropy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14391v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gravity is derived from an entropic action coupling matter fields with geometry. The fundamental idea is to relate the metric of Lorentzian spacetime to a density matrix. The matter fields curve spacetime, defining a metric induced by the matter fields. The entropic action is the quantum relative entropy between the metric of spacetime and the metric induced by the matter fields. The modified Einstein equations obtained reduce to the Einstein equations in the regime of low coupling. To simplify the theory, exclusively scalar matter fields are considered. This theoretical framework can be extended in different directions, for instance by including fermionic matter fields and gauge fields. A canonical quantization of this field theory could bring new insights into quantum gravity.</description>

      <title>Fermion masses and mixings in the supersymmetric Pati-Salam landscape from Intersecting D6-Branes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09110v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, the complete landscape of three-family supersymmetric Pati-Salam models from intersecting D6-branes on a type IIA $\mathbb{T}^6/(\mathbb{Z}_2\times \mathbb{Z}_2)$ orientifold has been enumerated consisting of 33 independent models with distinct gauge coupling relations at the string scale. Here, we study the phenomenology of all such models by providing the detailed particle spectra and the analysis of the possible 3-point and the 4-point Yukawa interactions in order to accommodate all standard-model fermion masses and mixings. We find that only 17 models contain viable Yukawa textures to explain quarks masses, charged-leptons' masses, neutrino-masses, quarks' mixings and leptons' mixings. These viable models split into four classes, viz. a single model with 3 Higgs fields from the bulk and sixteen models with either 6, 9 or 12 Higgs from the $\mathcal{N}=2$ sector. The models perform successively better with the increasing number of Higgs pairs. Remarkably, the class of models with 12 Higgs naturally predicts the Dirac-type neutrino masses in normal ordering consistent with both the experimental constraints as well as the bounds from the swampland program.</description>

      <title>Stars and quark stars in bumblebee gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20360v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, the interior spacetime of stars is built in a Lorentz symmetry breaking model called bumblebee gravity. Firstly, we calculated the modified Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equation in this context of modified gravity. Then we show that the bumblebee field, responsible for the symmetry breaking, increases the star mass-radius relation when it assumes its vacuum expectation value. When compared to the general relativity mass-radius relation, a Lorentz symmetry breaking context, like the bumblebee gravity, could provide more massive stars, surpassing the $2.5 M_{\odot}$ limit as the interior of the star is described by quark matter with the MIT bag model.</description>

      <title>Positive Conserved Quantities in the Klein-Gordon Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04666v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce an embedding of the Klein-Gordon equation into a pair of coupled equations that are first-order in time. The existence of such an embedding is based on a positivity property exhibited by the Klein-Gordon equation. These coupled equations provide a more satisfactory reduction of the Klein-Gordon equation to first-order differential equations in time than the Schrodinger equation. Using this embedding, we show that the "negative probabilities" associated with the Klein-Gordon equation do not need to be resolved by introducing matrices as Dirac did with his eponymous equation. For the case of the massive Klein-Gordon equation, the coupled equations are equivalent to a forward Schrodinger equation in time and a backward Schrodinger equation in time, respectively, corresponding to a particle and its antiparticle. We show that there are two positive integrals that are conserved (constant in time) in the Klein-Gordon equation and thus provide a concrete resolution of the historical puzzle regarding the previously supposed lack of a probabilistic interpretation for the field governed by the Klein-Gordon equation.</description>

      <title>SPECTER: Efficient Evaluation of the Spectral EMD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05379v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Energy Mover's Distance (EMD) has seen use in collider physics as a metric between events and as a geometric method of defining infrared and collinear safe observables. Recently, the Spectral Energy Mover's Distance (SEMD) has been proposed as a more analytically tractable alternative to the EMD. In this work, we obtain a closed-form expression for the Riemannian-like p = 2 SEMD metric between events, eliminating the need to numerically solve an optimal transport problem. Additionally, we show how the SEMD can be used to define event and jet shape observables by minimizing the distance between events and parameterized energy flows (similar to the EMD), and we obtain closed-form expressions for several of these observables. We also present the SPECTER framework, an efficient and highly parallelized implementation of the SEMD metric and SEMD-derived shape observables as an analogue of the previously-introduced SHAPER for EMD-based computations. We demonstrate that computing the SEMD with SPECTER can be up to a thousand times faster than computing the EMD with standard optimal transport libraries.</description>

      <title>Hybrid SO(10) Axion Model Without Quality Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07323v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Invisible axion models that solve the strong CP problem via the Peccei-Quinn (PQ) mechanism typically have a quality problem that arises from quantum gravity effects which violate all global symmetries. These models therefore require extreme fine-tuning of parameters for consistency. We present a new solution to the quality problem in a unified $SO(10)\times U(1)_a$ gauge model, where $U(1)_a$ is an anomaly free axial gauge symmetry. PQ symmetry emerges as an accidental symmetry in this setup, which admits a PQ breaking scale as large as $4\times 10^{11}$ GeV, allowing for the axion to be the cosmological dark matter. We call this a hybrid axion model due to its unique feature that it interpolates between the popular KSVZ and DFSZ axion models. Its predictions for the experimentally measurable axion couplings to the nucleon and electron are distinct from those of the usual models, a feature that can be used to test it. Furthermore, the model has no domain wall problem and it provides a realistic and predictive framework for fermion masses and mixings.</description>

      <title>Maximal chirality transfer in the photon-graviton conversion in the early universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07338v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While photons and gravitons do not interact significantly, photons can be converted to gravitons in a background magnetic field -- a phenomenon known as the Gertsenshtein effect. In this paper, we investigate whether chiral electromagnetic (EM) waves can be converted to chiral gravitational waves (GW) in the presence of primordial magnetic fields during the radiation-dominated epoch of the early universe. We consider two situations wherein chirality is either present in the propagating EM waves or it exists in the background magnetic field. Our analysis shows that while the conversion probability increases with stronger magnetic fields, it remains insensitive to the chiral nature of the background magnetic field. Consequently, the net chirality parameter is independent of the chirality of the background field in both cases. Finally, we demonstrate that the present-day energy density of the produced chiral GWs peaks at a frequency of $\sim 100$ GHz, and the corresponding characteristic strain will be highly sensitive to current and future missions designed to detect high-frequency GWs.</description>

      <title>Observational imprints from Loop Quantum Cosmology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.14435v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The standard model of cosmology assumes a homogeneous and isotropic universe that undergoes a period of exponential expansion very early on, named inflation. This stretches quantum fluctuations from the onset of inflation to cosmological scales, which seed the temperature, polarization and matter anisotropies that we observe. However, this paradigm ignores pre-inflationary physics, as shortly before inflation there is the initial big-bang singularity. Loop Quantum Cosmology (LQC) is a promising approach to quantum cosmology. Its most outstanding result is that of the resolution of the classical initial singularity in terms of a quantum bounce that connects a contracting branch of the Universe with an expanding one. Consequently, it provides singularity-free pre-inflationary dynamics. Within this context, it is no longer justified to consider that every mode of the cosmological perturbations reaches the onset of inflation in the natural vacuum state of standard cosmology. In fact, some modes might reach it in an excited state, which may leave imprints in their power spectra at the end of inflation and therefore in observations of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB). The goal of this thesis is to search for such imprints from LQC in the CMB. We work in the hybrid approach to cosmological perturbations in LQC.</description>
