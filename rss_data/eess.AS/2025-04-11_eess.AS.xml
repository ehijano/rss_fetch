      <title>Categorical Unsupervised Variational Acoustic Clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07652v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a categorical approach for unsupervised variational acoustic clustering of audio data in the time-frequency domain. The consideration of a categorical distribution enforces sharper clustering even when data points strongly overlap in time and frequency, which is the case for most datasets of urban acoustic scenes. To this end, we use a Gumbel-Softmax distribution as a soft approximation to the categorical distribution, allowing for training via backpropagation. In this settings, the softmax temperature serves as the main mechanism to tune clustering performance. The results show that the proposed model can obtain impressive clustering performance for all considered datasets, even when data points strongly overlap in time and frequency.</description>

      <title>Visual-Aware Speech Recognition for Noisy Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07229v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Humans have the ability to utilize visual cues, such as lip movements and visual scenes, to enhance auditory perception, particularly in noisy environments. However, current Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) or Audio-Visual Speech Recognition (AVSR) models often struggle in noisy scenarios. To solve this task, we propose a model that improves transcription by correlating noise sources to visual cues. Unlike works that rely on lip motion and require the speaker's visibility, we exploit broader visual information from the environment. This allows our model to naturally filter speech from noise and improve transcription, much like humans do in noisy scenarios. Our method re-purposes pretrained speech and visual encoders, linking them with multi-headed attention. This approach enables the transcription of speech and the prediction of noise labels in video inputs. We introduce a scalable pipeline to develop audio-visual datasets, where visual cues correlate to noise in the audio. We show significant improvements over existing audio-only models in noisy scenarios. Results also highlight that visual cues play a vital role in improved transcription accuracy.</description>

      <title>Quantum-Inspired Genetic Algorithm for Robust Source Separation in Smart City Acoustics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07345v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The cacophony of urban sounds presents a significant challenge for smart city applications that rely on accurate acoustic scene analysis. Effectively analyzing these complex soundscapes, often characterized by overlapping sound sources, diverse acoustic events, and unpredictable noise levels, requires precise source separation. This task becomes more complicated when only limited training data is available. This paper introduces a novel Quantum-Inspired Genetic Algorithm (p-QIGA) for source separation, drawing inspiration from quantum information theory to enhance acoustic scene analysis in smart cities. By leveraging quantum superposition for efficient solution space exploration and entanglement to handle correlated sources, p-QIGA achieves robust separation even with limited data. These quantum-inspired concepts are integrated into a genetic algorithm framework to optimize source separation parameters. The effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated on two datasets: the TAU Urban Acoustic Scenes 2020 Mobile dataset, representing typical urban soundscapes, and the Silent Cities dataset, capturing quieter urban environments during the COVID-19 pandemic. Experimental results show that the p-QIGA achieves accuracy comparable to state-of-the-art methods while exhibiting superior resilience to noise and limited training data, achieving up to 8.2 dB signal-to-distortion ratio (SDR) in noisy environments and outperforming baseline methods by up to 2 dB with only 10% of the training data. This research highlights the potential of p-QIGA to advance acoustic signal processing in smart cities, particularly for noise pollution monitoring and acoustic surveillance.</description>

      <title>Towards Generalizability to Tone and Content Variations in the Transcription of Amplifier Rendered Electric Guitar Audio</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07406v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transcribing electric guitar recordings is challenging due to the scarcity of diverse datasets and the complex tone-related variations introduced by amplifiers, cabinets, and effect pedals. To address these issues, we introduce EGDB-PG, a novel dataset designed to capture a wide range of tone-related characteristics across various amplifier-cabinet configurations. In addition, we propose the Tone-informed Transformer (TIT), a Transformer-based transcription model enhanced with a tone embedding mechanism that leverages learned representations to improve the model's adaptability to tone-related nuances. Experiments demonstrate that TIT, trained on EGDB-PG, outperforms existing baselines across diverse amplifier types, with transcription accuracy improvements driven by the dataset's diversity and the tone embedding technique. Through detailed benchmarking and ablation studies, we evaluate the impact of tone augmentation, content augmentation, audio normalization, and tone embedding on transcription performance. This work advances electric guitar transcription by overcoming limitations in dataset diversity and tone modeling, providing a robust foundation for future research.</description>

      <title>SD-HuBERT: Sentence-Level Self-Distillation Induces Syllabic Organization in HuBERT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.10803v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Data-driven unit discovery in self-supervised learning (SSL) of speech has embarked on a new era of spoken language processing. Yet, the discovered units often remain in phonetic space and the units beyond phonemes are largely underexplored. Here, we demonstrate that a syllabic organization emerges in learning sentence-level representation of speech. In particular, we adopt "self-distillation" objective to fine-tune the pretrained HuBERT with an aggregator token that summarizes the entire sentence. Without any supervision, the resulting model draws definite boundaries in speech, and the representations across frames exhibit salient syllabic structures. We demonstrate that this emergent structure largely corresponds to the ground truth syllables. Furthermore, we propose a new benchmark task, Spoken Speech ABX, for evaluating sentence-level representation of speech. When compared to previous models, our model outperforms in both unsupervised syllable discovery and learning sentence-level representation. Together, we demonstrate that the self-distillation of HuBERT gives rise to syllabic organization without relying on external labels or modalities, and potentially provides novel data-driven units for spoken language modeling.</description>

      <title>Taming Data and Transformers for Scalable Audio Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19388v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The scalability of ambient sound generators is hindered by data scarcity, insufficient caption quality, and limited scalability in model architecture. This work addresses these challenges by advancing both data and model scaling. First, we propose an efficient and scalable dataset collection pipeline tailored for ambient audio generation, resulting in AutoReCap-XL, the largest ambient audio-text dataset with over 47 million clips. To provide high-quality textual annotations, we propose AutoCap, a high-quality automatic audio captioning model. By adopting a Q-Former module and leveraging audio metadata, AutoCap substantially enhances caption quality, reaching a CIDEr score of $83.2$, a $3.2\%$ improvement over previous captioning models. Finally, we propose GenAu, a scalable transformer-based audio generation architecture that we scale up to 1.25B parameters. We demonstrate its benefits from data scaling with synthetic captions as well as model size scaling. When compared to baseline audio generators trained at similar size and data scale, GenAu obtains significant improvements of $4.7\%$ in FAD score, $11.1\%$ in IS, and $13.5\%$ in CLAP score. Our code, model checkpoints, and dataset are publicly available.</description>

      <title>EveGuard: Defeating Vibration-based Side-Channel Eavesdropping with Audio Adversarial Perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10034v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Vibrometry-based side channels pose a significant privacy risk, exploiting sensors like mmWave radars, light sensors, and accelerometers to detect vibrations from sound sources or proximate objects, enabling speech eavesdropping. Despite various proposed defenses, these involve costly hardware solutions with inherent physical limitations. This paper presents EveGuard, a software-driven defense framework that creates adversarial audio, protecting voice privacy from side channels without compromising human perception. We leverage the distinct sensing capabilities of side channels and traditional microphones, where side channels capture vibrations and microphones record changes in air pressure, resulting in different frequency responses. EveGuard first proposes a perturbation generator model (PGM) that effectively suppresses sensor-based eavesdropping while maintaining high audio quality. Second, to enable end-to-end training of PGM, we introduce a new domain translation task called Eve-GAN for inferring an eavesdropped signal from a given audio. We further apply few-shot learning to mitigate the data collection overhead for Eve-GAN training. Our extensive experiments show that EveGuard achieves a protection rate of more than 97 percent from audio classifiers and significantly hinders eavesdropped audio reconstruction. We further validate the performance of EveGuard across three adaptive attack mechanisms. We have conducted a user study to verify the perceptual quality of our perturbed audio.</description>

      <title>TangoFlux: Super Fast and Faithful Text to Audio Generation with Flow Matching and Clap-Ranked Preference Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.21037v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce TangoFlux, an efficient Text-to-Audio (TTA) generative model with 515M parameters, capable of generating up to 30 seconds of 44.1kHz audio in just 3.7 seconds on a single A40 GPU. A key challenge in aligning TTA models lies in the difficulty of creating preference pairs, as TTA lacks structured mechanisms like verifiable rewards or gold-standard answers available for Large Language Models (LLMs). To address this, we propose CLAP-Ranked Preference Optimization (CRPO), a novel framework that iteratively generates and optimizes preference data to enhance TTA alignment. We demonstrate that the audio preference dataset generated using CRPO outperforms existing alternatives. With this framework, TangoFlux achieves state-of-the-art performance across both objective and subjective benchmarks. We open source all code and models to support further research in TTA generation.</description>
