      <title>Modeling variable guide efficiency in pooled CRISPR screens with ContrastiveVI+</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08072v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Genetic screens mediated via CRISPR-Cas9 combined with high-content readouts have emerged as powerful tools for biological discovery. However, computational analyses of these screens come with additional challenges beyond those found with standard scRNA-seq analyses. For example, perturbation-induced variations of interest may be subtle and masked by other dominant source of variation shared with controls, and variable guide efficiency results in some cells not undergoing genetic perturbation despite expressing a guide RNA. While a number of methods have been developed to address the former problem by explicitly disentangling perturbation-induced variations from those shared with controls, less attention has been paid to the latter problem of noisy perturbation labels. To address this issue, here we propose ContrastiveVI+, a generative modeling framework that both disentangles perturbation-induced from non-perturbation-related variations while also inferring whether cells truly underwent genomic edits. Applied to three large-scale Perturb-seq datasets, we find that ContrastiveVI+ better recovers known perturbation-induced variations compared to previous methods while successfully identifying cells that escaped the functional consequences of guide RNA expression. An open-source implementation of our model is available at \url{https://github.com/insitro/contrastive_vi_plus}.</description>

      <title>DBgDel: Database-Enhanced Gene Deletion Framework for Growth-Coupled Production in Genome-Scale Metabolic Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When simulating metabolite productions with genome-scale constraint-based metabolic models, gene deletion strategies are necessary to achieve growth-coupled production, which means cell growth and target metabolite production occur simultaneously. Since obtaining gene deletion strategies for large genome-scale models suffers from significant computational time, it is necessary to develop methods to mitigate this computational burden. In this study, we introduce a novel framework for computing gene deletion strategies. The proposed framework first mines related databases to extract prior information about gene deletions for growth-coupled production. It then integrates the extracted information with downstream algorithms to narrow down the algorithmic search space, resulting in highly efficient calculations on genome-scale models. Computational experiment results demonstrated that our framework can compute stoichiometrically feasible gene deletion strategies for numerous target metabolites, showcasing a noteworthy improvement in computational efficiency. Specifically, our framework achieves an average 6.1-fold acceleration in computational speed compared to existing methods while maintaining a respectable success rate.

      <title>Explainable Deep Learning Framework for SERS Bio-quantification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) is a potential fast and inexpensive method of analyte quantification, which can be combined with deep learning to discover biomarker-disease relationships. This study aims to address present challenges of SERS through a novel SERS bio-quantification framework, including spectral processing, analyte quantification, and model explainability. To this end,serotonin quantification in urine media was assessed as a model task with 682 SERS spectra measured in a micromolar range using cucurbit[8]uril chemical spacers. A denoising autoencoder was utilized for spectral enhancement, and convolutional neural networks (CNN) and vision transformers were utilized for biomarker quantification. Lastly, a novel context representative interpretable model explanations (CRIME) method was developed to suit the current needs of SERS mixture analysis explainability. Serotonin quantification was most efficient in denoised spectra analysed using a convolutional neural network with a three-parameter logistic output layer (mean absolute error = 0.15 {\mu}M, mean percentage error = 4.67%). Subsequently, the CRIME method revealed the CNN model to present six prediction contexts, of which three were associated with serotonin. The proposed framework could unlock a novel, untargeted hypothesis generating method of biomarker discovery considering the rapid and inexpensive nature of SERS measurements, and the potential to identify biomarkers from CRIME contexts.</description>

      <title>A universal formula explains cell size distributions in lineages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08327v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cells actively regulate their size along the cell cycle to maintain volume homeostasis across generations. While various mathematical models of cell size regulation have been proposed to explain how this is achieved, relating these models to experimentally observed cell size distributions has proved challenging. In this paper we derive a simple formula for the cell size distribution observed in lineage experiments, assuming exponential cell size growth. Our results are independent of the underlying cell size control mechanism and explain the characteristic shape underlying experimentally observed cell size distributions. We furthermore derive universal moment identities for these distributions, and show that our predictions agree well with experimental measurements of E. coli cells, both on the distribution and the moment level.</description>

      <title>Hashing for Protein Structure Similarity Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08286v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Protein structure similarity search (PSSS), which tries to search proteins with similar structures, plays a crucial role across diverse domains from drug design to protein function prediction and molecular evolution. Traditional alignment-based PSSS methods, which directly calculate alignment on the protein structures, are highly time-consuming with high memory cost. Recently, alignment-free methods, which represent protein structures as fixed-length real-valued vectors, are proposed for PSSS. Although these methods have lower time and memory cost than alignment-based methods, their time and memory cost is still too high for large-scale PSSS, and their accuracy is unsatisfactory. In this paper, we propose a novel method, called $\underline{\text{p}}$r$\underline{\text{o}}$tein $\underline{\text{s}}$tructure $\underline{\text{h}}$ashing (POSH), for PSSS. POSH learns a binary vector representation for each protein structure, which can dramatically reduce the time and memory cost for PSSS compared with real-valued vector representation based methods. Furthermore, in POSH we also propose expressive hand-crafted features and a structure encoder to well model both node and edge interactions in proteins. Experimental results on real datasets show that POSH can outperform other methods to achieve state-of-the-art accuracy. Furthermore, POSH achieves a memory saving of more than six times and speed improvement of more than four times, compared with other methods.</description>

      <title>SDDBench: A Benchmark for Synthesizable Drug Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08306v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A significant challenge in wet lab experiments with current drug design generative models is the trade-off between pharmacological properties and synthesizability. Molecules predicted to have highly desirable properties are often difficult to synthesize, while those that are easily synthesizable tend to exhibit less favorable properties. As a result, evaluating the synthesizability of molecules in general drug design scenarios remains a significant challenge in the field of drug discovery. The commonly used synthetic accessibility (SA) score aims to evaluate the ease of synthesizing generated molecules, but it falls short of guaranteeing that synthetic routes can actually be found. Inspired by recent advances in top-down synthetic route generation, we propose a new, data-driven metric to evaluate molecule synthesizability. Our approach directly assesses the feasibility of synthetic routes for a given molecule through our proposed round-trip score. This novel metric leverages the synergistic duality between retrosynthetic planners and reaction predictors, both of which are trained on extensive reaction datasets. To demonstrate the efficacy of our method, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of round-trip scores alongside search success rate across a range of representative molecule generative models. Code is available at https://github.com/SongtaoLiu0823/SDDBench.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Comparisons Between Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08739v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Which neural networks are similar is a fundamental question for both machine learning and neuroscience. Our novel method compares representations based on Bayesian statistics about linear readouts from the representations. Concretely, we suggest to use the total variation distance or Jensen-Shannon distance between prior predictive distributions to compare representations. The prior predictive distribution is a full description of the inductive bias and generalization of a model in Bayesian statistics, making it a great basis for comparisons. As Jensen-Shannon distance and total variation distance are metrics our dissimilarity measures are pseudo-metrics for representations. For a linear readout, our metrics just depend on the linear kernel matrix of the representations. Thus, our metrics connects linear read-out based comparisons to kernel based metrics like centered kernel alignment and representational similarity analysis. We apply our new metrics to deep neural networks trained on ImageNet-1k. Our new metrics can be computed efficiently including a stochastic gradient without dimensionality reductions of the representations. It broadly agrees with existing metrics, but is more stringent. It varies less across different random image samples, and it measures how well two representations could be distinguished based on a linear read out. Thus our metric nicely extends our toolkit for comparing representations.</description>

      <title>SMDP: SARS-CoV-2 Mutation Distribution Profiler for rapid estimation of mutational histories of unusual lineages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11201v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: SARS-CoV-2 usually evolves at a relatively constant rate over time. Occasionally, however, lineages arise with higher-than-expected numbers of mutations given the date of sampling. Such lineages can arise for a variety of reasons, including selection pressures imposed by evolution during a chronic infection or exposure to mutation-inducing drugs like molnupiravir. We have developed an open-source web-based application (SMDP: SARS-CoV-2 Mutation Distribution Profiler; https://eringill.shinyapps.io/covid_mutation_distributions) that compares a list of user-submitted lineage-defining mutations or a FASTA file containing a single genome (from which lineage-defining mutations are calculated) with established mutation distributions including those observed during (1) the first nine months of the pandemic, (2) during the global transmission of Omicron, (3) during the chronic infection of immunocompromised patients, and (4) during zoonotic spillover from humans to deer. The application calculates the most likely distribution for the user's mutation list and displays log likelihoods for all distributions. In addition, the transition:transversion ratio of the user's list is calculated to determine whether there is evidence of exposure to a mutation-inducing drug such as molnupiravir and indicates whether the list contains mutations in the proofreading domain of nsp14 which could lead to a higher-than-expected mutation rate in the lineage. This tool will be useful for public health and researchers seeking to rapidly infer evolutionary histories of SARS-CoV-2 variants, which can aid risk assessment and public health responses.</description>

      <title>Inferring directed spectral information flow between mixed-frequency time series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06109v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Identifying directed spectral information flow between multivariate time series is important for many applications in finance, climate, geophysics and neuroscience. Spectral Granger causality (SGC) is a prediction-based measure characterizing directed information flow at specific oscillatory frequencies. However, traditional vector autoregressive (VAR) approaches are insufficient to assess SGC when time series have mixed frequencies (MF) or are coupled by nonlinearity. Here we propose a time-frequency canonical correlation analysis approach ("MF-TFCCA") to assess the strength and driving frequency of spectral information flow. We validate the approach with extensive computer simulations on MF time series under various interaction conditions and further assess statistical significance of the estimate with surrogate data. In various benchmark comparisons, MF-TFCCA consistently outperforms the traditional parametric MF-VAR model in both computational efficiency and detection accuracy, and recovers the dominant driving frequencies. We further apply MF-TFCCA to real-life finance, climate and neuroscience data. Our analysis framework provides an exploratory and computationally efficient nonparametric approach to quantify directed information flow between MF time series in the presence of complex and nonlinear interactions.</description>
