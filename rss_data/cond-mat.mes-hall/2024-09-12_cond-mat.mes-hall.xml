      <title>Wavefunction approach to the fractional anomalous Hall crystal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose fractional anomalous Hall crystals (FAHCs) as possible ground states of strongly interacting electrons in parent bands with Berry curvature. FAHCs are exotic states of matter that spontaneously break continuous translation symmetry to form a fractional Chern insulator. We construct a unified family of variational wavefunctions that describe FAHCs and their competing states in the presence of uniform parent Berry curvature. We calculate their variational energy with Coulomb interactions semi-analytically in the thermodynamic limit. Our analysis reveals that FAHCs can be energetically favorable over both Wigner crystals and integer anomalous Hall crystals for sufficiently strong interactions or flat dispersion.</description>

      <title>Moir\'e Kramers-Weyl Fermions from Structural Chirality with Ideal Radial Spin Texture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06806v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate that two-dimensional Kramers-Weyl fermions can be engineered in spin-orbit coupled twisted bilayers, where the chiral structure of these moir\'e systems breaks all mirror symmetries, confining Kramers-Weyl fermions to high-symmetry points in the Brillouin zone under time reversal symmetry. Our theoretical analysis reveals a symmetry-enforced Weyl-like interlayer moir\'e coupling that universally ensures an ideal radial spin-texture at arbitrary twist angles, under $C_{nz}$ symmetry with n&gt;2. First principles density functional calculation confirm the realization of these fermions in twisted $\alpha$-In$_2$Se$_3$ bilayers, where flat bands and out-of-plane ferroelectric polarization in each layer guarantee two-dimensional Kramers-Weyl physics with perfectly ideal radial spin textures.</description>

      <title>Four-terminal voltage fluctuations in disordered graphene nanoribbons: Anderson and anomalous localization effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06891v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The voltage is a sensitive quantity to quantum interference in coherent electronic transport. We study the voltage fluctuations in disordered graphene nanoribbons with zigzag and armchair edge terminations in a four-terminal configuration. We show that the average and standard deviation of the voltage oscillates with the separation of the attached voltage probes and depend on the coupling strength of the probes. The voltage fluctuations can be large enough to observe negative voltages for weakly coupled probes. As we numerically verified, the voltage fluctuations are described within a random matrix approach for weakly disordered nanoribbons at energies away from the Fermi energy. However, near the Fermi energy, zigzag nanoribbons exhibit Anderson localization, whereas electrons are anomalously localized in armchair nanoribbons. This distinction leads to different voltage statistics for zigzag and armchair nanoribbons.</description>

      <title>Static quantum dot on a potential hilltop for generating and analyzing hot electrons in the quantum Hall regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07061v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose and demonstrate a static quantum dot on a potential hilltop to generate and analyze ballistic hot electrons along a quantum Hall edge channel well above the chemical potential. High energy resolution associated with discrete energy levels is attractive for studying hot-electron dynamics. Particularly, the energy distribution function of hot electrons weakly coupled to cold electrons is investigated to reveal spectral diffusion with energy relaxation. The analysis allows us to estimate the maximum energy exchange per scattering, which is an important parameter to describe interacting electrons in the edge channel.</description>

      <title>Topological Spin-Orbit Torque in Ferrimagnetic Weyl Semimetal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07106v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spin-orbit torque (SOT) in a compensated ferrimagnetic Weyl semimetal, ${\rm Ti}_{2}{\rm MnAl}$, is studied by the linear response theory. We elucidate that the SOT driven by all the occupied electronic states is present in magnetic Weyl semimetal, unlike in conventional metallic magnets. Around the energy of the Weyl points, we find that such an SOT is dominant and almost independent of the disorder. The emergence of the SOT in ${\rm Ti}_{2}{\rm MnAl}$ can be understood from the structure of the mixed Berry curvature around the Weyl points, which is similar to that of the ordinary Berry curvature.</description>

      <title>Inner non-Hermitian skin effect on Bethe lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07117v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model on Bethe lattice, revealing a novel localization phenomenon coined inner non-Hermitian skin effect. This effect is featured by the localization of all eigenstates within the bulk of the lattice, diverging from the conventional skin effect observed in general non-Hermitian systems. The analytical treatment of the model demonstrates that the Hamiltonian can be decoupled into a series of one-dimensional chains, with one end fixed at the bottom boundary while the other ends positioned at varying generations within the bulk. This configuration leads to the emergence of the inner non-Hermitian skin effect, which is further validated by performing circuit simulations. Our findings provide new insights into the interplay between non-Hermitian physics and the self-similar structure on Bethe lattice.</description>

      <title>Nernst Plateau in the Quantum Limit of Topological Insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07199v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nernst effect, a transverse electric current induced by a temperature gradient, is a promising tool for revealing emergent phases of condensed matter. We find a Nernst coefficient plateau in low carrier density topological insulators, as a signature of 1D Weyl points in the quantum limit of the weak topological insulator. The plateau height is inversely proportional to the impurity density, suggesting a way to engineer infinitely large Nernst effects. The Nernst plateau also exists in strong topological insulators, at the bottom of the lowest Landau band. We show that these plateaus have been overlooked in the previous experiments and we highlight the experimental conditions to observe them. Our results may inspire more investigations of employing anomalous Nernst effect to identify emergent phases of condensed matter.</description>

      <title>Low-Temperature Electron Transport in [110] and [100] Silicon Nanowires: A DFT - Monte Carlo study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07282v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The effects of very low temperature on the electron transport in a [110] and [100] axially aligned unstrained silicon nanowires (SiNWs) are investigated. A combination of semi-empirical 10-orbital tight-binding method, density functional theory (DFT), and Ensemble Monte Carlo (EMC) methods are used. Both acoustic and optical phonons are included in the electron-phonon scattering rate calculations covering both intra-subband and inter-subband events. A comparison with room temperature (300 K) characteristics shows that for both nanowires, the average electron steady-state drift velocity increases at least 2 times at relatively moderate electric fields and lower temperatures. Furthermore, the average drift velocity in [110] nanowires is 50 percent more than that of [100] nanowires, explained by the difference in their conduction subband effective mass. Transient average electron velocity suggests that there is a pronounced streaming electron motion at low temperature which is attributed to the reduced electron-phonon scattering rates.</description>

      <title>Development of large scale CVD grown two dimensional materials for field-effect transistors, thermally-driven neuromorphic memory, and spintronics applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07357v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semiconductor research has shifted towards exploring two-dimensional (2D) materials as candidates for next-generation electronic devices due to the limitations of existing silicon technology. Transition Metal Dichalcogenides (TMDCs) stand out for their exceptional optoelectronic properties and potential for advanced device integration. This thesis focuses on the synthesis of 2D TMDCs using Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD) for their potential applications in transistors, memory, and neuromorphic computing. By optimizing the NaCl-assisted CVD method and examining their optical properties through Raman and photoluminescence spectroscopy, challenges such as premature growth, defects, and non-uniformity in MoS2 samples are addressed. The thesis highlights device fabrication techniques and electrical performance of salt-assisted CVD-grown MoS2 field-effect transistors, which exhibit hysteresis-free behavior and high field-effect mobility. A novel etching-free transfer technique is introduced, improving transistor performance and enabling applications in flexible optoelectronics. The thesis also explores monolayer MoS2 mem-transistors, demonstrating multifunctional room temperature transistor and high-temperature multi-level memory behaviour. These devices leverage interfacial physics and ion dynamics to achieve non-volatile memory with multi-level storage capabilities. Additionally, high density memory devices using monolayer WS2 are developed, which demonstrate 6-bit memory operation with neuromorphic biomimetic plasticity. The study also includes 2D TMDCs and their hetero-bilayers as potential 2D dilute magnetic semiconductors via doping, strain engineering using density functional theory and micromagnetic simulations, revealing potential applications in spintronics. This thesis makes significant contributions to advancing 2D materials for next-generation electronics and spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Hofstadter Butterflies in Topological Insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this chapter, we investigate the energy spectra as well as the bulk and surface states in a two-dimensional system composed of a coupled stack of one-dimensional dimerized chains in the presence of an external magnetic field. Specifically, we analyze the Hofstadter butterfly patterns that emerge in a 2D stack of coupled 1D Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) chains subject to an external transverse magnetic field. Depending on the parameter regime, we find that the energy spectra of this hybrid topological system can exhibit topologically non-trivial bulk bands separated by energy gaps. Upon introducing boundaries into the system, we observe topologically protected in-gap surface states, which are protected either by a non-trivial Chern number or by inversion symmetry. We examine the resilience of these surface states against perturbations, confirming their expected stability against local symmetry-preserving perturbations.</description>

      <title>Enhancement of topological regime in elongated Josephson junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07418v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically study topological superconductivity in elongated planar Josephson junctions. Josephson junctions host a topological phase accompanied by the presence of zero-energy Majorana-bound states in a certain region of the superconducting phase difference with a span determined by the strength of an external magnetic field. We demonstrate that the topological superconducting phase range can be greatly increased by elongation of the junction, which causes an amplification of the Zeeman-induced phase shift of Andreev bound states. We show that the appearance of trivial in-gap states that occurs in elongated junctions can prohibit the creation of Majorana modes, but it can be mitigated by further proximitization of the junction with additional superconducting contacts. The topological transition in this system can be probed by measurements of the critical current and we show that the elongation of the junction leads to a linear decrease of the transition critical magnetic field beneficial for experimental studies.</description>

      <title>Manipulating moires by controlling heterostrain in van der Waals devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07427v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Van der Waals (vdW) moires offer tunable superlattices that can strongly manipulate electronic properties. We demonstrate the in-situ manipulation of moire superlattices via heterostrain control in a vdW device. By straining a graphene layer relative to its hexagonal boron nitride substrate, we modify the shape and size of the moire. Our sliding-based technique achieves uniaxial heterostrain values exceeding 1%, resulting in distorted moires that are larger than those achievable without strain. The stretched moire is evident in transport measurements, resulting in shifted superlattice resistance peaks and Landau fans consistent with an enlarged superlattice unit cell. Electronic structure calculations reveal how heterostrain shrinks and distorts the moire Brillouin zone, resulting in a reduced electronic bandwidth as well as the appearance of highly anisotropic and quasi-1-dimensional Fermi surfaces. Our heterostrain control approach opens a wide parameter space of moire lattices to explore beyond what is possible by twist angle control alone.</description>

      <title>The chiral torsional anomaly and the Nieh-Yan invariant with and without boundaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06766v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There exists a long-standing debate regarding the torsion contribution to the 4d chiral anomaly of a Dirac fermion. Central to this debate is the Nieh-Yan anomaly, which has been considered ill-defined and a regularization artifact. Using a heat-kernel approach, we examine the relationship between the Dirac operator index, the Nieh-Yan invariant and the torsional anomaly. We show the Nieh-Yan invariant vanishes on spacetimes without boundaries, if the Dirac index is well-defined. In the known examples of non-vanishing Nieh--Yan invariant on manifolds without boundaries, the heat kernel expansion breaks down, making the index ill-defined. Finally, for finite boundaries we identify several finite bulk and boundary anomaly terms, alongside bulk and boundary Nieh-Yan terms. We construct explicit counterterms that cancel the Nieh-Yan terms and argue that the boundary terms give rise to a torsional anomalous Hall effect. Our results emphasize the importance of renormalization conditions, as these can affect both the thermal and non-thermal Nieh-Yan anomaly coefficients. In addition, we demonstrate that anomalous torsional transport may arise even without relying on the Nieh-Yan invariant.</description>

      <title>A general method for calibration of active scanning thermal probes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06872v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scanning Thermal Microscopy (SThM) is a scanning probe technique aimed at quantitative characterization of local thermal properties at the length scale down to tens of nanometers. With many probe designs and approaches to interpretation of probe responses, there is a need for a universal framework, which would allow probe calibration and comparison of probe performance. Here, we have developed a calibration framework based on an abstracted, formal, probe model for active SThM probes. The calibration can be accomplished through measurements with two or three calibration samples. Requirements to calibration samples are described with examples of structures of suitable samples identified in published literature. A link to a published experimental work indirectly verifying the proposed procedure is provided. The calibration does not require knowledge of internal probe properties and yields a small and universal set of parameters that can be used to quantify thermal resistance presented to the probe by samples as well as to characterize active-mode SThM probes of any type and at any measurement frequency. We have illustrated how the probe calibration parameters can be used to guide probe design. We have also analyzed when the calibration approach can be used directly to measure thermal conductivity of unknown samples.</description>

      <title>Cascade of strongly correlated quantum states in a partially filled kagome flat band</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06933v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Coulomb interactions among charge carriers that occupy an electronic flat band have a profound impact on the macroscopic properties of materials. At sufficient strength, these interactions can give rise to captivating phenomena such as quantum criticality, Mott-Hubbard states, and unconventional superconductivity. The appearance of these characteristics sensitively depends on the number of electrons occupying the flat band states. In this work, we present experimental evidence obtained from scanning tunneling microscopy measurements for a cascade of strongly correlated states appearing in the partially occupied kagome flat bands of Co$_{1-x}$Fe$_x$Sn whose filling can be controlled by the Fe-doping level $x$. At elevated temperatures ($T\geq16\,K$), we detect a nematic electronic state across a broad doping range $0.05&lt;x&lt;0.25$. The comparison with model calculations reveals that strong Coulomb interactions ($U&gt;100\,$meV) blend the states of two $3d$-orbital derived flat bands and impart a nematic order parameter. This state serves as the parent phase of a strongly correlated phase diagram: At lower temperatures $T&lt;16\,$K, we find spectroscopic evidence for an orbital-selective Mott state enabled by the $3d$-orbital degeneracy of the Co atom. This state can only be detected in samples with ideal Fe doping ($x=0.17$) and descends into pseudogap phases upon electron and hole doping. At $T&lt;8\,$K, the pseudogap phase evolves into another nematic low temperature state. Our observations demonstrate that the electronic ground state of a kagome flat band depends on the complex interplay between strong Coulomb repulsion, $3d$-orbital degeneracy, and flat band filling fraction at different temperatures.</description>

      <title>General Stacking Theory for Altermagnetism in Bilayer Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06964v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) altermagnetism was recently proposed to be attainable in twisted antiferromagnetic bilayers providing an experimentally feasible approach to realize it in 2D materials. Nevertheless, a comprehensive understanding of the mechanism governing the appearance of altermagnetism in bilayer systems is still absent. In present letter, we address this gap by introducing a general stacking theory (GST) as a key condition for the emergence of altermagnetism in bilayer systems. The GST provides straightforward criteria to predict whether a bilayer demonstrates altermagnetic spin splitting, solely based on the layer groups of the composing monolayers. According to the GST, only seven point groups of bilayers facilitate the emergence of altermagnetism. It is revealed that, beyond the previously proposed antiferromagnetic twisted vdW stacking, altermagnetism can even emerge in bilayers formed through the symmetrically restricted direct stacking of two monolayers. By combining the GST and first-principles calculations, we present illustrative examples of bilayers demonstrating altermagnetism. Our work establishes a robust framework for designing diverse bilayer systems with altermagnetism, thereby opening up new avenues for both fundamental research and practical applications in this field.</description>

      <title>Moir\'e exciton polaron engineering via twisted hBN</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.06999v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Twisted hexagonal boron nitride (thBN) exhibits emergent ferroelectricity due to the formation of moir\'e superlattices with alternating AB and BA domains. These domains possess electric dipoles, leading to a periodic electrostatic potential that can be imprinted onto other 2D materials placed in its proximity. Here we demonstrate the remote imprinting of moir\'e patterns from twisted hexagonal boron nitride (thBN) onto monolayer MoSe2 and investigate the resulting changes in the exciton properties. We confirm the imprinting of moir\'e patterns on monolayer MoSe2 via proximity using Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) and hyperspectral photoluminescence (PL) mapping. By developing a technique to create large ferroelectric domain sizes ranging from 1 {\mu}m to 8.7 {\mu}m, we achieve unprecedented potential modulation of 387 +- 52 meV. We observe the formation of exciton polarons due to charge redistribution caused by the antiferroelectric moir\'e domains and investigate the optical property changes induced by the moir\'e pattern in monolayer MoSe2 by varying the moir\'e pattern size down to 110 nm. Our findings highlight the potential of twisted hBN as a platform for controlling the optical and electronic properties of 2D materials for optoelectronic and valleytronic applications.</description>

      <title>Low-energy critical behavior in two-dimensional tilted semi-Dirac semimetals driven by fermion-fermion interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07126v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Employing the renormalization group approach, we carefully investigate the critical behavior of two-dimensional tilted semi-Dirac semimetals induced by the fermion-fermion interactions in the low-energy regime. After incorporating all one-loop corrections, we derive the coupled RG equations of all related parameters and introduce two distinct strategies, named as Strategy I and Strategy II, to describe different scenarios. A detailed numerical analysis yields several interesting behavior in the low-energy limit. At first, we notice that the fermion-fermion interactions either vanish or diverge in the Strategy I, depending on the initial values of the tilting parameter and the fermionic couplings, whereas these interactions in the Strategy II always diverge at a certain critical energy scale, which is associated with the initial conditions. Next, the microstructural parameter $\alpha$ and the fermion velocity $v_F$ in the Strategy I share the similar behavior with their Strategy II counterparts. It is observed that fermion-fermion interactions lead to an increase in $\alpha$ while driving a decrease in $v_F$. Furthermore, the system can either be attracted by the Gaussian fixed point (GFP) or certain relatively fixed point (RFP) in the Strategy I. However, it always flow towards the RFP in the Strategy II at the lowest-energy limit. These results would provide helpful insights into the studies on observable quantities and phase transitions in the two-dimensional tilted semi-Dirac semimetals and the analogous semimetals.</description>

      <title>Flow is slow at the nanoscale: Revisiting the Green-Kubo relation for friction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07134v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A central aim of statistical mechanics is to establish connections between a system's microscopic fluctuations and its macroscopic response to a perturbation. For non-equilibrium transport properties, this amounts to establishing Green-Kubo (GK) relationships. In hydrodynamics, relating such GK expressions for liquid-solid friction to macroscopic slip boundary conditions has remained a long-standing problem due to two challenges: (i) The GK running integral of the force autocorrelation function decays to zero rather than reaching a well-defined plateau value; and (ii) debates persist on whether such a transport coefficient measures an intrinsic interfacial friction or an effective friction in the system. Inspired by ideas from the coarse-graining community, we derive a GK relation for liquid-solid friction where the force autocorrelation is sampled with a constraint of momentum conservation in the liquid. Our expression does not suffer from the "plateau problem" and unambiguously measures an effective friction coefficient, in an analogous manner to Stokes' law. We further establish a link between the derived friction coefficient and the hydrodynamic slip length, enabling a straightforward assessment of continuum hydrodynamics across length scales. We find that continuum hydrodynamics describes the simulation results quantitatively for confinement length all the way down to 1 nm. Our results also make clear that water flow under nano-confinement is orders of magnitude slower compared to the macroscopic case. Our approach amounts to a straightforward modification to the present standard method of quantifying interfacial friction from molecular simulations, making possible a sensible comparison between surfaces of vastly different slippage.</description>

      <title>Existence of higher degree minimizers in the magnetic skyrmion problem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.07205v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate existence of topologically nontrivial energy minimizing maps of a given positive degree from bounded domains in the plane to $\mathbb S^2$ in a variational model describing magnetizations in ultrathin ferromagnetic films with Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. Our strategy is to insert tiny truncated Belavin-Polyakov profiles in carefully chosen locations of lower degree objects such that the total energy increase lies strictly below the expected Dirichlet energy contribution, ruling out loss of degree in the limits of minimizing sequences. The argument requires that the domain be either sufficiently large or sufficiently slender to accommodate a prescribed degree. We also show that these higher degree minimizers concentrate on point-like skyrmionic configurations in a suitable parameter regime.</description>

      <title>Excitonic signatures of ferroelectric order in parallel-stacked MoS$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07234v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Interfacial ferroelectricity, prevalent in various parallel-stacked layered materials, allows switching of out-of-plane ferroelectric order by in-plane sliding of adjacent layers. Its resilience against doping potentially enables next-generation storage and logic devices. However, studies have been limited to indirect sensing or visualization of ferroelectricity. For transition metal dichalcogenides, there is little knowledge about the influence of ferroelectric order on their intrinsic valley and excitonic properties. Here, we report direct probing of ferroelectricity in few-layer 3R-MoS$_2$ using reflectance contrast spectroscopy. Contrary to a simple electrostatic perception, layer-hybridized excitons with out-of-plane electric dipole moment remain decoupled from ferroelectric ordering, while intralayer excitons with in-plane dipole orientation are sensitive to it. Ab initio calculations identify stacking-specific interlayer hybridization leading to this asymmetric response. Exploiting this sensitivity, we demonstrate optical readout and control of multi-state polarization with hysteretic switching in a field-effect device. Time-resolved Kerr ellipticity reveals a direct correspondence between spin-valley dynamics and stacking order.</description>

      <title>Water Desalination by Ferroelectric Nanoparticles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.07318v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The fundamental aspect of physics of ferroelectric materials is the screening of uncompensated bound charges by the dissociative adsorption of ionic charges from the environment. The adsorption of ions can be especially strong when the ferroelectric undergoes the temperature induced transition from the paraelectric phase to the ferroelectric state. Here we demonstrate that the adsorption of ions and free radicals by the polar surface of ferroelectric nanoparticles can be very efficient in aqueous solutions due to the strong ferro-ionic coupling in the nanoparticles. Obtained results can be useful for the elaboration of alternative methods and tools for adsorption of the cations (Li+, K+, Na+, etc.), anions (Cl-, Br-, J-), and/or free radicals (CO-, NH4+, etc.) from aqueous solutions by the lead-free uniaxial ferroelectric nanoparticles. The results may become an alternative way for the environment-friendly cleaning of different aqueous solutions from ionic contamination as well as for the desalination of sea water using the natural temperature variations.</description>

      <title>Development of an embedded-atom method potential of Ni-Mo alloys for electrocatalysis / surface compositional studies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07320v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ni-Mo superalloys have emerged as materials of choice for a diverse array of applications owing to their superior mechanical properties, exceptional corrosion and oxidation resistance, electrocatalytic behavior, and surface stability. Understanding and optimizing the surface composition of Ni-Mo alloys is critical for enhancing their performance in practical applications. Traditional experimental surface analysis techniques, while informative, are often prohibitive in terms of cost and time. Likewise, theoretical approaches such as first-principle calculations demand substantial computational resources and it is difficult to simulate large structures. This study introduces an alternative approach utilizing hybrid Monte-Carlo / Molecular Dynamics (MC/MD) simulations to investigate the surface composition of Ni-Mo alloys. We report the development of an optimized Embedded-Atom Method (EAM) potential specifically for Ni-Mo alloys, carefully parameterized using empirical lattice constants and formation energies of elemental and face-centered cubic (FCC) Ni-Mo solid solution alloys. The reliability of the EAM potential is corroborated via the evaluation of equations of state, with a particular focus on reproducing structural properties. Utilizing this validated potential, MC/MD simulations were performed to understand the depth-wise variations in the compositions of Ni-Mo alloy nanoparticles and extended surfaces. These simulations reveal a preferential segregation of nickel on surface, and molybdenum in sub-surface layer. Due to this preferential segregation, it is imperative to consider surface segregation while tailoring the surface properties for targeted applications.</description>

Abstract: Although plasmons and phonons are the collective excitations that govern the low-energy physics of doped semiconductors, their nonadiabatic hybridization and mutual screening have not been studied from first principles. We achieve this goal by transforming the Dyson equation to the frequency-independent dynamical matrix of an equivalent damped oscillator. Calculations on doped GaAs and TiO2 agree well with available Raman data and await immediate experimental confirmation from infrared, neutron, electron-energy-loss, and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopies.</description>

      <title>An effective and reliable approach to the phase problem in single-shot single-particle Coherent Diffraction Imaging</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.07413v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Coherent Diffraction Imaging (CDI) is an experimental technique to get images of isolated structures by recording the light scattered off the sample. Thanks to the extremely bright and short coherent light pulses provided by X-ray Free Electron Lasers, CDI makes it possible to study nanostructures in the gas phase and get time-resolved snapshots of their ultrafast dynamics with unprecedented resolution. In principle, the sample density can be recovered from the scattered light field through a straightforward Fourier Transform operation. However, only the amplitude of the field is recorded, while the phase is lost during the measurement process and has to be retrieved by means of suitable, well-established, phase retrieval algorithms. We present the Memetic Phase Retrieval (MPR) method, an improved approach to the phase retrieval problem, which makes use of a combination of existing phase retrieval algorithms and evolutionary algorithms to mitigate the shortcomings of conventional approaches. We benchmark the method on experimental data acquired in two experimental campaigns at SwissFEL and European XFEL. Imaging results on isolated nanostructures reveal considerable stability of the algorithm's behavior on the input parameters, as well as the capability of identifying the solution in challenging conditions. A user-friendly implementation of the MPR method is released as open-source software, aiming at being a reference tool for the FEL imaging community.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.09747v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate gate-tunable giant field-dependent nonreciprocal transport (magnetochiral anisotropy) in a noncentrosymmetric superconductor $T_{\rm d}$-MoTe$_2$ in the thin limit. Giant magnetochiral anisotropy (MCA) with a rectification coefficient $\gamma$ = $3.1 \times 10^6$ T$^{-1}$ A$^{-1}$, is observed at 230 mK, below the superconducting transition temperature ($T_c$). This is one of the largest values reported so far and is likely attributed to the reduced symmetry of the crystal structure. The temperature dependence of $\gamma$ indicates that the ratchet-like motion of magnetic vortices is the origin of the MCA, as supported by our theoretical model. For bilayer $T_{\rm d}$-MoTe$_2$, we successfully perform gate control of the MCA and realize threefold modulation of $\gamma$. Our experimental results provide a new route to realizing electrically controllable superconducting rectification devices in a single material.</description>

Abstract: We consider adiabatic quantum pumping through a resonant level model, a single-level quantum dot connected to two fermionic leads. Using the tools of adiabatic expansion, we develop a self-contained thermodynamic description of this model accounting for the variation of the energy level of the dot and the tunnelling rates with the thermal baths. This enables us to study various examples of pumping cycles computing the relevant thermodynamic quantities, such as the entropy produced and the dissipated power. These quantities are compared with the transport properties of the system, i.e. the pumped charge and the charge noise. Among other results, we find that the entropy production rate vanishes in the charge quantization limit while the dissipated power is quantized in the same limit.</description>

Abstract: The observation of the Sagnac effect for massive material particles offers a significant enhancement in sensitivity when compared to optical interferometers with equal area and angular rotation velocity. For this reason, there have been suggestions to employ solid-state interferometers that rely on semiconductors and graphene. We investigate the Sagnac effect in Dirac materials governed by the relativisticlike quasiparticle dispersion law and show that the fringe shift is still determined by the mass of a free electron. This confirms that graphene is indeed a promising material for creating solid-state Sagnac interferometers. Considering monolayer graphene with its linear dispersion law and comparing it with light provides a deeper understanding of the Sagnac effect.</description>

Abstract: Pairing of electrons is ubiquitous in electronic systems featuring attractive inter-electron interactions, as exemplified in superconductors. Counter-intuitively, it can also be mediated in certain circumstances by the repulsive Coulomb interaction alone. Quantum Hall (QH) Fabry-P\'erot interferometers (FPIs) tailored in two-dimensional electron gas under a perpendicular magnetic field has been argued to exhibit such unusual electron pairing seemingly without attractive interaction. Here, we show evidence in graphene QH FPIs revealing not only a similar electron pairing at bulk filling factor nu=2 but also an unforeseen emergence of electron tripling characterized by a fractional Aharonov-Bohm flux period h/3e (h is the Planck constant and e the electron charge) at nu=3. Leveraging a novel plunger-gate spectroscopy, we demonstrate that electron pairing (tripling) involves correlated charge transport on two (three) entangled QH edge channels. This spectroscopy indicates a quantum interference flux-periodicity determined by the sum of the phases acquired by the distinct QH edge channels having slightly different interfering areas. While recent theory invokes the dynamical exchange of neutral magnetoplasmons -- dubbed neutralons -- as mediator for electron pairing, our discovery of three entangled QH edge channels with apparent electron tripling defies understanding and introduces a new three-body problem for interacting fermions.</description>

      <title>Quantization of optical quasinormal modes for spatially separated cavity systems with finite retardation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07741v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A multi-cavity quantization scheme is developed using quasinormal modes (QNMs) of optical cavities embedded in a homogeneous background medium for cases where retardation is significant in the inter-cavity coupling. Using quantities that can be calculated in computational optics with numerical Maxwell solvers, we extend previous QNM quantization schemes and define a quantitative measure to determine if a separate quantization of QNM cavities is justified or if a joint quantization of the system is necessary. We test this measure for the examples of two coupled one-dimensional dielectric slabs and a dimer of metal nanorods acting as QNM cavities. For sufficiently large separations, the new scheme allows for an efficient treatment of multi-cavity phenomena using parameters defined for the individual cavities. Formulating the Hamiltonian in a familiar system-bath form, the scheme connects the rigorous QNM theory and widespread phenomenological models of open cavities coupled to a shared photonic bath with parameters obtained directly from Maxwell calculations.</description>

      <title>Connecting physics to systems with modular spin-circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19345v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An emerging paradigm in modern electronics is that of CMOS + $\sf X$ requiring the integration of standard CMOS technology with novel materials and technologies denoted by $\sf X$. In this context, a crucial challenge is to develop accurate circuit models for $\sf X$ that are compatible with standard models for CMOS-based circuits and systems. In this perspective, we present physics-based, experimentally benchmarked modular circuit models that can be used to evaluate a class of CMOS + $\sf X$ systems, where $\sf X$ denotes magnetic and spintronic materials and phenomena. This class of materials is particularly challenging because they go beyond conventional charge-based phenomena and involve the spin degree of freedom which involves non-trivial quantum effects. Starting from density matrices $-$ the central quantity in quantum transport $-$ using well-defined approximations, it is possible to obtain spin-circuits that generalize ordinary circuit theory to 4-component currents and voltages (1 for charge and 3 for spin). With step-by-step examples that progressively become more complex, we illustrate how the spin-circuit approach can be used to start from the physics of magnetism and spintronics to enable accurate system-level evaluations. We believe the core approach can be extended to include other quantum degrees of freedom like valley and pseudospins starting from corresponding density matrices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01278v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we discuss an extension of the geometric description of graphene wormholes in a non-inertial situation. We present an effective metric that describes the wormhole connection between two graphene sheets with matter content in rotation. Additionally, a stretching term as a function of the classical redshift of space has been found and discussed. We also explore the influence of a rotation term on quantum holonomy, recovering previous results found for the static case.</description>

      <title>Internal tensorial variables and a heat transport equation with inertial, thermal viscosity and vorticity terms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06380v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Taking into account some results obtained within the framework of non-equilibrium thermodynamics with internal variables (NET-IV) in a previous paper, where generalized Guyer-Krumhansl evolution equations for the heat flux in heat rigid conductors were derived, in this paper we obtain a heat transport equation describing conductive, viscous and vortical motions of phonons. To do so, we take as independent variables the internal energy, the heat flux, and a tensorial internal variable, with a symmetric part and an antisymmetric part, which turns out to be related to the rotational terms in the final equation. Besides the shear phonon viscosity arising in usual phonon hydrodynamics, we propose a rotational phonon viscosity, which would describe a transfer from ordered rotational motion of phonon vortices to rotational microscopic motions of diatomic particles constituting complex polar crystals, in analogy to the hydrodynamics of classical micropolar fluids. This possibility emphasizes the interest of exploring the interactions between the average heat flow and the heat vortices found in some models of phonon hydrodynamics.</description>

      <title>Periodic potential can enormously boost free particle transport induced by active fluctuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.01465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.01465v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Active fluctuations are detected in a growing number of systems due to self-propulsion mechanisms or collisions with active environment. They drive the system far from equilibrium and can induce phenomena which at equilibrium states are forbidden by e.g. fluctuation-dissipation relations and detailed balance symmetry. Understanding of their role in living matter is emerging as a challenge for physics. Here we demonstrate a paradoxical effect in which a free particle transport induced by active fluctuations can be boosted by many orders of magnitude when the particle is additionally subjected to a periodic potential. In contrast, within the realm of only thermal fluctuations the velocity of a free particle exposed to a bias is reduced when the periodic potential is switched on. The presented mechanism is significant for understanding nonequilibrium environments such as living cells where it can explain from a fundamental point of view why spatially periodic structures known as microtubules are necessary to generate impressively effective intracellular transport. Our findings can be readily corroborated experimentally e.g. in a setup comprising a colloidal particle in an optically generated periodic potential.</description>

      <title>Helical Luttinger liquid on a space-time lattice</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.10828v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Luttinger model is a paradigm for the breakdown due to interactions of the Fermi liquid description of one-dimensional massless Dirac fermions. Attempts to discretize the model on a one-dimensional lattice have failed to reproduce the established bosonization results, because of the fermion-doubling obstruction: A local and symmetry-preserving discretization of the Hamiltonian introduces a spurious second species of low-energy excitations, while a nonlocal discretization opens a single-particle gap at the Dirac point. Here we show how to work around this obstruction, by discretizing both space and time to obtain a \textit{local} Lagrangian for a helical Luttinger liquid with Hubbard interaction. The approach enables quantum Monte Carlo simulations that preserve the topological protection of an unpaired Dirac cone.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03611v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We perform network analysis of a system described by the master equation to estimate the lower bound of the steady-state current noise, starting from the level 2.5 large deviation function and using the graph theory approach. When the transition rates are uniform, and the system is driven to a non-equilibrium steady state by unidirectional transitions, we derive a noise lower bound, which accounts for fluctuations of sojourn times at all states and is expressed using mesh currents. This bound is applied to the uncertainty in the signal-to-noise ratio of the fluctuating computation time of a schematic Brownian computation plus reset process described by a graph containing one cycle. Unlike the mixed and pseudo-entropy bounds that increase logarithmically with the length of the intended computation path, this bound depends on the number of extraneous predecessors and thus captures the logical irreversibility.</description>

      <title>Sub-meV Linewidths in Polarized Low-Temperature Photoluminescence of 2D PbS Nanoplatelets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19821v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Colloidal semiconductor nanocrystals are promising materials for classical and quantum light sources due to their versatile chemistry and efficient photoluminescence (PL) properties. While visible emitters are well-established, the pursuit of excellent (near-)infrared sources continues. One notable candidate in this regard are photoluminescent two-dimensional (2D) PbS nanoplatelets (NPLs) exhibiting excitonic emission at 720 nm (1.7 eV) directly tying to the typical emission range limit of CdSe NPLs. Here, we present the first comprehensive analysis of low-temperature PL from this material class. Ultrathin 2D PbS NPLs exhibit high crystallinity confirmed by scanning transmission electron microscopy, and revealing Moire patterns in overlapping structures. At 4K, we observe unique PL features in single PbS NPLs, including narrow zero-phonon lines with line widths down to 0.6 meV and a linear degree of polarization up to 90%. Time-resolved measurements identify trions as the dominant emission source with a 2.3 ns decay time. Sub-meV spectral diffusion and no immanent blinking over minutes is observed, as well as discrete spectral jumps without memory effects. These findings advance the understanding and underpin the potential of colloidal PbS NPLs for optical and quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Topological pairing of composite fermions via criticality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09050v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The fractional quantum Hall effect (FQHE) at the filling factor with an even denominator, 5/2, occurs despite the expectation, due to the electron statistics, that the denominator must be an odd number. It is believed that the Cooper pairing of underlying quasiparticles, composite fermions (CFs), leads to the explanation of this effect. Such a state should have a Pfaffian form of the BCS wave function (due to the absence of spin) and non-Abelian statistics of possible vortex-like excitations (due to the $p$-wave nature of the pairing). Here we expose the origin of pairing by using the effective dipole representation of the problem and show that pairing is encoded in a Hamiltonian that describes the interaction of the charge density with dipoles i.e. the current of CFs. The necessary condition for the paired state to exist is the effective dipole physics at the Fermi level as a consequence of the non-trivial topology of the ideal band in which electrons live - a Landau level (LL); the paired state is a resolution of the unstable, critical behaviour characterized by the distancing of correlation hole with respect to electron (and thus dipole) at the Fermi level due to the topology. We describe analytically this deconfined critical point, at which deconfinement of Majorana neutral fermions takes place. In the presence of large, short-range repulsive interaction inside a LL, the critical behavior may be stabilized into a regularized Fermi-liquid-like (FLL) state, like the one that characterizes the physics in the lowest LL (LLL), but in general, for an interaction with slowly decaying pseudopotentials, the system is prone to pairing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01319v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study dissipationless spin transport induced by a charge supercurrent in a monolayer van der Waals superconductor under the applied magnetic field and in a bilayer superconductor/ferromagnet (S/F) heterostructure with no external field. It is shown that in both cases a combined action of the Ising-type spin-orbit coupling and the Zeeman field results in appearance of a nonunitary superconducting triplet correlations with nonzero average Cooper pair spin, which carry spin current in the presence of a condensate motion. Properties of this dissipationless spin current are investigated. In particular, it is shown that it manifests a rectification effect. In addition, in S/F heterostructures the amplitude and the sign of the spin current are controlled by gating.</description>
