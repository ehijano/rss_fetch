      <title>Non-Gaussianities in Collider Metric Binning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03809v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metrics for rigorously defining a distance between two events have been used to study the properties of the dataspace manifold of particle collider physics. The probability distribution of pairwise distances on this dataspace is unique with probability 1, and so this suggests a method to search for and identify new physics by the deviation of measurement from a null hypothesis prediction. To quantify the deviation statistically, we directly calculate the probability distribution of the number of event pairs that land in the bin a fixed distance apart. This distribution is not generically Gaussian and the ratio of the standard deviation to the mean entries in a bin scales inversely with the square-root of the number of events in the data ensemble. If the dataspace manifold exhibits some enhanced symmetry, the number of entries is Gaussian, and further fluctuations about the mean scale away like the inverse of the number of events. We define a robust measure of the non-Gaussianity of the bin-by-bin statistics of the distance distribution, and demonstrate in simulated data of jets from quantum chromodynamics sensitivity to the parton-to-hadron transition and that the manifold of events enjoys enhanced symmetries as their energy increases.</description>

      <title>Apparent convergence in functional glueball calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03821v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We scrutinize the determination of glueball masses in pure Yang-Mills theory from functional equations, i.e. Dyson-Schwinger and Bethe-Salpeter equations. We survey the state-of-the-art input (dressed propagators and vertices) with an emphasis on the stability of the results under extensions of the employed truncations and explore the importance of different aspects of the bound state equations, focusing on the three lightest glueballs with $J^{PC} = 0^{++}$ , $0^{-+}$ and $2^{++}$ . As an important systematic extension compared to previous calculations we include two-loop diagrams in the Bethe-Salpeter kernels. In terms of the glueball spectrum we find only marginal mass shifts compared to previous results, indicating apparent convergence of the system. As a by-product, we also explore gauge invariance within a class of Landau-type gauges.</description>

      <title>Prospects for observing a novel photon-induced $H^-H^+$ production at HL-LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03822v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the production of charged scalar boson pairs via photon-induced $H^{-}H^{+}$ in $pp$ collisions at the forthcoming High Luminosity Large Hadron Collider (HL-LHC). The predictions are based on the Two-Higgs Doublet Model type-III, since it predicts large branching ratios of the channel decay $H^{\pm}\to \tau^{\pm}\nu_{\tau}$, which is the one we focus on. Motivated by the current excess of events in the process $\mathcal{BR}(t\to H^\pm b)\times \mathcal{BR}(H^\pm\to cb)$ for $M_{H^{\pm}}=130$ GeV, we explore charged Higgs bosons masses $M_{H^{\pm}}$ among 100-150 GeV. According to benchmarks points allowed by experimental constraints, and including a systematic uncertainty of 5$\%$, we obtain for the process of $H^-H^+\to \tau\nu_\tau\tau\nu_\tau\to e\mu+\slashed{E}_T$ a \textit{signal significance} at $5\sigma$ ($3\sigma$) for $M_{H^{\pm}}=100$ GeV ($100\leq M_{H^\pm} \leq 136$ GeV) with 3000 $fb^{-1}$ ($\gtrsim 1000\,fb^{-1}$) integrated luminosity, which would be the last stage foreseen for Large Hadron Collider machine.</description>

      <title>Bounds on neutrino-DM interactions from TXS 0506+056 neutrino outburst</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03823v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We constrain the neutrino-dark matter cross-section using the $13 \pm 5$ neutrino event excess observed by IceCube in 2014-2015 from the direction of the blazar TXS 0506+056. Our analysis takes advantage of the dark matter overdensity spike surrounding the supermassive black hole at the center of the blazar. In our results, we take into account uncertainties related to the different types of neutrino emission models and the features of the dark matter spike, considering cross-sections that scale with energy as $\sigma \propto (E_{\nu} /E_0)^n$, for values of $n = 1, 0, -1, -2$. In our best-case scenario, we obtain limits competitive with those derived from other active galaxies, tidal disruption events (TDEs), and the IC-170922A event.</description>

      <title>Higgs near-criticality at future colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The so-called metastability bound on the Higgs mass suggests that the smallness of the Higgs mass may be a byproduct of the metastability of the electroweak vacuum. A significantly strong bound requires new physics capable of lowering the scale where the Higgs quartic coupling turns negative through renormalization group effects, without destabilizing the electroweak vacuum entirely. We analyze in this context the low-scale Majoron model of neutrino masses, which automatically contains two key elements for a viable scenario: heavy fermions to lower the instability scale and a extended scalar sector to stabilize the potential and achieve realistic lifetimes for the electroweak vacuum. We show how the metastability bound can be generalized to theories with multiple scalars and present an efficient way of calculating the tunneling rate in such potentials. We also demonstrate that FCC will probe regions of the parameter space relevant for metastability: large regions of the fermionic sector at FCC-ee and some reach to the scalar sector at FCC-hh.</description>

      <title>The ABC of RPV II: Classification of R-parity Violating Signatures from UDD Couplings and their Coverage at the LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03830v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform a detailed study of the current phenomenological status of baryon number violating operators within the framework of the $R$-parity violating Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (RPV-MSSM). This study aims to identify any gaps in the experimental coverage of the RPV landscape. We identify the unique final states for all possible LSPs decaying via four different benchmark UDD operators. Both the direct production of the LSP and its production via gauge-cascades are considered. For each LSP, we assume that only one UDD coupling is non-zero at a time and confront the signals with existing ATLAS and CMS searches implemented in the recasting framework \texttt{CheckMATE\;2}. We find that the UDD colored LSP sector is well covered with the mass bounds on the gluino LSP being the strongest, and with possible improvements for some of the right-handed squark LSPs. We also point out that there is limited coverage for electroweakino and slepton LSPs with UDD decays. This limitation may be due to the lack of targeted experimental searches for these specific final states or the appropriate recasting of existing searches.</description>

      <title>WIMPs and new physics interpretations of the PTA signal are incompatible</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03857v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In order to explain the large amplitude of the nano-Hertz stochastic gravitational wave background observed in pulsar timing arrays (PTA), primordial sources must be particularly energetic. This is correlated to the generation of large density fluctuations, later collapsing into ultra-compact mini-halo (UCMHs). We demonstrate that if dark matter is made of WIMPs, then photon and neutrino fluxes from UCMHs produced by curvature peaks, first-order phase transition and domain wall interpretations of the PTA signal, exceed current bounds.</description>

      <title>Implications of recent Higgs data for the light CP-odd Higgs boson in the GNMSSM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study systematically examines the parameter space of GNMSSM with a light CP-odd Higgs boson $a_1$, emphasizing the exotic decay $h_{125}\to a_1a_1$ under recent Higgs data constraints. Firstly, We scan the parameter space under the basic constraints from \textsf{HiggsSignals-2.6.2} and \textsf{HiggsBounds-5.10.2}, and then further filter the surviving parameter points using constraints from the LHC direct Higgs searches and \textsf{HiggsTools}. Comparative analysis demonstrates that the code \textsf{HiggsTools} imposes stringent constraints compared to legacy versions of \textsf{HiggsSignals-2.6.2} and \textsf{HiggsBounds-5.10.2}.
  Moreover, its exclusion capacity notably exceeds the direct individual decay channel searches. Through comparative analysis of the two types of constraints (\textsf{HiggsSignals} and \textsf{HiggsBounds}) embedded in the HiggsTools, we found that the constraints from \textsf{HiggsBounds} are the most stringent. Almost all parameter points excluded by \textsf{HiggsSignals} and the individual decay channel analyses at the LHC can also be excluded by \textsf{HiggsBounds}. This is because \textsf{HiggsBounds} provides direct constraints, while \textsf{HiggsSignals} imposes indirect constraints for the searches of non-SM Higgs bosons. In the $h_2$ scenario, due to the the kinematic accessibility of the exotic decay channel $h_2 \to h_1h_1$, \textsf{HiggsSignals} can also exclude the parameter points with smaller values of $Br(h\to a_1 a_1\to \tau\tau/\mu\mu bb)$. Despite rigorous experimental limitations constraining the light CP-odd Higgs scenario, our comprehensive investigation still reveals viable parameter regions, which opens new avenues for future exploration of light Higgs phenomenology.</description>

      <title>SU(7) Grand Gauge-Higgs Unification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a model of six dimensional $SU(7)$ grand gauge-Higgs unification compactified on $S^1/Z_2 /times S^1/Z_2$, which is a six dimensional extension of five dimensional $SU(4)$ gauge-Higgs unification predicting the weak mixing angle $/sin^2 /theta_W=1/4$ at the compactification scale. We investigate whether the correct pattern of electroweak symmetry breaking is realized in our model. We find some solutions providing the electroweak symmetry breaking and a realistic Higgs mass. Corresponding to each solution, the compactification scale of the fifth dimension is predicted. Furthermore, we evaluate the weak mixing angle at the weak scale by using one-loop renormalization group equation and find it to be in good agreement with the experimental data.</description>

      <title>Searching for Dark Photon Tridents Through Primordial Black Hole Signatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04175v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The detection of gamma-ray signals from primordial black holes (PBHs) could provide compelling evidence for their role as a dark matter candidate, particularly through the observation of their Hawking radiation. Future gamma-ray observatories, such as e-ASTROGAM, and the next-generation telescopes, are poised to explore this possibility by measuring both Standard Model (SM) and beyond-the-SM particle emissions. A particularly promising avenue involves production of dark photons by PBHs, which is a hypothetical particle that decays into photons. In this work, we investigate the trident decay of dark photons focusing on their primary emission from PBHs. We assume that the dark photons produced via Hawking radiation decay into photons well before reaching Earth, thereby enhancing the detectable gamma-ray flux. The energy spectrum of the photons decaying from the dark photons is distinct from that of direct Hawking-radiated photons due to higher degree of freedom, leading to observable modifications in the gamma-ray signal. Using the asteroid-mass PBHs as a case study, we demonstrate that future gamma-ray missions could detect dark-photon signatures and distinguish them from conventional Hawking radiation. This approach enables the exploration of previously inaccessible parameter spaces in dark photon mass $m_{A^{\prime}}$ and their coupling to photons, offering a novel pathway to uncover the properties of dark sectors and the nature of PBHs.</description>

      <title>Studying Bremsstrahlung in Polarized Background Field at EIC and EicC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Within the framework of quantum field theory, we have studied bremsstrahlung radiation in polarized electromagnetic fields. It reveals that the resulting photon beams are polarized, reflecting the properties of the background field. We propose to observe this phenomenon via the Bethe-Heitler process and provide numerical estimates at the Electron-Ion Collider and the Electron-Ion Collider in China. This study introduces a novel approach to probing the structure of polarized background fields through bremsstrahlung radiation.</description>

      <title>Towards modeling the short-range interactions of hidden/open charm pentaquark molecular states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04264v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The hadronic $\Sigma_c^{(*)}\bar{D}^{(*)}$ and $\Sigma_c^{(*)}{D}^{(*)}$ interactions are revisited, with a focus on their short-range parts, motivated by a tension between the interpretations of $P_{c\bar{c}}(4312)$, $P_{c\bar{c}}(4440)$, and $P_{c\bar{c}}(4457)$ in effective field theory (EFT) frameworks and the one-boson-exchange (OBE) model. While the three states can be interpreted as $\Sigma_c\bar{D}^{(*)}$ molecular states within EFT frameworks, this is not feasible in the single-channel OBE model with consistent cutoff. In this work, the possibility to reconcile OBE model with EFTs by refitting the $\rho$-, $\omega$- and $\sigma$-exchange interaction is explored and ruled out. It is pointed out that the problem in OBE arises from the strong short-range spin-dependent one-pion-exchange (OPE) interaction and the fixed signs of other short-range interactions in OBE model also prevent the cancellation. To address this issue, the short-range subtraction strategies within the OBE model are revisited. Two subtraction schemes are explored: removing the delta-function from all interactions and eliminating it only from the pseudoscalar-meson-exchange component. These schemes favor different spin assignments for $P_{c\bar{c}}(4440)$ and $P_{c\bar{c}}(4457)$. Though solving the problem, there is no clear dynamical picture to support the subtraction schemes. We propose a new quark-exchange mechanism motivated by the Pauli principle. Different from the two subtraction schemes in OBE, the quark-exchange mechanism offers an explanation grounded in microscopic dynamics. It is shown that the spin-dependent quark-exchange interaction cancels those from OPE. The differences in the predictions for the spin, isospin, and open-charm partner states of the experimental $P_{c\bar{c}}$ states offer a way to distinguish between the subtracted OBE model and the OBE model with quark-exchange contributions.</description>

      <title>TRANSIT your events into a new mass: Fast background interpolation for weakly-supervised anomaly searches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04342v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a new model for conditional and continuous data morphing called TRansport Adversarial Network for Smooth InTerpolation (TRANSIT). We apply it to create a background data template for weakly-supervised searches at the LHC. The method smoothly transforms sideband events to match signal region mass distributions. We demonstrate the performance of TRANSIT using the LHC Olympics R\&amp;D dataset. The model captures non-linear mass correlations of features and produces a template that offers a competitive anomaly sensitivity compared to state-of-the-art transport-based template generators. Moreover, the computational training time required for TRANSIT is an order of magnitude lower than that of competing deep learning methods. This makes it ideal for analyses that iterate over many signal regions and signal models. Unlike generative models, which must learn a full probability density distribution, i.e., the correlations between all the variables, the proposed transport model only has to learn a smooth conditional shift of the distribution. This allows for a simpler, more efficient residual architecture, enabling mass uncorrelated features to pass the network unchanged while the mass correlated features are adjusted accordingly. Furthermore, we show that the latent space of the model provides a set of mass decorrelated features useful for anomaly detection without background sculpting.</description>

      <title>Spectra and azimuthal harmonic of charmed mesons in Pb+Pb collisions at LHC energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04411v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using the recombination model (RM) extended to the heavy flavor scenario, we investigate the production of charmed mesons, i.e., $D^0$, $D_s^+$ and $J/\psi$, in Pb+Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=2.76$ and 5.02 TeV at the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC) including the heavy flavor energy loss inside the hot and dense medium. Soft, semihard, and hard partons all play important roles in our model and are uniformly treated for all mesons produced. The resulting transverse momentum spectra and the second azimuthal harmonic $v_2$ for these mesons are presented and compared with the available experimental data. The good agreement provides strong support again that the quark recombination mechanism is a universal scheme of hadronization.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04464v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent observation of the ultra-high-energy neutrino event KM3-230213A by the KM3NeT experiment offers a compelling avenue to explore physics beyond the Standard Model. In this work, we explore a simplest possibility that this event originates from the decay of a super-heavy dark matter (SHDM). We consider a minimal extension of the type-I seesaw by including a singlet scalar and a singlet fermion DM, both being odd under a $Z_2$ symmetry. At high scale, the $Z_2$ symmetry is spontaneously broken by the vev of the $Z_2$ odd scalar, leading to i) mixing between DM and heavy right-handed neutrinos and ii) formation of domain walls (DW). In the former case, the decay of the DM to $\nu,h$ can give rise to the PeV neutrino event KM3-230213A. While, in the latter case, the disappearance of the DW can give rise to stochastic gravitational waves. We derive constraints on the DM lifetime as a function of DM mass ensuring consistency with IceCube, Auger upper limits and the observed KM3-230213A event. We found that KM3-230213A gives stringent constraint on DM mass ranging from $1.7\times10^8$ GeV to $5.5\times10^9$ GeV with lifetime $6.3\times10^{29}$ s to $3.6\times10^{29}$ s.</description>

      <title>Enhancing the sensitivity to ultralight bosonic dark matter using signal correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04484v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, numerous experiments have been proposed and conducted to search for ultralight bosonic dark matter (ULBDM). Signals from ULBDM in such experiments are characterized by extremely narrow spectral widths. A near-optimal detection strategy is to divide the data based on the signal coherence time and sum the power across these segments. However, the signal coherence time can extend beyond a day, making it challenging to construct contiguous segments of such a duration due to detector instabilities. In this work, we present a novel detection statistic that can coherently extract ULBDM signals from segments of arbitrary durations. Our detection statistic, which we refer to as coherent SNR, is a weighed sum of data correlations, whose weights are determined by the expected signal correlations. We demonstrate that coherent SNR achieves sensitivity independent of segment duration and surpasses the performance of the conventional incoherent-sum approach, through analytical arguments and numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Probing Dark Matter-Electron Interactions in the Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we consider Dark Matter (DM) interactions, and study the same in the light of the Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation (CMBR) data. In particular, we focus on the DM-electron interactions. Assuming that such interactions are mediated by rather heavy mediators, we consider effective operators describing the relevant interaction terms in the lagrangian. The presence of such interaction terms lead to both DM annihilation and DM-electron scattering (drag). We focus on operators which lead to velocity-independent DM annihilation and DM-electron scattering cross-sections. Using the CMBR data, we study the the implications of both of these effects imposing constraints on the respective effective operators. This analysis underscores the importance of taking both scattering and annihilation processes into consideration in the study of DM interactions. We observe that the constraints on the DM annihilation and scattering cross-sections can change, up to about 14% and 13% respectively, for the benchmark scenarios we considered, depending on the mass of DM, as compared to the scenario where only DM annihilation is accounted for.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.04573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We obtain stringent bounds on neutrino quantum decoherence from the analysis of SN1987A data. We show that for the decoherence model considered here, which allows for neutrino-loss along the trajectory, the bounds are many orders of magnitude stronger than the ones that can be obtained from the analysis of data from reactor neutrino oscillation experiments or neutrino telescopes.</description>

      <title>Investigating the nature of $N(1535)$ and $\Lambda(1405)$ in a quenched chiral quark model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04586v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we systematically study $N(1440)$, $N(1535)$, and $\Lambda(1405)$ in both the quenched three-quark and five-quark frameworks using the Gaussian Expansion Method (GEM) within the chiral quark model. Our calculations show that $N(1535)$ can be reproduced as a three-quark state ($N(1P)$), while $N(1440)$ and $\Lambda(1405)$ cannot be accommodated as the three-quark candidates, ($N(2S)$ and $\Lambda(1P)$), respectively. In the five-quark framework, we find that the $\Lambda K$ state for $N(1535)$ can not form a bound state, while in the $N\bar{K}$ channel there will $\Lambda(1405)$ form a shallow bound state. Based on the complex-scaling method, we performed complete coupled-channels calculations and obtained six resonance states with energies ranging from 1.8 GeV to 2.2 GeV, in addition with one bound state located around $\Sigma \pi$ channel. However, neither molecular candidates in $\Lambda K$ channel for $N(1535)$ nor $N\bar{K}$ for $\Lambda(1405)$ are included in these states. This is because the strong coupling between $N\bar{K}$ and $\Sigma \pi$ will make the $N\bar{K}$ unbound, while the weak coupling between $\Lambda K$ and $\Sigma K$ can not help form a stable structure around $\Lambda K$ threshold. Thus, under the quenched quark model, our results support $N(1535)$ as a three-quark state, while $N(1440)$ is neither a three-quark nor a five-quark state. In addition, we find that although $\Lambda(1405)$ can be primarily a five-quark state, it requires a mixture of three-quark and five-quark components for stability. In the future, an exploration on the mixing effects between bare baryons with these relevant two-body hadronic channel components will be carried out to further test our conclusions.</description>

      <title>Double Narrow-Line Signatures of Dark Matter Decay and New Constraints from XRISM Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04726v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the indirect detection search of the two-body decay of dark matter particles into final states containing a photon, a process predicted in various promising dark matter models such as axion-like particles and sterile neutrinos. Recent and near-future photon detectors with a resolution $
R \equiv \lambda/\Delta\lambda = O(1000) $ are primarily optimized for the velocity dispersion of dark matter in the Milky Way. When performing indirect detection of dark matter in objects other than the Milky Way, one should take into account the contribution from Milky Way dark matter. As a result, the dark matter signal observed by a detector is predicted to exhibit a two-peak structure in many targets, owing to the Doppler shift, differences in radial velocities and the good energy resolution. An analysis incorporating this two-peak effect was performed using the latest XRISM observation data of the Centaurus galaxy cluster~\cite{XRISM:2025axf}. Although, due to the relatively short observation time, our derived limit is weaker than some existing limits, among dark matter searches in galaxy clusters our limit is one of the most stringent (at least in certain mass ranges). We also perform the usual single-peak analysis, for considering the various scenarios, that prefer narrow-line photon from the faraway galaxy cluster. Future data releases from XRISM as well as other observatories will further strengthen our conclusions.</description>

      <title>Topological Quantum Dark Matter via Global Anomaly Cancellation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.21319v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Standard Model (SM) with 15 Weyl fermions per family (lacking the 16th, the sterile right-handed neutrino $\nu_R$) suffers from mixed gauge-gravitational anomalies tied to baryon number plus or minus lepton number ${\bf B} \pm {\bf L}$ symmetry. Including $\nu_R$ per family can cancel these anomalies, but when ${\bf B} \pm {\bf L}$ symmetry is preserved as discrete finite subgroups rather than a continuous U(1), the perturbative local anomalies become nonperturbative global anomalies. In this work, we systematically enumerate these gauge-gravitational global anomalies involving discrete ${\bf B} \pm {\bf L}$ that are enhanced from the fermion parity $\mathbb{Z}_2^{\rm F}$ to $\mathbb{Z}_{2N}^{\rm F}$, with $N=2,3,4,6,9$, etc. The ${\bf B} \pm {\bf L}$ discreteness is constrained by multi-fermion deformations beyond-the-SM and the family number $N_f$. Unlike the free quadratic $\nu_R$ Majorana mass gap preserving the minimal $\mathbb{Z}_2^{\rm F}$, we explore novel scenarios canceling $({\bf B} \pm {\bf L})$-gravitational anomalies while preserving the $\mathbb{Z}_{2N}^{\rm F}$ discrete symmetries, featuring 4d interacting gapped topological orders (potentially with or without low-energy TQFT descriptions) or gapless sectors (e.g., conformal field theories). We propose anomalous sectors as quantum dark matter to cancel SM's global anomalies. We find the $N_f=3$ uniqueness, when the $\mathbb{Z}_{2N}^{\rm F}$ representation from the faithful ${\bf B} + {\bf L}$ for baryons at $N=N_c=3$ is extended to the faithful ${\bf Q} + N_c {\bf L}$ for quarks at $N=N_c N_f=9$, this symmetry extension matches with the topological order dark matter construction. Key implications include: (1) a 5th force mediating between SM and dark matter via discrete gauge fields. (2) dark matter as topological order quantum matter with gapped anyon excitations at ends of extended defects. (3) topological leptogenesis.</description>

      <title>Evolution of a kink-antikink ensemble in a quantum vacuum</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.03808v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the $1+1$ flat spacetime dynamics of a classical field configuration corresponding to an ensemble of sine-Gordon kinks and antikinks, semi-classically coupled to a quantum field. This coupling breaks the integrability of the sine-Gordon model resulting in the background's decay into quantum radiation as kink-antikink pairs annihilate. We find evidence that, on average, the energy of the ensemble scales as $t^{-\alpha}$ with $\alpha&lt;1$ and independent of the coupling strength or the mass of the quantum field. The generalization of this result to domain wall networks in higher spacetime dimensions could be relevant to particle production in the early universe.</description>

      <title>Trial by FIRE: Probing the dark matter density profile of dwarf galaxies with GraphNPE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03812v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Dark Matter (DM) distribution in dwarf galaxies provides crucial insights into both structure formation and the particle nature of DM. GraphNPE (Graph Neural Posterior Estimator), first introduced in Nguyen et al. (2023), is a novel simulation-based inference framework that combines graph neural networks and normalizing flows to infer the DM density profile from line-of-sight stellar velocities. Here, we apply GraphNPE to satellite dwarf galaxies in the FIRE-2 Latte simulation suite of Milky Way-mass halos, testing it against both Cold and Self-Interacting DM scenarios. Our method demonstrates superior precision compared to conventional Jeans-based approaches, recovering DM density profiles to within the 95% confidence level even in systems with as few as 30 tracers. Moreover, we present the first evaluation of mass modeling methods in constraining two key parameters from realistic simulations: the peak circular velocity, $V_\mathrm{max}$, and the peak virial mass, $M_\mathrm{200m}^\mathrm{peak}$. Using only line-of-sight velocities, GraphNPE can reliably recover both $V_\mathrm{max}$ and $M_\mathrm{200m}^\mathrm{peak}$ within our quoted uncertainties, including those experiencing tidal effects ($\gtrsim$ 63% of systems are recovered with our 68% confidence intervals and $\gtrsim$ 92% within our 95% confidence intervals). The method achieves 10-20% accuracy in $V_\mathrm{max}$ recovery, while $M_\mathrm{200m}^\mathrm{peak}$ is recovered to 0.1-0.4 dex accuracy. This work establishes GraphNPE as a robust tool for inferring DM density profiles in dwarf galaxies, offering promising avenues for constraining DM models. The framework's potential extends beyond this study, as it can be adapted to non-spherical and disequilibrium models, showcasing the broader utility of simulation-based inference and graph-based learning in astrophysics.</description>

      <title>A First Look at "Continuous Spin" Gravity -- Time Delay Signatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03817v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the possibility that gravity is mediated by "continuous spin" particles, i.e., massless particles whose invariant spin scale $\rho_g$ is non-zero. In this case, the primary helicity-2 modes of gravitational radiation on a Minkowski background mix with a tower of integer-helicity partner modes under boosts, with $\rho_g$ controlling the degree of mixing. We develop a formalism for coupling spinless matter to continuous spin gravity at linearized level. Using this formalism, we calculate the time delay signatures induced by gravitational waves in an idealized laser interferometer detector. The fractional deviation from general relativity predictions is $O(\rho_g/\omega)$ for gravitational wave frequencies $\omega &gt;\rho_g$, and the effects of waves with $\omega \lesssim \rho_g$ are damped. The precision and low frequency ranges of gravitational wave detectors suggest potential sensitivity to spin scales at or below $\sim 10^{-14}$ eV at ground-based laser interferometers and $\sim 10^{-24}$ eV at pulsar timing arrays, motivating further analysis of observable signatures.</description>

      <title>Constrained many-body phases in a $\mathbb{Z}_2$-Higgs lattice gauge theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03828v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the ground-state phase diagram of a one-dimensional $\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge theory coupled to soft-core bosonic matter at unit filling, inspired by the Higgs sector of the standard model. Through a combination of analytical perturbative approaches, exact diagonalization, and density-matrix-renormalization-group simulations, we uncover a rich phase diagram driven by gauge-field-mediated resonant pair hopping and the confinement of single particles. The pair hopping results in a bunching state with superextensive energy and macroscopic particle number fluctuations at strong electric field strengths and weak on-site interactions. The bunching state crosses over into a pair superfluid phase as the on-site interaction increases, characterized by a finite superfluid density and powerlaw-decaying pair correlations. At large on-site interaction strengths and driven by effective interactions induced by the gauge constraint, the superfluid transitions into an incompressible pair Mott insulator phase. At weak field strengths and on-site interactions, we find a plasma-like region, where single bosons exhibit large short-range correlations and the ground state is composed almost equally of states with even and odd local boson occupation. The presence of a bunching state with large number fluctuations, which is difficult to study using classical numerics, motivates experimental realizations in hybrid boson-qubit quantum simulation platforms such as circuit QED, neutral atoms, and trapped ions. Our findings highlight the rich interplay between gauge fields and soft-core bosonic matter.</description>

      <title>Neutrino quantum kinetics in three flavors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.03835v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The impact of neutrino flavor conversion on the supernova mechanism is yet to be fully understood. We present multi-energy and multi-angle solutions of the neutrino quantum kinetic equations in three flavors, taking into account neutrino advection and non-forward collisions with the background medium. Flavor evolution is explored within a spherically symmetric shell surrounding the region of neutrino decoupling in the interior of a core-collapse supernova, relying on the outputs of a spherically symmetric core-collapse supernova model with a mass of $18.6 M_\odot$. We select two representative post-bounce times: $t_{\rm pb} = 0.25$ s (no angular crossings are present and flavor conversion is triggered by slow collective effects) and $t_{\rm pb} = 1$ s (angular crossings trigger fast flavor instabilities). We find that flavor equipartition is achieved in the antineutrino sector between $\bar\nu_e$ and $\bar\nu_x = (\bar\nu_\mu + \bar\nu_\tau)/2$ for both post-bounce times. In the neutrino sector, flavor equipartition between $\nu_e$ and $\nu_x$ seems more likely at later post-bounce times, where the neutrino emission properties among different flavors tend to approach each other, but it is not a generic feature. The exponential growth of the $\nu_\mu$--$\nu_\tau$ asymmetry due to three-flavor effects is responsible for differences between the quasi-steady configurations obtained in the three-flavor solution and in the two-flavor approximation. This has consequences on the neutrino heating rate, which is generally larger when all three flavors are taken into account and can increase up to $30\%$ with respect to the case where flavor conversion is neglected.</description>

      <title>A universal scaling of condensation temperature in quantum fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03937v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The phenomena of superconductivity and superfluidity are believed to originate from the same underlying physics, namely the condensation of either bosons or pairs of fermions (Cooper pairs). In this work I complied and analyzed literature data for a number of quantum fluids and showed that indeed they all follow the same simple scaling law. The critical temperature for condensation T$_c$ is found to scale with the condensate coherence length $\xi$ and the effective mass of condensing particles m$^{\ast}$. The scaling plot includes members of most known classes of superconductors, as well as a number of superfluids and condensates, such as $^3$He, $^4$He, dilute Bose and Fermi gases, excitons, polaritons, neutron superfluid and proton superconductor in neutron stars, nuclear pairing, quark--antiquark condensate and Higgs condensate. The scaling plot spans more that 24 orders of magnitude of critical temperatures, albeit the scaling exponent is not the one predicted by theory. The plot might help the search for a dark matter particle.</description>

      <title>Limitations of the paraxial beam model in the study of quantum vacuum signals</title>

Abstract: Studies of nonlinear quantum vacuum signals often model the driving laser fields as paraxial beams. This in particular holds for analytic approaches. While this allows for reliable predictions in most situations, there are also notable exceptions. A prominent example is the overestimation of the polarization-flipped signal photon yield in the collision of two equally focused, parallel polarized laser beams by a factor of about six. In the present work, we identify the origin of this deficiency and devise a strategy to obtain accurate closed-form expressions also in cases challenging the conventional (leading order) paraxial beam model. We demonstrate the potential of our approach on the example of two linearly polarized laser pulses colliding at a generic collision angle.</description>

      <title>Enhancing DUNE Physics Sensitivity with Light and Charge Calorimetry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.04432v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the potential of light calorimetry in liquid argon time projection chambers and its intrinsic self compensation properties, emphasizing its advantages alongside conventional charge calorimetry. Previous studies have demonstrated that light calorimetry can achieve energy resolution comparable to advanced charge based techniques, particularly for GeV scale neutrinos. In this work, we explore the complementarity of light calorimetry with charge calorimetry for precision measurements of key physics parameters in the DUNE, including CP violation (CPV) and mass hierarchy determination. While charge calorimetry provides superior resolution in CP phase measurements, light calorimetry independently offers significant insights into CPV and mass hierarchy sensitivities. Furthermore, our exposure versus CPV sensitivity studies indicate that the $5\sigma$ discovery potential is reached faster using light and charge calorimetry than with the traditional TDR based reconstruction methods. These findings highlight the promising role of light calorimetry as a simple yet effective reconstruction method, serving as a complementary approach to enhance the physics capabilities of DUNE.</description>

      <title>Synthetic and cosmological axion hybridization: entangled photons, (HBT) and quantum beats</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04533v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article it is argued that synthetic axions, emergent collective excitations in topological insulators or Weyl semimetals hybridize with the cosmological axion, a compelling dark matter candidate via a common two photon decay channel since they both couple to electromagnetic fields via a Chern-Simons term. We point out an analogy to a V-type three level system with the two upper levels identified with the synthetic and cosmological axions decaying into a two-photon state. The Weisskopf-Wigner theory of spontaneous decay in multi level atoms is complemented and extended to describe the dynamics of hybridization. The final two-photon state features both kinematic and polarization entanglement and displays quantum beats as a consequence of the interference between the decay paths. An initial population of either axion induces a population of the other via hybridization. Consequently, a dark matter axion condensate induces a condensate of the synthetic axion, albeit with small amplitude. We obtain a momentum and polarization resolved Hanbury- Brown Twiss (HBT) second order coherence describing coincident correlated two-photon detection. It exhibits quantum beats with a frequency given by the difference between the energies of the synthetic and cosmological axion and \emph{perhaps may be harnessed} to detect either type of axion excitations. The case of synthetic axions individually is obtained in the limit of vanishing coupling of the cosmological axion and features similar two-photon correlations. Hence second order (HBT) two-photon coherence \emph{may} provide an alternative detection mechanism for emergent condensed matter axionic collective excitations. Similarities and differences with parametrically down converted photons are discussed.</description>

      <title>Preference for evolving dark energy in light of the galaxy bispectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04602v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyse pre-DESI clustering data using a dark energy equation of state $w(z)$ parametrised by $(w_0, w_a)$, finding a $2.8-3.9\sigma$ preference for evolving dark energy over the cosmological constant $\Lambda$ when combined with cosmic microwave background data from Planck and supernova data from Pantheon+, Union3, or DESY5. Our constraints, consistent with DESI Y1 results, are derived from the power spectrum and bispectrum of SDSS/BOSS galaxies using the Effective Field Theory of Large Scale Structure (EFTofLSS) at one loop. The evidence remains robust across analysis variations but disappears without the one-loop bispectrum. When combining DESI baryon acoustic oscillations with BOSS full-shape data, while marginalising over the sound horizon in the latter to prevent unaccounted correlations, the significance increases to $3.7-4.4\sigma$, depending on the supernova dataset. Using a data-driven reconstruction of $w(z)$, we show that the evidence arises from deviations from $\Lambda$ at multiple redshifts. In addition, our findings are interpreted within the Effective Field Theory of Dark Energy (EFTofDE), from which we explicitly track the non-standard time evolution in EFTofLSS predictions. For perturbatively stable theories in the $w &lt; -1$ regime, the evidence persists in the clustering limit $(c_s^2 \rightarrow 0)$ when higher-derivative corrections are present, as well as in the quasi-static limit $(c_s^2 \rightarrow 1)$ when additional EFTofDE parameters are considered.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.04657v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It has recently been pointed out that rotation in internal space can induce superradiance. We explore this effect in non-topological solitons of the two-field Friedberg-Lee-Sirlin model. This renormalizable model admits very large solitons, making the perturbative scattering equations highly sensitive to boundary conditions and requiring a relaxation method for their solution. We find that the energy extraction rate is strongly influenced by the mass hierarchy of the two scalars, and solitons with lower internal frequencies lead to more peaks in the spectra of the amplification factors. Additionally, we derive absolute bounds on the amplification factors for general ingoing modes using a linear fractional optimization algorithm and establish analytical bounds near the mass gap.</description>

      <title>Charge dependent directed flow splitting from baryon inhomogeneity and electromagnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04660v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work aims to understand the recent experimental data from the STAR collaboration on the system size dependence of directed flow splitting between oppositely charged hadrons [arXiv:2412.18326]. Previously, we have studied the role of baryon inhomogeneity on charge dependent directed flow. We now incorporate the effects of the electromagnetic (EM) field albeit perturbatively, as implemented in Ref. [arXiv:1806.05288]. This enables us to compare the relative contributions between baryon inhomogeneity and EM field on charge dependent directed flow. Our model calculation describes the experimental data on the centrality and system size dependence of the mid-rapidity directed flow slope splitting, $\Delta dv_1/dy$, between protons and anti-protons. Our results indicate that in central collisions, where the EM field strength is negligible, the inclusion of EM field effects does not influence the splitting between protons and anti-protons. This suggests that the observed system size dependence of $\Delta dv_1/dy (p-\bar{p})$ in central collisions arises solely from enhanced baryon stopping in larger collision systems. However, in semi-central and peripheral collisions, both baryon diffusion and EM field effects contribute to the splitting. Furthermore, the centrality dependence of $\Delta dv_1/dy (p-\bar{p})$ is highly sensitive to the electrical conductivity of the medium, making it a potential probe for extracting this transport coefficient in the QCD medium through model-to-data comparisons. However, achieving this requires a precise determination of the background baseline originating from baryon diffusion. Additionally, further investigation is needed to understand $\Delta dv_1/dy$ for oppositely charged kaons and pions, particularly by incorporating the diffusion of other conserved charges.</description>

      <title>Abundance and properties of dark radiation from the cosmic microwave background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04671v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the cosmological signatures of new light relics that are collisionless like standard neutrinos or are strongly interacting. We provide a simple and succinct rephrasing of their physical effects in the cosmic microwave background, as well as the resulting parameter degeneracies with other cosmological parameters, in terms of the total radiation abundance and the fraction thereof that freely streams. In these more general terms, interacting and noninteracting light relics are differentiated by their respective decrease and increase of the free-streaming fraction, and, moreover, the scale-dependent interplay thereof with a common, correlated reduction of the fraction of matter in baryons. We then derive updated constraints on various dark-radiation scenarios with the latest cosmological observations, employing this language to identify the physical origin of the impact of each dataset. The "PR4" reanalyses of Planck CMB data prefer a larger primordial helium yield and therefore also slightly more radiation than the 2018 analysis, whose origin we identify in a number of poorly fit polarization measurements. Smaller free-streaming fractions are disfavored by the excess lensing of the CMB measured in lensing reconstruction data from Planck and the Atacama Cosmology Telescope. On the other hand, baryon acoustic oscillation measurements from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument drive marginal detections of new, strongly interacting light relics due to that data's preference for lower matter fractions. Finally, we forecast measurements from the CMB-S4 experiment.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.12915v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss a standard hierarchical VEVs model which predicts the leptonic mixing angles in terms of the Cabibbo angle, and masses of strange and charm quarks as $\sin \theta_{12}^\ell \geq 1 - 2 \sin \theta_{12}$, $\sin \theta_{23}^\ell \geq 1 - \sin \theta_{12}$, and $\sin \theta_{13}^\ell \geq \sin \theta_{12} - \frac{m_s}{m_c}$ for the normal mass ordering of neutrinos. This results in very precise predictions of the leptonic mixing angles given by $\sin \theta_{12}^\ell = 0.55 \pm 0.00134 $, $\sin \theta_{23}^\ell = 0.775 \pm 0.00067 $, and $\sin \theta_{13}^\ell = 0.1413 - 0.1509 $. Furthermore, we predict neutrinos to be the Dirac kind disfavouring the inverted mass hierarchy. The standard hierarchical VEVs model predicts a possible new class of the dark matter candidate, named as neutrinic dark matter.</description>

      <title>Charge-conjugation asymmetry and molecular content: the $D_{s0}^\ast(2317)^\pm$ in matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00451v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze the modifications that a dense nuclear medium induces in the $D_{s0}^\ast(2317)^\pm$ and $D_{s1}(2460)^\pm$. In the vacuum, we consider them as isoscalar $D^{(*)}K$ and $\overline{D}{}^{(*)}\overline{K}$ $S$-wave bound states, which are dynamically generated from effective interactions that lead to different Weinberg compositeness scenarios. Matter effects are incorporated through the two-meson loop functions, taking into account the self energies that the $D^{(*)}$, $\overline{D}{}^{(*)}$, $K$, and $\overline{K}$ develop when embedded in a nuclear medium. Although particle-antiparticle [$D^{(\ast)}_{s0,s1}(2317,2460)^+$ versus $D^{(\ast)}_{s0,s1}(2317,2460)^-$] lineshapes are the same in vacuum, we find extremely different density patterns in matter. This charge-conjugation asymmetry mainly stems from the very different kaon and antikaon interaction with the nucleons of the dense medium. We show that the in-medium lineshapes found for these resonances strongly depend on their $D^{(*)}K$/$\overline{D}{}^{(*)}\overline{K}$ molecular content, and discuss how this novel feature can be used to better determine/constrain the inner structure of these exotic states.</description>

      <title>Four top final states with NLO accuracy in perturbative QCD: 3 lepton channel</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.05960v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examine the effect of higher-order QCD corrections on the four top-quark production cross section in the $3$ lepton decay channel. Top-quark and $W$ gauge-boson decays are included at next-to-leading order in perturbative QCD. The narrow-width approximation, that preserves spin correlations, is used to perform the calculation for this complex $2 \to 12 \,(13)$ process. We present differential cross-section distributions of top-quark decay products for the LHC Run III energy of $\sqrt{s}=13.6$ TeV, using realistic selection cuts. Our results show that QCD corrections and jet radiation in top-quark and $W$ decays can lead to significant changes in shapes of basic kinematic distributions and, therefore, need to be included for the accurate description of $pp \to t\bar{t}t\bar{t}+X$ process in the $3\ell$ decay channel. The NLO QCD results obtained in this work are important in the context of the recent observation of the $pp\to t\bar{t}t\bar{t}+X$ process by the ATLAS and CMS collaborations and are of great significance for the High-Luminosity phase of the LHC.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03470v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate a dark matter model that couples to the standard model through a one-loop interaction with neutrinos, where the mediator particles also generate neutrino masses. We perform a global fit that incorporates dark matter relic abundance, primordial nucleosynthesis, neutrino mass, collider and indirect detection constraints. Thanks to the loop suppression, large couplings are allowed, and we find that the model parameters are constrained on all sides. Dark matter masses from 10 MeV to a few TeV are allowed, but sub-GeV masses are preferred for the model to also account for the heaviest neutrino mass. Though our results are valid for a single neutrino mass eigenstate at a time, the model and methods are generalizable to the full 3-flavor case.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18282v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magnetars are neutron stars with superstrong magnetic fields. Some of them (soft-gamma repeaters, SGRs) demonstrate gigantic flares which nature is still unclear. At decay phase of such flares one often observes quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) which are treated as stellar oscillations triggered by the flares. We study, for the first time, magneto-elastic oscillations of magnetars possessing toroidal magnetic fields confined in the stellar crust, without imposing axial symmetry of perturbations. We show that the Zeeman effect makes the oscillation spectrum much richer than for axially symmetric oscillations. The main properties of theoretical QPO spectra are discussed as well as their potential to interpret observations and explore magnetar physics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17946v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For the first time, we use relativistic mean-field (RMF) approximation with density-dependent couplings, adjusted by the DDME2 parameterization, to investigate the effects of dark matter on supernova remnants. We calculate the nuclear equation of state for nuclear and dark matter separately, under the thermodynamic conditions related to the evolution of supernova remnants. A mirrored model is adopted for dark matter, and its effect on remnant matter is studied using a two-fluid scenario. At each stage of the remnant evolution, we assume that dark and ordinary matter have the same entropy and lepton fraction, and a fixed proportion of dark matter mass fraction is added to the stellar matter to observe its effects on some microscopic and macroscopic properties of the star. We observe that dark matter in the remnant core reduces the remnant's maximum mass, radius, and tidal deformability. Moreover, dark matter heats the remnant matter and alters particle distributions, thereby decreasing its isospin asymmetry and increasing the sound speed through the matter.</description>

Abstract: We present novel implementations of Starobisky-like inflation within Supergravity adopting Kaehler potentials for the inflaton which parameterize hyperbolic geometries known from the T-model inflation. The associated superpotentials are consistent with an R and a global or gauge U(1)_X symmetries. The inflaton is represented by a gauge-singlet or non-singlet superfield and is accompanied by a gauge-singlet superfield successfully stabilized thanks to its compact contribution into the total Kaehler potential. Keeping the Kaehler manifold intact, a conveniently violated shift symmetry is introduced which allows for a slight variation of the predictions of Starobinsky inflation: The (scalar) spectral index exhibits an upper bound which lies close to its central observational value whereas the constant scalar curvature of the inflaton-sector Kaehler manifold increases with the tensor-to-scalar ratio.</description>

However, inter-experiment consistency checks through the parameter goodness-of-fit test reveals proximity to the tension boundary, with the Double Chooz, RENO, and Daya Bay ensemble yielding $p_\text{PG}=0.14$ vs threshold $\alpha=0.1$. Anisotropic Lorentz invariance violation (LIV) can accommodate this tension by introducing a location-dependent angle $\theta^\text{LIV}$ relative to the earth's axis. It is found that anisotropic LIV improve the fit to data up to 1.9$\sigma$ confidence level significance, with the coefficient $\mathcal{A}^{C(0)}_{31} = 2.43\times 10^{-17}\text{ MeV}$ yielding the best fit, while Parameter Goodness-of-fit (PG) is significantly improved within the LIV formalism.</description>

      <title>Fermion-Vortex Interactions in Axion Electrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17567v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A relativistic action for scalar condensate-fermion mixture is considered where both the scalar boson and the fermion fields are coupled to a $U(1)$ gauge field. The dynamics of the gauge field is governed by a linear combination of the Maxwell term, and the Lorentz invariant $\mathbf{E\cdot B}$ term with a constant coefficient $\theta$. We obtain an effective action describing an emergent fermion-fermion interaction and fermion-vortex tube interaction by using the particle-string duality, and find that the $\theta$ term can significantly affect the interaction of fermions and vortices. We also perform a dimensional reduction to show a $\theta$ dependent flux attachment to the itinerant fermions.</description>

      <title>The Maximal Gravitational Wave Signal from Asteroid-Mass Primordial Black Hole Mergers At Resonant Microwave Cavities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15400v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Primordial black holes can be the entirety of the dark matter in a broad, approximately five-orders-of-magnitude-wide mass range, the ``asteroid mass range'', between $10^{-16}\ M_{\rm Sun}$ -- where constraints originate from evaporation -- and $10^{-11}\ M_{\rm Sun}$ -- from microlensing. A direct detection in this mass range is very challenging with any known observational or experimental methods. Here we update the calculation of the sight distance for narrow-band detectors such as resonant microwave cavities, and the resulting maximal event rate. We find that the largest detection rates are associated with binaries from non-monochromatic mass functions in early-formed three-body systems. Even in the most optimistic setup, these events are anticipated to be extremely rare.</description>

      <title>An Explicit Categorical Construction of Instanton Density in Lattice Yang-Mills Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07195v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Since the inception of lattice QCD, a natural definition for the Yang-Mills instanton on lattice has been long sought for. In a recent work, one of authors showed the natural solution has to be organized in terms of bundle gerbes in higher homotopy theory / higher category theory, and introduced the principles for such a categorical construction. To pave the way towards actual numerical implementation in the near future, nonetheless, an explicit construction is necessary. In this paper we provide such an explicit construction for $SU(2)$ gauge theory, with technical aspects inspired by L\"{u}scher's 1982 geometrical construction. We will see how the latter is in a suitable sense a saddle point approximation to the full categorical construction. The generalization to $SU(N)$ will be discussed. The construction also allows for a natural definition of lattice Chern-Simons-Yang-Mills theory in three spacetime dimensions.</description>

      <title>Interpreting the Extremely Diffuse Stellar Distribution of the Nube Galaxy through Fuzzy Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01307v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent observations have uncovered a remarkably flat and extremely diffuse stellar distribution within the almost dark dwarf galaxy Nube, posing a challenge to the standard cold dark matter scenario. In this study, we employ numerical simulations to explore the possibility that this anomalous stellar distribution can be attributed to the dynamical heating effect of fuzzy dark matter (FDM). The relatively isolated location and low baryon fraction of Nube make it an ideal system for investigating this effect. Our findings indicate that by adopting a halo profile consistent with the dynamical mass estimation of Nube and an FDM particle mass on the order of $10^{-23}$ eV, the final 2D stellar distribution derived from simulation closely matches observational data. These results suggest that FDM could provide an explanation for the extremely diffuse stellar distribution of Nube.</description>

      <title>Revisiting holographic dark energy from the perspective of multi-messenger gravitational wave astronomy: future joint observations with short gamma-ray bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06873v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The advent of third-generation (3G) gravitational-wave (GW) detectors opens new opportunities for multi-messenger observations of binary neutron star merger events, holding significant potential for probing the history of cosmic expansion. In this paper, we investigate the holographic dark energy (HDE) model by using the future GW standard siren data observed from the 3G GW detectors and the short $\gamma$-ray burst THESEUS-like detector joint observations. We find that GW data alone can achieve a relatively precise estimation of the Hubble constant, with precision of $0.2\%$-$0.6\%$, but its ability to constrain other cosmological parameters remains limited. Nonetheless, since the GW data can break parameter degeneracies generated by the mainstream EM observations, CMB + BAO + SN (CBS), GW standard sirens play a crucial role in enhancing the accuracy of parameter estimation. With the addition of GW data to CBS, the constraints on cosmological parameters $H_0$, $c$ and $\Omega_{\rm{m}}$ can be improved by $63\%$-$88\%$, $27\%$-$44\%$ and $55\%$-$70\%$. In summary, observations of GW standard sirens from 3G GW detectors could be pivotal in helping solve the Hubble tension and probe the fundamental nature of dark energy.</description>

      <title>Construction of fuzzy dark matter halos with arbitrary initial velocities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08372v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cosmological simulations of fuzzy dark matter (FDM) are computationally expensive, and the resulting halos lack flexibility in parameter adjustments, such as virial mass, density profile, and global velocity. Previous studies have introduced a method for constructing FDM halos with predefined density profiles. In this study, we investigate the initial global velocity of these constructed halos and find that it is nonzero. We provide the theoretical formula for this velocity and illustrate that it arises from the interference between states of odd and even parity. Our calculated results closely match simulation outcomes. Additionally, we showcase how to counteract this velocity and create a halo with a customizable initial global velocity. Our study presents a practical method for adjusting the initial global velocity of halos in controlled FDM simulations, facilitating investigations into tidal effects, galaxy collisions, and other scenarios.</description>

      <title>Staggered Fermions with Chiral Anomaly Cancellation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10837v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the implications of the quantized vectorial and axial charges in the lattice Hamiltonian of multi-flavor staggered fermions in $(1+1)$ dimensions. These lattice charges coincide with those of the $U(1)_V$ and $U(1)_A$ global symmetries of Dirac fermions in the continuum limit, whose perturbative chiral anomaly matches the non-Abelian Onsager algebra on the lattice. In this note, we focus on the lattice models that flow to continuum quantum field theories of Dirac fermions that are free from the perturbative chiral anomaly between $U(1)_V$ and $U(1)_A$. In a lattice model that flows to two Dirac fermions, we identify quadratic Hamiltonian deformations that can gap the system while fully preserving both the vectorial and axial charges on the lattice. These deformations flow to the usual symmetry-preserving Dirac mass terms in the continuum. Additionally, we propose a lattice model that flows to the chiral fermion $3-4-5-0$ model in the continuum by using these lattice charges, and we discuss the multi-fermion interactions that can generate a mass gap in the paradigm of symmetric mass generation.</description>

      <title>Phase transitions in an expanding medium -- hot remnants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07879v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze the dynamics of a first order confinement/deconfinement phase transition in an expanding medium using an effective boundary description fitted to the holographic Witten model. We observe and analyze hot plasma remnants, which do not cool down or nucleate bubbles despite the expansion of the system. The appearance of the hot remnants, the dynamics of their shrinking and subsequent dissolution and further heating up is very robust and persists in such diverse scenarios as boost-invariant expansion with a flat Minkowski metric and cosmological expansion in a Friedmann-Robertson-Walker spacetime.</description>
