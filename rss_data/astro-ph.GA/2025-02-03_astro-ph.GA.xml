      <title>CRexit: how different cosmic ray transport modes affect thermal instability in the circumgalactic medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18678v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The circumgalactic medium (CGM) plays a critical role in galaxy evolution, influencing gas flows, feedback processes, and galactic dynamics. Observations show a substantial cold gas reservoir in the CGM, but the mechanisms driving its formation and evolution remain unclear. Cosmic rays (CRs), as a source of non-thermal pressure, are increasingly recognized as key regulators of cold gas dynamics. This study explores how CRs affect cold clouds that condense from the hot CGM via thermal instability (TI). Using 3D CR-magnetohydrodynamic (CRMHD) simulations with AREPO, we assess the impact of various CR transport models on cold gas evolution. Under purely advective CR transport, CR pressure significantly suppresses the collapse of thermally unstable regions, altering the CGM's structure. In contrast, realistic CR transport models reveal that CRs escape collapsing regions via streaming and diffusion along magnetic fields, diminishing their influence on the thermal and dynamic structure of the cold CGM. The ratio of the CR escape time to the cloud collapse time emerges as a critical factor in determining the impact of CRs on TI. CRs remain confined within cold clouds when effective CR diffusion is slow which maximizes their pressure support and inhibits collapse. Fast effective CR diffusion, as realized in our 2-moment CRMHD model, facilitates rapid CR escape, reducing their stabilizing effect. This realistic CR transport model shows a wide dynamic range of the effective CR diffusion coefficient, ranging from $10^{29}$ to $10^{30}\,\mathrm{cm^{2}\,s^{-1}}$ for thermally- to CR-dominated atmospheres, respectively. In addition to these CR transport-related effects, we demonstrate that high numerical resolution is crucial to avoid spuriously large clouds formed in low-resolution simulations, which would result in overly long CR escape times and artificially amplified CR pressure support.</description>

      <title>Anisotropies in the Circumgalactic Medium of Disk Galaxies: Milky Way-like Bubbles or Star Formation-driven Outflows?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18681v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gamma and X-ray observatories have revealed spectacular structures in the emission of the tenuous hot gas surrounding the Milky Way (MW), known as the Fermi and eROSITA bubbles. Galaxy formation simulations suggest that MW-like bubbles could be ubiquitous, but their emission may be too faint to detect with today's instruments in individual external galaxies. In this paper, we present an analysis of stacked Chandra observations of 93 nearby galaxies. We detected soft, diffuse X-rays from the CGM, extending up to 14 kpc, with a luminosity of $(4.2\pm0.7)\times10^{39}$ erg/s in the $0.3-2$ keV band. To probe its spatial distribution, we constructed an azimuthal profile and found a significant enhancement along the galactic minor axis. When dividing our sample by stellar mass, central supermassive black hole mass, and star formation rate, we found that only high star formation rate galaxies exhibit significant anisotropies in the CGM emission. To investigate whether the observed anisotropies could be attributed to MW-like bubbles, we compared our results with TNG50 simulations. In these simulations, X-ray bubbles are strongly correlated with mass of the central supermassive black hole and typically extend to much larger, $\sim50$ kpc, scales. We conclude that the observed anisotropies are either caused by AGN-driven MW-like bubbles confined to smaller, $\sim10$ kpc, scales, or by star formation- or starburst-driven bubbles/outflows.</description>

      <title>Star Formation Rates, Metallicities, and Stellar Masses on kpc-scales in TNG50</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18687v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integral field units (IFU) have extended our knowledge of galactic properties to kpc (or, sometimes, even smaller) patches of galaxies. These scales are where the physics driving galaxy evolution (feedback, chemical enrichment, etc.) take place. Quantifying the spatially-resolved properties of galaxies, both observationally and theoretically, is therefore critical to our understanding of galaxy evolution. To this end, we investigate spatially-resolved scaling relations within central galaxies ($M_\star&gt;10^{9.0}$) at $z=0$ in IllustrisTNG. We examine both the resolved star-forming main sequence (rSFMS) and the resolved mass-metallicity relation (rMZR) using $1~{\rm kpc}\times1~{\rm kpc}$ maps of galaxies. We find that the rSFMS in IllustrisTNG is well-described by a power-law, but has some dependence on the host galaxy's mass. Conversely, the rMZR for IllustrisTNG can be described by a single power-law at low stellar mass surface density that flattens at high surface densities and is independent of host galaxy mass. We find quantitative agreement in both the rSFMS and rMZR with recent IFU observational campaigns. Furthermore, we argue that the rSFMS is an indirect result of the Schmidt-Kennicutt (SK) law and local gas fraction relation, which are both independent of host galaxy properties. Finally, we expand upon a localized leaky-box model to study the evolution of idealized spaxels and find that it provides a good description of these resolved relations. The degree of agreement, however, between idealized spaxels and simulated spaxels depends on the `net' outflow rate for the spaxel, and the observed scaling relations indicate a preference for a low net outflow rate.</description>

      <title>The outflow impacts on the size of the narrow-line region among type-2 AGNs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the study of the gas kinematics in narrow-line regions (NLRs) of 2,009 type-2 AGNs at $z&lt;0.34$. We construct the [O III]$\lambda$5007 emission-line images using publicly available broadband images from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). The [O III] emission area of the samples, measured down to $1.7\times10^{-15}$ erg/s/cm$^2$/arcsec$^2$, ranges from 3.7 kpc$^2$ up to 224 kpc$^2$. With our broadband technique, we found the strong correlation between [O III] area and AGN luminosity inferred from the [O III] luminosity and the mid-infrared luminosity at the rest-frame $15\mu$m. The isophotal threshold used to determine the [O III] area affects the correlation strength in that the brighter isophote yields the stronger correlation between the [O III] area and AGN luminosity. The presence of gas outflow is examined by the ratio of the [O III] velocity dispersion to the stellar velocity dispersion ($\sigma_{\rm [O\,III]}/\sigma_\star &gt; 1.4$) using the SDSS spectra. At the given luminosity, the objects with and without outflows exhibit the same extension of the [O III] emission. Their correlation between the [O III] area and luminosity is almost identical. It is suggested that the size of NLRs is not affected by outflow mechanisms but rather by photoionization from the central AGNS.</description>

      <title>Mass flows in the Galactic Center by supernovae of the circumnuclear disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18701v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. The circumnuclear disk (CND) is presently the main supply of mass for the accretion onto the supermassive black hole (SMBH) in the Galactic Center (GC). While the accretion is relatively slow, it has been suspected that local episodic explosive events play an important role in the temporary mass inflow toward the SMBH, while also affecting the evolution of the CND. Aims. The aim of this study is to follow the changes in mass flows caused by supernova (SN) explosions nestled in or near the CND. Methods. We perform simulations with the grid-based MHD code FLASH of the inner 5 pc of the Milky Way GC, including gravitational potential, rotation, magnetic field, central wind source, and the warm gas of the CND, all mimicking the observed physical properties. Results. Assuming a M$_\mathrm{SN}=10$ M$_\odot$ as the mass of the precursor of the core-collapse SN event at various locations within 2 pc from the GC, we detect a temporary increase in the accretion rate, transferring an additional 2-60 M$_\odot$ of warm gas to the immediate vicinity of the SMBH, depending on the explosion site. At the same time, the kinetic energy of the SN blows away even mass from the CND; the additional warm gas leaving the simulation domain after the explosion is on the order of $\sim100$ M$_\odot$. In the studied cases, the impact on mass flows and the turbulence caused by the explosion cease after $\sim250$ kyr.</description>

      <title>A confirmed recoiling supermassive black hole in a powerful quasar</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18730v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Supermassive black holes (SMBH) are thought to grow through accretion of matter and mergers. Models of SMBH mergers have long suffered the final parsec problem, where SMBH binaries may stall before energy loss from gravitational waves (GW) becomes significant, leaving the pair unmerged. Direct evidence of coalesced SMBH remains elusive. Theory predicts that GW recoiling black holes can occur following a black hole merger. Here we present decisive spectroscopic evidence that the gas bound to the SMBH in the spatially offset quasar 3C 186 is blue-shifted relative to the host galaxy. This is exclusively explained by the GW recoil super-kick scenario. This confirmation of the ejection process implies that the final parsec problem is resolved in nature, providing evidence that even the most massive black holes can merge.</description>

      <title>Gas accretion at high redshift: cold flows all the way</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19009v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study in detail how massive galaxies accrete gas through cosmic time using cosmological hydrodynamical simulations from the High-z Evolution of Large and Luminous Objects (HELLO) and the Numerical Investigation of a Hundred Astrophysical Objects (NIHAO) projects. We find that accretion through cold filaments at high redshift (z ~ 2-4) is a key factor in maintaining the high star formation rates (&gt; 100 Msun/yr) observed in these galaxies, and that more than 75% of the total gas participating in the star formation process is accreted via this channel at high z even in haloes well above 10^12 Msun. The low volume occupancy of the filaments allows plenty of space for massive gas outflows generated by the vigorous star formation and AGN activity, with the cold incoming gas and the hot outflowing gas barely interacting. We present a model based on a Bayesian hierarchical formalism that accurately describes the evolution of the cold fraction accretion with redshift and halo mass. Our model predicts a relatively constant critical mass (Mc) for the cold-to-hot transition up to z ~ 1.3 and an evolving critical mass log(Mc) proportional to log(1+z)^1.7 at higher redshift. Overall, our findings provide deeper insight into the cosmic evolution of gas accretion modes and offer a robust framework for understanding how cold accretion contributes to galaxy growth across different epochs.</description>

      <title>Large molecular and dust reservoir of a gravitationally-lensed submillimeter galaxy behind the Lupus-I molecular cloud</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the Australian Telescope Compact Array and Nobeyama 45 m telescope detection of a remarkably bright $S_\mathrm{1.1mm}$ = 44 mJy) submillimeter galaxy MM J154506.4-344318 in emission lines at 48.5 and 97.0 GHz, respectively. We also identify part of an emission line at $\approx$ 218.3 GHz using the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA). Together with photometric redshift estimates and the ratio between the line and infrared luminosities, we conclude that the emission lines are most likely to be the $J$ = 2-1, 4-3, and 9-8 transitions of $^{12}$CO at redshift $z = 3.753 \pm 0.001$. ALMA 1.3 mm continuum imaging reveals an arc and a spot separated by an angular distance of 1.6 arcsec, indicative of a strongly-lensed dusty star-forming galaxy with respective molecular and dust masses of $\log{M_{\rm mol}/M_\odot} \approx 11.5$ and $\log{M_{\rm dust}/M_\odot} \approx 9.4$ after corrected for $\approx$ 6.6$\times$ gravitational magnification. The inferred dust-to-gas mass ratio is found to be high ($\approx$ 0.0083) among coeval dusty star-forming galaxies, implying the presence of a massive, chemically-enriched reservoir of cool interstellar medium at $z \approx 4$ or 1.6 Gyr after the Big Bang.</description>

      <title>Systematic Bias in Ionizing Radiation Escape Fraction Measurements from Foreground Large-Scale Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19303v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the relationship between the Lyman-alpha (Lya) forest transmission in the intergalactic medium (IGM) and the environmental density of galaxies, focusing on its implications for the measurement of ionizing radiation escape fractions. Using a sample of 268 spectroscopically confirmed background galaxies at 2.7&lt;z&lt;3.0 and a galaxy density map at z~2.5 within the COSMOS field, we measure the Lya transmission photometrically, leveraging the multiwavelength data available from the COSMOS2020 catalog. Our results reveal a weak but statistically significant positive correlation between Lya optical depth and galaxy density contrast, suggesting that overdense regions are enriched in neutral gas, which could bias escape fraction measurements. This emphasizes the need to account for the large-scale structure of the IGM in analyses of ionizing radiation escape fractions, and highlights the advantages of a photometric approach for increasing the number of sampled lines of sight across large fields. The photometric redshifts provided by upcoming all-sky surveys, such as Euclid, will make it possible to account for this effect across widely separated fields.</description>

      <title>High-cadence observations of galactic nuclei by the future two-band UV-photometry mission QUVIK</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19365v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Quick Ultra-Violet Kilonova surveyor (QUVIK), a two-band UV space telescope approved for funding as a Czech national science and technology mission, will focus on detecting early UV light of kilonovae (Werner et al., 2024). In addition, it will study the UV emission of stars and stellar systems (Krti\v{c}ka et al., 2024) as well as the intense and variable emission of active galactic nuclei (AGN) or galactic nuclei activated by tidal disruption events (Zaja\v{c}ek et al., 2024). In this contribution, we describe the role of this small ($\sim 30$-cm diameter) UV telescope for studying bright, nearby AGN. With its NUV and FUV bands, the telescope will perform high-cadence ($\sim$ 0.1-1 day) two-band photometric monitoring of nearby AGN ($z&lt;1$), which will allow us to probe accretion disk sizes/temperature profiles via photometric reverberation mapping. Thanks to its versatility, QUVIK will be able to perform a moderately fast repointing ($&lt;20$ min) to target candidates for tidal disruption events (TDEs). Early detection of the UV emission following a TDE optical flare, in combination with the subsequent two-band UV monitoring performed simultaneously with other observatories, will enable us to infer the time delay (or its lack of) between the optical, UV, and X-ray emission. In combination with theoretical models, it will be possible to shed more light on the origin of the UV/optical emission of TDEs. Furthermore, the two-band monitoring of nuclear transients will be beneficial in distinguishing between TDEs (nearly constant blue colour) and supernovae (progressive reddening).</description>

      <title>Low dust mass and high star-formation efficiency at $z&gt;12$ from deep ALMA observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the dust mass build-up and star formation efficiency of two galaxies at $z&gt;12$, GHZ2 and GS-z14-0, by combining ALMA and JWST observations with an analytical model that assumes dust at thermal equilibrium. We obtained $3\sigma$ constraints on dust mass of $\log M_{\rm dust}/M_{\odot}&lt;5.0$ and $&lt;5.3$, respectively. These constraints are in tension with a high dust condensation efficiency in stellar ejecta but are consistent with models with a short metal accretion timescale at $z&gt;12$. Given the young stellar ages of these galaxies ($t_{\rm age}\sim10\,{\rm Myrs}$), dust grain growth via accretion may still be ineffective at this stage, though it likely works efficiently to produce significant dust in galaxies at $z\sim7$. The star formation efficiencies, defined as the SFR divided by molecular gas mass, reach $\sim10\,{\rm Gyr}^{-1}$ in a 10\,Myr timescale, aligning with the expected redshift evolution of `starburst' galaxies with efficiencies that are $\sim0.5$--$1\,{\rm dex}$ higher than those in main-sequence galaxies. This starburst phase seems to be common in UV-bright galaxies at $z&gt;12$ and is likely associated with the unique conditions of the early phases of galaxy formation, such as bursty star formation and/or negligible feedback from super-Eddington accretion. Direct observations of molecular gas tracers like [C\,{\sc ii}] will be crucial to further understanding the nature of bright galaxies at $z&gt;12$.</description>

      <title>A Spectroscopically Calibrated Prescription for Extracting PAH Flux from JWST MIRI Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19397v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a prescription for estimating the flux of the 7.7 micron and 11.3 micron\ polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) features from broadband JWST/MIRI images. Probing PAH flux with MIRI imaging data has advantages in field of view, spatial resolution, and sensitivity compared with MIRI spectral maps, but comparisons with spectra are needed to calibrate these flux estimations over a wide variety of environments. For 267 MIRI/MRS spectra from independent regions in the four luminous infrared galaxies (LIRGs) in the Great Observatories All-sky LIRG Survey (GOALS) early release science program, we derive synthetic filter photometry and directly compare estimated PAH fluxes to those measured from detailed spectral fits. We find that for probing PAH 7.7 micron, the best combination of filters is F560W, F770W, and either F1500W or F2100W, and the best for PAH 11.3 micron is F560W, F1000W, F1130W, and F1500W. The prescription with these combinations yields predicted flux densities that typically agree with values from spectral decomposition within ~7% and ~5% for PAH 7.7 and 11.3 micron, respectively.</description>

      <title>Localizing Dynamically-Formed Black Hole Binaries in Milky Way Globular Clusters with LISA</title>

Abstract: The dynamical formation of binary black holes (BBHs) in globular clusters (GCs) may contribute significantly to the observed gravitational wave (GW) merger rate. Furthermore, LISA may detect many BBH sources from GCs at mHz frequencies, enabling the characterization of such systems within the Milky Way and nearby Universe. In this work, we use Monte Carlo N-body simulations to construct a realistic sample of Galactic clusters, thus estimating the population, detectability, and parameter measurement accuracy of BBHs hosted within them. In particular, we show that the GW signal from $0.7\pm 0.7$, $2.0\pm 1.7$, $3.6\pm 2.3$, $13.4\pm 4.7$ BBHs in Milky Way GCs can exceed the signal-to-noise ratio threshold of $\rm SNR =30$, 5, 3, and 1 for a 10-year LISA observation, with $\sim 50\%$ of detectable sources exhibiting high eccentricities ($e\gtrsim0.9$). Moreover, the Fisher matrix and Bayesian analyses of the GW signals indicate these systems typically feature highly-resolved orbital frequencies ($\delta f_{\rm orb}/ f_{\rm orb} \sim 10^{-7}-10^{-5}$) and eccentricities ($\delta e/ e \sim 10^{-3}-0.1$), as well as a measurable total mass when SNR exceeds $\sim20$. Notably, BBHs with $\rm SNR\gtrsim 20$ can be confidently localized to specific GCs within the Milky Way, with an angular resolution of $\sim 10-100$ arc minutes. The detection and localization of even a single BBH in a Galactic GC would allow accurate tracking of its long-term orbital evolution, enable a direct test of the role of GCs in BBH formation, and provide a unique probe into the evolutionary history of Galactic clusters.</description>

      <title>Cosmic Rays Masquerading as Hot CGM Gas: An Inverse-Compton Origin for Diffuse X-ray Emission in the Circumgalactic Medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18696v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Observations have argued that Milky Way (MW), Andromeda, and lower-mass galaxies exhibit extended soft X-ray diffuse halos to radii $R\gtrsim100\,$kpc in the circumgalactic medium (CGM). If interpreted as thermal emission, the shallow surface brightness profiles $S_{X}\propto R^{-1}$ are difficult to explain and contradict other observations. We show that such halos instead arise from inverse Compton (IC) scattering of CMB photons with GeV cosmic ray (CR) electrons. GeV electrons have ~Gyr lifetimes and escape the galaxy, forming a shallow extended profile out to $\gtrsim100\,$kpc, where IC off the CMB should produce soft, thermal-like X-ray spectra peaked at ~keV. The observed keV halo luminosities and brightness profiles agree well with those expected for CRs observed in the local interstellar medium (LISM) escaping the galaxy, with energetics consistent with known CRs from SNe and/or AGN, around galaxies with stellar masses $M_{\ast}\lesssim2\times 10^{11}\,M_{\odot}$. At higher masses observed X-ray luminosities are larger than predicted from IC and should be dominated by hot gas. In the MW+M31, the same models of escaping CRs reproduce gamma-ray observations if we assume an LISM-like proton-to-electron ratio and CR-pressure-dominated halo. In all other halos, the radio and $\gamma$-ray brightness is below detectable limits. If true, the observations provide qualitatively new constraints on CGM and CR physics: X-ray brightness directly traces the CR lepton energy density in the CGM. This agrees with LISM values within 10 kpc, which following the profile expected for escaping CRs in the CGM. The inferred CR pressure is a major part of the MW CGM pressure budget. X-ray surface brightness and luminosity allows one to further determine the CGM diffusivity at radii $\sim10-1000\,$kpc. These also agree with LISM values at small radii but increase in the CGM.</description>

      <title>Tidal disruption events as origin of the eROSITA and Fermi bubbles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18713v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context: The recently discovered spherical eROSITA bubbles arise up to a latitude of $\pm$80\deg-85\deg in the X-ray regime of the Milky Way halo. Similar to the $\gamma$-ray Fermi bubbles, they evolve around the Galactic center, making a common origin plausible. However, the driving mechanism and evolution of both bubbles are still under debate. Aims: We want to investigate whether hydrodynamic energy injections at the Galactic center, such as e.g. tidal disruption events (TDEs), could have inflated both bubbles. The supermassive black hole Sagittarius A* is expected to tidally disrupt a star every 10-100 kyr, potentially leading to an outflow from the central region that drives a shock propagating into the Galactic halo due to its vertically declining density distribution, ultimately forming a superbubble blown out of the disk similar to the eROSITA and Fermi bubbles. Methods: We model TDEs in the Galaxy using three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations, considering different Milky Way mass models and TDE rates. We then generate synthetic X-ray maps and compare them to observations. Results: Our simulation results of a $\beta$-model Milky Way halo show that superbubbles, blown for 16 Myr by regular energy injections at the Galactic center that occur every 100 kyr, can have a shape, shell stability, size, and evolution time similar to estimates for the eROSITA bubbles, and an overall structure reminiscent to the Fermi bubbles. The $\gamma$-rays in our model would stem from cosmic ray interactions at the contact discontinuity, where they were previously accelerated by first order Fermi acceleration at in situ shocks. Conclusions: Regular TDEs in the past 10-20 Myr near the Galactic center could have driven an outflow resulting in both, the X-ray emission of the eROSITA bubbles and the $\gamma$-ray emission of the Fermi bubbles.</description>

      <title>Kepler meets Gaia DR3: homogeneous extinction-corrected color-magnitude diagram and binary classification</title>

Abstract: The original Kepler mission has delivered unprecedented high-quality photometry. These data have impacted numerous research fields (e.g., asteroseismology and exoplanets), and continue to be an astrophysical goldmine. Because of this, thorough investigations of the ~ 200,000 stars observed by Kepler remain of paramount importance. In this paper, we present a state-of-the-art characterization of the Kepler targets based on Gaia DR3 data. We place the stars on the color-magnitude diagram (CMD), account for the effects of interstellar extinction, and classify targets into several CMD categories (dwarfs, subgiants, red giants, photometric binaries, and others). Additionally, we report various categories of candidate binary systems spanning a range of detection methods, such as Renormalised Unit Weight Error (RUWE), radial velocity variables, Gaia non-single stars (NSS), Kepler and Gaia eclipsing binaries from the literature, among others. First and foremost, our work can assist in the selection of stellar and exoplanet host samples regarding CMD and binary populations. We further complement our catalog by quantifying the impact that astrometric differences between Gaia data releases have on CMD location, assessing the contamination in asteroseismic targets with properties at odds with Gaia, and identifying stars flagged as photometrically variable by Gaia. We make our catalog publicly available as a resource to the community when researching the stars observed by Kepler.</description>

      <title>A Novel Method to Estimate the FUV Flux and a Catalogue for Star-Hosting Discs in Nearby Star-Forming Regions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18752v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Protoplanetary discs, when externally irradiated by Far Ultraviolet (FUV) photons from OBA-type stars, lose material through photoevaporative winds, reducing the amount of material available to form planets. Understanding the link between environmental irradiation and observed disc properties requires accurately evaluating the FUV flux at star-hosting discs, which can be challenging due stellar parallax uncertainties. In this paper, we address this issue proposing a novel approach: using the local density distribution of a star-forming region (i.e. 2D pairwise star separations distribution) and assuming isotropy, we infer 3D separations between star-hosting discs and massive stars. We test this approach on synthetic clusters, showing that it significantly improves the accuracy compared to previous methods. We compute FUV fluxes for a large sample of star-bearing discs in 7 regions within 200 pc, 6 regions in Orion, and Serpens sub-regions, providing a publicly accessible catalogue. We find that discs in regions hosting late-type B and early-type A stars can reach non-negligible irradiation levels for disc evolution (10-100 G0). We investigate dust disc masses relative to FUV fluxes detecting hints of a negative correlation when restricting to average region ages. However, we emphasize the need for more stellar and disc measurements at &gt;10^2 G0 to probe the dependence of disc properties on the environmental irradiation. Including average interstellar dust extinction, median FUV fluxes are not significantly attenuated, though this result may change if high-resolution 3D dust extinction maps were available. The method presented in this work is a powerful tool that can be expanded to additional regions.</description>

      <title>Chandra Follow-up Observations of Swift-BAT-selected AGNs III</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18757v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The cosmic X-ray background (CXB) is dominated by the obscured and unobscured coronal light of active galactic nuclei (AGN). At energies below 10 keV, the CXB can be well explained by models taking into account the known AGN and the observed distribution of their obscuring, line-of-sight column densities, $N_{\rm H,l.o.s}$. However, at energies around the Compton reflection hump ($\sim30$ keV), the models fall short of the data. This suggests the existence of a population of as yet undetected Compton-thick AGN ($N_{\rm H,l.o.s}&gt;1.5\times10^{24}$ cm$^{-2}$) whose X-ray spectra are dominated by the light that has been reprocessed by the obscuring material. In this work, we continue the effort to find and catalog all local ($z&lt;0.05$) Compton-thick (CT) AGN. To this end, we obtained soft X-ray data with Chandra for six local BAT detected sources lacking ROSAT (0.1-2.4 keV) counterparts, indicating potential obscuration. We fit their spectra with Bayesian and least squares methods using two different models, borus02 and UXCLUMPY. We compare the results of the different models and methods and find that the $N_{\rm H,l.o.s}$ is consistently measured in each case. Three of the sources also were observed with XMM-Newton allowing the opportunity to search for variability in soft X-ray flux or $N_{\rm H,l.o.s}$. From this sample, we find one strong CT candidate (NGC 5759) and one weaker CT candidate (CGCG 1822.3+2053). Furthermore, we find tentative evidence of $N_{\rm H,l.o.s}$ variability in 2MASX J17253053-4510279, which has $N_{\rm H,l.o.s}&lt;10^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$.</description>

      <title>Discovery of ionized circumstellar gas emission around the long-period Cepheid $\ell$ Carinae with ALMA</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.19011v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cepheid circumstellar emissions have previously been detected via both infrared excess and infrared interferometric observations at a few stellar radii. Those studies have shown that these circumstellar emission can be produced by ionized gas, however there is no direct observational evidence to confirm this hypothesis. In this letter we explore the continuum emission and a spectrum of the bright and long-period Cepheid, $\ell$~Car ($P=35.56\,$day) at millimeter-wavelengths in order to detect possible effects of ionized gas emission. We presented ALMA observations of $\ell$ Car in two spectral setups in Band~6 (near 212 and 253\,GHz, respectively) and we compared the measured flux density to one expected for the stellar continuum. We also derived the spectral index and probed the presence of Radio Recombination Lines (RRL). We report statistically significant emission of about 3.5$\,$mJy in the two spectral ranges, which is about 2.5 times the stellar continuum emission. For the first time, we are also able to derive the spectral index of the flux density ($S_\nu \propto \nu^\alpha$), $\alpha=+1.26\pm$0.44 ($\sim$3$\sigma$ error), which is characteristic of partially optically thick ionized gas emission. Additionally, we discovered an emission line from a RRL of hydrogen H29$\alpha$ centered on the stellar rest velocity, smaller in spatial extent than about 0\farcs2 ($\lesssim 100\,$AU), with a symmetric profile with a width at half power of 55.3$\pm$7.5\,\kms (1$\sigma$ error). It confirms the presence of ionized gas emission near $\ell$~Car. The millimeter emission detected from $\ell$ Car can be attributed to ionized gas emission from the Cepheid's chromosphere. Further radio interferometric observations are necessary to confirm the occurrence of these ionized gas envelopes around Cepheids of different pulsation periods.</description>

      <title>The evolution of cosmic ray electrons in the cosmic web: seeding by AGN, star formation and shocks</title>

Abstract: Several processes in the Universe convert a fraction of gas kinetic energy into the acceleration of relativistic electrons, making them observable at radio wavelengths, or contributing to a dormant reservoir of low-energy cosmic rays in cosmic structures. We present a new suite of cosmological simulations, with simple galaxy formation models calibrated to work at a specific spatial resolution, tailored to study all most important processes of injection of relativistic electrons in evolving large-sale structures: accretion and merger shocks, feedback from active galactic nuclei and winds from star forming regions. We also follow the injection of magnetic fields by active galactic nuclei and star formation, and compute the observational signatures of these mechanisms. We find that the injection of cosmic ray electrons by shocks is the most volume filling process, and that it also dominates the energy density of fossil relativistic electrons in halos. The combination of the seeding mechanisms studied in this work, regardless of the uncertainties related to physical or numerical uncertainties, is more than enough to fuel large-scale radio emissions with a large amount of seed fossil electrons. We derive an approximated formula to predict the number of fossil cosmic ray electrons injected by z=0 by the total activity of shocks, AGN and star formation in the volume of halos. By looking at the maximum possible contribution to the magnetisation of the cosmic web by all our simulated sources, we conclude that galaxy formation-related processes, alone, cannot explain the values of Faraday Rotation of background polarised sources recently detected using LOFAR.</description>

      <title>Rapid follow-up of infant supernovae with the Gran Telescopio de Canarias</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.19108v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The first few hours of a supernova contain significant information about the progenitor system. The most modern wide-field surveys that scan the sky repeatedly every few days can discover all kinds of transients in those early epochs. At such times, some progenitor footprints may be visible, elucidating critical explosion parameters and helping to distinguish between leading explosion models. A dedicated spectroscopic classification programme using the optical spectrograph OSIRIS mounted to the Gran Telescopio de Canarias was set up to try to obtain observations of supernova at those early epochs. With the time awarded, we obtained spectra for 10 SN candidates, which we present here. Half of them were thermonuclear SNe, while the other half were core-collapse SNe. Most (70\%) were observed within the first six days of the estimated explosion, with two being captured within the first 48 hours. We present a characterization of the spectra, together with other public ancillary photometry from ZTF and ATLAS. This programme shows the need for an accompanying rapid-response spectroscopic programme to existing and future deep photometric wide-field surveys located at the right longitude to be able to trigger observations in a few hours after the discovery of the supernova candidate. Both the future La Silla Southern Supernova Survey (LS4) and the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) both located in Chile will be providing discovery and follow up of most of the transients in the southern hemisphere. This paper demonstrates that with a rapid spectroscopic programme and stringent triggering criteria, obtaining a sample of SN with spectra within a day of the explosion is possible.</description>

      <title>FAUST XX. The chemical structure and temperature profile of the IRAS 4A2 hot corino at 20-50 au</title>

Abstract: Young low-mass protostars often possess hot corinos, compact, hot and dense regions bright in interstellar Complex Organic Molecules (iCOMs). Besides of their prebiotic role, iCOMs can be used as a powerful tool to characterize the chemical and physical properties of hot corinos. Using ALMA/FAUST data we aim to explore the iCOMs emission at &lt; 50 au scale around the Class 0 prototypical hot corino IRAS 4A2. We imaged IRAS 4A2 in six abundant, common iCOMs (CH$_3$OH, HCOOCH$_3$, CH$_3$CHO, CH$_3$CH$_2$OH, CH$_2$OHCHO, and NH$_2$CHO), and derived their emitting size. The column density and gas temperature for each species were derived at 1$\sigma$ from a multi-line analysis by applying a non-LTE approach for CH$_3$OH, and LTE population or rotational diagram analysis for the other iCOMs. Thanks to the unique estimates of the absorption from foreground millimeter dust toward IRAS 4A2, we derived for the first time unbiased gas temperatures and column densities. We resolved the IRAS 4A2 hot corino finding evidence for a chemical spatial distribution in the inner 50 au, with the outer emitting radius increasing from ~ 22-23 au for NH$_2$CHO and CH$_2$OHCHO, followed by CH$_3$CH$_2$OH (~ 27 au), CH$_3$CHO (~ 28 au), HCOOCH$_3$ (~ 36 au), and out to ~ 40 au for CH$_3$OH. Combining our estimate of the gas temperature probed by each iCOM with their beam-deconvolved emission sizes, we inferred the gas temperature profile of the hot corino on scales of 20-50 au in radius, finding a power-law index $q$ of approximately -1. We observed, for the first time, a chemical segregation in iCOMs of the IRAS 4A2 hot corino, and derived the gas temperature profile of its inner envelope. The derived profile is steeper than when considering a simple spherical collapsing and optically-thin envelope, hinting at a partially optically-thick envelope or a gravitationally unstable disk-like structure.</description>

      <title>Modeling submillimeter galaxies in cosmological simulations: Contribution to the cosmic star formation density and predictions for future surveys</title>

Abstract: Submillimeter galaxies (SMGs) constitute a key population of bright star-forming galaxies at high redshift. These galaxies challenge galaxy formation models, particularly in reproducing their observed number counts and redshift distributions. Furthermore, although SMGs contribute significantly to the cosmic star formation rate density (SFRD), their precise role remains uncertain. Upcoming surveys, such as the Ultra Deep Survey with the TolTEC camera, are expected to offer valuable insights into SMG properties and their broader impact. Robust modeling of SMGs in a cosmologically representative volume is necessary to investigate their nature in preparation for next-generation submillimeter surveys. We implement and test parametric relations derived from radiative transfer calculations across three cosmological simulations: EAGLE, IllustrisTNG, and FLAMINGO. Particular emphasis is placed on the FLAMINGO due to their large volume and robust statistical sampling of SMGs. Based on the model that best reproduces observations, we forecast submillimeter fluxes within the simulations, analyze the properties of SMGs, and evaluate their evolution over cosmic time. Our results show that the FLAMINGO reproduces the observed redshift distribution and source number counts of SMGs without requiring a top-heavy initial mass function. On the other hand, the EAGLE and IllustrisTNG show a deficit of bright SMGs. We find that SMGs with S850 &gt; 1 mJy contribute up to 27% of the SFRD at z=2.6 in the FLAMINGO, consistent with recent observations. Flux density functions reveal a rise in SMG abundance from z = 6 to 2.5, followed by a sharp decline in the number of brighter SMGs from z = 2.5 to 0. Leveraging the SMG population in FLAMINGO, we forecast that the TolTEC UDS will detect 80,000 sources over 0.8 deg^2 at 1.1 mm (at the 4{\sigma} detection limit), capturing about 50% of the cosmic SFRD at z=2.5.</description>

      <title>Hedgehog: An Isolated Quiescent Dwarf Galaxy at 2.4 Mpc</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00101v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is well-known that almost all isolated dwarf galaxies are actively forming stars. We report the discovery of dw1322m2053 (nicknamed Hedgehog), an isolated quiescent dwarf galaxy at a distance of $2.40\pm0.15$ Mpc with a stellar mass of $M_\star \approx 10^{5.8}\, M_\odot$. The distance is measured using surface brightness fluctuations with both Legacy Surveys and deep Magellan/IMACS imaging data. Hedgehog is 1.7~Mpc from the nearest galaxy group, Centaurus A, and has no neighboring galaxies within 1~Mpc, making it one of the most isolated quiescent dwarf galaxies at this stellar mass. It has a red optical color and early-type morphology and shows no UV emission. This indicates that Hedgehog has an old stellar population and no ongoing star formation. Compared with other quiescent dwarfs in the Local Group and Local Volume, Hedgehog appears smaller in size for its luminosity but is consistent with the mass--size relations. Hedgehog might be a backsplash galaxy from the Centaurus A group, but it could also have been quenched in the field by ram pressure stripping in the cosmic web, reionization, or internal processes such as supernova and stellar feedback. Future observations are needed to fully unveil its formation, history, and quenching mechanisms.</description>

      <title>GD-1 Stellar Stream and Cocoon in the DESI Early Data Release</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06336v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present 115 new spectroscopically identified members of the GD-1 tidal stream observed with the 5000-fiber Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI). We confirm the existence of a ``cocoon'' which is a broad (FWHM~2.932 deg ~ 460 pc) and kinematically hot (velocity dispersion, sigma ~ 5-8 km/s) component that surrounds a narrower (FWHM~ 0.353 deg ~ 55) and colder (sigma = 3.09+/-0.76 km/s) thin stream component (based on a median per star velocity precision of 2.7 km/s). The cocoon extends over at least a 30 degree segment of the stream observed by DESI. The thin and cocoon components have similar mean values of [Fe/H]: -2.54+/- 0.04 dex and -2.47+/- 0.06 dex suggestive of a common origin. The data are consistent with the following scenarios for the origin of the cocoon. The progenitor of the GD-1 stream was an accreted globular cluster (GC) and: (a) the cocoon was produced by pre-accretion tidal stripping of the GC while it was still inside its parent dwarf galaxy; (b) the cocoon is debris from the parent dwarf galaxy; (c) an initially thin GC tidal stream was heated by impacts from dark subhalos in the Milky Way; (d) an initially thin GC stream was heated by a massive Sagittarius dwarf galaxy; or a combination of some these. Future DESI spectroscopy and detailed modeling may enable us to distinguish between these possible origins.</description>

      <title>Gas Accretion Traced by Blue-Dominated Ly$\alpha$ Emission and Redshifted UV Absorption Lines in Protocluster Galaxies at z = 2.3 from the KBSS-KCWI Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01598v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ly$\alpha$ emission with a dominant blueshifted peak can probe gas flowing through the circumgalactic medium as it accretes onto galaxies and fuels new star formation, although it has seldom actually been observed. Here we present new Keck Cosmic Web Imager observations of the extended Ly$\alpha$ halos surrounding Q1700-BX710 and Q1700-BX711, a pair of UV continuum-selected Keck Baryonic Structure Survey (KBSS) galaxies at z = 2.3 in the HS1700+643 protocluster. We find that BX710 and BX711's Ly$\alpha$ halos are aligned with a large-scale galaxy filament consisting of thirteen spectroscopically identified protocluster galaxies. By measuring the peak separation and blue-to-red peak flux ratio of the Ly$\alpha$ emission profiles throughout these galaxies' Ly$\alpha$ halos, we have obtained measurements of their spatially varying velocity structure. The prevalence of blue-dominated Ly$\alpha$ emission profiles throughout BX711's Ly$\alpha$ halo suggests actively accreting gas. We fit a clumpy, multiphase Monte Carlo Radiative Transfer model which assumes a radially varying clump velocity to the spatially resolved Ly$\alpha$ emission throughout BX710 and BX711's Ly$\alpha$ halos and simultaneously fit these galaxies' average down-the-barrel UV absorption profile with a radially varying velocity model. The results of these models are consistent with a combination of HI and higher-metallicity gas accretion for both galaxies, especially BX711, which exhibits inflow-driven kinematics throughout most of its Ly$\alpha$ halo. We consider various accretion scenarios to explain these findings, including accretion of metal-enriched gas from the cosmic web, galaxy interactions, and recycled gas from the circumgalactic medium, all of which are compatible with our current observations.</description>

      <title>High detection significance of the dark substructure in gravitational lens SDSSJ0946+1006 by image pixel supersampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11090v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent studies have shown that the dark substructure reported in the gravitational lens SDSSJ0946+1006 has a high central density which is in apparent tension with the $\Lambda$CDM paradigm. However, its detection significance has been found in Ballard et al. (2024) to be sensitive to prior assumptions about the smoothness of the source galaxy. Here we show that the detection significance of the substructure is higher than previously reported (log-Bayes factor $\approx 143$, equivalent to a $\sim17\sigma$ detection) by approximating the integration of light over each pixel via ray tracing and averaging over many subpixels -- a technique known as supersampling -- and this result is insensitive to the assumed prior on the source galaxy smoothness. Assuming a dark matter subhalo, the combination of supersampling and modeling both sets of lensed arcs also tightens the subhalo constraints: we find the subhalo's projected mass within 1 kpc lies in the range $(2.2-3.4)\times10^9M_\odot$ at 95% confidence in our highest evidence model, while the log-slope of the subhalo's projected density at 1 kpc is steeper than $-1.75$ at the 95% confidence level, further establishing it as an outlier compared to expectations from CDM. We also identify a systematic that has biased the slope of the primary lensing galaxy's density profile in prior studies, which we speculate might be due to the presence of dust or an imperfect foreground subtraction. Our analysis places the existence of the substructure on firmer ground, and should motivate deeper follow-up observations to better constrain its properties and clarify its apparent tension with $\Lambda$CDM.</description>

      <title>The AURORA Survey: An Extraordinarily Mature, Star-forming Galaxy at $z\sim 7$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.00110v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the properties of a massive, large, dusty, metal-rich, star-forming galaxy at z_spec=6.73. GOODSN-100182 was observed with JWST/NIRSpec as part of the AURORA survey, and is also covered by public multi-wavelength HST and JWST imaging. While the large stellar mass of GOODSN-100182 (~10^10 M_sun) was indicated prior to JWST, NIRCam rest-optical imaging now reveals the presence of an extended disk (r_eff~1.5 kpc). In addition, the NIRSpec R~1000 spectrum of GOODSN-100182 includes the detection of a large suite of rest-optical nebular emission lines ranging in wavelength from [OII]3727 up to [NII]6583. The ratios of Balmer lines suggest significant dust attenuation (E(B-V)_gas=0.40+0.10/-0.09), consistent with the red rest-UV slope inferred for GOODSN-100182 (beta=-0.50+/-0.09). The star-formation rate based on dust-corrected H-alpha emission is log(SFR(H-alpha)/ M_sun/yr)=2.02+0.13/-0.14, well above the z~7 star-forming main sequence in terms of specific SFR. Strikingly, the ratio of [NII]6583/H-alpha emission suggests almost solar metallicity, as does the ratio ([OIII]5007/H-beta)/([NII]6583/H-alpha) and the detection of the faint [FeII]4360 emission feature. Overall, the excitation and ionization properties of GOODSN-100182 more closely resemble those of typical star-forming galaxies at z~2-3 rather than z~7. Based on public spectroscopy of the GOODS-N field, we find that GOODSN-100182 resides within a significant galaxy overdensity, and is accompanied by a spectroscopically-confirmed neighbor galaxy. GOODSN-100182 demonstrates the existence of mature, chemically-enriched galaxies within the first billion years of cosmic time, whose properties must be explained by galaxy formation models.</description>

      <title>The impact of cosmic ray heating on the cooling of the low-metallicity interstellar medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19087v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Low-metallicity environments are subject to inefficient cooling. They also have low dust-to-gas ratios and therefore less efficient photoelectric (PE) heating than in solar-neighbourhood conditions, where PE heating is one of the most important heating processes in the warm neutral interstellar medium (ISM). We perform magneto-hydrodynamic simulations of stratified ISM patches with a gas metallicity of 0.02 Z$_\odot$ as part of the SILCC project. The simulations include non-equilibrium chemistry, heating, and cooling of the low-temperature ISM as well as anisotropic cosmic ray (CR) transport, and stellar tracks. We include stellar feedback in the form of far-UV and ionising (FUV and EUV) radiation, massive star winds, supernovae, and CR injection. From the local CR energy density, we compute a CR heating rate that is variable in space and time. In this way, we can compare the relative impact of PE and CR heating on the metal-poor ISM and find that CR heating can dominate over PE heating. Models with a uniform CR ionisation rate suppress or severely delay star formation, since they provide a larger amount of energy to the ISM due to CR heating. Models with a variable CR ionisation rate form stars predominantly in pristine regions with low PE heating and CR ionisation rates where the metal-poor gas is able to cool efficiently. Because of the low metallicity, the amount of formed stars in all runs is not enough to trigger outflows of gas from the mid-plane.</description>

      <title>Weak-lensing Mass Reconstruction of Galaxy Clusters with a Convolutional Neural Network -- II: Application to Next-Generation Wide-Field Surveys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19907v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Traditional weak-lensing mass reconstruction techniques suffer from various artifacts, including noise amplification and the mass-sheet degeneracy. In Hong et al. (2021), we demonstrated that many of these pitfalls of traditional mass reconstruction can be mitigated using a deep learning approach based on a convolutional neural network (CNN). In this paper, we present our improvements and report on the detailed performance of our CNN algorithm applied to next-generation wide-field observations. Assuming the field of view ($3\deg.5 \times 3\deg.5$) and depth (27 mag at $5\sigma$) of the Vera C. Rubin Observatory, we generated training datasets of mock shear catalogs with a source density of 33 arcmin$^{-2}$ from cosmological simulation ray-tracing data. We find that the current CNN method provides high-fidelity reconstructions consistent with the true convergence field, restoring both small and large-scale structures. In addition, the cluster detection utilizing our CNN reconstruction achieves $\sim75$% completeness down to $\sim 10^{14}M_{\odot}$. We anticipate that this CNN-based mass reconstruction will be a powerful tool in the Rubin era, enabling fast and robust wide-field mass reconstructions on a routine basis.</description>

      <title>Understanding the Mechanisms Behind the Distribution of Galactic Metals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.01518v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The evolution and distribution of metals within galaxies are critical for understanding galactic evolution and star formation processes, but the mechanisms responsible for shaping this distribution remain uncertain. In this study, we carry out high-resolution simulations of an isolated Milky Way-like galaxy, including a star-by-star treatment of both feedback and element injection. We include seven key isotopes of observational and physical interest, and which are distributed across different nucleosynthetic channels--primarily AGB stars (N, Ba, Ce), supernovae (O, Mg, S), and Wolf-Rayet stars (C) show measurably different correlation statistics in space and time and their fluctuations. This difference arises from the distinct ejection mechanisms associated with each nucleosynthetic process. The large-scale properties ensure that different elements, despite having different nucleosynthetic origins, are highly correlated with one another (&gt;0.85 for all, &gt;0.99 for same orgins), and their spatial correlations vary together in time. However small-scale variations naturally break elements into distinct nucleosynthetic familiars, with elements originating from the same channels correlating better with each other than with elements from different origins. Our findings suggest both challenges and opportunities for ongoing efforts to use chemical measurements of gas and stars to unravel the history and physics of galaxy assembly.</description>

      <title>High-resolution imaging of the radio source associated with Project Hephaistos Dyson Sphere Candidate G</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.05152v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present high-resolution e-MERLIN and EVN (e-VLBI) observations of a radio source associated with Dyson Sphere candidate G, identified as part of Project Hephaistos. The radio source, VLASS J233532.86-000424.9, is resolved into three compact components and shows the typical characteristics of a radio-loud active galactic nucleus (AGN). In particular, the European VLBI Network (EVN) observations show that it has a brightness temperature in excess of $10^{8}$~K. No radio emission is detected at the position of the M-dwarf star. This result confirms our earlier hypothesis, that at least some of the Dyson Sphere candidates of project Hephaistos are contaminated by obscured, background AGN, lying close to the line of sight of otherwise normal galactic stars. High-resolution radio observations of other Dyson Sphere candidates can be useful in distinguishing truly promising candidates from those contaminated by background sources.</description>

      <title>Improved SED-Fitting Assumptions Result in Inside-Out Quenching at $z\sim0.5$ and Quenching at All Radii Simultaneously at $z\sim1$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06297v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many studies conclude that galaxies quench from the inside-out by examining profiles of specific star-formation rate (sSFR). These are usually measured by fitting spectral energy distributions (SEDs) assuming a fixed dust law and uniform priors on all parameters. Here, we examine the effects of more physically motivated priors: a flexible dust law, an exponential prior on the dust attenuation $A_V$, and Gaussian priors that favor extended star-formation histories. This results in model colors that better trace observations. We then perform radial SED fits to multiband flux profiles measured from Hubble Space Telescope images for 1,440 galaxies at $0.4&lt;z&lt;1.5$ of stellar masses $10^{10}-10^{11.5}\ M_{\odot}$ using both the traditional and the more physically motivated assumptions. The latter results in star formation rate and $A_V$ profiles that agree with measurements from spectroscopy and $A_V$ profiles that behave correctly as a function of inclination. Since green valley galaxies at $z\sim1.3$ are expected to evolve into quiescent galaxies at $z\sim0.9$, we compare their sSFR profiles using the more physically motivated assumptions. Their slopes are similar at all masses ($0.06 - 0.08~\textrm{dex}~\textrm{kpc}^{-1}$), and the normalizations for the quiescent galaxies are lower. Therefore, the sSFR profiles decline with time as quenching occurs at all radii simultaneously. We compare profiles of green valley galaxies at $z\sim0.9$ and quiescent galaxies at $z\sim0.5$. The former are shallower at all masses by $\sim0.1~\textrm{dex}~\textrm{kpc}^{-1}$. The sSFR profiles steepen with time as galaxies quench from the inside-out. In summary, galaxies at $z\sim1$ quench at all radii simultaneously while galaxies at $z\sim0.7$ quench from the inside-out.</description>

Abstract: Local-type primordial non-Gaussianity (PNG), predicted by many non-minimal models of inflation, creates a scale-dependent contribution to the power spectrum of large-scale structure (LSS) tracers. Its amplitude is characterized by the product $b_\phi f_{\rm NL}^{\rm loc}$, where $b_\phi$ is an astrophysical parameter dependent on the properties of the tracer. However, $b_\phi$ exhibits significant secondary dependence on halo concentration and other astrophysical properties, which may bias and weaken the constraints on $f_{\rm NL}^{\rm loc}$. In this work, we demonstrate that incorporating knowledge of the relation between Lagrangian bias parameters and $b_\phi$ can significantly enhance PNG constraints. We employ the Hybrid Effective Field Theory (HEFT) approach at the field-level and a linear regression model to seek a connection between the bias parameters and $b_{\phi}$ for halo and galaxy samples, constructed using the \textsc{AbacusSummit} simulation suite and mimicking the luminous red galaxies (LRGs) and quasi-stellar objects (QSOs) of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) survey. For the fixed-mass halo samples, our full bias model reduces the uncertainty by more than 70\%, with most of that improvement coming from $b_\nabla$, which we find to be an excellent proxy for concentration. For the galaxy samples, our model reduces the uncertainty on $b_\phi$ by 80\% for all tracers. By adopting Lagrangian-bias informed priors on the parameter $b_\phi$, future analyses can thus constrain $f_{\rm NL}^{\rm loc}$ with less bias and smaller errors.</description>

      <title>Wavelength-dependent far-infrared polarization of HL Tau observed with SOFIA/HAWC+</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16873v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the first polarimetric observations of a circumstellar disk in the far-infrared wavelength range. We report flux and linear polarization measurements of the young stellar object HL Tau in the bands A (53 $\mu$m), C (89 $\mu$m), D (155 $\mu$m), and E (216 $\mu$m) with SOFIA/HAWC+. The orientation of the polarization vectors is strongly wavelength-dependent and can be attributed to different wavelength-dependent polarization mechanisms in the disk and its local environment. In bands A, C, and D, the orientation of the polarization is roughly consistent with a value of 114{\deg} at the maximum emission. Hereby, the magnetic field direction is close to that of the spin axis of the disk. In contrast, in band E, the orientation is nearly parallel to the minor axis of the projection of the inclined disk. Based on a viscous accretion disk model combined with a surrounding envelope, we performed polarized three-dimensional Monte Carlo radiative transfer simulations. In particular, we considered polarization due to emission and absorption by aligned dust grains, and polarization due to scattering of the thermal reemission (self-scattering). At wavelengths of 53 $\mu$m, 89 $\mu$m, and 155 $\mu$m, we were able to reproduce the observed orientation of the polarization vectors. Here, the origin of polarization is consistent with polarized emission by aligned non-spherical dust grains. In contrast, at a wavelength of 216 $\mu$m, the polarization pattern could not be fully matched, however, applying self-scattering and assuming dust grain radii up to 35 $\mu$m, we were able to reproduce the flip in the orientation of polarization. We conclude that the polarization is caused by dichroic emission of aligned dust grains in the envelope, while at longer wavelengths, the envelope becomes transparent and the polarization is dominated by self-scattering in the disk.</description>
