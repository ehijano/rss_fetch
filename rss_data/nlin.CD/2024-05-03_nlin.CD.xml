      <title>On the weight dynamics of learning networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00743v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural networks have become a widely adopted tool for tackling a variety of problems in machine learning and artificial intelligence. In this contribution we use the mathematical framework of local stability analysis to gain a deeper understanding of the learning dynamics of feed forward neural networks. Therefore, we derive equations for the tangent operator of the learning dynamics of three-layer networks learning regression tasks. The results are valid for an arbitrary numbers of nodes and arbitrary choices of activation functions. Applying the results to a network learning a regression task, we investigate numerically, how stability indicators relate to the final training-loss. Although the specific results vary with different choices of initial conditions and activation functions, we demonstrate that it is possible to predict the final training loss, by monitoring finite-time Lyapunov exponents or covariant Lyapunov vectors during the training process.</description>

      <title>Synchronization Dynamics in the Spatial Evolution of Optical Power in Optical Oligomer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00976v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigated the spatial evolution of optical power in a closed-form optical waveguide configuration consisting of six passive waveguides and each of the waveguides exhibits equal strength of Kerr nonlinearity. We considered only nearest neighbor interaction between the waveguides. We found that in the case of low Kerr nonlinearity, evolution of optical power shows synchronization behavior. But when we increased the strength of Kerr nonlinearity, we discovered that spatial evolution of optical power in all waveguides shows independent characteristics. On the other hand, we have studied the impact of the coupling constant on the synchronization dynamics of our system. Our findings showed us that strong coupling can strengthen the collective dynamics in the presence of strong Kerr nonlinearity. From our results, we can conclude that Kerr nonlinearity in our system plays the role of disorder parameter that destroys as well as alters the synchronization behavior of evolution of optical power in the waveguides and coupling constant plays the role of an antagonist and restores synchronization in the model.</description>
