      <title>Intrinsic Bottleneck Distance for Merge Trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02755v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Merge trees are a topological descriptor of a filtered space that enriches the degree zero barcode with its merge structure. The space of merge trees comes equipped with an interleaving distance $d_I$, which prompts a naive question: is the interleaving distance between two merge trees equal to the bottleneck distance between their corresponding barcodes? As the map from merge trees to barcodes is not injective, the answer as posed is no, but (as conjectured in Gasparovic et al.) we prove that it is true for the \emph{intrinsic} metrics $\widehat{d}_I$ and $\widehat{d}_B$ realized by infinitesimal path length in merge tree space. This result suggests that in some special cases the bottleneck distance (which can be computed quickly) can be substituted for the interleaving distance (in general, NP-hard).</description>

      <title>Scalar Curvature And Transfer Maps In Spin And Spin^c Bordism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1992, Stolz proved that, among simply connected Spin-manifolds of dimension 5 or greater, the vanishing of a particular invariant $\alpha$ is necessary and sufficient for the existence of a metric of positive scalar curvature. More precisely, there is a map $\alpha\colon\Omega_*^{\rm Spin}\to {\rm ko}$ (which may be realized as the index of a Dirac operator) which Hitchin established vanishes on bordism classes containing a manifold with a metric of positive scalar curvature. Stolz showed $\ker\alpha$ is the image of a transfer map $\Omega_{*-8}^{\rm Spin}{\rm BPSp}(3)\to\Omega_*^{\rm Spin}$. In this paper we prove an analogous result for Spin$^c$-manifolds and a related invariant $\alpha^c: \Omega_*^{{\rm Spin}^c} \to {\rm ku}$. We show that $\ker\alpha^x$ is the sum of the image of Stolz's transfer $\Omega_{*-8}^{\rm Spin}{\rm BPSp}(3) \to \Omega_*^{{\rm Spin}^c}$ and an analogous map $\Omega_{*-4}^{{\rm Spin}^c}{\rm BSU}(3) \to \Omega_*^{{\rm Spin}^c}$. Finally, we expand on some details in Stolz's original paper and provide alternate proofs for some parts.</description>

      <title>Homotopy equivalence of digital pictures in $\mathbb{Z}^2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the properties of digital homotopy in the context of digital pictures $(X,\kappa,\bar \kappa)$, where $X\subsetneq \mathbb{Z}^n$ is a finite set, $\kappa$ is an adjacency relation on $X$, and $\bar \kappa$ is an adjacency relation on the complement of $X$. In particular we focus on homotopy equivalence between digital pictures in $\mathbb{Z}^2$. We define a numerical homotopy-type invariant for digital pictures in $\mathbb{Z}^2$ called the outer perimeter, which is a basic tool for distinguishing homotopy types of digital pictures. When a digital pictures has no holes, we show that it is homotopy equivalent to its rc-convex hull, obtained by ``filling in the gaps'' of any row or column. We show that a digital picture $(X,c_i,c_j)$ is homotopy equivalent to only finitely many other digital pictures $(Y,c_i,c_j)$. At the end of the paper, we raise a conjecture on the row-column-convex hull of a digital picture.</description>

      <title>On torus equivariant $S^4$-bundles over $S^4$ and Petrie-type questions for GKM manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We classify $T^2$-GKM fibrations in which both fiber and base are the GKM graph of $S^4$, with standard weights in the base. For each case in which the total space is orientable, we construct, by explicit clutching, a realization as a $T^2$-equivariant linear $S^4$-bundle over $S^4$. We determine which of the total spaces of these examples are non-equivariantly homotopy equivalent, homeomorphic or diffeomorphic, thereby finding many examples of a) pairs of homotopy equivalent, non-homeomorphic GKM manifolds with different first Pontryagin class, and b) pairs of GKM actions on the same smooth manifold whose GKM graphs do not agree as unlabeled graphs.</description>

      <title>The Splitting of Generalisations of the Fadell-Neuwirth short exact sequence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02707v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study some generalisations to mixed braid groups of the Fadell-Neuwirth short exact sequence and the possible splitting of this sequence. In certain cases, we determine conditions under which the projection from the mixed braid group $B_{n_{1},\ldots,n_{k}}(M)$ to $B_{n_{1},\ldots, n_{k-q}}(M)$ admits a section, where $M$ is either the torus or the Klein bottle, $n_{1}, \ldots, n_{k},q \in \mathbb{N}$, and $1\leq q \leq k-1$. For $k\geq 2$ and $q=k-1$, we show that this projection admits a section if and only if $n_{1}$ divides $n_{i}$ for all $i=2,\ldots, k$. We present some partial conclusions in the case $k\geq 3$ and $q=1$. To obtain our results, we compute and make use of suitable mixed braid groups of $M$, as well as certain key quotients that play a central r\^{o}le in our analysis.</description>

      <title>Rings of cooperations for Hermitian K-theory over finite fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.02786v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compute the ring of cooperations $\pi_{**}^{\mathbb{F}_q}(\text{kq} \otimes \text{kq})$ for the very effective Hermitian K-theory over all finite fields $\mathbb{F}_q$ where $\text{char}(\mathbb{F}_q) \neq 2.$ To do this, we use the motivic Adams spectral sequence and show that all differentials are determined by the integral motivic cohomology of $\mathbb{F}_q$. As an application, we compute the $E_1$-page of the kq-resolution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.03371v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish a DK-equivalence between the relative category of $\pi$-tribes and the relative category of locally cartesian closed quasicategories. From this follows one of the internal languages conjecture: Martin-L\"of type theory with dependent sums, intensional identity types, and dependent products satisfying functional extensionality is the internal language of locally cartesian closed $(\infty,1)$-categories.</description>

Abstract: For an arbitrary link $L \subset S^3$ , Sarkar-Scaduto-Stoffregen construct a family of spatial refinements of even and odd Khovanov homology. We give a computation of $\text{Sq}^2$ on these spaces, determining their stable homotopy types for all knots K up to 11 crossings. We also prove that the Steenrod squares $\text{Sq}_0^2$ , $\text{Sq}_1^2$ defined by Sch\"utz do arise as Steenrod squares on these spaces.</description>

      <title>Bousfield-Kan completion as a codensity $\infty$-monad</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08414v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a theory of codensity monads associated with full subcategories in the setting of $\infty$-categories. For an $\infty$-monad $\mathcal{M}$ on an $\infty$-category $\mathcal{C}$ that admits totalizations of cosimplicial objects, we consider the $\mathcal{M}$-completion functor defined as the totalization of the canonical cosimplicial functor associated with $\mathcal{M}$. We prove that the $\mathcal{M}$-completion functor is the codensity $\infty$-monad of a full $\infty$-subcategory $\mathcal{A}(\mathcal{M})\subseteq \mathcal{C}$ spanned by objects that admit a structure of $\mathcal{M}$-algebra. This implies that the $\mathcal{M}$-completion functor is the terminal object in the $\infty$-category of $\infty$-monads preserving all objects of $\mathcal{A}(\mathcal{M})$. As an application, we prove that the classical Bousfield-Kan $R$-completion functor is the codensity $\infty$-monad of the full subcategory in the $\infty$-category of spaces $\mathcal{K}(R) \subseteq \mathsf{Spc}$ spanned by the empty space and the products of Eilenberg-MacLane spaces of $R$-modules. As a corollary, we obtain two universal properties of the Bousfield-Kan $R$-completion: it is the terminal $\mathcal{K}(R)$-preserving coaugmented functor, and the terminal $\mathcal{K}(R)$-preserving $\infty$-monad.</description>

      <title>Interpreting type theory in a quasicategory: a Yoneda approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2207.01967v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We make use of a higher version of the Yoneda embedding to construct, from a given quasicategory, a tribe, as a subcategory of a well-behaved simplicial model category, that presents the same $(\infty,1)$-category as the former quasicategory. We then show that, when the quasicategory is locally cartesian closed, it is possible to further endow such a tribe with enough structure for it to provide a model of Martin-L\"of type theory with $\Pi$-types. This mapping procedure restricts so that elementary higher topoi yield models of homotopy type theory.</description>

      <title>Persistence diagrams as morphological signatures of cells: A method to measure and compare cells within a population</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.20644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.20644v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cell biologists study in parallel the morphology of cells with the regulation mechanisms that modify this morphology. Such studies are complicated by the inherent heterogeneity present in the cell population. It remains difficult to define the morphology of a cell with parameters that can quantify this heterogeneity, leaving the cell biologist to rely on manual inspection of cell images. We propose an alternative to this manual inspection that is based on topological data analysis. We characterise the shape of a cell by its contour and nucleus. We build a filtering of the edges defining the contour using a radial distance function initiated from the nucleus. This filtering is then used to construct a persistence diagram that serves as a signature of the cell shape. Two cells can then be compared by computing the Wasserstein distance between their persistence diagrams. Given a cell population, we then compute a distance matrix that includes all pairwise distances between its members. We analyse this distance matrix using hierarchical clustering with different linkage schemes and define a purity score that quantifies consistency between those different schemes, which can then be used to assess homogeneity within the cell population. We illustrate and validate our approach to identify sub-populations in human mesenchymal stem cell populations.</description>
