      <title>Ferroelectric quantum critical point in superconducting hydrides: The case of H$_3$S</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00833v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: H$_3$S sulfur hydride has been widely investigated for its high superconducting critical temperature $T_c$ of 203 K at about $p_c = 155$ GPa. Despite being the precursor of superconducting hydrides, a detailed picture of its phase diagram in an extended temperature and pressure range is still missing. To determine it with inclusion of both thermal and quantum effects, we carry out path integral molecular dynamics combined to a MACE neural network potential trained on BLYP density functional theory configurations. The resulting H$_3$S phase diagram is characterized by the ferroelectric transition between the Im$\bar{3}$m and R3m phases, which originates from a quantum critical point (QCP) located at $p_\mathrm{QCP} \approx 134$ GPa. We show that the experimental $T_c$ peak falls into a paraelectric region of large nuclear quantum fluctuations above the ferroelectric QCP, as measured by local phonon Green's functions resolved in imaginary time, where fluctuating dipole moments are at play. We study the critical behavior of the system in the proximity of the QCP by a finite-size scaling analysis, showing that it belongs to the 4D Ising universality class. We finally discuss its implications for the superconducting state.</description>

      <title>Novel dynamical excitations and roton-based measurement of Cooper-pair momentum in a two-dimensional Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov superfluid on optical lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Determining the center-of-mass (COM) momentum of Cooper pairs in unconventional superconductors or superfluids is a topic of great interest in condensed matter physics and ultracold atomic gases. Theoretically, we investigate the dynamical excitations of a two-dimensional spin-polarized attractive Hubbard model on a square optical lattice under an effective Zeeman field by computing the density and spin dynamical structure factors, focusing on phase transition from a Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) superfluid to an Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) superfluid. In the FFLO superfluid, besides the phonon mode in the density channel, a low-energy bogolon mode emerges in the spin channel, which is associated with Bogoliubov quasiparticles on a Bogoliubov Fermi surface. Moreover, the dynamical excitations exhibit pronounced anisotropy in momentum space due to the finite COM momentum. At half filling, the roton mode around $[\pi,\pi]$ evolves from a point-like minimum into a ring structure shifted by the COM momentum across the BCS-FFLO transition, providing a roton-based protocol to extract the COM momentum. These predictions provide key insights for confirming the existence of FFLO superfluids and understanding their dynamical excitation spectra.</description>

      <title>Two-lifetime model for the cuprates revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Several models of the strange-metal state of the cuprate superconductors postulate the existence of strong inelastic forward scattering of the electrons, but direct evidence of such scattering is missing. Here we show that angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) provides a unique tool which can address this issue. We propose a two-lifetime phenomenological model of the superconducting state of the cuprates and we show that it explains several salient low-energy features of the measured ARPES spectra. The model enables discrimination between forward- and large-angle scattering and, in addition, gives access to the magnitude of the gap function away from the Fermi surface.</description>

      <title>Direct Observation of Unidirectional Density Wave and Band splitting in a Single-Domain Trilayer Nickelate Pr$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02127v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unraveling the interplay between density-wave (DW) instabilities and multi-orbital physics is critical for understanding superconductivity in Ruddlesden-Popper nickelates, yet intrinsic electronic features have been persistently obscured by material inhomogeneity and thus the multi-domain averaging effect. Here, we employ micro-focused angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy ($\mu$-ARPES) on single-domain Pr$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ to disentangle the complex hierarchy of intrinsic and back-folded bands, explicitly identifying the electronic states driving the DW phase transition. We provide decisive spectroscopic evidence that the low-energy reconstruction is governed by inter-orbital nesting between the $\alpha$ and $\beta$ bands. Specifically, we resolve a orbital-dependent gap of $\sim44$ meV on the $\alpha$ pocket, a value quantitatively consistent with prior measurements, unifying previously conflicting experimental reports regarding the locus and magnitude of the DW gap. Furthermore, we reveal strong orbital-selective mass renormalization in the $d_{z^2}$ states and successfully resolve the long-sought intrinsic trilayer $\beta$-band splitting, establishing a critical lower bound for the outer-layer hopping. These results define a coherent microscopic fingerprint for the trilayer nickelates, identifying the specific nesting channels and correlation effects that underpin the phase diagram.</description>

      <title>Contrasting Momentum-Selective Spin-Density-Wave Gaps in Bilayer and Trilayer Nickelates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02174v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Resolving where the density-wave gap opens in momentum space is essential for identifying the microscopic origin of the instability in layered nickelates. Using polarization-resolved electronic Raman scattering, we map the momentum selectivity of the spin-density-wave (SDW) gap in trilayer La4Ni3O10. We observe a SDW-induced redistribution of spectral weight on both the $\alpha$ pocket at the Brillouin-zone centre and a portion of the $\beta$ pocket near the zone boundary, characterized by gap energies of approximately 55~meV. In contrast, no comparable spectral weight suppression is observed along the diagonal region of $\beta$ pockets, implying little or no gap opening. This gap topology contrasts sharply with that in La3Ni2O7, where anisotropic SDW gaps open solely on the $\beta$ pocket. Our results establish a distinct momentum-space gap topology between bilayer and trilayer nickelates, placing new constraints on the ordering wave vector and the mechanism of the density-wave instability relevant to superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Long-range phase coherence and phase patterns in hybrid Josephson junction arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02255v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The coherence of superconductivity and its suppression near a quantum phase transition is governed by the interplay between local pairing and macroscopic phase coherence. Using scanning SQUID, we image the local susceptibility in a hybrid Josephson junction array. On a square lattice of narrow islands, we simultaneously access both the amplitude and spatial phase structure of sensitive superconducting states. We observe periodic phase patterns at commensurate magnetic fillings. At zero field the long-range phase coherence is strongest. At a finite field, smaller than one percent of flux quantum per unit cell, the system fragments into large regions of constant superconducting phase, as a function of the applied field. Our results provide the first direct measurement of long-range phase coherence in a Josephson junction array.</description>

      <title>Visualizing the Odd-parity Superconducting Order Parameter and its Quasiparticle Surface Band in UTe2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02490v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A distinctive identifier of nodal intrinsic topological superconductivity (ITS) would the appearance of an Andreev bound state on crystal surfaces parallel to the nodal axis, in the form of a topological quasiparticle surface band (QSB) appearing only for $T &lt; T_C$. Moreover, theory shows that specific QSB characteristics observable in tunneling to an s-wave superconductor can distinguish between chiral and non-chiral ITS order parameter $\Delta_k$. To search for such phenomena in $\text{UTe}_2$, s-wave superconductive scan-tip scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) imaging was employed. It reveals an intense zero-energy Andreev conductance maximum at the $\text{UTe}_2$ (0-11) crystal termination. Development of the zero-energy Andreev conductance peak into two finite-energy particle-hole symmetric conductance maxima as the tunnel barrier is reduced, then signifies that $\text{UTe}_2$ superconductivity is non-chiral. Quasiparticle interference imaging (QPI) for an ITS material should be dominated by the QSB for energies within the superconductive energy gap $|E| \le \Delta$, so that bulk $\Delta(k)$ characteristics of the ITS can only be detected excursively. Again using a superconducting scan-tip, the in-gap quasiparticle interference patterns of the QSB of $\text{UTe}_2$ were visualized. Specifically, a band of Bogoliubov quasiparticles appears as a characteristic sextet $q_i$ :$i = 1-6$ of interference wavevectors showing that QSB dispersions $k(E)$ occur only for energies $|E| \le \Delta_{max}$ and only within the range of Fermi momenta projected onto the (0-11) crystal surface. In combination, these phenomena are consistent with a bulk $\Delta(k)$ exhibiting spin triplet, time-reversal conserving, odd-parity, a-axis nodal, $B_{3u}$ symmetry in $\text{UTe}_2$.</description>

      <title>Reexamining the strange metal charge response with transmission inelastic electron scattering</title>

Abstract: The strange metal remains one of the great unsolved problems for 21st century science. Since the early development of the marginal Fermi liquid phenomenology, it has been clear that progress requires detailed knowledge of the momentum- and frequency-dependent charge susceptibility, $\chi(\mathbf{q},\omega)$, particularly at large momenta. Electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS), performed in either reflection or transmission geometry, provides the most direct probe of $\chi(\mathbf{q},\omega)$. However, measurements over the past four decades have yielded conflicting results, with some studies reporting a dispersing RPA-like plasmon and others observing a strongly overdamped, incoherent response. Here we report a transmission EELS study of Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+x}$ (Bi-2212) that simultaneously achieves high energy resolution ($\Delta E \approx 30$ meV) and high momentum resolution ($\Delta q \approx 0.01$ \r{A}$^{-1}$). To address issues of reproducibility, measurements were repeated ten times on five different Bi-2212 flakes, benchmarked against aluminum, a well-characterized Fermi liquid, and quantitatively compared with prior studies spanning four decades. At momenta $q &lt; 0.15$ \r{A}$^{-1}$, we observe a highly damped plasmon whose linewidth is comparable to its energy. At larger momenta, $q &gt; 0.15$ \r{A}$^{-1}$, this excitation does not disperse but instead evolves into an incoherent continuum, with no evidence for the RPA-like dispersion reported in some earlier works. Comparison with recent RIXS measurements on Bi-based cuprates supports the view that Bi-2212 is an incoherent metal with strongly damped charge excitations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.09387v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In superconductors with multiple pairing channels, Bardasis-Schrieffer modes and clapping modes arise as fluctuations in channels whose angular momenta differ from that of the pair condensate. Crystal symmetries often impose selection rules which keep these modes optically dark. We show that if pairing occurs around a single Fermi surface, trigonal warping renders both of these modes, as well as the quasiparticle excitation gap, visible in the longitudinal and Hall optical responses. Our results suggest that rhombohedral graphene multilayers, which are believed to host the required ingredients, might offer an ideal setting for the study of exotic superconducting collective modes.</description>

      <title>Two-Level System Microwave Losses in Chemically Pure Bulk Niobium Oxide Samples</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.06668v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Losses from two-level systems (TLS) associated with amorphous oxides remain one of the primary limitations to the performance of superconducting qubits and microwave cavities. Niobium resonators are widely used in quantum science experiments, yet niobium's natural oxide layer contains various types of oxides whose relative contributions to TLS loss have not been clearly distinguished. Here, we use a superconducting 3D microwave cavity to measure chemically pure oxides \ch{Nb2O5} and \ch{NbO2}. Using this approach, we directly compare the loss characteristics of \ch{Nb2O5} and \ch{NbO2}. Our measurements show that the \ch{Nb2O5} oxide exhibits losses which have the power and temperature behavior expected for TLS. Moreover, the measurements agree with existing theoretical models. Analogous measurements performed on \ch{NbO2} do not show any detectable TLS loss signatures. These results provide direct experimental evidence that \ch{Nb2O5} is the dominant TLS host in niobium resonators and establish a general framework for separating oxide-specific dissipation channels.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02995v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Second-order topological insulating (SOTI) states in three-dimensional materials are helical one-dimensional hinge states. Inducing superconductivity in these states leads to gapless bound states, characterized by the 4$\pi$-periodic current-phase relation. Here, we provide evidence of the topologically protected hinge states in Dirac semimetal Bi$_{0.97}$Sb$_{0.03}$ nanoflakes by an unconventional interference pattern in a magnetic field, and the 4$\pi$-periodic supercurrent carried by these states via the suppressed first and third Shapiro steps. Tight-binding simulations confirm the presence of multiple hinge modes, supporting our interpretation of Bi$_{0.97}$Sb$_{0.03}$ as a prototypical designable SOTI platform. Quantum confinement effect is identified by a quasi-one-dimensional bulk transport, and the confined Rashba states are responsible for the broadened hinge states.</description>

      <title>Magnetic correlations and superconducting pairing near higher-order Van Hove singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10358v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Higher-order Van Hove singularities in strongly correlated electron systems provide a fertile ground for emergent electronic orders and superconductivity. This study investigates the interplay between magnetic fluctuations and superconducting pairing near higher-order Van Hove singularities on the honeycomb lattice, a paradigmatic platform relevant to graphene. By incorporating third-nearest-neighbor hopping \(t''\), we uncover a universal crossover: ferromagnetic fluctuations dominate below the higher-order Van Hove filling, while antiferromagnetic fluctuations take over toward half filling. A key finding is that the already dominant \(f_n\)-wave pairing is enhanced in the critical region of this magnetic crossover by the higher-order Van Hove. This enhancement is driven by the synergistic effect of the higher-order Van Hove singularities-induced divergent density of states and the competing magnetic fluctuations. Although increased hopping parameters generally suppress superconducting correlation, we identify a critical \(t''\) that anomalously enhances pairing via the higher-order Van Hove renormalization. Furthermore, the nearest-neighbor Coulomb interaction suppresses the pairing correlation function in a sign-independent manner. Our results clarify the competitive mechanisms between magnetic fluctuations and unconventional superconductivity in higher-order Van Hove singularities systems, offering a theoretical basis for tailoring quantum phases in graphene-based materials via band engineering.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.16907v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that two Yukawa-SYK models with a weak tunneling contact can have an exotic hybrid superconducting thermofield-double-like state that is holographically dual to a traversable wormhole connecting two black holes with charged scalar hair. The hybrid superconducting thermo-field-double/wormhole state is distinguishable by anomalous scaling of revival oscillations in the fermionic Green's function, but also in a unique Andreev-revival in the anomalous Green's function. The existence of this TFD/wormhole state surprisingly shows that the some quantum critical effects can survive the phase transition to superconductivity. This Andreev-revival is in principle an accessible signature of the transition to the TFD/wormhole phase detectable in the ac-Josephson current.</description>

      <title>Beyond on-site Hubbard interaction in charge dynamics of cuprate superconductors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.21868v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this review, we first present compelling evidence from resonant inelastic x-ray scattering data that highlights the significance of the long-range Coulomb interaction in cuprate charge dynamics, particularly around the in-plane momentum q=(0,0). We show that these experimental observations are well-captured by the layered t-J-V model, which extends the standard t-J framework to include the long-range Coulomb interaction V and the layered structure.
  This new perspective elucidates how charge dynamics renormalizes one-particle excitation properties, leading to several profound and often counterintuitive consequences. We demonstrate that the electron dispersion does not exhibit a sharp kink, and Landau quasiparticles persist in the low-energy limit despite a significant suppression of their spectral weight. We further show that while charge fluctuations alone cannot fully account for the pseudogap, they are a crucial component for understanding its formation. Additionally, we reveal that optical plasmon excitations generate fermionic quasiparticles, known as plasmarons, which give rise to a distinct, incoherent replica band.
  We argue that accurately describing these plasmonic effects requires a three-dimensional theoretical approach. This perspective on plasmon excitations may offer a critically new clue to a long-standing puzzle: why multi-layer cuprate superconductors, containing more than two CuO2 layers per unit cell, consistently exhibit a higher critical temperature Tc than their single-layer counterparts. Finally, we review the spin-fluctuation mechanism of superconductivity suffers from the "self-restraint effect" and show how important the screened Coulomb interaction is in the spin-fluctuation mechanism to realize high-Tc superconductivity.</description>

Abstract: We demonstrate that a boundary-localized periodic (Floquet) drive can induce nontrivial long-range correlations in a non-interacting fermionic chain which is additionally subject to boundary dissipation. Surprisingly, we find that this phenomenon occurs even when the corresponding isolated bulk is in a trivial gapped phase with exponentially decaying correlations. We argue that this boundary-drive induced non-equilibrium transition (as witnessed through the correlation matrix) is driven by a resonance mechanism whereby the drive frequency bridges bulk energy gaps, allowing boundary-injected particles and holes to propagate and mediate long-range correlations into the bulk. We also numerically establish that when the drive bridges a particle-hole gap, the induced long-range order scales as a power law with the bulk pairing potential ($\chi \sim \gamma^2$). Our results highlight the potential of localized coherent driving for generating macroscopic order in open quantum systems.</description>
