      <title>EditRoom: LLM-parameterized Graph Diffusion for Composable 3D Room Layout Editing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12836v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given the steep learning curve of professional 3D software and the time-consuming process of managing large 3D assets, language-guided 3D scene editing has significant potential in fields such as virtual reality, augmented reality, and gaming. However, recent approaches to language-guided 3D scene editing either require manual interventions or focus only on appearance modifications without supporting comprehensive scene layout changes. In response, we propose Edit-Room, a unified framework capable of executing a variety of layout edits through natural language commands, without requiring manual intervention. Specifically, EditRoom leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) for command planning and generates target scenes using a diffusion-based method, enabling six types of edits: rotate, translate, scale, replace, add, and remove. To address the lack of data for language-guided 3D scene editing, we have developed an automatic pipeline to augment existing 3D scene synthesis datasets and introduced EditRoom-DB, a large-scale dataset with 83k editing pairs, for training and evaluation. Our experiments demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms other baselines across all metrics, indicating higher accuracy and coherence in language-guided scene layout editing.</description>

      <title>NePHIM: A Neural Physics-Based Head-Hand Interaction Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13503v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to the increasing use of virtual avatars, the animation of head-hand interactions has recently gained attention. To this end, we present a novel volumetric and physics-based interaction simulation. In contrast to previous work, our simulation incorporates temporal effects such as collision paths, respects anatomical constraints, and can detect and simulate skin pulling. As a result, we can achieve more natural-looking interaction animations and take a step towards greater realism. However, like most complex and computationally expensive simulations, ours is not real-time capable even on high-end machines. Therefore, we train small and efficient neural networks as accurate approximations that achieve about 200 FPS on consumer GPUs, about 50 FPS on CPUs, and are learned in less than four hours for one person. In general, our focus is not to generalize the approximation networks to low-resolution head models but to adapt them to more detailed personalized avatars. Nevertheless, we show that these networks can learn to approximate our head-hand interaction model for multiple identities while maintaining computational efficiency.
  Since the quality of the simulations can only be judged subjectively, we conducted a comprehensive user study which confirms the improved realism of our approach. In addition, we provide extensive visual results and inspect the neural approximations quantitatively. All data used in this work has been recorded with a multi--view camera rig and will be made available upon publication. We will also publish relevant implementations.</description>

      <title>Eyelid Fold Consistency in Facial Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13760v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Eyelid shape is integral to identity and likeness in human facial modeling. Human eyelids are diverse in appearance with varied skin fold and epicanthal fold morphology between individuals. Existing parametric face models express eyelid shape variation to an extent, but do not preserve sufficient likeness across a diverse range of individuals. We propose a new definition of eyelid fold consistency and implement geometric processing techniques to model diverse eyelid shapes in a unified topology. Using this method we reprocess data used to train a parametric face model and demonstrate significant improvements in face-related machine learning tasks.</description>

      <title>PC-Planner: Physics-Constrained Self-Supervised Learning for Robust Neural Motion Planning with Shape-Aware Distance Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12805v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motion Planning (MP) is a critical challenge in robotics, especially pertinent with the burgeoning interest in embodied artificial intelligence. Traditional MP methods often struggle with high-dimensional complexities. Recently neural motion planners, particularly physics-informed neural planners based on the Eikonal equation, have been proposed to overcome the curse of dimensionality. However, these methods perform poorly in complex scenarios with shaped robots due to multiple solutions inherent in the Eikonal equation. To address these issues, this paper presents PC-Planner, a novel physics-constrained self-supervised learning framework for robot motion planning with various shapes in complex environments. To this end, we propose several physical constraints, including monotonic and optimal constraints, to stabilize the training process of the neural network with the Eikonal equation. Additionally, we introduce a novel shape-aware distance field that considers the robot's shape for efficient collision checking and Ground Truth (GT) speed computation. This field reduces the computational intensity, and facilitates adaptive motion planning at test time. Experiments in diverse scenarios with different robots demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method in efficiency and robustness for robot motion planning, particularly in complex environments.</description>

      <title>L3DG: Latent 3D Gaussian Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13530v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose L3DG, the first approach for generative 3D modeling of 3D Gaussians through a latent 3D Gaussian diffusion formulation. This enables effective generative 3D modeling, scaling to generation of entire room-scale scenes which can be very efficiently rendered. To enable effective synthesis of 3D Gaussians, we propose a latent diffusion formulation, operating in a compressed latent space of 3D Gaussians. This compressed latent space is learned by a vector-quantized variational autoencoder (VQ-VAE), for which we employ a sparse convolutional architecture to efficiently operate on room-scale scenes. This way, the complexity of the costly generation process via diffusion is substantially reduced, allowing higher detail on object-level generation, as well as scalability to large scenes. By leveraging the 3D Gaussian representation, the generated scenes can be rendered from arbitrary viewpoints in real-time. We demonstrate that our approach significantly improves visual quality over prior work on unconditional object-level radiance field synthesis and showcase its applicability to room-scale scene generation.</description>

      <title>360U-Former: HDR Illumination Estimation with Panoramic Adapted Vision Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13566v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent illumination estimation methods have focused on enhancing the resolution and improving the quality and diversity of the generated textures. However, few have explored tailoring the neural network architecture to the Equirectangular Panorama (ERP) format utilised in image-based lighting. Consequently, high dynamic range images (HDRI) results usually exhibit a seam at the side borders and textures or objects that are warped at the poles. To address this shortcoming we propose a novel architecture, 360U-Former, based on a U-Net style Vision-Transformer which leverages the work of PanoSWIN, an adapted shifted window attention tailored to the ERP format. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first purely Vision-Transformer model used in the field of illumination estimation. We train 360U-Former as a GAN to generate HDRI from a limited field of view low dynamic range image (LDRI). We evaluate our method using current illumination estimation evaluation protocols and datasets, demonstrating that our approach outperforms existing and state-of-the-art methods without the artefacts typically associated with the use of the ERP format.</description>

      <title>MEGA: Memory-Efficient 4D Gaussian Splatting for Dynamic Scenes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13613v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: 4D Gaussian Splatting (4DGS) has recently emerged as a promising technique for capturing complex dynamic 3D scenes with high fidelity. It utilizes a 4D Gaussian representation and a GPU-friendly rasterizer, enabling rapid rendering speeds. Despite its advantages, 4DGS faces significant challenges, notably the requirement of millions of 4D Gaussians, each with extensive associated attributes, leading to substantial memory and storage cost. This paper introduces a memory-efficient framework for 4DGS. We streamline the color attribute by decomposing it into a per-Gaussian direct color component with only 3 parameters and a shared lightweight alternating current color predictor. This approach eliminates the need for spherical harmonics coefficients, which typically involve up to 144 parameters in classic 4DGS, thereby creating a memory-efficient 4D Gaussian representation. Furthermore, we introduce an entropy-constrained Gaussian deformation technique that uses a deformation field to expand the action range of each Gaussian and integrates an opacity-based entropy loss to limit the number of Gaussians, thus forcing our model to use as few Gaussians as possible to fit a dynamic scene well. With simple half-precision storage and zip compression, our framework achieves a storage reduction by approximately 190$\times$ and 125$\times$ on the Technicolor and Neural 3D Video datasets, respectively, compared to the original 4DGS. Meanwhile, it maintains comparable rendering speeds and scene representation quality, setting a new standard in the field.</description>

      <title>VidPanos: Generative Panoramic Videos from Casual Panning Videos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13832v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Panoramic image stitching provides a unified, wide-angle view of a scene that extends beyond the camera's field of view. Stitching frames of a panning video into a panoramic photograph is a well-understood problem for stationary scenes, but when objects are moving, a still panorama cannot capture the scene. We present a method for synthesizing a panoramic video from a casually-captured panning video, as if the original video were captured with a wide-angle camera. We pose panorama synthesis as a space-time outpainting problem, where we aim to create a full panoramic video of the same length as the input video. Consistent completion of the space-time volume requires a powerful, realistic prior over video content and motion, for which we adapt generative video models. Existing generative models do not, however, immediately extend to panorama completion, as we show. We instead apply video generation as a component of our panorama synthesis system, and demonstrate how to exploit the strengths of the models while minimizing their limitations. Our system can create video panoramas for a range of in-the-wild scenes including people, vehicles, and flowing water, as well as stationary background features.</description>

      <title>Differentiable Robot Rendering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13851v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vision foundation models trained on massive amounts of visual data have shown unprecedented reasoning and planning skills in open-world settings. A key challenge in applying them to robotic tasks is the modality gap between visual data and action data. We introduce differentiable robot rendering, a method allowing the visual appearance of a robot body to be directly differentiable with respect to its control parameters. Our model integrates a kinematics-aware deformable model and Gaussians Splatting and is compatible with any robot form factors and degrees of freedom. We demonstrate its capability and usage in applications including reconstruction of robot poses from images and controlling robots through vision language models. Quantitative and qualitative results show that our differentiable rendering model provides effective gradients for robotic control directly from pixels, setting the foundation for the future applications of vision foundation models in robotics.</description>

      <title>FlashTex: Fast Relightable Mesh Texturing with LightControlNet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.13251v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Manually creating textures for 3D meshes is time-consuming, even for expert visual content creators. We propose a fast approach for automatically texturing an input 3D mesh based on a user-provided text prompt. Importantly, our approach disentangles lighting from surface material/reflectance in the resulting texture so that the mesh can be properly relit and rendered in any lighting environment. We introduce LightControlNet, a new text-to-image model based on the ControlNet architecture, which allows the specification of the desired lighting as a conditioning image to the model. Our text-to-texture pipeline then constructs the texture in two stages. The first stage produces a sparse set of visually consistent reference views of the mesh using LightControlNet. The second stage applies a texture optimization based on Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) that works with LightControlNet to increase the texture quality while disentangling surface material from lighting. Our algorithm is significantly faster than previous text-to-texture methods, while producing high-quality and relightable textures.</description>

      <title>Depth-supervised NeRF: Fewer Views and Faster Training for Free</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.02791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2107.02791v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A commonly observed failure mode of Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) is fitting incorrect geometries when given an insufficient number of input views. One potential reason is that standard volumetric rendering does not enforce the constraint that most of a scene's geometry consist of empty space and opaque surfaces. We formalize the above assumption through DS-NeRF (Depth-supervised Neural Radiance Fields), a loss for learning radiance fields that takes advantage of readily-available depth supervision. We leverage the fact that current NeRF pipelines require images with known camera poses that are typically estimated by running structure-from-motion (SFM). Crucially, SFM also produces sparse 3D points that can be used as "free" depth supervision during training: we add a loss to encourage the distribution of a ray's terminating depth matches a given 3D keypoint, incorporating depth uncertainty. DS-NeRF can render better images given fewer training views while training 2-3x faster. Further, we show that our loss is compatible with other recently proposed NeRF methods, demonstrating that depth is a cheap and easily digestible supervisory signal. And finally, we find that DS-NeRF can support other types of depth supervision such as scanned depth sensors and RGB-D reconstruction outputs.</description>

      <title>HyperDreamBooth: HyperNetworks for Fast Personalization of Text-to-Image Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.06949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.06949v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Personalization has emerged as a prominent aspect within the field of generative AI, enabling the synthesis of individuals in diverse contexts and styles, while retaining high-fidelity to their identities. However, the process of personalization presents inherent challenges in terms of time and memory requirements. Fine-tuning each personalized model needs considerable GPU time investment, and storing a personalized model per subject can be demanding in terms of storage capacity. To overcome these challenges, we propose HyperDreamBooth - a hypernetwork capable of efficiently generating a small set of personalized weights from a single image of a person. By composing these weights into the diffusion model, coupled with fast finetuning, HyperDreamBooth can generate a person's face in various contexts and styles, with high subject details while also preserving the model's crucial knowledge of diverse styles and semantic modifications. Our method achieves personalization on faces in roughly 20 seconds, 25x faster than DreamBooth and 125x faster than Textual Inversion, using as few as one reference image, with the same quality and style diversity as DreamBooth. Also our method yields a model that is 10,000x smaller than a normal DreamBooth model. Project page: https://hyperdreambooth.github.io</description>
