      <title>Visual Authority and the Rhetoric of Health Misinformation: A Multimodal Analysis of Social Media Videos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20724v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Short form video platforms are central sites for health advice, where alternative narratives mix useful, misleading, and harmful content. Rather than adjudicating truth, this study examines how credibility is packaged in nutrition and supplement videos by analyzing the intersection of authority signals, narrative techniques, and monetization. We assemble a cross platform corpus of 152 public videos from TikTok, Instagram, and YouTube and annotate each on 26 features spanning visual authority, presenter attributes, narrative strategies, and engagement cues. A transparent annotation pipeline integrates automatic speech recognition, principled frame selection, and a multimodal model, with human verification on a stratified subsample showing strong agreement. Descriptively, a confident single presenter in studio or home settings dominates, and clinical contexts are rare. Analytically, authority cues such as titles, slides and charts, and certificates frequently occur with persuasive elements including jargon, references, fear or urgency, critiques of mainstream medicine, and conspiracies, and with monetization including sales links and calls to subscribe. References and science like visuals often travel with emotive and oppositional narratives rather than signaling restraint.</description>

      <title>ArchGPT: Understanding the World's Architectures with Large Multimodal Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20858v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Architecture embodies aesthetic, cultural, and historical values, standing as a tangible testament to human civilization. Researchers have long leveraged virtual reality (VR), mixed reality (MR), and augmented reality (AR) to enable immersive exploration and interpretation of architecture, enhancing accessibility, public understanding, and creative workflows around architecture in education, heritage preservation, and professional design practice. However, existing VR/MR/AR systems are often developed case-by-case, relying on hard-coded annotations and task-specific interactions that do not scale across diverse built environments. In this work, we present ArchGPT, a multimodal architectural visual question answering (VQA) model, together with a scalable data-construction pipeline for curating high-quality, architecture-specific VQA annotations. This pipeline yields Arch-300K, a domain-specialized dataset of approximately 315,000 image-question-answer triplets. Arch-300K is built via a multi-stage process: first, we curate architectural scenes from Wikimedia Commons and filter unconstrained tourist photo collections using a novel coarse-to-fine strategy that integrates 3D reconstruction and semantic segmentation to select occlusion-free, structurally consistent architectural images. To mitigate noise and inconsistency in raw textual metadata, we propose an LLM-guided text verification and knowledge-distillation pipeline to generate reliable, architecture-specific question-answer pairs. Using these curated images and refined metadata, we further synthesize formal analysis annotations-including detailed descriptions and aspect-guided conversations-to provide richer semantic variety while remaining faithful to the data. We perform supervised fine-tuning of an open-source multimodal backbone ,ShareGPT4V-7B, on Arch-300K, yielding ArchGPT.</description>

      <title>WAVECLIP: Wavelet Tokenization for Adaptive-Resolution CLIP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21153v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce WAVECLIP, a single unified model for adaptive resolution inference in CLIP, enabled by wavelet-based tokenization. WAVECLIP replaces standard patch embeddings with a multi-level wavelet decomposition, enabling the model to process images coarse to fine while naturally supporting multiple resolutions within the same model. At inference time, the model begins with low resolution tokens and refines only when needed, using key-value caching and causal cross-level attention to reuse computation, effectively introducing to the model only new information when needed. We evaluate WAVECLIP in zero-shot classification, demonstrating that a simple confidence-based gating mechanism enables adaptive early exits. This allows users to dynamically choose a compute-accuracy trade-off using a single deployed model. Our approach requires only lightweight distillation from a frozen CLIP teacher and achieves competitive accuracy with significant computational savings.</description>

      <title>REArtGS: Reconstructing and Generating Articulated Objects via 3D Gaussian Splatting with Geometric and Motion Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06677v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Articulated objects, as prevalent entities in human life, their 3D representations play crucial roles across various applications. However, achieving both high-fidelity textured surface reconstruction and dynamic generation for articulated objects remains challenging for existing methods. In this paper, we present REArtGS, a novel framework that introduces additional geometric and motion constraints to 3D Gaussian primitives, enabling realistic surface reconstruction and generation for articulated objects. Specifically, given multi-view RGB images of arbitrary two states of articulated objects, we first introduce an unbiased Signed Distance Field (SDF) guidance to regularize Gaussian opacity fields, enhancing geometry constraints and improving surface reconstruction quality. Then we establish deformable fields for 3D Gaussians constrained by the kinematic structures of articulated objects, achieving unsupervised generation of surface meshes in unseen states. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real datasets demonstrate our approach achieves high-quality textured surface reconstruction for given states, and enables high-fidelity surface generation for unseen states.
