      <title>Interpolation-Based Gradient-Error Bounds for Use in Derivative-Free Optimization of Noisy Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19661v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we analyze the accuracy of gradient estimates obtained by linear interpolation when the underlying function is subject to bounded measurement noise. The total gradient error is decomposed into a deterministic component arising from the interpolation (finite-difference) approximation, and a stochastic component due to noise. Various upper bounds for both error components are derived and compared through several illustrative examples. Our comparative study reveals that strict deterministic bounds, including those commonly used in derivative-free optimization (DFO), tend to be overly conservative. To address this, we propose approximate gradient error bounds that aim to upper bound the gradient error norm more realistically, without the excessive conservatism of classical bounds. Finally, drawing inspiration from dual real-time optimization strategies, we present a DFO scheme based on sequential programming, where the approximate gradient error bounds are enforced as constraints within the optimization problem.</description>

      <title>Implementation and Basis Construction for Smooth Finite Element Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19732v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The construction of $C^m$ conforming finite elements on simplicial meshes has recently advanced through the groundbreaking work of Hu, Lin, and Wu (Found. Comput. Math. 24, 2024). Their framework characterizes smoothness via moments of normal derivatives over subsimplices, leading to explicit degrees of freedom and unisolvence, unifying earlier constructions. However, the absence of explicit basis functions has left these spaces largely inaccessible for practical computation. In parallel, multivariate spline theory (Chui and Lai, J. Approx. Theory 60, 1990) enforces $C^m$ smoothness through linear constraints on Bernstein--B\'{e}zier coefficients, but stable, locally supported bases remain elusive beyond low dimensions. Building on the geometric decomposition of the simplicial lattice proposed by Chen and Huang (Math. Comp. 93, 2024), this work develops an explicit, computable framework for smooth finite elements. The degrees of freedom defined by moments of normal derivatives are modified to align with the dual basis of the Bernstein polynomials, yielding structured local bases on each simplex. Explicit basis construction is essential not merely for completeness, but for enabling efficient matrix assembly, global continuity, and scalable solution of high-order elliptic partial differential equations. This development closes the gap between theoretical existence and practical realization, making smooth finite element methods accessible to broad computational applications.</description>

      <title>An inverse random diffraction grating problem for the Helmholtz equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19744v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the inverse scattering problem of time-harmonic plane waves incident on a perfectly reflecting random periodic structure. To simulate random perturbations arising from manufacturing defects and surface wear in real-world grating profiles, we propose a stochastic surface modeling framework motivated by the discretization of the Wiener process. Our approach introduces randomness at discrete nodes and then applies linear interpolation to construct the surface, marking a novel attempt to incorporate the concepts of the Wiener process into random surface representation. Under this framework, each realization of the random surface generates a Lipschitz-continuous diffraction grating, mathematically represented as a sum of a baseline profile and a weighted linear combination of local `tent' basis functions, meanwhile preserving key statistics of the random surface. Building on this representation, we introduce the Recursive Parametric Smoothing Strategy (RPSS) to invert the key statistics of our random surfaces. Combined with Monte Carlo sampling and a wavenumber continuation strategy, our reconstruction scheme demonstrates effectiveness across multiple benchmark scenarios. Several numerical results are presented along with some discussions in the end on reconstruction mechanisms and future extensions.</description>

      <title>A Modified Dielectric Contrast based Integral Equation for 2D TE Scattering by Inhomogeneous Domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19777v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents a modified domain integral equation approach for the forward problem of TE scattering, employing a modified definition of dielectric contrast and discretizing the electric field density using Rao-Wilton-Glisson (RWG) basis functions. The proposed formulation mitigates the numerical challenges introduced by the gradient-divergence operator in traditional electric field-based vector formulations. The use of RWG basis functions over triangular meshes enhances geometric conformity, ensures tangential continuity across dielectric interfaces, and facilitates the application of well known singularity extraction techniques for numerical accuracy. Validation through numerical experiments on a two-layered dielectric cylinder demonstrates excellent agreement between computed and analytical scattered fields. Convergence studies confirm improving solution accuracy with mesh refinement indicating robustness with respect to discretization without increasing the iterations.</description>

      <title>Deep Uzawa for Kinetic Transport with Lagrange-Enforced Boundaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a neural network framework for solving stationary linear transport equations with inflow boundary conditions. The method represents the solution using a neural network and imposes the boundary condition via a Lagrange multiplier, based on a saddle-point formulation inspired by the classical Uzawa algorithm. The scheme is mesh-free, compatible with automatic differentiation and extends naturally to problems with scattering and heterogeneous media. We establish convergence of the continuum formulation and analyse the effects of quadrature error, neural approximation and inexact optimisation in the discrete implementation. Numerical experiments show that the method captures anisotropic transport, enforces boundary conditions and resolves scattering dynamics accurately.</description>

      <title>A Bi-fidelity numerical method for velocity discretization of Boltzmann equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19945v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a bi-fidelity algorithm for velocity discretization of Boltzmann-type kinetic equations under multiple scales. The proposed method employs a simpler and computationally cheaper low-fidelity model to capture a small set of significant velocity points through the greedy approach, then evaluates the high-fidelity model only at these few velocity points and to reconstruct a bi-fidelity surrogate. This novel method integrates a simpler collision term of relaxation type in the low-fidelity model and an asymptotic-preserving scheme in the high-fidelity update step. Both linear Boltzmann under diffusive scaling and the nonlinear full Boltzmann in hyperbolic scaling are discussed. We show the weak asymptotic-preserving property and empirical error bound estimates. Extensive numerical experiments on linear semiconductor and nonlinear Boltzmann problems with smooth or discontinuous initial conditions and under various regimes have been carefully studied, which demonstrates the effectiveness and robustness of our proposed scheme.</description>

      <title>Time-continuous strongly conservative space-time finite element methods for the dynamic Biot model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19955v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the dynamic Biot model (see [Biot, M. A. J. Appl. Phys. 33, 1482--1498 (1962)]) describing the interaction between fluid flow and solid deformation including wave propagation phenomena in both the liquid and solid phases of a saturated porous medium. This model couples a hyperbolic equation for momentum balance to a second-order in time dynamic Darcy law and a parabolic equation for the balance of mass and is here considered in three-field formulation with the displacement of the elastic matrix, the fluid velocity, and the fluid pressure being the physical fields of interest.
  A family of variational space-time finite element methods is proposed, which combines a continuous-in-time Galerkin ansatz of arbitrary polynomial degree with $H(\mathrm{div})$-conforming approximations of the displacement field, its time derivative, and the flux field--of discontinuous Galerkin (DG) type for displacements--with a piecewise polynomial pressure approximation, providing an inf-sup stable strongly conservative mixed method in each case. We prove error estimates in a combined energy norm in space for the maximum norm in time. The theoretical results are confirmed by numerical experiments for different polynomial orders in space and time.</description>

      <title>Geometric-Perturbation-Robust Cut-Cell Scheme for Two-Material Flows: Exact Pressure-Equilibrium Preservation and Rigorous Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19966v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Preserving pressure equilibrium across material interfaces is critical for the stability of compressible multi-material flow simulations, yet most interface-fitted sharp-interface schemes are notoriously sensitive to interface geometry: even slight perturbations of the captured (or tracked) interface can trigger large spurious pressure oscillations. We present a cut-cell method that is geometric-perturbation-robust (GPR) for the compressible two-material flows. By construction, the scheme provably preserves exact interfacial pressure equilibrium in the presence of small interface-position errors. The key is a strict consistency between the conserved variables and the geometric moments (i.e., the integrals of monomials) of every cut cell. We formulate auxiliary transport equations, whose discrete solutions furnish evolved geometric moment, these geometric moments remain perfectly synchronized with the conserved variables -- even on a deforming mesh. Surpassing the classical geometric conservation law, our approach keeps all higher-order geometric moments consistent, thereby eliminating accuracy loss due to geometric mismatches. To prevent the reconstruction step from destroying pressure equilibrium, we introduce the notion of equilibrium-compatible (EC) reconstructions. A carefully designed modification equips any conventional weighted essentially non-oscillatory (WENO) reconstruction with the EC property; we detail a third-order EC multi-resolution WENO (EC-MRWENO) variant. The tight coupling of EC-MRWENO with the evolved moments yields the first cut-cell solver that is simultaneously provably GPR and genuinely high-order: it attains second-order accuracy precisely at material interfaces, while preserving third-order accuracy in smooth regions. Extensive two-dimensional tests confirm the framework's robustness, accuracy and stability under geometric perturbations and topology changes.</description>

      <title>Imaging a moving point source in R^3 from the time of arrival at sparse observation points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20204v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a novel numerical method for reconstructing the trajectory within three-dimensional space, where both the emission moment and spatial location of the point source are unknown. Our approach relies solely on measuring the time of arrival at five or seven properly chosen observation points. By utilizing the distinctive geometric configuration of these five or seven observation points, we establish the uniqueness of the trajectory and emission moment of the point source through rigorous mathematical proofs. Moreover, we analyze the stability of our proposed method. The effectiveness of the method is also verified by numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Spectral element methods for boundary-value problems of functional differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20266v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove convergence of the spectral element method for piecewise polynomial collocation applied to periodic boundary value problems (BVP) for functional
  differential equations with possibly state-dependent delays. If the exact solution of the BVP has an analytic extension then the collocation solution converges geometrically. This means that the accuracy of the approximation is of order $\mathrm{e}^{-\eta m}$ for some $\eta&gt;0$ depending on the size of the mesh, when using polynomials of degree $m$. If the exact solution has a finite order of continuous differentiability then the collocation solution converges with this order.
  For functional differential equations with state-dependent delays the right-hand side cannot be expected to be differentiable with respect to its arguments in the classical sense, and analyticity of the solution does not necessarily follow from analyticity of the coefficients in the right-hand side. Thus, our geometric convergence statement assumes analyticity of the solution, rather than of the right-hand side.</description>

      <title>A Hybrid Particle-Continuum Method for Simulating Fast Ice via Subgrid Iceberg Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A significant fraction (4%-13%) of Antarctic sea ice remains stationary as landfast sea-ice ("fast ice"), typically anchored by grounded icebergs. Current global climate models do not represent fast-ice formation due to iceberg grounding, as iceberg-sea-ice interaction mostly occurs at subgrid scales. We propose a novel subgrid-scale coupling mechanism between Lagrangian iceberg particles and an Eulerian sea-ice continuum model. This hybrid particle-continuum approach integrates feedback from icebergs into the sea-ice momentum equation via a Green's function, a Stokeslet, representing the drag exerted by a point force on the viscous-plastic medium. The coupled system, including the Stokeslet induced drag, is discretized using a finite-element method with piecewise linear basis functions. The approach assumes that individual icebergs have diameters smaller than the grid spacing. The presented finite-element discretization is compatible with existing unstructured-mesh ocean model frameworks such as FESOM and ICON, ensuring practical applicability in Earth system modeling. This work provides and analyzes, for the first time, a stable numerical framework to capture the effects of individual subgrid-scale icebergs on sea-ice dynamics. We derive an a-priori stability estimate bounding a functional of the sea-ice system and show that the momentum equation including the subgrid iceberg-sea-ice drag remains stable. Numerical test cases demonstrate the capability of the approach to capture fast-ice formation due to subgrid iceberg grounding on coarse horizontal grids.</description>

      <title>Efficient numerical methods for the uncertain Boltzmann equation based on a hybrid solver</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20316v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we propose and compare several approaches to solve the Boltzmann equation with uncertain parameters, including multi-level Monte Carlo and multi-fidelity methods that employ an asymptotic-preserving-hybrid (APH) scheme (Filbet and Rey, 2015) for the deterministic Boltzmann model. By constructing a hierarchy of models from finer to coarser meshes in phase space for the APH scheme and adopting variance reduction techniques, the MLMC method is able to allocate computational resources across different hierarchies quasi-optimally. On the other hand, in the bi-fidelity method we choose the APH scheme for the Boltzmann equation as the high-fidelity solver, and a finite volume scheme for the compressible Euler system as the low-fidelity model. Since both methods are non-intrusive, they can preserve the physical properties of the deterministic solver. Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate that our APH-based MLMC and multi-fidelity methods are significantly faster than standard approaches, while maintaining accuracy. We also provide practical guidelines for selection between APH-based MLMC and multi-fidelity approaches, based on solution smoothness and computational resource availability.</description>

      <title>Subset selection for matrices in spectral norm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address the subset selection problem for matrices, where the goal is to select a subset of $k$ columns from a "short-and-fat" matrix $X \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n}$, such that the pseudoinverse of the sampled submatrix has as small spectral or Frobenius norm as possible. For the NP-hard spectral norm variant, we propose a new deterministic approximation algorithm. Our method refines the potential-based framework of spectral sparsification by specializing it to a single barrier function. This key modification enables direct, unweighted column selection, bypassing the intermediate weighting step required by previous approaches. It also allows for a novel adaptive update strategy for the barrier. This approach yields a new, explicit bound on the approximation quality that improves upon existing guarantees in key parameter regimes, without increasing the asymptotic computational complexity. Furthermore, numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms its direct competitors. A complete C++ implementation is provided to support our findings and facilitate future research.</description>

      <title>A generalized ENO reconstruction in compact GKS for compressible flow simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20461v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a generalized ENO (GENO)-type nonlinear reconstruction scheme for compressible flow simulations. The proposed reconstruction preserves the accuracy of the linear scheme while maintaining essentially non-oscillatory behavior at discontinuities. By generalizing the adaptive philosophy of ENO schemes, the method employs a smooth path function that directly connects high-order linear reconstruction with a reliable lower-order alternative. This direct adaptive approach significantly simplifies the construction of nonlinear schemes, particularly for very high-order methods on unstructured meshes. A comparative analysis with various WENO methods demonstrates the reliability and accuracy of the proposed reconstruction, which provides an optimal transition between linear and nonlinear reconstructions across all limiting cases based on stencil smoothness. The consistency and performance of the GENO reconstruction are validated through implementation in both high-order compact gas-kinetic schemes (GKS) and non-compact Riemann-solver-based methods. Benchmark tests confirm the robustness and shock-capturing capabilities of GENO, with particularly superior performance when integrated with compact schemes. This work advances the construction methodology of nonlinear schemes and establishes ENO-type reconstruction as a mature and practical approach for engineering applications.</description>

      <title>On rank-2 Nonnegative Matrix Factorizations and their variants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20612v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of finding the best nonnegative rank-2 approximation of an arbitrary nonnegative matrix. We first revisit the theory, including an explicit parametrization of all possible nonnegative factorizations of a nonnegative matrix of rank 2. Based on this result, we construct a cheaply computable (albeit suboptimal) nonnegative rank-2 approximation for an arbitrary nonnegative matrix input. This can then be used as a starting point for the Alternating Nonnegative Least Squares method to find a nearest approximate nonnegative rank-2 factorization of the input; heuristically, our newly proposed initial value results in both improved computational complexity and enhanced output quality. We provide extensive numerical experiments to support these claims. Motivated by graph-theoretical applications, we also study some variants of the problem, including matrices with symmetry constraints.</description>

      <title>A fixed-time stable dynamical model for solving EVLCPs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20652v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A fixed-time stable dynamical system for solving the extended vertical linear complementarity problem (EVLCP) is developed. The system is based on the reformulation of EVLCP as a special case of a new kind of generalized absolute value equations. Some properties of the new kind of generalized absolute value equations are explored which are useful for developing a fixed-time stable dynamical system for solving it. Without using any smoothing technique, we develop a dynamical system for solving the new kind of generalized absolute value equations and prove its fixed-time stability. The model is applicable for solving EVLCP. As two by-products, a new condition which guarantees the unique solvability of EVLCP and a new error bound of EVLCP are given. Numerical results are given to demonstrate our claims.</description>

      <title>A general framework for the OSRC-preconditioned EFIE in computational electromagnetics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20707v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents a comprehensive study of preconditioning strategies for the Electric Field Integral Equation (EFIE) using On-Surface Radiation Condition (OSRC) operators. We examine two distinct formulations -- the Magnetic-to-Electric (MtE) and Electric-to-Magnetic (EtM) maps -- used to precondition the EFIE, and we analyze their spectral properties, discretization behavior, and numerical performance. A central objective is to bridge the gap between theoretical development and practical implementation, identifying the strengths and limitations of each approach. Through numerical experiments on smooth, closed geometries, we show that the MtE formulation stands out as a cost-effective preconditioner in the context of Boundary Element Methods. We also offer implementation guidelines and propose improvements to address existing challenges. These findings provide a valuable reference for researchers and practitioners working with preconditioned boundary integral formulations in computational electromagnetics.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Complex Injection Mold Design Validation Using Multicombined RV Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20732v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The intricate design of real complex injection molds poses significant challenges. Mold design vali-dation often falls to operators with tool-handling experience but limited CAD proficiency. Unlike other industries, the scale and costs of injection mold fabrication hinder prototyping before pro-duction. Virtual reality (VR) has emerged as a revolutionary solution offering a safe, immersive, and realistic experience and accessible using QR codes. This paper presents a new multimodal virtual environment tailored to validate mold design complexities. Integrating knowledge-enriched visual tools like interactive 3D models and dynamic visualizations enables users to explore complex mold designs. Statistical analyses, including the Wilcoxon test, unveil significant differences in interference detection, internal topology tracking, and validation of assembly and disassembly accessibility for both small and large mold components when comparing validation conducted through traditional means using solely CAD systems versus the utilization of multidimensional validation methods. Efficiency gains in using VR devices for mold design validation in a hybrid environment in the analysis of relative frequencies. The present study surpasses the state of the art illustrating how VR technology can substantially reduce manufacturing errors in injection molding processes, thereby offering important advantages for manufacturers emerging as an essential tool for this impact in-dustry in the next years.</description>

      <title>Explicit and Effectively Symmetric Runge-Kutta Methods</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.21006v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Symmetry is a key property of numerical methods. The geometric properties of symmetric schemes make them an attractive option for integrating Hamiltonian systems, whilst their ability to exactly recover the initial condition without the need to store the entire solution trajectory makes them ideal for the efficient implementation of Neural ODEs. In this work, we present a Hopf algebraic approach to the study of symmetric B-series methods. We show that every B-series method can be written as the composition of a symmetric and "antisymmetric" component, and explore the structure of this decomposition for Runge-Kutta schemes. A major bottleneck of symmetric Runge-Kutta schemes is their implicit nature, which requires solving a nonlinear system at each step. By introducing a new set of order conditions which minimise the antisymmetric component of a scheme, we derive what we call Explicit and Effectively Symmetric (EES) schemes -- a new class of explicit Runge-Kutta schemes with near-symmetric properties. We present examples of second-order EES schemes and demonstrate that, despite their low order, these schemes readily outperform higher-order explicit schemes such as RK4 and RK5, and achieve results comparable to implicit symmetric schemes at a significantly lower computational cost.</description>

      <title>Noise-expansion cascade: an origin of randomness of turbulence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.14941v3 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Randomness is one of the most important characteristics of turbulence, but its origin remains an open question. By means of a ``thought experiment'' via several clean numerical experiments based on the Navier-Stokes equations for two-dimensional turbulent Kolmogorov flow, we reveal a new phenomenon, which we call the ``noise-expansion cascade'' whereby all micro-level noises/disturbances at different orders of magnitudes in the initial condition of Navier-Stokes equations enlarge consistently, say, one by one like an inverse cascade, to macro-level. More importantly, each noise/disturbance input may greatly change the macro-level characteristics and statistics of the resulting turbulence, clearly indicating that micro-level noise/disturbance might have great influence on macro-level characteristics and statistics of turbulence. Besides, the noise-expansion cascade closely connects randomness of micro-level noise/disturbance and macro-level disorder of turbulence, thus revealing an origin of randomness of turbulence. This also highly suggests that unavoidable thermal fluctuations must be considered when simulating turbulence, even if such fluctuations are several orders of magnitudes smaller than other external environmental disturbances. Hopefully, the ``noise-expansion cascade'' as a fundamental property of the NS equations could greatly deepen our understandings about turbulence, and besides is helpful for attacking the fourth millennium problem posed by Clay Mathematics Institute in 2000.</description>

      <title>Clean numerical simulation (CNS) of three-dimensional turbulent Kolmogorov flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11805v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Turbulence holds immense importance across various scientific and engineering disciplines. The direct numerical simulation (DNS) of turbulence proposed by Orszag in 1970 is a milestone in fluid mechanics, which began an era of numerical experiment for turbulence. Many researchers have reported that turbulence should be chaotic, since spatiotemporal trajectories are very sensitive to small disturbance. In 2006 E.D. Lorenz discovered that numerical noise might have a great influence on statistic characteristics of chaotic systems. The above-mentioned facts logically lead to the conclusion that numerical noises of turbulence (as a chaotic system) might have great influence on turbulent flows. This is indeed true for a two-dimensional (2D) Kolmogorov turbulent flow, as currently revealed by a much more accurate algorithm than DNS, namely the ``clean numerical simulation'' (CNS). Different from DNS, CNS can greatly reduce both of truncation error and round-off error to any required small level so that artificial numerical noise can be rigorously negligible throughout a time interval long enough for calculating statistics. However, In physics, 3D turbulent flow is more important than 2D turbulence, as pointed out by Nobel Prize winner T.D. Lee. So, for the first time, we solve a 3D turbulent Kolmogorov flow by means of CNS in this paper, and compare our CNS result with that given by DNS in details. It is found that the spatial-temporal trajectories of the 3D Kolmogorov turbulent flow given by DNS are badly polluted by artificial numerical noise rather quickly, and the DNS result has huge deviations from the CNS benchmark solution not only in the flow field and the energy cascade but also even in statistics.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical clustering and dimensional reduction for optimal control of large-scale agent-based models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.19644v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Agent-based models (ABMs) provide a powerful framework to describe complex systems composed of interacting entities, capable of producing emergent collective behaviours such as consensus formation or clustering. However, the increasing dimensionality of these models -- in terms of both the number of agents and the size of their state space -- poses significant computational challenges, particularly in the context of optimal control. In this work, we propose a scalable control frame work for large-scale ABMs based on a twofold model order reduction strategy: agent clustering and projection-based reduction via Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD). These techniques are integrated into a feedback loop that enables the design and application of optimal control laws over a reduced-order representation of the system. To illustrate the effectiveness of the approach, we consider the opinion dynamics model, a prototyp ical first-order ABM where agents interact through state-dependent influence functions. We show that our method significantly improves control efficiency, even in scenarios where direct control fails due to model complexity. Beyond its methodological contributions, this work also highlights the rel evance of opinion dynamics models in environmental contexts -- for example, modeling the diffusion of pro-environmental attitudes or decision-making processes in sustainable policy adoption -- where controlling consensus formation plays a crucial role.</description>

      <title>Solving the MIT Inverse Problem by Considering Skin and Proximity Effects in Coils</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20004v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents an improved technique for solving the inverse problem in magnetic induction tomography (MIT) by considering skin and proximity effects in coils. MIT is a non-contact, noninvasive, and low-cost imaging modality for obtaining the distribution of conductivity inside an object. Reconstruction of low conductivity distribution by MIT requires more accurate techniques since measured signals are inherently weak and the reconstruction problem is highly nonlinear and ill-posed. Previous MIT inverse problem studies have ignored skin and proximity effects inside coils in the forward method. In this article, the improved technique incorporates these effects in the forward method. Furthermore, it employs the regularized Gauss-Newton algorithm to reconstruct the conductivity distribution. The regularization parameter is obtained by an adaptive method using the two input parameters: a coefficient and an initial conductivity distribution. The new Jacobian matrix is computed based on a standard technique. To compare the early and improved forward methods in possible medical and industrial applications with low conductivity regions, a 2D 8-coil MIT system is modeled, and image reconstruction is performed for synthetic phantoms. Results show that it is crucial to use the improved forward method for the reconstruction of the absolute conductivity values.</description>

      <title>An Optimal Transport-Based Method for Computing LM Rate and Its Convergence Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20129v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The mismatch capacity characterizes the highest information rate of the channel under a prescribed decoding metric and serves as a critical performance indicator in numerous practical communication scenarios. Compared to the commonly used Generalized Mutual Information (GMI), the Lower bound on the Mismatch capacity (LM rate) generally provides a tighter lower bound on the mismatch capacity. However, the efficient computation of the LM rate is significantly more challenging than that of the GMI, particularly as the size of the channel input alphabet increases. This growth in complexity renders standard numerical methods (e.g., interior point methods) computationally intensive and, in some cases, impractical. In this work, we reformulate the computation of the LM rate as a special instance of the optimal transport (OT) problem with an additional constraint. Building on this formulation, we develop a novel numerical algorithm based on the Sinkhorn algorithm, which is well known for its efficiency in solving entropy regularized optimization problems. We further provide the convergence analysis of the proposed algorithm, revealing that the algorithm has a sub-linear convergence rate. Numerical experiments demonstrate the feasibility and efficiency of the proposed algorithm for the computation of the LM rate.</description>

Abstract: Multi-grade deep learning (MGDL) has been shown to significantly outperform the standard single-grade deep learning (SGDL) across various applications. This work aims to investigate the computational advantages of MGDL focusing on its performance in image regression, denoising, and deblurring tasks, and comparing it to SGDL. We establish convergence results for the gradient descent (GD) method applied to these models and provide mathematical insights into MGDL's improved performance. In particular, we demonstrate that MGDL is more robust to the choice of learning rate under GD than SGDL. Furthermore, we analyze the eigenvalue distributions of the Jacobian matrices associated with the iterative schemes arising from the GD iterations, offering an explanation for MGDL's enhanced training stability.</description>

      <title>A global Lipschitz stability perspective for understanding approximate approaches in Bayesian sequential learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20379v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish a general, non-asymptotic error analysis framework for understanding the effects of incremental approximations made by practical approaches for Bayesian sequential learning (BSL) on their long-term inference performance. Our setting covers inverse problems, state estimation, and parameter-state estimation. In these settings, we bound the difference-termed the learning error-between the unknown true posterior and the approximate posterior computed by these approaches, using three widely used distribution metrics: total variation, Hellinger, and Wasserstein distances. This framework builds on our establishment of the global Lipschitz stability of the posterior with respect to the prior across these settings. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to establish such global Lipschitz stability under the Hellinger and Wasserstein distances and the first general error analysis framework for approximate BSL methods.
  Our framework offers two sets of upper bounds on the learning error. The first set demonstrates the stability of general approximate BSL methods with respect to the incremental approximation process, while the second set is estimable in many practical scenarios.
  Furthermore, as an initial step toward understanding the phenomenon of learning error decay, which is sometimes observed, we identify sufficient conditions under which data assimilation leads to learning error reduction.</description>

      <title>Diagonally-Weighted Generalized Method of Moments Estimation for Gaussian Mixture Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20459v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Since Pearson [Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London. A, 185 (1894), pp. 71-110] first applied the method of moments (MM) for modeling data as a mixture of one-dimensional Gaussians, moment-based estimation methods have proliferated. Among these methods, the generalized method of moments (GMM) improves the statistical efficiency of MM by weighting the moments appropriately. However, the computational complexity and storage complexity of MM and GMM grow exponentially with the dimension, making these methods impractical for high-dimensional data or when higher-order moments are required. Such computational bottlenecks are more severe in GMM since it additionally requires estimating a large weighting matrix. To overcome these bottlenecks, we propose the diagonally-weighted GMM (DGMM), which achieves a balance among statistical efficiency, computational complexity, and numerical stability. We apply DGMM to study the parameter estimation problem for weakly separated heteroscedastic low-rank Gaussian mixtures and design a computationally efficient and numerically stable algorithm that obtains the DGMM estimator without explicitly computing or storing the moment tensors. We implement the proposed algorithm and empirically validate the advantages of DGMM: in numerical studies, DGMM attains smaller estimation errors while requiring substantially shorter runtime than MM and GMM. The code and data will be available upon publication at https://github.com/liu-lzhang/dgmm.</description>

      <title>Operator Inference Aware Quadratic Manifolds with Isotropic Reduced Coordinates for Nonintrusive Model Reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20463v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quadratic manifolds for nonintrusive reduced modeling are typically trained to minimize the reconstruction error on snapshot data, which means that the error of models fitted to the embedded data in downstream learning steps is ignored. In contrast, we propose a greedy training procedure that takes into account both the reconstruction error on the snapshot data and the prediction error of reduced models fitted to the data. Because our procedure learns quadratic manifolds with the objective of achieving accurate reduced models, it avoids oscillatory and other non-smooth embeddings that can hinder learning accurate reduced models. Numerical experiments on transport and turbulent flow problems show that quadratic manifolds trained with the proposed greedy approach lead to reduced models with up to two orders of magnitude higher accuracy than quadratic manifolds trained with respect to the reconstruction error alone.</description>

      <title>Methodology for intelligent injection point location based on geometric algorithms and discrete topologies for virtual digital twin environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20922v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article presents an innovative methodology for locating injection points in injection-molded parts using intelligent models with geometric algorithms for discrete topologies. The first algorithm calculates the center of mass of the discrete model based on the center of mass of each triangular facet in the system, ensuring uniform molten plastic distribution during mold cavity filling. Two sub-algorithms intelligently evaluate the geometry and optimal injection point location. The first sub-algorithm generates a geometric matrix based on a two-dimensional nodal quadrature adapted to the part's bounding box. The second sub-algorithm projects the nodal matrix and associated circular areas orthogonally on the part's surface along the demolding direction. The optimal injection point location is determined by minimizing the distance to the center of mass from the first algorithm's result. This novel methodology has been validated through rheological simulations in six case studies with complex geometries. The results demonstrate uniform and homogeneous molten plastic distribution with minimal pressure loss during the filling phase. Importantly, this methodology does not require expert intervention, reducing time and costs associated with manual injection mold feed system design. It is also adaptable to various design environments and virtual twin systems, not tied to specific CAD software. The validated results surpass the state of the art, offering an agile alternative for digital twin applications in new product design environments, reducing dependence on experts, facilitating designer training, and ultimately cutting costs</description>

      <title>Stochastic gradient with least-squares control variates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.20981v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The stochastic gradient descent (SGD) method is a widely used approach for solving stochastic optimization problems, but its convergence is typically slow. Existing variance reduction techniques, such as SAGA, improve convergence by leveraging stored gradient information; however, they are restricted to settings where the objective functional is a finite sum, and their performance degrades when the number of terms in the sum is large. In this work, we propose a novel approach which is well suited when the objective is given by an expectation over random variables with a continuous probability distribution. Our method constructs a control variate by fitting a linear model to past gradient evaluations using weighted discrete least-squares, effectively reducing variance while preserving computational efficiency. We establish theoretical sublinear convergence guarantees for strongly convex objectives and demonstrate the method's effectiveness through numerical experiments on random PDE-constrained optimization problems.</description>

Abstract: We study the recovery of functions in various norms, including $L_p$ with $1\le p\le\infty$, based on function evaluations. We obtain worst case error bounds for general classes of functions in terms of the best $L_2$-approximation from a given nested sequence of subspaces and the Christoffel function of these subspaces. In the case $p=\infty$, our results imply that linear sampling algorithms are optimal up to a constant factor for many reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces.</description>

      <title>Versatile mixed methods for weakly-compressible flows</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.18660v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Versatile mixed finite element methods were originally developed by Chen and Williams for isothermal incompressible flows in "Versatile mixed methods for the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations," Computers &amp; Mathematics with Applications, Volume 80, 2020. Thereafter, these methods were extended by Miller, Chen, and Williams to non-isothermal incompressible flows in "Versatile mixed methods for non-isothermal incompressible flows," Computers &amp; Mathematics with Applications, Volume 125, 2022. The main advantage of these methods lies in their flexibility. Unlike traditional mixed methods, they retain the divergence terms in the momentum and temperature equations. As a result, the favorable properties of the schemes are maintained even in the presence of non-zero divergence. This makes them an ideal candidate for an extension to compressible flows, in which the divergence does not generally vanish. In the present article, we finally construct the compressible extension of the methods. In addition, we demonstrate the excellent performance of the resulting methods for weakly-compressible flows that arise near the incompressible limit, as well as moderately-compressible flows that arise near Mach 0.5.</description>

      <title>Efficient Shallow Ritz Method For 1D Diffusion-Reaction Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01496v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies the shallow Ritz method for solving one-dimensional diffusion-reaction problems. The method is capable of improving the order of approximation for non-smooth problems. By following a similar approach to the one presented in [9], we present a damped block Newton (dBN) method to achieve nearly optimal order of approximation. The dBN method optimizes the Ritz functional by alternating between the linear and non-linear parameters of the shallow ReLU neural network (NN). For diffusion-reaction problems, new difficulties arise: (1) for the linear parameters, the mass matrix is dense and even more ill-conditioned than the stiffness matrix, and (2) for the non-linear parameters, the Hessian matrix is dense and may be singular. This paper addresses these challenges, resulting in a dBN method with computational cost of ${\cal O}(n)$.
  The ideas presented for diffusion-reaction problems can also be applied to least-squares approximation problems. For both applications, starting with the non-linear parameters as a uniform partition, numerical experiments show that the dBN method moves the mesh points to nearly optimal locations.</description>

      <title>Ultra-Low-Latency Edge Inference for Distributed Sensing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13360v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There is a broad consensus that artificial intelligence (AI) will be a defining component of the sixth-generation (6G) networks. As a specific instance, AI-empowered sensing will gather and process environmental perception data at the network edge, giving rise to integrated sensing and edge AI (ISEA). Many applications, such as autonomous driving and industrial manufacturing, are latency-sensitive and require end-to-end (E2E) performance guarantees under stringent deadlines. However, the 5G-style ultra-reliable and low-latency communication (URLLC) techniques designed with communication reliability and agnostic to the data may fall short in achieving the optimal E2E performance of perceptive wireless systems. In this work, we introduce an ultra-low-latency (ultra-LoLa) inference framework for perceptive networks that facilitates the analysis of the E2E sensing accuracy in distributed sensing by jointly considering communication reliability and inference accuracy. By characterizing the tradeoff between packet length and the number of sensing observations, we derive an efficient optimization procedure that closely approximates the optimal tradeoff. We validate the accuracy of the proposed method through experimental results, and show that the proposed ultra-Lola inference framework outperforms conventional reliability-oriented protocols with respect to sensing performance under a latency constraint.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.05172v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we numerically examine the precision challenges that emerge in automatic differentiation and numerical integration in various tasks now tackled by physics-informed neural networks (PINNs). Specifically, we illustrate how ill-posed problems or inaccurately computed functions can cause serious precision issues in differentiation and integration. A major difficulty lies in detecting these problems. A simple large-scale view of the function or good-looking loss functions or convergence results may not reveal any potential errors, and the resulting outcomes are often mistakenly considered correct. To address this, it is critical to determine whether standard double-precision arithmetic suffices or if higher precision is necessary. Three problematic use-cases for solving differential equations using PINNs are analysed in detail. For the case requiring numerical integration, we also evaluate several numerical quadrature methods and suggest particular numerical analysis steps to choose the most suitable method.</description>

      <title>Sensitivity-preserving of Fisher Information Matrix through random data down-sampling for experimental design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15906v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The quality of numerical reconstructions of unknown parameters in inverse problems heavily relies on the chosen data. It is crucial to select data that is sensitive to the parameters, which can be expressed through a sufficient conditioning of the Fisher Information Matrix. We propose a general framework that provides an efficient down-sampling strategy that can select experimental setups that preserves this conditioning, as opposed to the standard optimization approach in optimal experimental design. Matrix sketching techniques from randomized linear algebra is heavily leaned on to achieve this goal. The method requires drawing samples from a sensitivity-informed distribution, and gradient free sampling methods are integrated to execute the data selection. Numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of this method in selecting sensor locations for Schr\"odinger potential reconstruction.</description>

Abstract: The finite element method is an effective numerical method for accurate analysis of seepage that can determine the values of outlet flow and pore water pressures at any point of the body and the foundation. In the present study, the seepage analysis of Sahand Dam has been performed using finite element method and PLAXIS software and the dam has been validated by instrumental data's. After validation, permeability coefficients have been used to investigate the factors affecting seepage in the normal level of the reservoir such as cutoff wall, upstream concrete cover, clay blanket and the effect of foundation depth. Results show that the implementation of clay blanket with concrete cover of upstream together, causes a significant decrease in discharge of the dam. Finally, by investigating the effective parameters on the dam seepage, a complex optimum model was developed. In the mentioned model, discharge amount was decreased to one over third of the corresponding value of the initial dam model.</description>

      <title>Machine learning-based moment closure model for the linear Boltzmann equation with uncertainties</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01932v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Boltzmann equation, a fundamental equation in kinetic theory, serves as a bridge between microscopic particle dynamics and macroscopic continuum mechanics. However, deriving closed macroscopic moment systems from the Boltzmann equation remains a long-standing challenge due to the intrinsic non-closure of the moment hierarchy. In this paper, we propose a machine learning (ML)-based moment closure model for the linear Boltzmann equation, addressing both the deterministic and stochastic settings. Our approach leverages neural networks to learn the spatial gradient of the unclosed highest-order moment, enabling effective training through natural output normalization. For the deterministic problem, to ensure global hyperbolicity and stability, we derive and apply the constraints that enforce symmetrizable hyperbolicity of the system. For the stochastic problem, we adopt the generalized polynomial chaos (gPC)-based stochastic Galerkin method to discretize the random variables, resulting in a system for which the approach in the deterministic case can be used similarly. Several numerical experiments are shown to demonstrate the effectiveness and accuracy of our ML-based moment closure model for the linear Boltzmann equation with or without uncertainties.</description>

Abstract: We construct new Crouzeix-Raviart (CR) spaces of even degree $p$ that are spanned by basis functions mimicking those for the odd degree case. Compared to the standard CR gospel, the present construction allows for the use of nested bases of increasing degree and is particularly suited to design variable order CR methods. We analyze a nonconforming discretization of a two dimensional Poisson problem, which requires a DG-type stabilization; the employed stabilization parameter is considerably smaller than that needed in DG methods. Numerical results are presented, which exhibit the expected convergence rates for the $h$-, $p$-, and $hp$-versions of the scheme. We further investigate numerically the behaviour of new even degree CR-type discretizations of the Stokes' equations.</description>

Abstract: This paper presents a new low-frequency stabilization for a two-step formulation solving the full set of Maxwell's equations. The formulation is based on a electric scalar and magnetic vector potential equation using the electroquasistatic problem as gauge condition. The proposed stabilization technique consists of an adequate frequency scaling for the electroquasistatic problem, and a tree-cotree decomposition of the magnetic vector potential such that its divergence remains consistent with the partial decoupling of the magnetic and electric potentials. The paper discusses two variants and demonstrates the effectiveness by a few computational examples.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.07178v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel parallel splitting algorithm for solving quasi-static multiple-network poroelasticity (MPET) equations. By introducing a total pressure variable, the MPET system can be reformulated into a coupled Stokes-parabolic system. To efficiently solve this system, we propose a parallel splitting approach. In the first time step, a monolithic solver is used to solve all variables simultaneously. For subsequent time steps, the system is split into a Stokes subproblem and a parabolic subproblem. These subproblems are then solved in parallel using a stabilization technique. This parallel splitting approach differs from sequential or iterative decoupling, significantly reducing computational time. The algorithm is proven to be unconditionally stable, optimally convergent, and robust across various parameter settings. These theoretical results are confirmed by numerical experiments. We also apply this parallel algorithm to simulate fluid-tissue interactions within the physiological environment of the human brain.</description>

      <title>Matrix nearness problems and eigenvalue optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14750v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This book is about solving matrix nearness problems that are related to eigenvalues or singular values or pseudospectra. These problems arise in great diversity in various fields, be they related to dynamics, as in questions of robust stability and robust control, or related to graphs, as in questions of clustering and ranking. Algorithms for such problems work with matrix perturbations that drive eigenvalues or singular values or Rayleigh quotients to desired locations.
  Remarkably, the optimal perturbation matrices are typically of rank one or are projections of rank-1 matrices onto a linear structure, e.g. a prescribed sparsity pattern. In the approach worked out here, these optimal rank-1 perturbations will be determined in a two-level iteration: In the inner iteration, an eigenvalue optimization problem for a fixed perturbation size is to be solved via gradient-based rank-1 matrix differential equations. This amounts to numerically driving a rank-1 matrix, which is represented by two vectors, into a stationary point, mostly starting nearby. The outer iteration determines the optimal perturbation size by solving a scalar nonlinear equation.
  A wide variety of matrix nearness problems, as outlined in the introductory Chapter I, will be tackled in Chapters II to VIII by such an approach and its nontrivial extensions.</description>

      <title>Regularization for time-dependent inverse problems: Geometry of Lebesgue-Bochner spaces and algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11291v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider time-dependent inverse problems in a mathematical setting using Lebesgue-Bochner spaces. Such problems arise when one aims to recover a function from given observations where the function or the data depend on time. Lebesgue-Bochner spaces allow to easily incorporate the different nature of time and space.
  In this manuscript, we present two different regularization methods in Lebesgue Bochner spaces:
  1. classical Tikhonov regularization in Banach spaces
  2. temporal variational regularization by penalizing the time-derivative
  In the first case, we additionally investigate geometrical properties of Lebesgue Bochner spaces. In particular, we compute the duality mapping and show that these spaces are smooth of power type. With this we can implement Tikhononv regularization in Lebesgue-Bochner spaces using different regularities for time and space.
  We test both methods using the example of dynamic computerized tomography.</description>

      <title>Fast solvers for the high-order FEM simplicial de Rham complex</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17406v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present new finite elements for solving the Riesz maps of the de Rham complex on triangular and tetrahedral meshes at high order. The finite elements discretize the same spaces as usual, but with different basis functions, so that the resulting matrices have desirable properties. These properties mean that we can solve the Riesz maps to a given accuracy in a $p$-robust number of iterations with $\mathcal{O}(p^6)$ flops in three dimensions, rather than the na\"ive $\mathcal{O}(p^9)$ flops.
  The degrees of freedom build upon an idea of Demkowicz et al., and consist of integral moments on an equilateral reference simplex with respect to a numerically computed polynomial basis that is orthogonal in two different inner products. As a result, the interior-interface and interior-interior couplings are provably weak, and we devise a preconditioning strategy by neglecting them. The combination of this approach with a space decomposition method on vertex and edge star patches allows us to efficiently solve the canonical Riesz maps at high order. We apply this to solving the Hodge Laplacians of the de Rham complex with novel augmented Lagrangian preconditioners.</description>

      <title>Numerical Artifacts in Learning Dynamical Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.14491v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In many applications, one needs to learn a dynamical system from its solutions sampled at a finite number of time points. The learning problem is often formulated
  as an optimization problem over a chosen function class. However, in the optimization procedure, it is necessary to employ a numerical scheme to integrate candidate dynamical systems and assess how their solutions fit the data.
  This paper reveals potentially serious effects of a chosen numerical scheme on the learning outcome. In particular, our analysis demonstrates that a damped oscillatory system may be incorrectly identified as having "anti-damping" and exhibiting a reversed oscillation direction, despite adequately fitting the given data points.</description>

      <title>A stabilized Two-Step Formulation of Maxwell's Equations in the time-domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18235v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Simulating electromagnetic fields across broad frequency ranges is challenging due to numerical instabilities at low frequencies. This work extends a stabilized two-step formulation of Maxwell's equations to the time-domain. Using a Galerkin discretization in space, we apply two different time-discretization schemes that are tailored to the first- and second-order in time partial differential equations of the two-step solution procedure used here. To address the low-frequency instability, we incorporate a generalized tree-cotree gauge that removes the singularity of the curl-curl operator, ensuring robustness even in the static limit. Numerical results on academic and application-oriented 3D problems confirm stability, accuracy, and the method's applicability to nonlinear, temperature-dependent materials.</description>

      <title>Double Fourier Sphere Methods with Low Rank Approximation for Block Copolymer Systems on Sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18968v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce spectral methods for the Ohta-Kawasaki (OK) and Nakazawa-Ohta (NO) models on a spherical domain, examining their coarsening dynamics and equilibrium pattern formations. We employed the Double Fourier Sphere (DFS) method for spatial discretization and the second-order Backward Differentiation Formula (BDF2) scheme for time evolution, resulting in an efficient energy-stable scheme to simulate the OK and NO models on the unit sphere. Our numerical experiments reveal various self-assembled patterns, such as single-bubble assemblies in binary systems and double-bubble and mixed-bubble assemblies in ternary systems. These patterns closely resemble experimental biomembrane patterns, demonstrating the effectiveness of the OK model in real-world applications. Additionally, our study explores the relationship between repulsive strength and the number of bubbles in assemblies, confirming the two-thirds law in the OK model. This provides quantitative evidence of how self-assembled patterns depend on system parameters in copolymer systems.</description>

      <title>Tensor Completion with Nearly Linear Samples Given Weak Side Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.00736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2007.00736v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Tensor completion exhibits an interesting computational-statistical gap in terms of the number of samples needed to perform tensor estimation. While there are only $\Theta(tn)$ degrees of freedom in a $t$-order tensor with $n^t$ entries, the best known polynomial time algorithm requires $O(n^{t/2})$ samples in order to guarantee consistent estimation. In this paper, we show that weak side information is sufficient to reduce the sample complexity to $O(n)$. The side information consists of a weight vector for each of the modes which is not orthogonal to any of the latent factors along that mode; this is significantly weaker than assuming noisy knowledge of the subspaces. We provide an algorithm that utilizes this side information to produce a consistent estimator with $O(n^{1+\kappa})$ samples for any small constant $\kappa &gt; 0$. We also provide experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets that validate our theoretical insights.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.08151v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Standard perturbation theory of eigenvalue problems consists of obtaining approximations of eigenmodes in the neighborhood of an operator where the corresponding eigenmode is known. Nevertheless, if the corresponding eigenmodes of several nearby operators are known, standard perturbation theory cannot simultaneously use all this knowledge to provide a better approximation. We derive a resolvent formula enabling such an approximation result, and provide numerical examples for which this method is more competitive than standard perturbation theory.</description>

      <title>Edge-guided Low-light Image Enhancement with Inertial Bregman Alternating Linearized Minimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01142v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Prior-based methods for low-light image enhancement often face challenges in extracting available prior information from dim images. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a simple yet effective Retinex model with the proposed edge extraction prior. More specifically, we design an edge extraction network to capture the fine edge features from the low-light image directly. Building upon the Retinex theory, we decompose the low-light image into its illumination and reflectance components and introduce an edge-guided Retinex model for enhancing low-light images. To solve the proposed model, we propose a novel inertial Bregman alternating linearized minimization algorithm. This algorithm addresses the optimization problem associated with the edge-guided Retinex model, enabling effective enhancement of low-light images. Through rigorous theoretical analysis, we establish the convergence properties of the algorithm. Besides, we prove that the proposed algorithm converges to a stationary point of the problem through nonconvex optimization theory. Furthermore, extensive experiments are conducted on multiple real-world low-light image datasets to demonstrate the efficiency and superiority of the proposed scheme.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11821v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that modeling a Grassmannian as symmetric orthogonal matrices $\operatorname{Gr}(k,\mathbb{R}^n) \cong\{Q \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n} : Q^{\scriptscriptstyle\mathsf{T}} Q = I, \; Q^{\scriptscriptstyle\mathsf{T}} = Q,\; \operatorname{tr}(Q)=2k - n\}$ yields exceedingly simple matrix formulas for various curvatures and curvature-related quantities, both intrinsic and extrinsic. These include Riemann, Ricci, Jacobi, sectional, scalar, mean, principal, and Gaussian curvatures; Schouten, Weyl, Cotton, Bach, Pleba\'nski, cocurvature, nonmetricity, and torsion tensors; first, second, and third fundamental forms; Gauss and Weingarten maps; and upper and lower delta invariants. We will derive explicit, simple expressions for the aforementioned quantities in terms of standard matrix operations that are stably computable with numerical linear algebra. Many of these aforementioned quantities have never before been presented for the Grassmannian.</description>

      <title>Spectral Properties of Positive Definite Matrices over Symmetrized Tropical Algebras and Valued Ordered fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.10602v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the properties of positive definite and positive semi-definite symmetric matrices within the framework of symmetrized tropical algebra, an extension of tropical algebra adapted to ordered valued fields.
  We focus on the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of these matrices. We
  prove that the eigenvalues of a positive (semi)-definite matrix in the tropical symmetrized setting coincide with its diagonal entries. Then, we show that the images by the valuation of the eigenvalues of a positive definite matrix over a valued nonarchimedean ordered field coincide with the eigenvalues of an associated matrix in the symmetrized tropical algebra. Moreover, under a genericity condition, we characterize the images of the eigenvectors under the map keeping track both of the nonarchimedean valuation and sign, showing that they coincide with tropical eigenvectors in the symmetrized algebra. These results offer new insights into the spectral theory of matrices over tropical semirings, and provide combinatorial formul\ae\ for log-limits of eigenvalues and eigenvectors of parametric families of real positive definite matrices.</description>

      <title>A Novel Approach to the Initial Value Problem with a complete validated algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00503v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the first order autonomous differential equation (ODE) ${\bf x}'={\bf f}({\bf x})$ where ${\bf f}: {\mathbb R}^n\to{\mathbb R}^n$ is locally Lipschitz. For ${\bf x}_0\in{\mathbb R}^n$ and $h&gt;0$, the initial value problem (IVP) for $({\bf f},{\bf x}_0,h)$ is to determine if there is a unique solution, i.e., a function ${\bf x}:[0,h]\to{\mathbb R}^n$ that satisfies the ODE with ${\bf x}(0)={\bf x}_0$. Write ${\bf x} ={\tt IVP}_{\bf f}({\bf x}_0,h)$ for this unique solution.
  We pose a corresponding computational problem, called the End Enclosure Problem: given $({\bf f},B_0,h,\varepsilon_0)$ where $B_0\subseteq{\mathbb R}^n$ is a box and $\varepsilon_0&gt;0$, to compute a pair of non-empty boxes $(\underline{B}_0,B_1)$ such that $\underline{B}_0\subseteq B_0$, width of $B_1$ is $&lt;\varepsilon_0$, and for all ${\bf x}_0\in \underline{B}_0$, ${\bf x}={\tt IVP}_{\bf f}({\bf x}_0,h)$ exists and ${\bf x}(h)\in B_1$. We provide a algorithm for this problem. Under the assumption (promise) that for all ${\bf x}_0\in B_0$, ${\tt IVP}_{\bf f}({\bf x}_0,h)$ exists, we prove the halting of our algorithm. This is the first halting algorithm for IVP problems in such a general setting.
  We also introduce novel techniques for subroutines such as StepA and StepB, and a scaffold datastructure to support our End Enclosure algorithm. Among the techniques are new ways refine full- and end-enclosures based on a {\bf radical transform} combined with logarithm norms. Our preliminary implementation and experiments show considerable promise, and compare well with current algorithms.</description>

      <title>Multiple solutions to the static forward free-boundary Grad-Shafranov problem on MAST-U</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.05674v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Grad-Shafranov (GS) equation is a nonlinear elliptic partial differential equation that governs the ideal magnetohydrodynamic equilibrium of a tokamak plasma. Previous studies have demonstrated the existence of multiple solutions to the GS equation when solved in idealistic geometries with simplified plasma current density profiles and boundary conditions. Until now, the question of whether multiple equilibria might exist in real-world tokamak geometries with more complex current density profiles and integral free-boundary conditions (commonly used in production-level equilibrium codes) has remained unanswered. In this work, we discover multiple solutions to the static forward free-boundary GS problem in the MAST-U tokamak geometry using the validated evolutive equilibrium solver FreeGSNKE and the deflated continuation algorithm. By varying the plasma current, current density profile coefficients, or coil currents in the GS equation, we identify and characterise distinct equilibrium solutions, including both deeply and more shallowly confined plasma states. We suggest that the existence of even more equilibria is likely prohibited by the restrictive nature of the integral free-boundary condition, which globally couples poloidal fluxes on the computational boundary with those on the interior. We conclude by discussing the implications of these findings for wider equilibrium modelling and emphasise the need to explore whether multiple solutions are present in other equilibrium codes and tokamaks, as well as their potential impact on downstream simulations that rely on GS equilibria.</description>

      <title>Nystr\"om Type Exponential Integrators for Strongly Magnetized Charged Particle Dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.00288v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Calculating the dynamics of charged particles in electromagnetic fields (i.e. the particle pushing problem) is one of the most computationally intensive components of particle-in-cell (PIC) methods for plasma physics simulations. This task is especially challenging when the plasma is strongly magnetized, since in this case the particle motion consists of a wide range of temporal scales from highly oscillatory fast gyromotion to slow macroscopic behavior and the resulting numerical model is very stiff. Current state-of-the-art time integrators used to simulate particle motion have limitations given the severe numerical stiffness of the problem and more efficient methods are of interest. Recently, exponential integrators have been proposed as a promising new approach for these simulations and shown to offer computational advantages over commonly used schemes. Exponential methods can solve linear problems exactly and are $A$-stable. In this paper, the standard exponential algorithms framework is extended to derive Nystr\"om-type exponential methods that integrate the Newtonian equations of motion as a second-order differential equation. Specific Nystr\"om-type schemes of second and third orders are derived and applied to strongly magnetized particle pushing problems. Numerical experiments are presented to demonstrate that the Nystr\"om-type exponential integrators can provide significant improvement in computational efficiency over the standard exponential methods.</description>

      <title>On a mean-field Pontryagin minimum principle for stochastic optimal control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10506v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This papers outlines a novel extension of the classical Pontryagin minimum (maximum) principle to stochastic optimal control problems. Contrary to the well-known stochastic Pontryagin minimum principle involving forward-backward stochastic differential equations, the proposed formulation is deterministic and of mean-field type. We denote it the McKean-Pontryagin minimum principle. The Hamiltonian structure of the proposed McKean-Pontryagin minimum principle is achieved via the introduction of an appropriate gauge variable. The gauge freedom can be used to decouple the forward and reverse time equations; hence simplifying the solution of the underlying boundary value problem. We also consider infinite horizon discounted cost optimal control problems. In this case, the mean-field formulation allows converting the computation of the desired optimal control law into solving a pair of forward mean-field ordinary differential equations. The McKean-Pontryagin minimum principle is tested numerically for a controlled inverted pendulum and a controlled Lorenz-63 system.</description>

      <title>Analysis and conditional optimization of projection estimates for distribution of random variable using Legendre polynomials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.14822v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Algorithms for jointly obtaining projection estimates of the density and distribution function of a random variable using Legendre polynomials are proposed. For these algorithms, a problem of the conditional optimization is solved. Such optimization allows one to increase the approximation accuracy with minimum computational costs. The proposed algorithms are tested on examples with different degrees of smoothness of the density. A projection estimate of the density is compared to a histogram that is often used in applications to estimate distributions.</description>

Abstract: We present a novel framework for Linear Combination of Unitaries (LCU)-style decomposition tailored to structured sparse matrices, which frequently arise in the numerical solution of partial differential equations (PDEs). While LCU is a foundational primitive in both variational and fault-tolerant quantum algorithms, conventional approaches based on the Pauli basis can require a number of terms that scales quadratically with matrix size. We introduce the Sigma basis, a compact set of simple, non-unitary operators that can better capture sparsity and structure, enabling decompositions with only polylogarithmic scaling in the number of terms. We develop both numerical and semi-analytical methods for computing Sigma basis decompositions of arbitrary matrices. Given this new basis is comprised of non-unitary operators, we leverage the concept of unitary completion to design efficient quantum circuits for evaluating observables in variational quantum algorithms and for constructing block encodings in fault-tolerant quantum algorithms. We compare our method to related techniques like unitary dilation, and demonstrate its effectiveness through several PDE examples, showing exponential improvements in decomposition size while retaining circuit efficiency.</description>
