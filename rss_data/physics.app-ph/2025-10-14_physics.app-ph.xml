      <title>Nonlinear Strain-Mediated Magnetoelectric Coupling in Sub-Microscale Ni/BPZT Thin-Film Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09795v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strain-mediated magnetoelectric (ME) heterostructures enable electric-field control of magnetism and are promising for ultra-low-power spintronic logic. Yet achieving spatially selective, low-voltage control in thin films and quantifying ME coupling across the full ferroelastic loop remains challenging. Here, we investigate sub-micrometer Ni/BPZT thin-film devices with laterally patterned gates that localize in-plane strain beneath the Ni stripe and modulate its magnetization. We use anisotropic magnetoresistance to measure magnetization changes across the ferroelastic loop under different magnetic bias fields. Combined with Multiphysics strain simulations and micromagnetic modeling, this provides a quantitative framework that captures the convolution of ferroelastic and magnetoelastic nonlinearities and provides critical insight for device design, while enabling multi-state, bias-field-free magnetization control for non-conventional computing. The extracted coupling coefficient in linear range is 1.3 mT/V across a 700 nm gap, with a clear pathway to improving voltage efficiency through device scaling, establishing a scalable CMOS-compatible platform for energy-efficient spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Experimental Characterization and Dynamic Modeling of THz Channels Under Fog Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09906v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The terahertz (THz) band is a promising candidate for sixth-generation wireless networks, but its deploymen in outdoor environments is challenged by meteorological phenomena, particularly fog, which imposes variable and difficult-to-predict channel degradation. This article introduces dynamic channel model for the THz band explicitly driven by the time-evolving droplet size distribution (DSD) of fog, integrating real-time microphysical sensing to capture variations in the fog microstructure. Experimental measurements were conducted at 220 GHz and 320 GHz in a controlled fog chamber to achieve quasi-stationary states, and a larger room-scale setup to characterize dynamic, non-stationary fog evolution. The results confirm that channel power loss is overwhelmingly dominated by absorption rather than scattering, validating the use of the computationally efficient Rayleigh approximation below 1 THz. Statistical analysis revealed exceptionally high Rician K-factors, demonstrating that THz channels maintain strong line-of-sight stability even in dense fog. System-level performance analysis shows that degradation in bit error rate is driven by the slow, gradual evolution of the DSD, rather than fast multipath fading. This finding enables the reliable simplification of the THz fog channel into a near-Gaussian channel model with time-varying signal-to-noise ratio. This microphysics-aware approach established here provides the necessary foundation for developing adaptive system designs centered on SNR tracking for robust future THz networks.</description>

      <title>Spin Fluctuations-induced Unconventional Transverse Spin Current in Spin Degenerate Antiferromagnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09964v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern magnetic memory technology requires unconventional transverse spin current to achieve deterministic switching of perpendicular magnetization. Spin current in antiferromagnets (AFMs) has been long thought to be trivial as nonmagnets. Recently, a class of spin-splitting AFMs has been shown to be able to generate unconventional spin current for spin-orbit torque (SOT) applications. However, such AFMs requires specific symmetry breaking, and have been largely restricted by the limited material candidates. Here, we reveal universal spin fluctuation-induced unconventional transverse spin current in conventional spin degenerate AFMs at finite temperature by taking collinear (AFM) L10-MnPt as an example. The field-free switching of perpendicular magnetization was achieved via out-of-plane anti-damping-like SOT, leveraging the spin current with both y- and z-spin polarizations in heterostructures with MnPt functioning as spin current source. Based on symmetry analyses and experimental characterizations of current-induced spin torques, we find that the spin current generated by L10-MnPt exhibits anisotropy that varies with the current direction, enforced by the low symmetry magnetic point group when its N\'eel vector is along [110]. From a fundamental perspective, it would be intriguing to uncover a mechanism underlying the emergence of unconventional spin currents in spin degenerate antiferromagnets, which is highly desirable for spintronic applications.</description>

      <title>Material combination optimization for brazed ceramic-metal composites using Artificial Intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10128v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study proposes an Artificial Intelligence (AI) driven methodology for predicting a combination of brazed ceramic-metal composite materials. Multiple machine learning (ML) algorithms are compared with the deep learning (DL) model. The developed models are tested using k-fold validation. Nine different input-output feature configurations are evaluated to assess the model performance. The input-output feature comprises material properties, namely, the coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) and molecular mass of brazed ceramic-metal composite materials obtained from literature and the strength parameter (average Von Mises Stress (VMS)) estimated from Finite Element Method (FEM) simulation for joint assembly structure. A multi-output model, Autoencoder (AE), has also been developed and tested to predict various features. The ML model, namely the polynomial regression (PR), outperforms the other ML/DL models with a Mean square Error (MSE) of 0.01 for the test data. The autoencoder model with a 32-16-32 structure outperforms LR, PR, RF, and ANN with an MSE of 0.04% for the prediction of unseen data. The developed multi-output model accurately predicts all the features (single and multiple), while PR fails to accurately predict multi-output features of low importance. The developed AE model predicts the different material properties with an average error of ~0.16-3.78% with literature-reported values.</description>

      <title>A Bioinspired Aquatic Machine Mimicking Water Caltrop</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10686v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Plants are increasingly becoming a source of inspiration for robotics and engineers to develop bioinspired, adaptive, and multifunctional machines. In this study, we propose a bioinspired aquatic machine that mimics the fruit of the water caltrop (Trapa natans L.). Among various plant species, T. natans produces unique woody fruits that can disperse passively via water currents or by clinging to boats or waterfowls. Inspired by the structures and dispersal mechanisms of T. natans, we designed miniaturized biomimetic machines capable of passive dispersion in aquatic ecosystems. In order to study our selected biological model, we collected natural fresh and dried mature samples of T. natans fruits. We designed biomimetic aquatic machines by extracting the main geometrical details from the natural samples, and by exploiting advanced three-dimensional reconstruction techniques, including x-ray micro-computed topography (Micro-CT). Then, we successfully fabricate the biomimetic machines at high-resolution in two configurations (hollow body and solid body) using light-based bioprinting of photo-responsive hydrogels. We also characterized the mechanical properties of the bioprinted materials through compression tests. Finally, we evaluated the floating behavior of the biomimetic machines in a flow chamber as a proof of concept. This biomimetic approach enhances the adaptability of the machine in aquatic environments, offering new design insights for underwater, soft, and microrobotics.</description>

      <title>A High-Performance Training-Free Pipeline for Robust Random Telegraph Signal Characterization via Adaptive Wavelet-Based Denoising and Bayesian Digitization Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Random telegraph signal (RTS) analysis is increasingly important for characterizing meaningful temporal fluctuations in physical, chemical, and biological systems. The simplest RTS arises from discrete stochastic switching events between two binary states, quantified by their transition amplitude and dwell times in each state. Quantitative analysis of RTSs provides valuable insights into microscopic processes such as charge trapping in semiconductors. However, analyzing RTS becomes considerably complex when signals exhibit multi-level structures or are corrupted by background white or pink noise. To address these challenges and support high-throughput RTS analysis, we introduce a modular and scalable signal processing pipeline combining dual-tree complex wavelet transform (DTCWT) denoising with a Bayesian digitization strategy. The adaptive DTCWT-based denoiser incorporates autonomous parameter selection rules for its decomposition level and thresholds, optimizing white noise suppression without manual tuning. Complementing this denoiser, our probabilistic digitizer effectively resolves binary trap states even under residual notorious background pink noise. The overall approach enables robust performance across varying noise levels and multi-trap scenarios, improving mean dwell time estimation and RTS reconstruction over classical and neural baselines. The method is up to 83x faster, training-free, and suitable for real-time or large-scale analysis. Evaluations confirm its generalizability, speed, and reliability, providing a strong foundation for future fully adaptive and automated RTS pipelines.</description>

      <title>Loss investigations of high frequency lithium niobate Lamb wave resonators at ultralow temperatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10983v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lamb wave resonators (LWRs) operating at ultralow temperatures serve as promising acoustic platforms for implementing microwave-optical transduction and radio frequency (RF) front-ends in aerospace communications because of the exceptional electromechanical coupling (k^2) and frequency scalability. However, the properties of LWRs at cryogenic temperatures have not been well understood yet. Herein, we experimentally investigate the temperature dependence of the quality factor and resonant frequency in higher order antisymmetric LWRs down to millikelvin temperatures. The high-frequency A1 and A3 mode resonators with spurious-free responses are comprehensively designed, fabricated, and characterized. The quality factors of A1 modes gradually increase upon cryogenic cooling and shows 4 times higher than the room temperature value, while A3 mode resonators exhibit a non-monotonic temperature dependence. Our findings provide new insights into loss mechanisms of cryogenic LWRs, paving the way to strong-coupling quantum acoustodynamics and next-generation satellite wireless communications.</description>

      <title>A variational phase-field model for anisotropic fracture accounting for multiple cohesive lengths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11309v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel variational phase-field model for fracture in anisotropic materials. The model is specifically designed to allow a more flexible calibration of crack nucleation than existing anisotropic fracture formulations, while avoiding the introduction of multiple damage variables. In addition to the classical components of anisotropic phase-field models based on a single damage variable -- namely, anisotropic elasticity and the extension of the fracture energy density via a second-order structural tensor -- the proposed approach introduces fracture anisotropy through a cohesive degradation function with potentially distinct cohesive lengths along the principal material directions. For this reason, we refer to it as multi-cohesive model. This feature enables independent control of the critical stresses governing crack nucleation in each material direction. We analyze the homogeneous solution and its second-order stability, and we compare the resulting strength surfaces with those of two representative anisotropic phase-field models available in the literature. Finally, numerical simulations in two and three dimensions demonstrate the capability of the proposed model to independently control crack nucleation and propagation in anisotropic fracture problems of increasing complexity.</description>

      <title>Raman Microspectroscopy for Real-Time Structure Indicator in Ultrafast Laser Writing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Raman microspectroscopy provides non-destructive, structure-specific contrast suited to in situ monitoring of femtosecond (fs) laser fabrication processes. In this work, we introduce a sample-agnostic Raman workflow that screens candidate spectral indicators using drift-resistant, self-normalized metrics and, where appropriate, label-free hyperspectral unmixing to extract endmembers and validate metric selection. Using diamond as an example, hyperspectral maps and electrical tests show that depletion of the 1332 cm-1 sp3 line is a monotonic, robust predictor of resistance, counterintuitively outperforming sp2-based measures often assumed optimal. This enables a practical implementation: a single narrowband channel at the selected marker provides real-time feedback without full-spectrum acquisition. Because the selection hinges on general band definitions and functional validation rather than diamond-specific physics, the approach translates Raman phase information directly into device specifications and is transferable to other Raman-active hosts for in-line quality control of laser-written structures.</description>

      <title>Unlocking High-Throughput Heterojunction Discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photoluminescence (PL) is a ubiquitous proxy for material quality in optoelectronic devices, widely used for high-throughput materials discovery. However, we demonstrate that in the presence of charge-selective contacts, PL loses its predictive reliability and can exhibit strong quenching even in highly efficient photovoltaic devices under open-circuit conditions. By combining steady-state and transient PL with contactless transient surface photovoltage measurements we disentangle the intertwined processes of extraction and recombination, clarifying the physical origin of this phenomenon. This joint approach reveals extraction dynamics not captured by PL alone. A digital replica of the interface shows that Coulomb attraction and interfacial recombination are the fundamental mechanisms driving quenching after charge extraction. Based on these insights, we present a decision tree for heterojunction classification and PL interpretation applicable across diverse optoelectronic systems, including photovoltaics, photodetectors, and LEDs. Our approach supports systematic screening and optimization of half-devices, bridging the gap between accelerated materials discovery and accelerated device discovery.</description>

      <title>Elastic Rod Origami (RodOri) for Programming Static and Dynamic Mechanical Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11568v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reconfigurable mechanical systems enable precise programmable control over structural properties, opening new opportunities in architected materials, adaptive devices, and multifunctional structures. Here, we introduce elastic rod origami (RodOri), a platform that exploits remarkably simple elements (pre-stressed, naturally curved rods) into a system with an extraordinary degree of multistability and configurational richness. For example, a single 6-rod RodOri unit can easily access 11 distinct configurations, far exceeding the reconfigurability of conventional origami or general mechanical reconfigurable systems. Individual rods, constrained under clamped boundary conditions, undergo snapping transitions between discrete morphologies whose strain energy and stiffness are precisely prescribed by their natural curvature. Assembling these rods into modular multi-rod architectures yields metamaterials with numerous stable configurations that can be selectively and reversibly programmed. This configurational diversity enables tunable static stiffness, nonlinear force response, and thus enables tunable dynamic behaviors such as vibration filtering, wave-propagation switching, and mode conversion within a single, easily-manufactured platform. By leveraging curvature-induced mechanical instability, RodOri unlocks highly programmable static and dynamic mechanical behavior, offering new design strategies in reconfigurable structures, soft robotics, medical devices, and adaptive materials.</description>

      <title>Injector for dielectric laser accelerators based on an ultracold electron source and a magnet design avoiding apparent emittance growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09831v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dielectric Laser Acceleration holds the promise of extremely high acceleration gradients in laser-driven miniaturized accelerator structures. However, sub-relativistic experimental demonstration has so far been limited by bunch charges well below 1 electron per bunch due to the low acceptance of these 'accelerator-on-a-chip' devices. Here, we propose a novel design for an injector tailor made for dielectric laser acceleration, based on just-above-threshold ionization of laser-cooled atoms. The key new feature is a an innovative magnet design that avoids apparent emittance growth by using the field-free regions of an axially polarised ring of permanent magnets as source point. We optimized this design using a multi-objective optimization approach that is also applicable to the development of other sub-relativistic, high-brightness/low-emittance electron beam setups (like setups for ultrafast electron diffraction). The expected injected bunch charge of our proposed injector is 90 (60) electrons for a dielectric laser acceleration gradient of 1 GV/m (100MV/m) operating at a 10 micron driver laser wavelength, increasing the expected bunch charge by about two orders of magnitude.</description>

      <title>High-Contrast Interferometric Imaging of Single-Molecule Dynamics on Optical Fibers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10061v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Single-molecule detection enables direct observation of individual biomolecular events, providing mechanistic insights into biological processes and offering a powerful tool for disease diagnostics. However, the fundamental scale mismatch between optical wavelengths and molecules restricts the application of label-free techniques, leading to poor signal-to-noise (SNR) performance. Here, we propose a high-contrast, label-free approach based on interferometric imaging, utilizing the strong evanescent field supported on a microfiber surface to provide near-field illumination. We observed unique interference patterns generated by in-plane scattering from natural defects, which enabled high-contrast detection of localized phase changes induced by single molecules. The results indicate an approximately 38 dB enhancement in SNR over the conventional fluorescence methods, without employing any plasmonic or microcavity-based amplification techniques. This approach was further applied to track molecular dynamics, capturing both conformational transition and binding behaviors of individual protein molecules. Meanwhile, the stimulus-response of single molecules to acoustic waves was investigated, demonstrating the ultimate miniaturization of an acoustic sensor at the single-molecule scale. By enabling direct observation of molecular dynamics and mechanical responses at the single-molecule level, this approach provides a versatile platform for probing fundamental biological processes and developing ultra-sensitive biosensors. Moreover, this approach lays the foundation for coupling optical and acoustic waves at the molecular scale, opening new avenues for next-generation single-molecule diagnostics and precision biophysics studies.</description>

      <title>Controllable Domain Wall Memories with Magnetic Topological Insulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10369v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Domain wall memories have undergone several changes over the years for faster shift, read, and write operations; however, fundamental issues persist due to creating pinning sites topographically along the nanowire. The deformity in notches creates non-uniform pinning strength, leading to multiple faults during shift operation. This study proposes a novel approach to address these challenges and gain greater control over domain manipulation for advanced applications in Boolean and non-Boolean paradigms. Utilizing the magnetic topological insulator (MTI) can create pinning sites without potentially faulty topographical notches made through complex lithography. Moreover, applying an external current enables precise control over the pinning potentials at these sites. Micromagnetic simulations validate the effectiveness of MTI-based pinning sites, showcasing their potential for future applications. Our approach introduces an alternative method for creating pinning sites by cross-architecture of ferromagnetic nanowires and MTI nanobars, inducing exchange interaction at their intersection points. This method offers simplicity of fabrication and enables control over the pinning strength by external current.</description>

      <title>Constructing a Nanopipette-based DNA Electro-Mechanical Device</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10515v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Solid-state nanopore and nanopipette sensors are powerful devices for the detection, quantification and structural analysis of biopolymers such as DNA and proteins, especially in carrier-enhanced resistive-pulse sensing. However, hundreds of different molecules typically need to be sampled from solution and analysed to obtain statistically robust information. This limits the applicability of such sensors and complicates associated workflows. Here, we present a new strategy to trap DNA structures in the sensing region of a nanopipette through end functionalisation and nanoparticle capping. We develop a robust set of descriptors to characterise the insertion and presence of nanoparticle-DNA constructs in the nanopipette tip and, furthermore, show that they remain mobile and responsive to external electric fields over extended periods of time. This allows for repeated readout of the same DNA structure and could enable new applications for such sensors, for example in flow and in confined environments.</description>

      <title>Perceptual Compensation of Ambisonics Recordings for Reproduction in Room</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10883v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ambisonics is a method for capturing and rendering a sound field accurately, assuming that the acoustics of the playback room does not significantly influence the sound field. However, in practice, the acoustics of the playback room may lead to a noticeable degradation in sound quality. We propose a recording and rendering method based on Ambisonics that utilizes a perceptually-motivated approach to compensate for the reverberation of the playback room. The recorded direct and reverberant sound field components in the spherical harmonics (SHs) domain are spectrally and spatially compensated to preserve the relevant auditory cues including the direction of arrival of the direct sound, the spectral energy of the direct and reverberant sound components, and the Interaural Coherence (IC) across each auditory band. In contrast to the conventional Ambisonics, a flexible number of Ambisonics channels can be used for audio rendering. Listening test results show that the proposed method provides a perceptually accurate rendering of the originally recorded sound field, outperforming both conventional Ambisonics without compensation and even ideal Ambisonics rendering in a simulated anechoic room. Additionally, subjective evaluations of listeners seated at the center of the loudspeaker array demonstrate that the method remains robust to head rotation and minor displacements.</description>

      <title>Analysis of bio-nanofluid flow over a stretching sheet with slip boundaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11149v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A viscous, incompressible, micropolar bio-nanofluid flowing across a stretching sheet in three dimensions while being driven to convect several slip boundaries in the presence of a magnetic field was studied. With the assistance of the relevant transformations, a mathematical model is presented. The finite difference method numerically solves the converted non-linear ordinary differential equations. A comprehensive assessment was conducted to examine the impact of governing parameters on dimensionless velocity, micro-rotation, temperature, nanoparticle volume fraction, microorganisms, and heat transfer rate. The findings of this investigation showed a strong correlation when compared to previous studies, indicating a high level of agreement and consistency between the results. The study's conclusions indicate that the velocity profile increases with higher values of {\lambda} and {\delta}, while it decreases with higher values of A, {\delta}v, and M. The micro-rotation profile F({\eta}) drops as the spin gradient viscosity parameter rises, but G({\eta}) increases. The temperature profile decreases with higher Prandtl numbers but increases with higher thermophoresis parameters. The concentration profile decreases with higher Schmidt numbers and Brownian motion parameters. The microorganism profile increases with higher Peclet numbers and microorganism slip parameters but decreases with higher bio-convection Schmidt numbers. Lastly, the local Nusselt number grows with increasing values of the stretching parameter {\lambda}.</description>

      <title>Analytical and numerical investigation of heat transfer of porous fin in a local thermal non-equilibrium state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11157v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This research employs a local thermal non-equilibrium (LTNE) model to analyze the heat transfer phenomenon through a porous fin, considering natural convection and radiation effects. The infiltration velocity within the porous medium is evaluated using the Darcy model, and buoyancy effects are accounted for using the Boussinesq approximation. The Akbari-Ganji method (AGM) is applied to address the governing energy equations. The accuracy of the proposed solution is verified by comparing it with numerical results obtained from the finite difference method (FDM), the finite element method (FEM), and earlier investigations. The results are presented regarding the total average Nusselt number and temperature profiles. These results shed light on the influence of several important parameters, such as the thermal conductivity ratio, dimensionless thickness, convectional heat transfer, and external and internal radiation. The analysis reveals that decreasing Rayleigh and Biot numbers reduces the temperature profiles of the solid phase. Additionally, when the Rayleigh number is low but the assigned Biot number is high, the temperature difference between the solid and fluid phases diminishes. Furthermore, increased thermal conductivity ratio and dimensionless thickness for assigned Biot and Rayleigh numbers lead to higher solid phase temperatures. The Nusselt number exhibits a decreasing trend with a decreasing thermal conductivity ratio but increases with higher Rayleigh and Biot numbers and increased external radiation.</description>

      <title>Information-theoretic analysis of temporal dependence in discrete stochastic processes: Application to precipitation predictability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11276v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the temporal dependence of precipitation is key to improving weather predictability and developing efficient stochastic rainfall models. We introduce an information-theoretic approach to quantify memory effects in discrete stochastic processes and apply it to daily precipitation records across the contiguous United States. The method is based on the predictability gain, a quantity derived from block entropy that measures the additional information provided by higher-order temporal dependencies. This statistic, combined with a bootstrap-based hypothesis testing and Fisher's method, enables a robust memory estimator from finite data. Tests with generated sequences show that this estimator outperforms other model-selection criteria such as AIC and BIC. Applied to precipitation data, the analysis reveals that daily rainfall occurrence is well described by low-order Markov chains, exhibiting regional and seasonal variations, with stronger correlations in winter along the West Coast and in summer in the Southeast, consistent with known climatological patterns. Overall, our findings establish a framework for building parsimonious stochastic descriptions, useful when addressing spatial heterogeneity in the memory structure of precipitation dynamics, and support further advances in real-time, data-driven forecasting schemes.</description>

      <title>Generalized causality constraint based on duality symmetry reveals untapped potential of sound absorption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18740v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Causality constraints are known to bind sound absorption to a limit that can only be achieved by optimizing the system bandwidth for a specific material thickness. This limit is defined on the assumption of a one-port system, generally causing duality symmetry to be overlooked. Here, we define a generalized causality constraint of sound absorption by investigating reflection and transmission of a two-port hybrid monopole-dipole resonator. With our theory, we show that the absorption limit is approached by relying on the well-established critical coupling as well as by matching effective compressibility and density. We experimentally show that the designed resonator absorbance follows the duality symmetry condition embodied in the large bandwidth reported. A comparison with a traditional foam liner and other competitive works further validates our findings, confirming an intrinsic connection between duality symmetry and scattering causality. Our results untap unexplored absorption potential in broadband acoustic metamaterials.</description>

      <title>Upper bounds of focusing light through multimode fibers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.07626v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Wavefront shaping enables precise control of light propagation through multimode fibers, facilitating diffraction-limited focusing for applications such as high-resolution single-fiber imaging and high-power fiber amplifiers. While the theoretical intensity enhancement at the focal point is dictated by the number of input degrees of freedom, practical constraints-such as phase-only modulation and experimental noise-impose significant limitations. Despite its importance, the upper bounds of enhancement under these constraints remain largely unexplored. In this work, we establish a theoretical framework to predict the fundamental limits of intensity enhancement with phase-only modulation in the presence of noise-induced phase errors, and we experimentally demonstrate wavefront shaping that approaches these limits. Our experimental results confirm an enhancement factor of 5,000 in a large-core multimode fiber, approaching the theoretical upper bound, enabled by noise-tolerant wavefront shaping. These findings provide key insights into the limits of phase-only control in multimode fibers, with profound implications for single-fiber imaging, optical communication, high-power broad-area fiber amplification, and beyond.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.03022v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Grey wolf optimizer (GWO) is a nature-inspired stochastic meta-heuristic of the swarm intelligence field that mimics the hunting behavior of grey wolves. Differential evolution (DE) is a popular stochastic algorithm of the evolutionary computation field that is well suited for global optimization. In this part, we introduce a new algorithm based on the hybridization of GWO and two DE variants, namely the GWO-DE algorithm. We evaluate the new algorithm by applying various numerical benchmark functions. The numerical results of the comparative study are quite satisfactory in terms of performance and solution quality.</description>

      <title>Breakdown of the Kirchhoff's law of thermal radiation by a spatiotemporally modulated nonreciprocal metasurface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00463v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Kirchhoff's law of thermal radiation, which dictates that the emissivity of a surface equals its absorptivity under thermal equilibrium, which dictates that the emissivity of a surface equals its absorptivity under thermal equilibrium, fundamentally limits the efficiency of photonic systems by enforcing reciprocal energy exchange between source and detector. Breaking this reciprocity is particularly important for advancing photonic devices for energy conversion, radiative cooling, and mid-infrared sensing and imaging. Driven by the growing need for photonic platforms to overcome reciprocity constraints, we present the first demonstration of spatiotemporally modulated nonreciprocal metasurfaces operating at mid-infrared frequencies suitable for the violation of the Kirchhoff's law at room temperature. We fabricate a graphene-based integrated photonic structure and experimentally demonstrate nonreciprocal reflection from a metasurface modulated at gigahertz frequencies. We develop a theoretical framework to relate nonreciprocal scattering under spatiotemporal modulation with unequal absorptivity and emissivity for violation of the spectral directional Kirchhoff's law. Our experiment and theory imply effective decoupling of absorption and emission channels by breaking time-reversal symmetry at thermal wavelengths.</description>
