      <title>Noncommutative resolution of $SU_C(2)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08891v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the derived category of the moduli space $SU_C(2)$ of rank $2$ vector bundles on a smooth projective curve $C$ of genus $g\ge 2$ with trivial determinant. This generalizes the recent work by Tevelev and Torres on the case with fixed odd determinant. Since $SU_C(2)$ is singular, we work with its resolution of singularities, specifically with the noncommutative resolution constructed by P\u{a}durariu and \v{S}penko-Van den Bergh (in the more general setting of symmetric stacks). We show that this noncommutative resolution admits a semiorthogonal decomposition into derived categories of symmetric powers $Sym^{2k}C$ for $2k\le g-1$. In the case of even genus, each block appears four times. This is also true in the case of odd genus, except that the top symmetric power $Sym^{g-1}C$ appears twice. In the case of even genus, the noncommutative resolution is strongly crepant in the sense of Kuznetsov and categorifies the intersection cohomology of $SU_C(2)$. Since all of its components are ``geometric,'' our semiorthogonal decomposition provides evidence for the expectation, which dates back to the work of Newstead and Tyurin, that $SU_C(2)$ is a rational variety.</description>

      <title>An explicit wall crossing for the moduli space of hyperplane arrangements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The moduli space of hyperplanes in projective space has a family of geometric and modular compactifications that parametrize stable hyperplane arrangements with respect to a weight vector. Among these, there is a toric compactification that generalizes the Losev-Manin moduli space of points on the line. We study the first natural wall crossing that modifies this compactification into a non-toric one by varying the weights. As an application of our work, we show that any $\mathbb{Q}$-factorialization of the blow up at the identity of the torus of the generalized Losev-Manin space is not a Mori dream space for a sufficiently high number of hyperplanes. Additionally, for lines in the plane, we provide a precise description of the wall crossing.</description>

      <title>An example of homogeneous cones whose basic relative invariant has maximal degree</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is known that degrees of basic relative invariants of homogeneous open convex cones of rank $r$ are less than or equal to $2^{r-1}$. In this article, we show that there exists a homogeneous cone of rank $r$ one of whose basic relative invariants has degree $2^{r-1}$. The main idea for this is to construct such a homogeneous cone inductively to have specific structure constants which enable us to calculate degrees of its basic relative invariants. We study homogeneous cones of rank $3$ in detail in order to see non-triviality of the existence of homogeneous cones with given structure constants.</description>

      <title>Relative compactification of semiabelian N\'eron models, II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $R$ be a complete discrete valuation ring, $k(\eta)$ its fraction field, $S=\Spec R$, $(G_{\eta},\cL_{\eta})$ a polarized abelian variety over $k(\eta)$ with $\cL_{\eta}$ symmetric ample cubical and $\cG$ the N\'eron model of $G_{\eta}$ over $S$. Suppose that $\cG$ is semiabelian over $S$. Then there exists a {\it unique} relative compactification $(P,\cN)$ of $\cG$ such that ($\alpha$) $P$ is Cohen-Macaulay with $\codim_P(P\setminus\cG)=2$ and ($\beta$) $\cN$ is ample invertible with $\cN_{|\cG}$ cubical and $\cN_{\eta}=\cL^{\otimes n}_{\eta}$ for some positive integer $n$. The totally degenerate case has been studied in \cite{MN24}. We discuss here first the partially degenerate case and then the case where $R$ is a Dedekind domain.</description>

      <title>A refined Weyl character formula for comodules on $\operatorname{GL}(2,A)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $A$ be any commutative unital ring and let $\operatorname{GL}(2,A)$ be the general linear group scheme on $A$ of rank $2$. We study the representation theory of $\operatorname{GL}(2,A)$ and the symmetric powers $\operatorname{Sym}^d(V)$, where $(V, \Delta)$ is the standard right comodule on $\operatorname{GL}(2,A)$. We prove a refined Weyl character formula for $\operatorname{Sym}^d(V)$. There is for any integer $d \geq 1$ a (canonical) refined weight space decomposition $\operatorname{Sym}^d(V) \cong \oplus_i \operatorname{Sym}^d(V)^i$ where each direct summand $\operatorname{Sym}^d(V)^i$ is a comodule on $N \subseteq \operatorname{GL}(2,A)$. Here $N$ is the schematic normalizer of the diagonal torus $T \subseteq \operatorname{GL}(2,A)$. We prove a character formula for the direct summands of $\operatorname{Sym}^d(V)$ for any integer $d \geq 1$. This refined Weyl character formula implies the classical Weyl character formula. As a Corollary we get a refined Weyl character formula for the pull back $\operatorname{Sym}^d(V \otimes K)$ as a comodule on $\operatorname{GL}(2,K)$ where $K$ is any field. We also calculate explicit examples involving the symmetric powers, symmetric tensors and their duals. The refined weight space decomposition exists in general for group schemes such as $\operatorname{GL}(n,A)$ and $\operatorname{SL}(n,A)$. The methods introduced in the paper may have applications to the study of finite rank torsion free comodules on $\operatorname{SL}(n,Z)$ and $\operatorname{GL}(n,Z)$. There is no "highest weight theory" or "complete reducibility property" such comodules, and we want to give a definition of the notion "good filtration" for such modules. Such a study may have applications to the study of groups $G$ such as $\operatorname{SL}(n,k)$ and $\operatorname{GL}(n,k)$ and quotients $G/H$ where $k$ is an arbitrary field and $H \subseteq G$ is a closed subgroup.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that the modular component $\mathcal M(r)$, constructed in the Main Theorem of a former paper of us (published in Adv. Math on 2024), paramatrizing (isomorphism classes of) Ulrich vector bundles of rank $r$ and given Chern classes, on suitable $3$-fold scrolls $X_e$ over Hirzebruch surfaces $\mathbb{F}_{e\geq 0}$, which arise as tautological embeddings of projectivization of very-ample vector bundles on $\mathbb{F}_e$, is generically smooth and unirational. A stronger result holds for the suitable associated moduli space $\mathcal M_{\mathbb F_e}(r)$ of vector bundles of rank $r$ and given Chern classes on $\mathbb{F}_e$, Ulrich w.r.t. the very ample polarization $c_1({\mathcal E}_e) = \mathcal O_{\mathbb F_e}(3, b_e),$ which turns out to be generically smooth, irreducible and unirational.</description>

      <title>The McKay Correspondence for Dihedral Groups: The Moduli Space and the Tautological Bundles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09491v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A conjecture in [Ish20] states that for a finite subgroup $G$ of $GL(2; \mathbb{C})$, a resolution $Y$ of $\mathbb{C}^2/G$ is isomorphic to a moduli space $\mathcal{M}_{\theta}$ of $G$-constellations for some generic stability parameter $\theta$ if and only if $Y$ is dominated by the maximal resolution. This paper affirms the conjecture in the case of dihedral groups as a class of complex reflection groups, and offers an extension of McKay correspondence (via [IN1], [IN2], and [Ish02]).</description>

      <title>Wronskians form the inverse system of the arcs of a double point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08964v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ideal of the arc scheme of a double point or, equivalently, the differential ideal generated by the ideal of a double point is a primary ideal in an infinite-dimensional polynomial ring supported at the origin. This ideal has a rich combinatorial structure connecting it to singularity theory, partition identities, representation theory, and differential algebra. Macaulay inverse system is a powerful tool for studying the structure of primary ideals which describes an ideal in terms of certain linear differential operators. In the present paper, we show that the inverse system of the ideal of the arc scheme of a double point is precisely a vector space spanned by all the Wronskians of the variables and their formal derivatives. We then apply this characterization to extend our recent result on Poincar\'e-type series for such ideals.</description>

      <title>Algebraic Tools for Computing Polynomial Loop Invariants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09232v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Loop invariants are properties of a program loop that hold before and after each iteration of the loop. They are often employed to verify programs and ensure that algorithms consistently produce correct results during execution. Consequently, the generation of invariants becomes a crucial task for loops. We specifically focus on polynomial loops, where both the loop conditions and assignments within the loop are expressed as polynomials. Although computing polynomial invariants for general loops is undecidable, efficient algorithms have been developed for certain classes of loops. For instance, when all assignments within a while loop involve linear polynomials, the loop becomes solvable. In this work, we study the more general case where the polynomials exhibit arbitrary degrees.
  Applying tools from algebraic geometry, we present two algorithms designed to generate all polynomial invariants for a while loop, up to a specified degree. These algorithms differ based on whether the initial values of the loop variables are given or treated as parameters. Furthermore, we introduce various methods to address cases where the algebraic problem exceeds the computational capabilities of our methods. In such instances, we identify alternative approaches to generate specific polynomial invariants.</description>

      <title>The representation of $\mathfrak{S}_n$ on the cohomology of the permutohedral variety and gamma vectors of partitioned permutohedra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09242v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Foata and Sch\"{u}tzenberger gave an expansion for the Eulerian polynomial $A_n(t)$ in terms of the basis $\{t^j(1+t)^{n-1-2j}\}$ for the space of polynomials $f(t)$ satisfying $f(t)=t^{n-1}f(1/t)$. We generalize this result in two ways. First, we provide an analogue for the graded representation of the symmetric group $\mathfrak{S}_n$ on the cohomology of the permutohedral variety. Then we give expansions $h$-polynomials of polytopes obtained by cutting permutohedra with hyperplanes orthogonal to simple roots in terms of the same basis.</description>

      <title>A positive proportion of monic odd-degree hyperelliptic curves of genus $g \geq 4$ have no unexpected quadratic points</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09421v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{F}_g$ be the family of monic odd-degree hyperelliptic curves of genus $g$ over $\mathbb{Q}$. Poonen and Stoll have shown that for every $g \geq 3$, a positive proportion of curves in $\mathcal{F}_g$ have no rational points except the point at infinity. In this note, we prove the analogue for quadratic points: for each $g\geq 4$, a positive proportion of curves in $\mathcal{F}_g$ have no points defined over quadratic extensions except those that arise by pulling back rational points from $\mathbb{P}^1$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1605.02721v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a local-to-global formalism for constructing Calabi-Yau structures for global sections of constructible sheaves or cosheaves of categories. The required data - an isomorphism of the sheafified Hochschild homology with the topological dualizing sheaf - specializes to the classical notion of orientation when applied to the category of local systems on a manifold. We apply this construction to the cosheaves on arboreal skeleta arising in the microlocal approach to the A-model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.08125v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study transverse equivariant Hilbert schemes of affine hypertoric varieties equipped with a symplectic action of a Weyl group. In particular, we show that the Coulomb branches of Braverman, Finkelberg, and Nakajima can be obtained either as such Hilbert schemes or Hamiltonian reductions thereof. Furthermore, we propose that the Coulomb branches for representations of non-cotangent type are also obtained in this way. We also investigate the putative complete hyperk\"ahler metrics on these objects. We describe their twistor spaces and, in the case when the symplectic quotient construction of the hypertoric variety is $W$-equivariant (which includes Coulomb branches of cotangent type), we show that the hyperk\"ahler metric can be described as the natural $L^2$-metric on a moduli space of solutions to modified Nahm's equations on an interval with poles at both ends and a discontinuity in the middle, with the latter described by a new object: a hyperspherical variety canonically associated to a hypertoric variety.</description>

      <title>A criterion for smooth weighted blow-downs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.15076v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish a criterion for determining when a smooth Deligne-Mumford stack is a weighted blow-up. More precisely, given a smooth Deligne-Mumford stack $\mathcal{X}$ and a Cartier divisor $\mathcal{E} \subset \mathcal{X}$ such that (1) $\mathcal{E}$ is a weighted projective bundle over a smooth Deligne-Mumford stack $\mathcal{Y}$ and (2) for every $y\in\mathcal{Y}$ we have $\mathcal{O}_{\mathcal{X}}(\mathcal{E})|_{\mathcal{E}_y}\simeq \mathcal{O}_{\mathcal{E}_y}(-1)$, then there exists a contraction $\mathcal{X}\to\mathcal{Z}$ to a smooth Deligne-Mumford stack $\mathcal{Z}$. Moreover, the stack $\mathcal{X}$ can be recovered as a weighted blow-up along $\mathcal{Y}\subset \mathcal{Z}$ with exceptional divisor $\mathcal{E}$, and $\mathcal{Z}$ is a pushout in the category of algebraic stacks. As an application, we show that the moduli stack $\overline{\mathscr{M}}_{1,n}$ of stable $n$-pointed genus one curves is a weighted blow-up of the stack of pseudo-stable curves. Along the way we also prove a reconstruction result for smooth Deligne-Mumford stacks that is of independent interest.</description>

Abstract: We characterize the existence of an Ulrich vector bundle on a variety $X \subset P^N$ in terms of the existence of a subvariety satisfying some precise conditions. Then we use this fact to prove that a complete intersection of dimension $n \ge 4$, which if $n=4$ is very general and not of type $(2,2)$, does not carry any Ulrich bundles of rank $r \le 3$ unless $n=4, r=2$ and $X$ is a quadric.</description>

      <title>Nef and Effective cones of some Quot Schemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04067v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $C$ be a smooth projective curve over $\mathbb{C}$ of genus $g(C)\geqslant 3$ (respectively, $g(C)=2$). Fix integers $r,k$ such that $2\leqslant k\leqslant r-2$, (respectively, $3\leqslant k\leqslant r-2$). Let $\mathcal{Q}:={\rm Quot}_{C/\mathbb{C}}(\mathcal{O}^{\oplus r}_C, k, d)$ be the Quot scheme parametrizing rank $k$ and degree $d$ quotients of the trivial bundle of rank $r$. Let $\mathcal{Q}_L$ denote the closed subscheme of the Quot scheme parametrizing quotients such that the quotient sheaf has determinant $L$. It is known that $\mathcal{Q}_L$ is an integral, normal, local complete intersection, locally factorial scheme of Picard rank 2, when $d\gg0$. In this article we compute the nef cone, effective cone and canonical divisor of this variety when $d\gg0$. We show this variety is Fano iff $r=2k+1$.</description>

      <title>Markov numbers and rational $\mathbb{C}^*$-surfaces</title>

Abstract: The Markov triples, that means the positive integer solutions of the equation $x^2+y^2+z^2=3xyz$, form the vertex set of the Markov tree. Each Markov triple defines a weighted projective plane, giving a geometric interpretation of the vertex. We exhibit a class of rational, projective $\mathbb{C}^*$-surfaces representing the edges of the Markov tree in the sense that they admit coverings onto the adjacent weighted projective planes. As an application, we obtain an explicit description of all normal degenerations of the projective plane admitting a $\mathbb{C}^*$-action.</description>

      <title>Siegel modular forms of degree three and invariants of ternary quartics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.07431</link>
      <description>arXiv:1907.07431v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We determine the structure of the graded ring of Siegel modular forms of degree 3. It is generated by 19 modular forms, among which we identify a homogeneous system of parameters with 7 forms of weights 4, 12, 12, 14, 18, 20 and 30. We also give a complete dictionary between the Dixmier-Ohno invariants of ternary quartics and the above generators.</description>

      <title>D\'evissage for periodic cyclic homology of complete intersections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.14261v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that the d\'evissage property holds for periodic cyclic homology for a local complete intersection embedding into a smooth scheme. As a consequence, we show that the complexified topological Chern character maps for the bounded derived category and singularity category of a local complete intersection are isomorphisms, proving new cases of the Lattice Conjecture in noncommutative Hodge theory.</description>

      <title>Towards the classification of finite-dimensional diagonally graded commutative algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.16403v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Any finite-dimensional commutative (associative) graded algebra with all nonzero homogeneous subspaces one-dimensional is defined by a symmetric coefficient matrix. This algebraic structure gives a basic kind of $A$-graded algebras originally studied by Arnold. In this paper, we call them diagonally graded commutative algebras (DGCAs) and verify that the isomorphism classes of DGCAs of dimension $\leq 7$ over an arbitrary field are in bijection with the equivalence classes consisting of coefficient matrices with the same distribution of nonzero entries, while dramatically there may be infinitely many isomorphism classes of dimension $n$ corresponding to one equivalence class of coefficient matrices when $n\geq 8$.
  Furthermore, we adopt the Skjelbred-Sund method of central extensions to study the isomorphism classes of DGCAs, and associate any DGCA with a undirected simple graph to explicitly describe its corresponding second (graded) commutative cohomology group as an affine variety.</description>
