      <title>Electroweak Precision Constraints on Dark Photon Models with Generalized Mixing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16888v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a global fit to electroweak precision observables (EWPOs) in dark photon (DP) models containing both kinetic and mass mixing between the DP and the neutral gauge bosons of the Standard Model (SM). Such more general mixing can be the result of an extended scalar sector, which we specify in this paper. We calculate the tree-level contributions to EWPOs due to the mixing with the DP, as well as the leading loop corrections to the oblique parameters due to the extended Higgs sector. In the scalar sector, we find that ample regions of parameter space are still unconstrained by data. In the gauge sector, the excluded region depends strongly on the vacuum expectation values of the scalar fields: for moderate ratios, DP masses in the $(40\,\text{GeV}, 1\,\text{TeV})$ range are excluded; for larger ratios, the limits become indistinguishable from those for standard DPs.</description>

      <title>Thermal modifications of mesons and energy-energy correlators from real-time simulations of a $U(1)$ lattice gauge theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16890v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate thermal properties of a $U(1)$ lattice gauge theory in $1+1$-dimensions through real-time simulations. We extract the spectral functions directly coupling to the pseudoscalar and scalar mesons, demonstrating the thermal modifications of these states with increasing temperatures. Introducing the notion of energy-flow operators, we quantify the temporal build-up of correlations in the energy flows across the lattice. We demonstrate that energy-energy correlators fail to factorize to products of energy flows, both in the vacuum and at nonzero-temperature, indicating the presence of non-trivial correlations in the quantum states. Our results constitute a first real-time \textit{ab-initio} study of bound state thermal broadening and finite temperature energy-flow correlations in a gauge theory, providing a benchmark for future studies of hadronic matter under extreme conditions.</description>

      <title>Vacuum muon decay and interaction with laser pulses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16891v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Muons decay in vacuum mainly via the leptonic channel to an electron, an electron neutrino and a muon antineutrino. Previous investigations have concluded that muon decay can only be significantly altered in a strong electromagnetic field when the muonic strong-field parameter is of order unity, which is far beyond the reach of lab-based experiments at current and planned facilities. In this letter, an alternative mechanism is presented in which a laser pulse affects the vacuum decay rate of a muon outside the pulse. Quantum interference between the muon decaying with or without interacting with the pulse generates fringes in the electron momentum spectra and can increase the muon lifetime by up to a factor 2. The required parameters to observe this effect are available in experiments today.</description>

      <title>Fast and Fewrious: Stochastic binary perturbations from fast compact objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16894v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Massive compact objects soften binaries. This process has been used for decades to constrain the population of such objects, particularly as a component of dark matter (DM). The effects of light compact objects, such as those in the unconstrained asteroid-mass range, have generally been neglected. In principle, low-energy perturbers can harden binaries instead of softening them, but the standard lore is that this effect vanishes when the perturber velocities are large compared to the binary's orbital velocity, as is typical for DM constituents. Here, we revisit the computation of the hardening rate induced by light perturbers. We show that although the perturbations average to zero over many encounters, many scenarios of interest for DM constraints are in the regime where the variance cannot be neglected. We show that a few fast-moving perturbers can leave stochastic perturbations in systems that are measured with great precision, and we use this framework to revisit the constraint potential of systems such as binary pulsars and the Solar System. This opens a new class of dynamical probes with potential applications to asteroid-mass DM candidates.</description>

      <title>Phenomenology of Fractionally Charged Particles: Two Reps Are Better Than One</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16900v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We continue our study of fractionally charged particles (FCPs) -- particles carrying electric charge a multiple of $e/6$. Discovering an FCP would inform us about both Standard Model physics (what the true gauge group and the one-form global symmetry are) and Beyond the Standard Model physics (ruling out many unified theories), which makes them a high-stakes target for collider searches. Here we find that with two FCPs there are vastly richer phenomenologies compared to the single-particle extensions we previously studied. Stringent constraints on colored FCPs can be dramatically weakened when decays are open; conversely the cross sections of the least visible species can be enlarged by up to $\sim 10^3$, increasing their discovery potential enormously at the LHC and milliQan. Overall, these simple models motivate performing searches for FCPs produced along with jets or leptons, and highlight 'free' discovery potential in reanalyzing existing missing-energy datasets for low-quality tracks.</description>

      <title>Hot news on the phase-structure of the SMEFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16905v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform dimensional reduction of the electroweak sector of the dimension-six SMEFT to order $g^4$ in coupling constants $g$. This analysis includes one-loop contributions to kinetic terms and quartic couplings; as well as two-loop contributions, where operators such as four-fermion interactions first appear, to squared mass terms. Using lattice data, we also provide evidence that, in contrast with previous statements in the literature, the SMEFT may undergo a first-order phase transition even for null $|\phi|^6$ at zero temperature, where $\phi$ is the Higgs doublet. This opens the door to entirely unexplored directions in model building.</description>

      <title>A linear PDF model for Bayesian inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A robust uncertainty estimate in global analyses of Parton Distribution Functions (PDFs) is essential at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), especially in view of the high-precision data anticipated by experimentalists in the High-Luminosity phase of the LHC. A Bayesian framework to determine PDFs provides a rigorous treatment of uncertainties and full control on the prior, though its practical implementation can be computationally demanding. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel approach to PDF determination tailored for Bayesian inference, based on the use of linear models. Unlike traditional parametrisations, our method represents PDFs as vectors in a functional space spanned by specially chosen bases, derived from the dimensional reduction of a neural network functional space, providing a compact yet versatile representation of PDFs. The low-dimensionality of the preferred models allows for particularly fast inference. The size of the bases can be systematically adjusted, allowing for transparent control over underfitting and overfitting, and facilitating principled model selection through Bayesian workflows. In this work, the methodology is applied to a fit of Deep Inelastic Scattering synthetic data, and thoroughly tested via multi-closure tests, thus paving the way to its application to global PDF fits.</description>

      <title>Beyond the Veil: Charting WIMP Territories at the Neutrino Floor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16987v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish comprehensive theoretical benchmarks for Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs) accessible to ultimate direct detection experiments, focusing on the challenging parameter space between current experimental limits and the irreducible neutrino background. We systematically examine both thermal freeze-out and freeze-in production mechanisms across a range of simplified dark matter models, including s-channel scalar and vector portals, t-channel mediator scenarios, and electroweakly interacting multiplets. For thermal relics, we identify parameter regions where suppressed direct detection cross-sections naturally arise through momentum-dependent interactions and blind-spot configurations, while maintaining the correct relic abundance. We extensively investigate freeze-in scenarios, demonstrating how feebly interacting massive particles (FIMPs) in portal models can populate experimentally accessible parameter space despite their ultra-weak couplings. Additionally, we explore how non-standard cosmological histories including early matter domination and fast-expanding Universe scenarios can dramatically alter the relationship between relic density and detection prospects, opening new avenues for discovery. Our analysis provides a roadmap for next-generation experiments approaching the neutrino floor, highlighting complementary detection strategies and identifying the most promising theoretical targets for ultimate sensitivity dark matter searches. These benchmarks establish the theoretical foundation for the final push toward comprehensive coverage of well-motivated WIMP parameter space.</description>

      <title>Constraints on Axion Dark Matter by Spin-Dependent Macroscopic Force</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Axion-like particles (ALPs) are hypothetical particles that serve as promising candidates for cold dark matter. Portals like inelastic axion scattering and axion propagated force have been employed to search for the upper limit of the ALPs' coupling with standard model particles. Other methods, like the axion-fermion interaction in the CASPEr experiment, integrate the dark matter motion into the measurement. We suggest a new method for detecting dark matter axions based on axionelectron elastic scattering. In the pseudoscalar axion model, this interaction can be seen as an effective magnetic field, so high-sensitivity atomic magnetometers can be utilized to measure this interaction. The scattering cross section of this process is significantly amplified by the high number density and occupation number of axion dark matter. The upper limit of the electron-axion coupling coefficient obtained from this process can reach two orders of magnitude higher than previous results at low axion mass, and will exceed the astrophysics limits by using a developing magnetometer. This scattering process also provides an efficient way to detect local structures of dark matter.</description>

      <title>Threshold cusp structures in multi-channel scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17260v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the behavior of the cusp structures focusing on the isospin symmetry breaking effects. The properties of the exotic hadrons are reflected in the shape of the cusp structures. In realistic hadron scatterings, the threshold energies of the isospin partners appear within a small energy region. For a detailed analysis of such systems, it is essential to study the behavior of the cusp structures arising at two closely spaced thresholds. In this work, we introduce a convenient formulation of the scattering amplitude and demonstrate that the cusp structures at two nearby thresholds are related through the isospin symmetry.</description>

      <title>Convergence in charmonium structure: light-front wave functions from basis light-front quantization and Dyson-Schwinger equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17330v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a systematic comparison of charmonium light-front wave functions obtained through two complementary non-perturbative approaches: Basis Light-Front Quantization (BLFQ) and Dyson-Schwinger Equations (DSE). Key observables include the charge form factor, gravitational form factors, light-cone distribution amplitudes, decay constants, and two-photon transition form factors. Despite their distinct theoretical foundations and model parameters, the predictions from BLFQ and DSE exhibit remarkable agreement across all observables. This convergence validates both frameworks for studying charmonium structure and highlights the complementary strengths of Hamiltonian-based -- BLFQ -- and Lagrangian-based -- DSE -- methods in addressing non-perturbative QCD.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.17400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we report on the predictions of $v_2$, $v_3$ and $v_4$ for charged hadrons in O+O collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\mathrm{NN}}}~=~7$~TeV using both AMPT-default and AMPT-String Melting. These predictions are compared with the existing published data of $p+p$, $p+Pb$, and $Pb+Pb$ collisions at LHC energies. The transverse momentum ($p_T$) dependence of $v_2$ is also investigated for different centrality classes. $O+O$ collisions provide a unique opportunity to bridge the gap between small and large collision systems, offering critical insight into the onset of collective behavior in QCD matter.</description>

      <title>A Numerical Study on Gauge Symmetry of Electroweak Amplitudes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17429v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electroweak (EW) amplitudes in the gauge-Goldstone 5-component formalism have a distinctive property: gauge symmetry is imprinted in the amplitudes, manifested as the massive Ward identity (MWI) $k^M\mathcal M_M=0$. In this paper, we use the HELAS package to numerically study gauge symmetry in EW amplitudes. First, we directly test gauge symmetry by examining the MWI of amplitudes. Second, we modify the couplings within a vertex and of vertices to check if and how the MWI changes. Third, we test gauge symmetry by considering the couplings modified by operators from the standard model effective field theory (SMEFT). We find that the MWI is violated as long as there are anomalous couplings that deviate from the precise relations fixed by gauge symmetry. On the other hand, as along as those relations hold -- either for the standard model, or for the SMEFT -- modifying the couplings would not violate the MWI.</description>

      <title>Dihadron fragmentation framework for near-side energy-energy correlators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17444v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish an approach to analyze the free hadron and transition (nonperturbative) regions of near-side energy-energy correlators (EECs) based on dihadron fragmentation functions (DiFFs). We introduce a (nonperturbative) function we call the "EEC-DiFF" and explicitly show that expanding it for large relative transverse momentum between the two hadrons gives the $O(\alpha_s)$ expression for the "EEC jet" function used in the quark/gluon (perturbative) region. This connection indicates that a formal theoretical matching will be able to bridge the free hadron, transition, and quark/gluon regions and allow all of them to be analyzed simultaneously. We further derive a result valid for near-side EECs in the free hadron and transition regions of $e^+e^-$ annihilation in terms of the EEC-DiFF. Using a simple model for the function, we perform the first fit to experimental data in this regime. We find reasonable agreement with the measurements and reproduce the salient features of near-side EECs in the free hadron and transition regions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.17478v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We critically examine the back-to-back limit of the energy-energy correlation (EEC) in $e^+e^-$ annihilation as a potential source of information on the Collins-Soper kernel and the strong coupling constant. The analysis is performed within the framework of transverse momentum dependent (TMD) factorization at next-to-next-to-next-to-next-to-leading logarithmic (N$^4$LL) accuracy, using a global fit to all available experimental data. Contrary to previous claims, we demonstrate that the current data do not provide meaningful constraints on either the Collins-Soper kernel or $\alpha_s$.</description>

      <title>Flavor SU(3) analysis of the charmless semileptonic $B \to PV\ell^+\nu_\ell$ decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17537v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: All charmless $B \to PV\ell^+\nu_\ell$ ($P$ denotes light pseudoscalar meson and $V$ denotes vector meson) decays have not been experimentally observed to date, but some of them might be measured in the near future. The charmless $B \to PV\ell^+\nu_\ell$ decays with the axial-vector ($A$) resonance states, the tensor ($T$) resonance states and the excited vector ($V_{E,D}$) resonance states are studied based on flavor SU(3) analysis in this work, where $V_E$ contains $\{\rho(1450), K^*(1410), \omega(1420), \phi(1680)\}$ with quantum numbers $n^{2S+1}L_J=2^3S_1$ and $V_D$ contains $\{\rho(1700), K^*(1680), \omega(1650), \phi(2170)\}$ with quantum numbers $n^{2S+1}L_J=1^3D_1$. The hadronic amplitudes of the $B \to A/T \ell^+\nu_{\ell}$ decays are related by the nonperturbative parameters, and the branching ratio predictions of $B \to A/T/V_{E,D} \ell^+\nu_{\ell}$ are obtained, and then the branching ratios of the $B\to A(A\to PV)\ell^+\nu_\ell$, $B\to T(T\to PV)\ell^+\nu_\ell$, $B\to V_E(V_E\to PV)\ell^+\nu_\ell$ and $B\to V_D(V_D\to PV)\ell^+\nu_\ell$ are obtained by the narrow width approximation or further considering the width effects. We find that most branching ratios of the $B \to A \ell^+\nu_{\ell}$ decays and many branching ratios of the $B\to A(A\to PV)\ell^+\nu_\ell$ decays are on the order of $\mathcal{O}(10^{-4}-10^{-3})$, and all branching ratios with the tensor resonance states and the excited vector resonance states are small. Our results could be tested in the future BelleII and LHCb experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.17559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a new method for solving two- and three-body bound state problems using unsupervised machine learning techniques. We use a deep neural network to calculate both simple and realistic potentials, obtaining the properties of the deuteron and triton bound states for the chiral effective field theory NN potential. Our results provide significant accuracy with no prior assumptions about the behaviour of the wave function. This neural network technique, which extends from two-body to three-body, may provide insight into potential solutions to the nuclear and hadronic many-body problems.</description>

      <title>Minimal Dark Matter in the sky: updated Indirect Detection probes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Minimal Dark Matter is among the simplest and most predictive Dark Matter frameworks, with the Majorana SU(2) 5-plet as its smallest accidentally stable real representation. We present a comprehensive reassessment of its indirect-detection signals. The $\gamma$-ray flux from both Sommerfeld-enhanced annihilations and bound-state formation is calculated, incorporating next-to-leading-order corrections and next-to-leading-log resummation of the relevant electroweak effects. In the Milky Way halo, bound-state formation dominates the flux near 100 GeV. The corresponding low-energy spectrum is used to place constraints based on Fermi-LAT observations of Galactic diffuse emission, while the high-energy part of the spectrum is employed to forecast the required observation time for several of the Milky Way's dwarf spheroidal galaxies using the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO). Fermi-LAT data strongly disfavor the lower edge of the thermal mass window, even under conservative assumptions about the inner Galaxy density profile. Furthermore, several hundred hours of forthcoming CTAO observations of northern dwarfs should be sufficient to probe the central mass value.</description>

      <title>Parity violation in M{\o}ller scattering within low-energy effective field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17652v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We include electroweak effects in Moller scattering at low energies in an effective field theory approach and compute the left-right parity-violating asymmetry. The calculation using low-energy effective field theory provides a solid framework to integrate out heavy particles with masses of the order of the electroweak scale, allowing the resummation of all large logarithms between the electroweak scale and the scale, where QCD perturbation theory breaks down. The NLO electroweak corrections with leading logarithmic resummation, combined with QED corrections at NNLO and hadronic effects are implemented into the Monte Carlo framework McMule. Thus, we obtain a fully differential description and present results adapted to the MOLLER experiment. The potential impact of large logarithms at the next-to-leading logarithmic level is investigated.</description>

      <title>Collinear limit of the energy-energy correlator in $e^+ e^-$ collisions: transition from perturbative to non-perturbative regimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the collinear limit of the energy-energy correlator (EEC) in $e^+e^-$ collisions, focusing on the transition from the perturbative QCD regime at relatively large angles to the non-perturbative region at small angles. To describe this transition, we introduce a non-perturbative jet function and perform a global analysis at NNLO+NNLL accuracy using experimental data spanning center-of-mass energies from $Q = 29.0$ to $91.2$ GeV. This marks the first accurate description of the EEC across the entire near-side region ($0^\circ&lt;\chi&lt;90^\circ$) within a unified theoretical framework. Our analysis also provides, for the first time, a quantitative extraction of the non-perturbative contribution to the EEC quark jet function, identifying a characteristic transition scale around $2.3$ GeV - distinct from the scale observed in EEC-in-jet measurements in $pp$ collisions at the LHC, which are dominated by gluon jets. These results offer the first evidence for flavor dependence (quark vs. gluon) in the EEC and provide new insights into the interplay between perturbative and non-perturbative QCD dynamics.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17733v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study lepton flavor violation (LFV) effects occurring in the $e-\mu$ conversion in nuclei and in the rare radiative decays $\eta(\eta') \to \gamma \mu e$ of the $\eta$ and $\eta'$ mesons with a special impact of the sub-GeV mass vector mediator (dark photon). In the case of the lepton conversion we make estimates for running and future experiments operating with electron beams at fixed target. Obtained results are implemented in analysis of the LFV decays $\eta(\eta') \to \gamma \mu e$. In particular, we derive the following upper bounds on the branching ratios $\mathrm{Br(\eta \to \gamma \mu e)}&lt; 2 \times 10^{-7}$ and $\mathrm{Br(\eta^\prime \to \gamma \mu e)}&lt; 2\times 10^{-8}$ in the framework of massive vector mediator portal.</description>

      <title>Pair production of massive charged vector bosons from the worldline</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15943v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate a worldline formulation for a massive spin-1 particle interacting with an electromagnetic background. Two first-quantized descriptions of the spin degrees of freedom are considered: one based on bosonic oscillators and the other on fermionic oscillators. Focusing initially on the bosonic model -- which can accommodate particles of arbitrary integer spin -- we review how quantization in the spin-1 sector, performed both via Dirac's method and BRST quantization, reproduces the free Proca field theory. We then introduce coupling to an external electromagnetic field and demonstrate that Maxwell's equations for the background emerge as a consistency condition for the nilpotency of the BRST charge on the spin-1 sector. Encouraged by this result, which proves the viability of the particle model, we proceed to construct a path integral quantization of the worldline action for the charged spin-1 particle on the circle. This yields the one-loop effective Lagrangian for a constant electromagnetic field induced by a massive charged vector boson. As expected, the result reveals a vacuum instability, which we quantify by deriving the pair production rate for the vector bosons, recovering previous results obtained in quantum field theory. For comparison, we repeat the analysis using the standard $\mathcal{N}=2$ spinning particle model, which contains fermionic worldline degrees of freedom, finding identical results. Finally, we comment on possible extensions of the worldline models to include effective interactions and briefly explore their implications for pair production.</description>

      <title>Holographic QCD Matter: Chiral Soliton Lattices in Strong Magnetic Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16897v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the chiral soliton lattice (CSL) in the framework of holographic QCD in magnetic field. Under appropriate boundary conditions for the gauge field and the quark mass deformation, we demonstrate that the ground state in the gravitational dual of QCD is given by the CSL in the background magnetic field and the baryon number density. In the presence of the background magnetic field, we show that the CSL is interpreted as a uniformly distributed D4-branes in the holographic setup, where the chiral soliton is identified with a non-self-dual instanton vortex or a center vortex in the five dimensional bulk gauge theory. While the baryon numbers are given to chiral solitons as well as Skyrmions due to the different terms in the Wess-Zumino-Witten (WZW) term in the chiral perturbation theory, these baryon numbers with different origins are unified in terms of the instanton charge density in five dimensions. With bulk analysis of the WZW term, we find that the pion decay constant becomes dependent on the magnetic field. For the massless pion case, we obtain an analytical form that is in qualitative agreement with lattice QCD results for strong magnetic fields.</description>

      <title>Generic EFT-motivated beyond General Relativity gravitational wave tests and their curvature dependence: from observation to interpretation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17143v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a "dictionary" to expedite the identification of potential deviations in gravitational waveforms from those predicted by General Relativity (GR) during the inspiral phase of black hole binaries. Assuming deviations from GR can be described by a local Effective Field Theory (EFT) formulated in terms of curvature operators (and possibly additional scalar fields), this dictionary characterizes how deviations scale with the masses of the binary components and identifies the leading order Post-Newtonian corrections in generic theories constructed within the EFT framework. By establishing a direct connection between observations and candidate theories beyond GR, this dictionary also aids in distinguishing genuine physical effects from systematic errors. These results can be readily incorporated into essentially all existing tests for the inspiral regime and, in particular, facilitate a more efficient combination of data from multiple events.</description>

      <title>Novel insight into centre-vortex geometry in four dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17200v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Centre-vortex surfaces are mapped out in four dimensions within the framework of SU(3) lattice gauge theory to understand the role of secondary loops that develop in three-dimensional visualisations of centre-vortex structure, appearing separate from the percolating cluster. Loops that initially appear disconnected in three-dimensional slices can originate from the same connected surface in four dimensions depending on the surface's curvature. For the first time, these secondary loops are identified as "connected" or "disconnected" with respect to the vortex sheet, allowing new insight into the evolution of centre-vortex geometry through the finite-temperature phase transition. At low temperatures, we find that secondary loops of any length primarily lie in the same sheet percolating the four-dimensional volume. Only a handful of small secondary sheets disconnected from the percolating sheet are identified. Above the phase transition, the vortex structure is still found to be dominated by a single large sheet but one that has aligned with the temporal dimension. With the near absence of any curvature orthogonal to the temporal dimension, connected secondary loops become vanishingly rare. Other novel quantities, such as the four-dimensional density of secondary sheets and the sheet sizes themselves, are analysed to build a complete picture of centre-vortex geometry in four dimensions.</description>

      <title>Innovative Approaches to Unravel the Shower Components' Energy Spectrum with a Single Hybrid Station</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17244v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurately measuring the energy of shower particles reaching the ground remains a challenge due to the inherent limitations of typical cosmic ray experiments. In this work, we present two experimental strategies to determine the energy spectra of the electromagnetic and muonic components of extensive air showers, leveraging a single hybrid detector station within a regular cosmic ray array. This station consists of a scintillator surface detector (SSD), a water Cherenkov detector (WCD), and Resistive Plate Chambers (RPCs), with a prototype currently being tested at the Pierre Auger Observatory.
  The first approach exploits the different responses of each detector to the same particles traversing them, allowing, for the first time, the extraction of the high-energy tail of the electromagnetic spectrum and the low-energy tail of the muonic spectrum. The second strategy utilizes machine learning tools to reconstruct the direction of muons using the WCD+RPC system. By correlating this information with the reconstructed muon production depth, the muon kinematical delay can be analyzed, providing access to its energy spectrum.</description>

      <title>Quantum walks reveal topological flat bands, robust edge states and topological phase transitions in cyclic graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17250v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topological phases, edge states, and flat bands in synthetic quantum systems are a key resource for topological quantum computing and noise-resilient information processing. We introduce a scheme based on step-dependent quantum walks on cyclic graphs, termed cyclic quantum walks (CQWs), to simulate exotic topological phenomena using discrete Fourier transforms and an effective Hamiltonian. Our approach enables the generation of both gapped and gapless topological phases, including Dirac cone-like energy dispersions, topologically nontrivial flat bands, and protected edge states, all without resorting to split-step or split-coin protocols. Odd and even-site cyclic graphs exhibit markedly different spectral characteristics, with rotationally symmetric flat bands emerging exclusively in $4n$-site graphs ($n\in \mathbf{N}$). We analytically establish the conditions for the emergence of topological, gapped flat bands and show that gap closings in rotation space imply the formation of Dirac cones in momentum space. Further, we engineer protected edge states at the interface between distinct topological phases in both odd and even cycle graphs. We numerically demonstrate that the edge states are robust against moderate static and dynamic gate disorder and remain stable against phase-preserving perturbations. This scheme serves as a resource-efficient and versatile platform for engineering topological phases, transitions, edge states, and flat bands in quantum systems, opening new avenues for fault-tolerant quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Prospects for searching for sterile neutrinos in dynamical dark energy cosmologies using joint observations of gravitational waves and $\gamma$-ray bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17315v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the era of third-generation (3G) gravitational-wave (GW) detectors, GW standard siren observations from binary neutron star mergers provide a powerful tool for probing the expansion history of the universe. Since sterile neutrinos can influence cosmic evolution by modifying the radiation content and suppressing structure formation, GW standard sirens offer promising prospects for constraining sterile neutrino properties within a cosmological framework. Building on this, we investigate the prospects for detecting sterile neutrinos in dynamical dark energy (DE) models using joint observations from 3G GW detectors and a future short gamma-ray burst detector, such as a THESEUS-like telescope. We consider three DE models: the $w$CDM, holographic DE (HDE), and Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) models. Our results show that the properties of DE can influence the constraints on sterile neutrino parameters. Moreover, the inclusion of GW data significantly improves constraints on both sterile neutrino parameters and other cosmological parameters across all three models, compared to the current limits derived from CMB+BAO+SN (CBS) observations. When GW data are included into the CBS dataset, a preference for $\Delta N_{\rm eff} &gt; 0$ emerges at approximately the $1\sigma$ level in the $w$CDM and CPL models, and reaches about $3\sigma$ in the HDE model. Moreover, the upper limits on $m_{\nu,{\rm sterile}}^{\rm eff}$ are reduced by approximately 13%, 75%, and 3% in the $w$CDM, HDE, and CPL models, respectively.</description>

      <title>Characterizing the neutron component of extensive air showers with the Surface-Scintillator Detectors of AugerPrime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17318v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neutrons are the only neutral hadrons that remain stable over the timescale of an air-shower development. Their energy is lost only through hadronic interactions and quasi-elastic scattering, which results in their high abundance at the ground. The signals from the electromagnetic and muonic components in scintillation detectors typically span only a few microseconds. In contrast, the neutrons can cause delayed pulses in scintillation detectors up to and beyond several milliseconds after the passage of the shower front. Selection of an appropriate time window allows us to isolate and characterize the neutron component of air showers, which may provide a new, direct method to probe hadronic interactions during the shower development. We report the measurement of a neutron component at ultra-high energies using the Surface-Scintillator Detectors (SSD) from the AugerPrime upgrade of the Pierre Auger Observatory. We provide a first look at the pulse-amplitude spectrum together with our measured rate and lateral distribution of the neutron component.</description>

      <title>Implications of the recent neutron decay measurements on the properties of compact objects -- a dark star with nucleonic shell ?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17340v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent experimental observation suggests that neutron decay is always accompanied by emission of electron while in 1% of cases proton is not emitted. We develop a scenario kinematically compatible with experimental observation, where neutron decay results in production of two dark matter particles of about half the mass of neutron and test properties of neutron stars with admixture of such particles. Constraints on mass and coupling to vector dark boson are obtained. The structure of the compact object is modified to a dark star with a shell of nucleonic matter around the nuclear saturation density.</description>

      <title>CMB constraints on $U(1)$ axion warm inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17438v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a model of warm inflation driven by axion-like particles interacting with $U(1)$ gauge fields, with implications for the early universe's thermal evolution. By extending traditional warm inflation models, we introduce a dissipation mechanism through the thermal fluctuations of electromagnetic fields, leading to a non-trivial backreaction on the inflaton's dynamics. Our results are consistent with CMB observations, even for a natural sub-Plankian axion decay constant $f&lt;M_{\rm Pl}$. We present precise constraints on the model's free parameters, using CAMB and CosmoMC codes. These findings offer new insights into the thermal history of the universe and the nature of inflationary dynamics.</description>

      <title>Inflationary Fossils Beyond Perturbation Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.17593v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we provide the missing link between two approaches aimed at characterizing the effect of long perturbation modes in Inflation. We consider the Inflationary Fossils' approach (arXiv:1203.0302 and related works) that characterizes the power-spectrum of the inflaton field in presence of other long and non dynamical fossil fields, and a technique, appeared in arXiv:2103.09244, that computes, beyond perturbation theory, the power-spectrum of a scalar field in presence of a large fluctuation of a second field. We clarify a few points on the applicability of the non-perturbative technique. We prove in five distinct cases that the non-perturbative approach, once expanded to first order in the coupling, matches the perturbative result following the Fossils' approach. We believe that this non-perturbative technique extends to all orders the Fossils' approach, resumming infinitely many diagrams of standard in-in perturbation theory.</description>

      <title>Accelerated cosmological expansion from pseudo-Hermiticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17660v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that a well-studied pseudo-Hermitian field theory composed of two complex scalar fields can generate accelerated cosmological expansion through a novel mechanism. The dynamics is unique to the pseudo-Hermitian field theory, and it arises in the regime of broken antilinear symmetry, wherein a growth instability from the resulting complex eigenspectrum competes with the Hubble damping. The azimuthal components of the complex scalar fields asymptote to a constant rate of rolling at late times, reminiscent of motion around the infinite staircase of M.C. Escher's lithograph "Ascending and Descending". The resulting centripetal acceleration drives the radial components of the field away from the minimum of the potential, and the system generates a self-sustaining and constant Hubble rate at late times, even when tuning the minimum of the potential such that the classical vacuum energy is vanishing. This result evidences the potential to generate novel and physically relevant dynamics that are unique to pseudo-Hermitian field theories, and that their regimes of broken antilinear symmetry can be physically relevant in dynamical spacetimes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.17716v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Beam dump experiments represent an effective way to probe new physics in a parameter space, where new particles have feeble couplings to the Standard Model sector and masses below the GeV scale. The LUXE experiment, designed primarily to study strong-field quantum electrodynamics, can be used also as a photon beam dump experiment with a unique reach for new spin-0 particles in the $10-350~\mathrm{MeV}$ mass and $10^{-6}-10^{-3}~\mathrm{GeV}^{-1}$ couplings to photons ranges. This is achieved via the ``New Physics search with Optical Dump'' (NPOD) concept. While prior estimations were obtained with a simplified model of the experimental setup, in this work we present a systematic study of the new physics reach in the full, realistic experimental apparatus, including an existing detector to be used in the LUXE NPOD context. We furthermore investigate updated scenarios of LUXE's experimental plan and confirm that our results are in agreement with the original estimations of a background-free operation.</description>

      <title>Standard Model parameters in the tadpole-free pure $\overline{\rm{MS}}$ scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.02500</link>
      <description>arXiv:1907.02500v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an implementation and numerical study of the Standard Model couplings, masses, and vacuum expectation value (VEV), using the pure $\overline{\rm{MS}}$ renormalization scheme based on dimensional regularization. Here, the $\overline{\rm{MS}}$ Lagrangian parameters are treated as the fundamental inputs, and the VEV is defined as the minimum of the Landau gauge effective potential, so that tadpole diagrams vanish, resulting in improved convergence of perturbation theory. State-of-the-art calculations relating the $\overline{\rm{MS}}$ inputs to on-shell observables are implemented in a consistent way within a public computer code library, SMDR (Standard Model in Dimensional Regularization), which can be run interactively or called by other programs. Included here for the first time are the full 2-loop contributions to the Fermi constant within this scheme and studies of the minimization condition for the VEV at 3-loop order with 4-loop QCD effects. We also implement, and study the scale dependence of, all known multi-loop contributions to the physical masses of the Higgs boson, the W and Z bosons, and the top quark, the fine structure constant and weak mixing angle, and the renormalization group equations and threshold matching relations for the gauge couplings, fermion masses, and Yukawa couplings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2211.11469v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Light millicharged particles can be copiously produced from meson decays in cosmic ray collisions with the atmosphere, leading to detectable signals in large underground neutrino detectors. In this paper we study a new channel for generating atmospheric millicharged particles, the proton bremsstrahlung process. We find that the proton bremsstrahlung process leads to a significantly higher flux of millicharged particles compared to meson decays and, for certain masses, results in a one-order-of-magnitude improvement in the flux. Consequently, Super-K constraints on $\varepsilon^2$ for sub-GeV MCPs are improved by half order of magnitude. We further note that the study on the proton bremsstrahlung process can be extended to a variety of new physics particle searches in atmospheric collisions and in low energy proton accelerators.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.05390v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a novel minimal scenario which simultaneously addresses the following theoretical/cosmological/phenomenological puzzles: (i) the origin of scales, (ii) primordial inflation, (iii) matter-antimatter asymmetry, (iv) tiny neutrino masses, (v) dark matter, and (vi) the strong CP-problem. Exact scale-symmetry was assumed. A global $U(1)_{\rm PQ}$-symmetry was also assumed but only in the matter sector. The novelty of the scenario is the introduction of an explicit $U(1)_{\rm PQ}$-breaking term in the gravity sector only. Such a term does not disturb the axion solution whereas naturally realizes an axi-majoron hybrid inflation which allows a natural realization of Affleck-Dine mechanism for generating Peccei-Quinn number asymmetry. The asymmetry can be transferred to the visible sector via the right-handed neutrino portal through non-thermal decay and thermal processes, even without the presence of a CP-violating phase in the matter sector. Dark matter and dark radiation are obtained by cold and hot components of axi-majorons, respectively.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.07685v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the volume and lifetime of the high baryon-density matter created in heavy-ion collisions and estimate the optimal collision-energy range to realize the high baryon-density region over a large spacetime volume. We simulate central collisions of gold ions for the center-of-mass energy per nucleon pair $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=2.4 - 19.6\;{\rm GeV}$ with a microscopic transport model JAM. We discover that the optimal range is around $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=3 - 5\;{\rm GeV}$, where a baryon density exceeding three times the normal nuclear density is realized with a substantially large spacetime volume. Higher and lower energies are disfavored due to short lifetime and low density, respectively. We also point out that event-by-event fluctuations of the spacetime density profile are large, indicating the importance of the event selection in the experimental analysis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19416v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive expressions for the vector and tensor components of the spin polarization of massive vector bosons at local thermodynamic equilibrium up to second order in the space-time gradients of the thermodynamic fields pertaining to the canonical stress-energy tensor and spin tensor of the free Proca field. A set of Feynman rules is devised to calculate the Wigner function and the matrix-valued spin-dependent distribution (MVSD) functions order by order in space-time gradients. Due to constraints imposed by time-reversal symmetry, the leading contribution to spin alignment - defined as the 00-component of the tensor polarization - arises from second-order terms in MVSD, for which we provide an analytic formula. We discuss the physical meaning of different contributions to vector and tensor polarization. These formulae provide a prediction of a contribution to the spin alignment which can be compared with the observations in relativistic heavy-ion collisions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.13594v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the evolution of the Deep Inelastic Scattering (DIS) entropy, defined as $ S(x,\mu^2) \simeq \ln[xg(x,\mu^2)]$ at small Bjorken variable $x$, where $\mu$ is the observable scale and
  the gluon distribution $xg(x,\mu^2)$ is derived from the Dokshitzer-Gribov-Lipatov-Altarelli-Parisi (DGLAP) evolution equations. We aim to evolve the DIS entropy, which is not directly observable, using a Laplace transform technique. This approach allows us to obtain an analytical solution for the DIS entropy based on known initial gluon distribution functions. We consider both leading-order (LO) and higher-order approximations for the DIS entropy, incorporating the evolved gluon distribution function at the initial scale. The DIS entropy, influenced by purely gluonic emissions, varies with higher-order corrections to the running coupling. By comparing theoretical predictions with charged hadron multiplicity data, we define the evolution. Additionally, we investigate the derivative of the scaling entropy, modeling it as a function of the running coupling, to determine the parameter $\lambda$, known as the Pomeron intercept. We find that the values of $\lambda(x,\mu^2)$ decrease as the order of evolution increases, which is consistent with the Balitsky-Fadin-Kuraev-Lipatov (BFKL) Pomeron in the LO and NLO approximations. This investigation provides insights into the dynamics of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) at high energies.</description>

      <title>Limitations of Freeze-in WIMP Dark Matter from Supercooled Phase Transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14526v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit the possibility of producing Weakly Interacting Massive Particle (WIMP) dark matter via a freeze-in mechanism triggered by a supercooled first-order phase transition (FOPT) in the early universe. Unlike traditional freeze-out and FIMP scenarios, this mechanism relies on a rapid entropy injection that dilutes the preexisting dark matter abundance and prevents re-equilibration due to a sudden mass increase. In this study, we systematically examine a variety of single-component dark matter models-including vector, fermionic, and scalar-mediated candidates-to assess whether they can satisfy the key cosmological condition T2 &gt;&gt; T1, required for successful WIMP freeze-in after FOPT. Contrary to earlier results, our revised analysis finds that none of the models fulfill this condition across viable parameter spaces. We confirm, however, that the scalar dark matter model analyzed in Ref. [1] is the only known viable single-component model that fulfills T2 &gt;&gt; T1 and enables WIMP freeze-in via this mechanism. These findings place important constraints on model-building efforts and suggest that successful freeze-in after FOPT may require multi-component or more complex dark sectors beyond the scope of minimal models.</description>

      <title>Stellar Light Scattering as a Probe for a Braneworld-Induced Baryogenesis Scenario</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.16588v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A recent baryogenesis scenario [Phys. Rev. D 110, 023520 (2024)], rooted in a two-brane Universe model, proposed a solution to the matter-antimatter asymmetry through the dynamics of a new pseudo-scalar field. In the present paper, one investigates the phenomenological consequences of this proposal. One shows that the associated boson could persist as a relic from the early Universe, forming a subdominant component of dark matter. While its overall cosmological density is small ($\approx 0.2\%$), one demonstrates that a one-loop process facilitates an ultra-weak coupling to photons, leading to a distinctive scattering signature. One argues that this effect could produce a faint, glowing halo around massive, hot stars, characterized by a unique spectral decay. Detecting or constraining this elusive light with current and future instruments like the JWST would provide a powerful and direct observational test of the underlying braneworld dynamics and its connection to baryogenesis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.06116v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hybrid mesons occupy a unique position in the hadronic spectrum, offering a valuable insight into the non-perturbative nature of the glue field. Hybrid states with exotic $J^{PC}$ quantum numbers, such as the $1^{-+}$, $0^{+-}$ and $2^{+-}$, cannot mix with conventional $q\bar{q}$ mesons, making them critical for establishing the full spectrum of hybrid mesons. In this work, we investigate the masses and the strong decays of $0^{+-}$ and $2^{+-}$ hybrid mesons, which could be regarded as the first orbitally excited states of the $\pi_1(1600)$ and $\eta_1(1855)$ mesons. We develop a constituent gluon model and apply it to study the mass spectra and decay modes of these exotic states. Our results suggest that experiment may searched for these $0^{+-}$ and $2^{+-}$ hybrid mesons in the mass region between 2.0 GeV and 2.4 GeV. Additionally, we identify some key decay channels which should be targeted in future experiments.</description>

      <title>Explaining Belle Data on $B\to K^{(*)}\nu\bar{\nu}$ Decays via Dark $Z$ Resonances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22347v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Belle II Collaboration reported the first measurement on ${\rm Br}(B^+\rightarrow K^+\nu\bar{\nu})$, which lies 2.7$\sigma$ away from the Standard Model expectation. This result may be manifestation of new physics beyond the Standard Model. In present work, motivated by the Belle II measurement, we investigate the effect of a dark photon/dark $Z$ on the rare $B$ meson decay $B^+\rightarrow K^+\nu\bar{\nu}$ and show that the ${\rm Br}(B^+\rightarrow K^+\nu\bar{\nu})$ excess from Belle II over the Standard Model expectation explained by the appearance of the dark $Z$ especially in resonances. We also derive constraints on various parameters of the two-Higgs-doublet model extended with a dark Abelian gauge group, in light of the measurement of the ${\rm Br}(B^+\rightarrow K^+\nu\bar{\nu})$ by the Belle-II Collaboration as well as the upper bound on ${\rm Br}(B^0\rightarrow K^{*0}\nu\bar{\nu})$ decay, set by the Belle data. Our results indicate that there exists a common region where both experimental results are satisfied for a dark $Z$ mass around 4.5 GeV with suitable values of the other parameters.</description>

      <title>Theoretical study of the $N(1535)$ in the process $\Lambda_c^+\to n\pi^+\pi^0$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14608v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We have investigated the $\Lambda_c^+\to n\pi^+\pi^0$ decay process using the chiral unitary approach, by considering that the nucleon resonance $N(1535)$ could be dynamically generated through $S$-wave pseudoscalar meson-octet baryon interactions. In the invariant mass distributions of $\pi^0n$ and $\pi^+n$, we observe a distinct peak structure associated with the resonance states $N(1535)^0$ and $N(1535)^+$, respectively. Our results suggest that the $\Lambda_c^+\to n\pi^+\pi^0$ process can be utilized to probe the properties of the nucleon $N(1535)$, and therefore, we encourage more precise experimental measurements of this process in the future.</description>

      <title>Lorentz and CPT violation and the (anti-)hydrogen molecular ion II -- hyperfine-Zeeman spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19015v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fundamental principles of quantum field theory such as Lorentz invariance, CPT symmetry and locality may be tested to extremely high precision in atomic and molecular spectroscopy. The narrow natural linewidth of rovibrational states in the hydrogen molecular ion $H_2^+$ and its antimatter counterpart $\bar{H}_2^-$, make these ideal candidates, and give $O(m_p/m_e)$ increased sensitivity to Lorentz and CPT violation in the proton sector compared to $H$ and $\bar{H}$ atoms. In a previous paper, we presented a detailed analysis of the rovibrational spectrum of $H_2^+$ and $\bar{H}_2^-$ in an effective QFT encoding Lorentz and CPT violation, focusing on spin-independent effects. Here, we extend this analysis to include the full hyperfine-Zeeman spectrum and include spin-dependent Lorentz and CPT violating operators in the effective theory. The results demonstrate how constraints on these symmetry-violating couplings may be extracted from specific rovibrational transitions between hyperfine-Zeeman states in the presence of an applied magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Radiative decays of the second shell $\Lambda_b$ and $\Xi_b$ bottom baryons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15680v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the radiative decays of the $\Lambda_b$ and $\Xi_b$ bottom baryons, which belong to the flavor anti-triplet ($\mathbf{\bar{3}}_{\rm F}$), within the constituent quark model formalism. The electromagnetic transitions are calculated from the second-shell states to both the ground and $P$-wave final states. These decays play a crucial role in confirming the existence of certain resonances. When strong decays are not allowed, the reconstruction of states relies on their electromagnetic decay channels. Moreover, electromagnetic decay widths are particularly useful for the identification of resonances when states have the same mass and total decay width. This study presents, for the first time, the calculation of electromagnetic decays for $D_\rho$-wave states, $\rho-\lambda$ mixed states, and $\rho$-mode radially excited states. Throughout our calculations, we account for uncertainties arising from both experimental and model-dependent errors.</description>

      <title>Probing the ATOMKI X17 vector boson using Dalitz decays $V\to Pe^+e^-$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23372v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent anomalies observed in $e^+e^-$ nuclear transitions of $^8 \textrm{Be}$, $^4 \textrm{He}$, and $^{12} \textrm{C}$ by the ATOMKI collaboration may hint at the existence of a vector boson with a mass around 17 MeV, referred to as X17. If it exists, this boson would also affect similar processes in particle physics, including the Dalitz decays of vector mesons. Recently, the BESIII collaboration measured the Dalitz decay $D^{*0}\to D^0e^+e^-$ for the first time and reported a $3.5\sigma$ excess over the theoretical prediction based on the vector meson dominance (VMD) model. This excess may be another signal of the X17. In this study, we investigate the possible effects of the X17 on the Dalitz decays $D^*_{(s)}\to D_{(s)}e^+e^-$, $B^*_{(s)}\to B_{(s)}e^+e^-$, and $J/\psi\to \eta_ce^+e^-$. The required hadronic form factors are calculated within the framework of our covariant confined quark model, without relying on heavy quark effective theory or the VMD model. We present predictions for the Dalitz decay widths and the ratios $R_{ee}(V)\equiv \Gamma(V\to Pe^+e^-)/\Gamma(V\to P\gamma)$ within the Standard Model and in several new physics scenarios involving modifications due to the X17. Our results are compared with other theoretical calculations.</description>

      <title>Probing Yoctosecond Quantum Dynamics in Toponium Formation at Colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05703v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The formation of toponium, a bound state of top and anti-top quarks, provides an unprecedented system for investigating quantum state dynamics at ultrashort timescales. We explore two distinct phenomenological descriptions of this process: a 'wavelike' scenario emphasizing the role of quantum superposition at creation, and a 'particlelike' scenario where a finite formation time is governed by relativistic causality. Both descriptions are compatible with the principles of relativistic quantum field theory. We propose to distinguish these scenarios by exploiting the top quark's intrinsic lifetime ($\tau_t \sim 5.02 \times 10^{-25}$\,s) as a quantum chronometer. We simulate the cross-section ratio $R_b = \sigma(e^+e^- \to b\bar{b})/\sum_q \sigma(e^+e^- \to q\bar{q})$ ($q = u,d,s,c,b$) near $\sqrt{s} = 343$\,GeV at future lepton colliders (CEPC/FCC-ee). These distinct scenarios yield observable $R_b$ profiles, enabling $&gt;5\sigma$ discrimination with 1500\,fb$^{-1}$ of data. Preliminary LHC data provide independent $2$--$3\sigma$ support. This framework establishes a collider-based method to explore time-dependent quantum phenomena in particle production with yoctosecond ($10^{-24}$\,s) resolution.</description>

      <title>Unifying Ordinary and Null Memory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.05936v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Based on a recently proposed reinterpretation of gravitational wave memory that builds up on the definition of gravitational waves pioneered by Isaacson, we provide a unifying framework to derive both ordinary and null memory from a single well-defined equation at leading order in the asymptotic expansion. This allows us to formulate a memory equation that is valid for any unbound asymptotic energy-flux that preserves local Lorentz invariance. Using Horndeski gravity as a concrete example metric theory with an additional potentially massive scalar degree of freedom in the gravitational sector, the general memory formula is put into practice by presenting the first account of the memory correction sourced by the emission of massive field waves. Throughout the work, physical degrees of freedom are identified by constructing manifestly gauge invariant perturbation variables within an SVT decomposition on top of the asymptotic Minkowski background, which will in particular prove useful in future studies of gravitational wave memory within vector tensor theories.</description>

      <title>Lorentz and CPT violation and the (anti-)hydrogen molecular ion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09730v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The extremely narrow natural linewidths of rovibrational energy levels in the molecular hydrogen ion $\textrm{H}_2^{\,+}$, and the prospect of synthesising its antimatter counterpart $\overline{\textrm{H}}_2^{\,-}$, make it a promising candidate for high-precision tests of fundamental symmetries such as Lorentz and CPT invariance. In this paper, we present a detailed analysis of the rovibrational spectrum of the (anti-)hydrogen molecular ion in a low-energy effective theory incorporating Lorentz and CPT violation. The focus is on the spin-independent couplings in this theory, for which the best current bounds come from measurements of the 1S-2S transition in atomic hydrogen and antihydrogen. We show that in addition to the improvement in these bounds from the increased precision of the transition frequencies, potentially reaching 1 part in $10^{17}$, rovibrational transitions have an enhanced sensitivity to Lorentz and CPT violation of $O(m_p/m_e)$ in the proton (hadron) sector compared to atomic transitions.</description>

      <title>Rotational Metric: A Solution to Einstein's Clock-Rate Problem and Its Magnetospheric Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20501v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rotational metric provides an exact solution to Einstein's clock-rate problem in curved spacetime, specifically, whether time flows more slowly at the equator of a compact object such as a neutron star than at its poles. It features a curvature singularity, an event horizon, a potentially evolving ergosphere, a rigidly-rotating normal space, and two stationary limit surfaces. Although derived from the Schwarzschild metric through rotational transformations, it includes an additional ergosphere. Given the equivalence of inertia and gravity, this demonstrates how non-inertial transformations, such as rotational transformations, can introduce new spacetime structures into a gravitational system. In particular, the additional physical degrees of freedom carried by rotational transformations are `eaten' by the gravitational system to form an additional ergosphere. Furthermore, the rotational metric effectively models a rigidly-rotating gravitational system and is applicable for describing rotationally-induced gravitational effects in various rotating magnetospheres.</description>

      <title>Doubly heavy tetraquarks from lattice QCD: incorporating diquark-antidiquark operators and the left-hand cut</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03473v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Lattice studies of the doubly-charm tetraquark $T_{cc}=cc\bar u\bar d$ require the determination of the $DD^*$ scattering amplitude, which most often incorporate only meson-meson interpolators. We additionally incorporate diquark-antidiquark operators and find that these have some impact on certain eigenenergies. This study presents the first extraction of the $DD^*$ scattering amplitude based on the meson-meson as well as diquark antidiquark interpolators. The effect of the additional operators renders
  slightly smaller values of $p\cot \delta_0$ and a $T_{cc}$ pole slightly closer to the threshold. The scattering amplitude is extracted from eigenenergies by adopting plane-wave and effective-field-theoretic methods, which also incorporate the left-hand cut and address the partial wave mixing. The $T_{cc}$ is found to be a subthreshold resonance with a pole at $m_{T_{cc}}-m_D-m_{D^*}=-5.2^{+0.7}_{-0.8} - i \cdot 6.3^{+2.4}_{-4.8}~$MeV, employing CLS ensembles with $m_\pi\simeq 280~$MeV and the distillation method. A more significant effect of diquark-antidiquark operators on eigen-energies is found for larger heavy quark masses relevant for $T_{bb}$. We find that deeply bound $T_{bb}$ does not emerge when employing only meson-meson operators, where each meson is separately momentum projected, while the deeply bound state emerges after adding local diquark antidiquark operators.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.18251v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a new two-fluid conduction scheme to simulate the evolution of an isolated, self-gravitating, equilibrium cluster of stars and collisionless dark matter on secular (gravothermal) timescales. We integrate the equations in Lagrangian coordinates via a second-order, semi-implicit algorithm, which is unconditionally stable when the mass of the lighter species is much less than that of the heavier species. The method can be straightforwardly generalized to handle a multi-species system with a population of stars or components beyond collisionless dark matter and stars. We apply the method to simulate the dynamical evolution of stellar-dark matter systems, exploring the consequences of mass segregation and gravothermal core collapse, and assessing those effects for observed globular clusters and dwarf galaxies in the Local Volume.</description>

      <title>Probability of the Initial Conditions for Inflation and Slow Contraction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.22763v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Some recent studies based on numerical relativity simulations claim that slow contraction/ekpyrosis is strongly preferred over inflation as the smoothing mechanism that brought the universe into the homogeneous, isotropic and flat state we observe today on large scales. In this paper, we evaluate the likelihood of the initial conditions employed in the aforementioned simulations by estimating the probability that a free scalar field dominating the universe at the beginning of inflation or ekpyrosis will be sufficiently homogeneous on scales comparable to the Hubble radius at that time. We explore the space of parameters that characterize the initial power spectrum of the scalar field, finding that either can be more likely than the other for a fixed choice of parameters. On the other hand, when we extremize over these parameters, we find that the maximal probability for inflation is much higher than that of ekpyrosis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.05389v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The orbits of planetary systems can be deformed from their initial configurations due to close encounters with larger astrophysical bodies. Typical candidates for close encounters are stars and binaries. We explore the prospect that if there is a sizeable population of primordial black holes (PBH) in our galaxy, then these may also impact the orbits of exoplanets. Specifically, in a simplified setting, we study numerically how many planetary systems might have a close encounter with a PBH, and analyze the potential changes to the orbital parameters of systems that undergo PBH flybys.</description>

      <title>Little Red Dots from Small-Scale Primordial Black Hole Clustering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.07171v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) observations have identified a class of compact galaxies at high redshifts ($4 \lesssim z \lesssim 11$), dubbed "little red dots" (LRDs). The supermassive black holes (SMBHs) of $10^{5-8}{\rm\,M}_{\odot}$ in LRDs favor a heavy-seed origin. We propose a mechanism for their formation: Clusters of primordial black holes, formed through long-short mode coupling on small scales in the early Universe, undergo sequential mergers over extended timescales. This mechanism can evade cosmic microwave background distortions and result in heavy-seed SMBHs via runaway mergers. We employ Monte Carlo simulations to solve the Smoluchowski coagulation equation and determine the runaway merging timescale. The resulting stochastic gravitational wave background offers a distinct signature of this process, and the forming SMBHs can be highly spinning at their formation due to the spin residual of the cluster from tidal fields. This mechanism may explain the rapidly spinning SMBHs in LRDs under the assumption of obscured active galactic nuclei.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.07193v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent observational results from the DESI collaboration reveal tensions with the standard $\Lambda$CDM model and favour a scenario in which dark energy (DE) decays over time. The DESI DR2 data also suggest that the DE equation of state (EoS) may have been phantom-like ($w &lt; - 1$) in the past, evolving to $w &gt; - 1$ at present, implying a recent crossing of the phantom divide at $w = - 1$. Scalar field models of DE naturally emerge in ultraviolet-complete theories such as string theory, which is typically formulated in higher dimensions. In this work, we investigate a broad class of $thawing~scalar~field~models$, including the simple quadratic, quartic, exponential, symmetry-breaking and axion potentials, propagating on a (4+1)-dimensional ghost-free phantom braneworld, and demonstrate that their effective EoS exhibits a phantom-divide crossing. Alongside the Hubble parameter and EoS of DE, we also analyse the evolution of the $Om$ diagnostic, and demonstrate that the time dependence of these quantities is in excellent agreement with the DESI DR2 observations. Furthermore, we perform a comprehensive parameter estimation using Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling, and find that the $\chi^2$ values for all our models are remarkably close to that of the widely used CPL parametrisation, indicating that our models fit the data very well.</description>
