      <title>LDPC-Coded Molecular Communications with Increased Diversity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper suggests achieving diversity gains while utilizing low-denisty parity check (LDPC) codes in molecular communications. Intersymbol interference (ISI) causes a significant disadvantage in error performance for molecular communications. Even though decoding LDPC codes with soft decoding yields a considerable enhancement in the bit error rate (BER) curves, this can be further improved by utilizing diversity gain. In order to achieve this, two different messenger molecule types are sent to transmit the message codeword and its interleaved version. The molecular communication channel is then modeled, and the error performance of the proposed method is estimated by Monte-Carlo simulations. This approach provides considerable improvement in the error performance in the scenario where few messenger molecules are transmitted per bit.</description>

      <title>Active Beam Learning for Full-Duplex Wireless Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel active beam learning method for in-band full-duplex wireless systems, that aims to design transmit and receive beams which suppress self-interference and maximize the sum spectral efficiency. Rather than rely on explicit estimation of the downlink, uplink, and/or self-interference channels like in most existing work, our method instead actively probes all three channels through measurements of SNR and INR over a fixed number of time slots. Then, once this probing concludes, all collected probing measurements are used to design transmit and receive beams which serve downlink and uplink in a full-duplex fashion. We realize this active beam learning scheme through a network of LSTMs and DNNs, which learns to design each probing beam pair and subsequently extract and record valuable information from each probing measurement such that near-optimal serving beams can be designed following the probing stage. Simulation indicates that our method reliably suppresses self-interference while delivering near-maximal SNR on the downlink and uplink with merely 3-10 probing time slots, while exhibiting robustness to measurement noise and the structure of the self-interference channel.</description>

      <title>Fluid Antenna Systems Enabling 6G:Principles, Applications, and Research Directions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fluid antenna system (FAS) as a new version of reconfigurable antenna technologies promoting shape and position flexibility, has emerged as an exciting and possibly transformative technology for wireless communications systems. FAS represents any software-controlled fluidic, conductive or dielectric structure that can dynamically alter antenna's shape and position to change the gain, the radiation pattern, the operating frequency, and other critical radiation characteristics. With its capability, it is highly anticipated that FAS can contribute greatly to the upcoming sixth generation (6G) wireless networks. This article substantiates this thought by addressing four major questions: 1) Is FAS crucial to 6G? 2) How to characterize FAS? 3) What are the applications of FAS? 4) What are the relevant challenges and future research directions? In particular, five promising research directions that underscore the potential of FAS are discussed. We conclude this article by showcasing the impressive performance of FAS.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning Modeling Method for RF Devices Based on Uniform Noise Training Set</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03936v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the scale and complexity of integrated circuits continue to increase, traditional modeling methods are struggling to address the nonlinear challenges in radio frequency (RF) chips. Deep learning has been increasingly applied to RF device modeling. This paper proposes a deep learning-based modeling method for RF devices using a uniform noise training set, aimed at modeling and fitting the nonlinear characteristics of RF devices. We hypothesize that a uniform noise signal can encompass the full range of characteristics across both frequency and amplitude, and that a deep learning model can effectively capture and learn these features. Based on this hypothesis, the paper designs a complete integrated circuit modeling process based on measured data, including data collection, processing, and neural network training. The proposed method is experimentally validated using the RF amplifier PW210 as a case study. Experimental results show that the uniform noise training set allows the model to capture the nonlinear characteristics of RF devices, and the trained model can predict waveform patterns it has never encountered before. The proposed deep learning-based RF device modeling method, using a uniform noise training set, demonstrates strong generalization capability and excellent training performance, offering high practical application value.</description>

      <title>Performance Analysis of XL-MIMO with Rotary and Movable Antennas for High-speed Railway</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03940v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rotary and movable antennas (ROMA) technology is efficient in enhancing wireless network capacity by adjusting both the antenna spacing and three-dimensional (3D) rotation of antenna surfaces, based on the spatial distribution of users and channel statistics. Applying ROMA to high-speed rail (HSR) wireless communications can significantly improve system performance in terms of array gain and spatial multiplexing. However, the rapidly changing channel conditions in HSR scenarios present challenges for ROMA configuration. In this correspondence, we propose a analytical framework for configuring ROMA-based extremely large-scale multiple-input-multiple-output (XL-MIMO) system in HSR scenarios based on spatial correlation. First, we develop a localization model based on a mobility-aware near-field beam training algorithm to determine the real-time position of the train relay antennas. Next, we derive the expression for channel orthogonality and antenna spacing based on the spatial correlation matrix, and obtain the optimal antenna spacing when the transceiver panels are aligned in parallel. Moreover, we propose an optimization algorithm for the rotation angle of the transceiver panels, leveraging the differential evolution method, to determine the optimal angle. Finally, numerical results are provided to validate the computational results and optimization algorithm.</description>

      <title>Environment Reconstruction with Multi-targets Reflectors-merged Sensing Method Based on THz Single-sided Channel Characteristics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Terahertz (THz) integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) holds the potential to achieve high data rates and high-resolution sensing. Reconstructing the propagation environment is a vital step for THz ISAC, as it enhances the predictability of the communication channel to reduce communication overhead. In this letter, we propose an environment reconstruction methodology (ERM) merging reflectors of multi-targets based on THz single-sided channel small-scale characteristics. In this method, the inclination and position of tiny reflection faces of one single multi-path (MPC) are initially detected by double-triangle equations based on Snells law and geometry properties. Then, those reflection faces of multi-target MPCs, which are filtrated as available and one-order reflection MPCs, are globally merged to accurately reconstruct the entire propagation environment. The ERM is capable of operating with only small-scale parameters of receiving MPC. Subsequently, we validate our ERM through two experiments: bi-static ray-tracing simulations in an L-shaped room and channel measurements in an urban macrocellular (UMa) scenario in THz bands. The validation results demonstrate a small deviation of 0.03 m between the sensing outcomes and the predefined reflectors in the ray-tracing simulation and a small sensing root-mean-square error of 1.28 m and 0.45 m in line-of-sight and non-line-of-sight cases respectively based on channel measurements. Overall, this work is valuable for designing THz communication systems and facilitating the application of THz ISAC communication techniques.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Learning for IRS-Assisted MEC Systems with Rate-Splitting Multiple Access</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intelligent reflecting surface (IRS)-assisted mobile edge computing (MEC) systems have shown notable improvements in efficiency, such as reduced latency, higher data rates, and better energy efficiency. However, the resource competition among users will lead to uneven allocation, increased latency, and lower throughput. Fortunately, the rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA) technique has emerged as a promising solution for managing interference and optimizing resource allocation in MEC systems. This paper studies an IRS-assisted MEC system with RSMA, aiming to jointly optimize the passive beamforming of the IRS, the active beamforming of the base station, the task offloading allocation, the transmit power of users, the ratios of public and private information allocation, and the decoding order of the RSMA to minimize the average delay from a novel uplink transmission perspective. Since the formulated problem is non-convex and the optimization variables are highly coupled, we propose a hierarchical deep reinforcement learning-based algorithm to optimize both continuous and discrete variables of the problem. Additionally, to better extract channel features, we design a novel network architecture within the policy and evaluation networks of the proposed algorithm, combining convolutional neural networks and densely connected convolutional network for feature extraction. Simulation results indicate that the proposed algorithm not only exhibits excellent convergence performance but also outperforms various benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Deep-Unrolling Multidimensional Harmonic Retrieval Algorithms on Neuromorphic Hardware</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04008v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores the potential of conversion-based neuromorphic algorithms for highly accurate and energy-efficient single-snapshot multidimensional harmonic retrieval (MHR). By casting the MHR problem as a sparse recovery problem, we devise the currently proposed, deep-unrolling-based Structured Learned Iterative Shrinkage and Thresholding (S-LISTA) algorithm to solve it efficiently using complex-valued convolutional neural networks with complex-valued activations, which are trained using a supervised regression objective. Afterward, a novel method for converting the complex-valued convolutional layers and activations into spiking neural networks (SNNs) is developed. At the heart of this method lies the recently proposed Few Spikes (FS) conversion, which is extended by modifying the neuron model's parameters and internal dynamics to account for the inherent coupling between real and imaginary parts in complex-valued computations. Finally, the converted SNNs are mapped onto the SpiNNaker2 neuromorphic board, and a comparison in terms of estimation accuracy and power efficiency between the original CNNs deployed on an NVIDIA Jetson Xavier and the SNNs is being conducted. The measurement results show that the converted SNNs achieve almost five-fold power efficiency at moderate performance loss compared to the original CNNs.</description>

      <title>Delay-Doppler Signal Processing with Zadoff-Chu Sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04295v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Much of the engineering behind current wireless systems has focused on designing an efficient and high-throughput downlink to support human-centric communication such as video streaming and internet browsing. This paper looks ahead to design of the uplink, anticipating the emergence of machine-type communication (MTC) and the confluence of sensing, communication, and distributed learning. We demonstrate that grant-free multiple access is possible even in the presence of highly time-varying channels. Our approach provides a pathway to standards adoption, since it is built on enhancing the 2-step random access procedure which is already part of the 5GNR standard. This 2-step procedure uses Zadoff-Chu (ZC) sequences as preambles that point to radio resources which are then used to upload data. We also use ZC sequences as preambles / pilots, but we process signals in the Delay-Doppler (DD) domain rather than the time-domain. We demonstrate that it is possible to detect multiple preambles in the presence of mobility and delay spread using a receiver with no knowledge of the channel other than the worst case delay and Doppler spreads. Our approach depends on the mathematical properties of ZC sequences in the DD domain. We derive a closed form expression for ZC pilots in the DD domain, we characterize the possible self-ambiguity functions, and we determine the magnitude of the possible cross-ambiguity functions. These mathematical properties enable detection of multiple pilots through solution of a compressed sensing problem. The columns of the compressed sensing matrix are the translates of individual ZC pilots in delay and Doppler. We show that columns in the design matrix satisfy a coherence property that makes it possible to detect multiple preambles in a single Zak-OTFS subframe using One-Step Thresholding (OST), which is an algorithm with low complexity.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03717v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Background: Liver diseases are a major global health concern, often diagnosed using resource-intensive methods. Electrocardiogram (ECG) data, widely accessible and non-invasive, offers potential as a diagnostic tool for liver diseases, leveraging the physiological connections between cardiovascular and hepatic health.
  Methods: This study applies machine learning models to ECG data for the diagnosis of liver diseases. The pipeline, combining tree-based models with Shapley values for explainability, was trained, internally validated, and externally validated on an independent cohort, demonstrating robust generalizability.
  Findings: Our results demonstrate the potential of ECG to derive biomarkers to diagnose liver diseases. Shapley values revealed key ECG features contributing to model predictions, highlighting already known connections between cardiovascular biomarkers and hepatic conditions as well as providing new ones. Furthermore, our approach holds promise as a scalable and affordable solution for liver disease detection, particularly in resource-limited settings.
  Interpretation: This study underscores the feasibility of leveraging ECG features and machine learning to enhance the diagnosis of liver diseases. By providing interpretable insights into cardiovascular-liver interactions, the approach bridges existing gaps in non-invasive diagnostics, offering implications for broader systemic disease monitoring.</description>

      <title>Electrically functionalized body surface for deep-tissue bioelectrical recording</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03749v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Directly probing deep tissue activities from body surfaces offers a noninvasive approach to monitoring essential physiological processes1-3. However, this method is technically challenged by rapid signal attenuation toward the body surface and confounding motion artifacts4-6 primarily due to excessive contact impedance and mechanical mismatch with conventional electrodes. Herein, by formulating and directly spray coating biocompatible two-dimensional nanosheet ink onto the human body under ambient conditions, we create microscopically conformal and adaptive van der Waals thin films (VDWTFs) that seamlessly merge with non-Euclidean, hairy, and dynamically evolving body surfaces. Unlike traditional deposition methods, which often struggle with conformality and adaptability while retaining high electronic performance, this gentle process enables the formation of high-performance VDWTFs directly on the body surface under bio-friendly conditions, making it ideal for biological applications. This results in low-impedance electrically functionalized body surfaces (EFBS), enabling highly robust monitoring of biopotential and bioimpedance modulations associated with deep-tissue activities, such as blood circulation, muscle movements, and brain activities. Compared to commercial solutions, our VDWTF-EFBS exhibits nearly two-orders of magnitude lower contact impedance and substantially reduces the extrinsic motion artifacts, enabling reliable extraction of bioelectrical signals from irregular surfaces, such as unshaved human scalps. This advancement defines a technology for continuous, noninvasive monitoring of deep-tissue activities during routine body movements.</description>

      <title>Learning Networks from Wide-Sense Stationary Stochastic Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03768v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Complex networked systems driven by latent inputs are common in fields like neuroscience, finance, and engineering. A key inference problem here is to learn edge connectivity from node outputs (potentials). We focus on systems governed by steady-state linear conservation laws: $X_t = {L^{\ast}}Y_{t}$, where $X_t, Y_t \in \mathbb{R}^p$ denote inputs and potentials, respectively, and the sparsity pattern of the $p \times p$ Laplacian $L^{\ast}$ encodes the edge structure. Assuming $X_t$ to be a wide-sense stationary stochastic process with a known spectral density matrix, we learn the support of $L^{\ast}$ from temporally correlated samples of $Y_t$ via an $\ell_1$-regularized Whittle's maximum likelihood estimator (MLE). The regularization is particularly useful for learning large-scale networks in the high-dimensional setting where the network size $p$ significantly exceeds the number of samples $n$.
  We show that the MLE problem is strictly convex, admitting a unique solution. Under a novel mutual incoherence condition and certain sufficient conditions on $(n, p, d)$, we show that the ML estimate recovers the sparsity pattern of $L^\ast$ with high probability, where $d$ is the maximum degree of the graph underlying $L^{\ast}$. We provide recovery guarantees for $L^\ast$ in element-wise maximum, Frobenius, and operator norms. Finally, we complement our theoretical results with several simulation studies on synthetic and benchmark datasets, including engineered systems (power and water networks), and real-world datasets from neural systems (such as the human brain).</description>

      <title>Offloading Revenue Maximization in Multi-UAV-Assisted Mobile Edge Computing for Video Stream</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03965v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traditional video transmission systems assisted by multiple Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are often limited by computing resources, making it challenging to meet the demands for efficient video processing. To solve this challenge, this paper presents a multi-UAV-assisted Device-to-Device (D2D) mobile edge computing system for the maximization of task offloading profits in video stream transmission. In particular, the system enables UAVs to collaborate with idle user devices to process video computing tasks by introducing D2D communications. To maximize the system efficiency, the paper jointly optimizes power allocation, video transcoding strategies, computing resource allocation, and UAV trajectory. The resulting non-convex optimization problem is formulated as a Markov decision process and solved relying on the Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic policy gradient (TD3) algorithm. Numerical results indicate that the proposed TD3 algorithm performs a significant advantage over other traditional algorithms in enhancing the overall system efficiency.</description>

Abstract: This paper examines the role of 5G communication in the Mobilities for EU project, a collaborative initiative involving 29 partners and 11 pilots aimed at revolutionizing urban mobility through electrification, automation, and connectivity. Focusing on Dresden as a Lead City, we explore the integration of 27 innovative solutions, including autonomous freight transport, eBuses, and charging robots, using a 5G communication network as the central framework. We analyze how 5G enables seamless connectivity and real-time data processing across diverse technologies, fostering interdependencies and synergies. This approach not only provides a cohesive understanding of the project's scope but also demonstrates 5G's critical role in smart city infrastructure. We evaluate the anticipated impact on sustainability metrics such as air quality, noise levels, CO2 emissions, and traffic congestion. The paper concludes by discussing challenges and strategies in leveraging 5G for comprehensive urban mobility solutions and its potential impact on future smart city developments.</description>

      <title>Joint Mode Selection and Beamforming Designs for Hybrid-RIS Assisted ISAC Systems</title>

Abstract: This paper considers a hybrid reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) assisted integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system, where each RIS element can flexibly switch between the active and passive modes. Subject to the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) constraint for each communication user (CU) and the transmit power constraints for both the base station (BS) and the active RIS elements, with the objective of maximizing the minimum beampattern gain among multiple targets, we jointly optimize the BS transmit beamforming for ISAC and the mode selection of each RIS reflecting element, as well as the RIS reflection coefficient matrix. Such formulated joint hybrid-RIS assisted ISAC design problem is a mixed-integer nonlinear program, which is decomposed into two low-dimensional subproblems being solved in an alternating manner. Specifically, by using the semidefinite relaxation (SDR) technique along with the rank-one beamforming construction process, we efficiently obtain the optimal ISAC transmit beamforming design at the BS. Via the SDR and successive convex approximation (SCA) techniques, we jointly determine the active/passive mode selection and reflection coefficient for each RIS element. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed design solution is significantly superior to the existing baseline solutions.</description>

      <title>Physics-informed Deep Learning for Muscle Force Prediction with Unlabeled sEMG Signals</title>

Abstract: Computational biomechanical analysis plays a pivotal role in understanding and improving human movements and physical functions. Although physics-based modeling methods can interpret the dynamic interaction between the neural drive to muscle dynamics and joint kinematics, they suffer from high computational latency. In recent years, data-driven methods have emerged as a promising alternative due to their fast execution speed, but label information is still required during training, which is not easy to acquire in practice. To tackle these issues, this paper presents a novel physics-informed deep learning method to predict muscle forces without any label information during model training. In addition, the proposed method could also identify personalized muscle-tendon parameters. To achieve this, the Hill muscle model-based forward dynamics is embedded into the deep neural network as the additional loss to further regulate the behavior of the deep neural network. Experimental validations on the wrist joint from six healthy subjects are performed, and a fully connected neural network (FNN) is selected to implement the proposed method. The predicted results of muscle forces show comparable or even lower root mean square error (RMSE) and higher coefficient of determination compared with baseline methods, which have to use the labeled surface electromyography (sEMG) signals, and it can also identify muscle-tendon parameters accurately, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed physics-informed deep learning method.</description>

      <title>Ternary Stochastic Neuron -- Implemented with a Single Strained Magnetostrictive Nanomagnet</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04246v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stochastic neurons are extremely efficient hardware for solving a large class of problems and usually come in two varieties -- "binary" where the neuronal statevaries randomly between two values of -1, +1 and "analog" where the neuronal state can randomly assume any value between -1 and +1. Both have their uses in neuromorphic computing and both can be implemented with low- or zero-energy-barrier nanomagnets whose random magnetization orientations in the presence of thermal noise encode the binary or analog state variables. In between these two classes is n-ary stochastic neurons, mainly ternary stochastic neurons (TSN) whose state randomly assumes one of three values (-1, 0, +1), which have proved to be efficient in pattern classification tasks such as recognizing handwritten digits from the MNIST data set or patterns from the CIFAR-10 data set. Here, we show how to implement a TSN with a zero-energy-barrier (shape isotropic) magnetostrictive nanomagnet subjected to uniaxial strain.</description>

      <title>Knowledge Transfer based Evolutionary Deep Neural Network for Intelligent Fault Diagnosis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.13479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2109.13479v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A fault diagnosis with commendable accuracy is essential for the reliability of industrial machines. Two main challenges affect the design of high-performing intelligent systems: (i) the selection of a suitable model and (ii) domain adaptation if there is a continuous change in operating conditions. Therefore, we propose an evolutionary Net2Net transformation (EvoN2N) that finds the best suitable DNN architecture with limited availability of labeled data samples. Net2Net transformation-based quick learning algorithm has been used in the evolutionary framework of Non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II to obtain the best DNN architecture. Net2Net transformation-based quick learning algorithm uses the concept of knowledge transfer from one generation to the next for faster fitness evaluation. The proposed framework can obtain the best model for intelligent fault diagnosis without a long and time-consuming search process. The proposed framework has been validated on the Case Western Reserve University dataset, the Paderborn University dataset, and the gearbox fault detection dataset under different operating conditions. The best models obtained are capable of demonstrating an excellent diagnostic performance and classification accuracy of almost up to 100\% for most of the operating conditions.</description>

      <title>WaveletGPT: Wavelets Meet Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.12924v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have ushered in a new wave of artificial intelligence advancements impacting every scientific field and discipline. They are trained on a simple objective: to predict the next token given the previous context. We live in a world where most of the data around us, e.g., text, audio, and music, has a multi-scale structure associated with it. This paper infuses LLMs with traditional signal processing ideas, namely wavelets, during pre-training to take advantage of the structure. Without adding \textbf{any extra parameters} to a GPT-style LLM architecture, we achieve the same pre-training performance almost twice as fast in text, raw audio, and symbolic music. This is achieved by imposing a structure on intermediate embeddings. When trained for the same number of training steps, we achieve significant gains in performance, which is comparable to pre-training a larger neural architecture. Our architecture allows every next token prediction access to intermediate embeddings at different temporal resolutions in every Transformer decoder block. This work will hopefully pave the way for incorporating multi-rate signal processing ideas into traditional LLM pre-training. Further, we showcase pushing model performance by improving internal structure instead of just going after scale.</description>

Abstract: In this document, we revise the results of [1] based on more reasonable assumptions regarding data shuffling and parameter setup of deep neural networks (DNNs). Thus, the simulation results can now more reasonably demonstrate the performance of both the proposed and compared beam alignment methods. We revise the simulation steps and make moderate modifications to the design of the vehicle distribution feature (VDF) for the proposed vision based beam alignment when the MS location is available (VBALA). Specifically, we replace the 2D grids of the VDF with 3D grids and utilize the vehicle locations to expand the dimensions of the VDF. Then, we revise the simulation results of Fig. 11, Fig. 12, Fig. 13, Fig. 14, and Fig. 15 in [1] to reaffirm the validity of the conclusions.</description>

      <title>Which Channel in 6G, Low-rank or Full-rank, more needs RIS from a Perspective of DoF?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13769v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS), as an efficient tool to improve receive signal-to-noise ratio, extend coverage and create more spatial diversity, is viewed as a most promising technique for the future wireless networks like 6G. As you know, RIS is very suitable for a special wireless scenario with wireless link between BS and users being completely blocked, i.e., no link. In this paper, we extend its applications to a general scenario, i.e., rank-deficient channel, particularly some extremely low-rank ones such as no link, and line-of-sight (LoS, rank-one). Actually, there are several potential important low-rank applications like low-altitude, satellite, UAV, marine, and deep-space communications. In such a situation, it is found that RIS may make a dramatic degrees of freedom (DoF) enhancement over no RIS. By using a distributed RISs placement, the DoF of channel from BS to user in LoS channel may be even boosted from a low-rank like 0/1 to full-rank. This will achieve an extremely rate improvement via spatial parallel multiple-stream transmission from BS to user. In this paper, we present a complete review of making an in-depth discussion on DoF effect of RIS.</description>

      <title>R-MTLLMF: Resilient Multi-Task Large Language Model Fusion at the Wireless Edge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18220v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multi-task large language models (MTLLMs) are important for many applications at the wireless edge, where users demand specialized models to handle multiple tasks efficiently. However, training MTLLMs is complex and exhaustive, particularly when tasks are subject to change. Recently, the concept of model fusion via task vectors has emerged as an efficient approach for combining fine-tuning parameters to produce an MTLLM. In this paper, the problem of enabling edge users to collaboratively craft such MTLMs via tasks vectors is studied, under the assumption of worst-case adversarial attacks. To this end, first the influence of adversarial noise to multi-task model fusion is investigated and a relationship between the so-called weight disentanglement error and the mean squared error (MSE) is derived. Using hypothesis testing, it is directly shown that the MSE increases interference between task vectors, thereby rendering model fusion ineffective. Then, a novel resilient MTLLM fusion (R-MTLLMF) is proposed, which leverages insights about the LLM architecture and fine-tuning process to safeguard task vector aggregation under adversarial noise by realigning the MTLLM. The proposed R-MTLLMF is then compared for both worst-case and ideal transmission scenarios to study the impact of the wireless channel. Extensive model fusion experiments with vision LLMs demonstrate R-MTLLMF's effectiveness, achieving close-to-baseline performance across eight different tasks in ideal noise scenarios and significantly outperforming unprotected model fusion in worst-case scenarios. The results further advocate for additional physical layer protection for a holistic approach to resilience, from both a wireless and LLM perspective.</description>

      <title>Multi-Functional RIS Integrated Sensing and Communications for 6G Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01251v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel multi-functional reconfigurable intelligent surface (MF-RIS) that supports signal reflection, refraction, amplification, and target sensing simultaneously. Our MF-RIS aims to enhance integrated communication and sensing (ISAC) systems, particularly in multi-user and multi-target scenarios. Equipped with reflection and refraction components (i.e., amplifiers and phase shifters), MF-RIS is able to adjust the amplitude and phase shift of both communication and sensing signals on demand. Additionally, with the assistance of sensing elements, MF-RIS is capable of capturing the echo signals from multiple targets, thereby mitigating the signal attenuation typically associated with multi-hop links. We propose a MF-RIS-enabled multi-user and multi-target ISAC system, and formulate an optimization problem to maximize the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) of sensing targets. This problem involves jointly optimizing the transmit beamforming and MF-RIS configurations, subject to constraints on the communication rate, total power budget, and MF-RIS coefficients. We decompose the formulated non-convex problem into three sub-problems, and then solve them via an efficient iterative algorithm. Simulation results demonstrate that: 1) The performance of MF-RIS varies under different operating protocols, and energy splitting (ES) exhibits the best performance in the considered MF-RIS-enabled multi-user multi-target ISAC system; 2) Under the same total power budget, the proposed MF-RIS with ES protocol attains 52.2%, 73.5% and 60.86% sensing SINR gains over active RIS, passive RIS, and simultaneously transmitting and reflecting RIS (STAR-RIS), respectively; 3) The number of sensing elements will no longer improve sensing performance after exceeding a certain number.</description>

      <title>Mixed-Precision Quantization: Make the Best Use of Bits Where They Matter Most</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03101v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mixed-precision quantization offers superior performance to fixed-precision quantization. It has been widely used in signal processing, communication systems, and machine learning. In mixed-precision quantization, bit allocation is essential. Hence, in this paper, we propose a new bit allocation framework for mixed-precision quantization from a search perspective. First, we formulate a general bit allocation problem for mixed-precision quantization. Then we introduce the penalized particle swarm optimization (PPSO) algorithm to address the integer consumption constraint. To improve efficiency and avoid iterations on infeasible solutions within the PPSO algorithm, a greedy criterion particle swarm optimization (GC-PSO) algorithm is proposed. The corresponding convergence analysis is derived based on dynamical system theory. Furthermore, we apply the above framework to some specific classic fields, i.e., finite impulse response (FIR) filters, receivers, and gradient descent. Numerical examples in each application underscore the superiority of the proposed framework to the existing algorithms.</description>

      <title>Pilot-Aided Simultaneous Communication And Localisation (PASCAL) Under Practical Imperfections</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.18762v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a system model called pilot-aided simultaneous communication and localisation (PASCAL) and illustrates its performance in the presence of practical gain and phase imperfections. Specifically, we consider the scenario where multiple single-antenna unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) transmit data packets to a multi-antenna base station (BS) that has the dual responsibility of detecting communication signals and localising UAVs using their pilot symbols. Two forms of receiver signal processing approaches are adopted, including disjoint localisation and communication by using maximum likelihood estimation and multiple signal classification (MUSIC), as well as joint localisation and data detection achieved by the newly proposed algorithms. To evaluate the asymptotic localisation performance in the presence of gain-phase imperfections, the Cram\'er-Rao lower bound (CRLB) is derived, while for evaluating the communication's performance, the average sum data rate (SDR) for all the UAVs is derived in closed-form. It is shown that these derived expressions concur with simulations. The results reveal that while the proposed PASCAL system can be sensitive to gain-phase imperfections, it remains to be a powerful and efficient means to achieve reliable simultaneous localisation and communications.</description>

Abstract: The technological landscape is rapidly evolving toward large-scale systems. Networks supporting massive connectivity through numerous Internet of Things (IoT) devices are at the forefront of this advancement. In this paper, we examine Wireless Power Transfer (WPT)-enabled networks, where a server requires to collect data from these IoT devices to compute a task with massive Ultra-Reliable and Low-Latency Communication (mURLLC) services.} We focus on information freshness, using Age-of-Information (AoI) as the key performance metric. Specifically, we aim to minimize the maximum AoI among IoT devices by optimizing the scheduling policy. Our analytical findings demonstrate the convexity of the problem, enabling efficient solutions. We introduce the concept of AoI-oriented cluster capacity and analyze the relationship between the number of supported devices and network AoI performance. Numerical simulations validate our proposed approach's effectiveness in enhancing AoI performance, highlighting its potential for guiding the design of future IoT systems requiring mURLLC services.</description>

      <title>Objective Features Extracted from Motor Activity Time Series for Food Addiction Analysis Using Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00310v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study investigates machine learning algorithms to identify objective features for diagnosing food addiction (FA) and assessing confirmed symptoms (SC). Data were collected from 81 participants (mean age: 21.5 years, range: 18-61 years, women: 77.8%) whose FA and SC were measured using the Yale Food Addiction Scale (YFAS). Participants provided demographic and anthropometric data, completed the YFAS, the Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale, and the Dutch Eating Behavior Questionnaire, and wore an actimeter on the non-dominant wrist for a week to record motor activity. Analysis of the actimetric data identified significant statistical and entropy-based features that accurately predicted FA and SC using ML. The Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) was the primary metric. Activity-related features were more effective for FA prediction (MCC=0.88) than rest-related features (MCC=0.68). For SC, activity segments yielded MCC=0.47, rest segments MCC=0.38, and their combination MCC=0.51. Significant correlations were also found between actimetric features related to FA, emotional, and restrained eating behaviors, supporting the model's validity. Our results support the concept of a human bionic suite composed of IoT devices and ML sensors, which implements health digital assistance with real-time monitoring and analysis of physiological indicators related to FA and SC.</description>
