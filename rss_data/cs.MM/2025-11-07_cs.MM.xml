      <title>On the Brittleness of CLIP Text Encoders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal co-embedding models, especially CLIP, have advanced the state of the art in zero-shot classification and multimedia information retrieval in recent years by aligning images and text in a shared representation space. However, such modals trained on a contrastive alignment can lack stability towards small input perturbations. Especially when dealing with manually expressed queries, minor variations in the query can cause large differences in the ranking of the best-matching results. In this paper, we present a systematic analysis of the effect of multiple classes of non-semantic query perturbations in an multimedia information retrieval scenario. We evaluate a diverse set of lexical, syntactic, and semantic perturbations across multiple CLIP variants using the TRECVID Ad-Hoc Video Search queries and the V3C1 video collection. Across models, we find that syntactic and semantic perturbations drive the largest instabilities, while brittleness is concentrated in trivial surface edits such as punctuation and case. Our results highlight robustness as a critical dimension for evaluating vision-language models beyond benchmark accuracy.</description>

      <title>MIDI-LLM: Adapting Large Language Models for Text-to-MIDI Music Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03942v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present MIDI-LLM, an LLM for generating multitrack MIDI music from free-form text prompts. Our approach expands a text LLM's vocabulary to include MIDI tokens, and uses a two-stage training recipe to endow text-to-MIDI abilities. By preserving the original LLM's parameter structure, we can directly leverage the vLLM library for accelerated inference. Experiments show that MIDI-LLM achieves higher quality, better text control, and faster inference compared to the recent Text2midi model. Live demo at https://midi-llm-demo.vercel.app.</description>

      <title>Towards Aligning Multimodal LLMs with Human Experts: A Focus on Parent-Child Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04366v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are increasingly applied in human-centred AI systems, their ability to understand complex social interactions remains uncertain. We present an exploratory study on aligning MLLMs with speech-language pathologists (SLPs) in analysing joint attention in parent-child interactions, a key construct in early social-communicative development. Drawing on interviews and video annotations with three SLPs, we characterise how observational cues of gaze, action, and vocalisation inform their reasoning processes. We then test whether an MLLM can approximate this workflow through a two-stage prompting, separating observation from judgment. Our findings reveal that alignment is more robust at the observation layer, where experts share common descriptors, than at the judgement layer, where interpretive criteria diverge. We position this work as a case-based probe into expert-AI alignment in complex social behaviour, highlighting both the feasibility and the challenges of applying MLLMs to socially situated interaction analysis.</description>

      <title>MusRec: Zero-Shot Text-to-Music Editing via Rectified Flow and Diffusion Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04376v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Music editing has emerged as an important and practical area of artificial intelligence, with applications ranging from video game and film music production to personalizing existing tracks according to user preferences. However, existing models face significant limitations, such as being restricted to editing synthesized music generated by their own models, requiring highly precise prompts, or necessitating task-specific retraining, thus lacking true zero-shot capability. Leveraging recent advances in rectified flow and diffusion transformers, we introduce MusRec, the first zero-shot text-to-music editing model capable of performing diverse editing tasks on real-world music efficiently and effectively. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing methods in preserving musical content, structural consistency, and editing fidelity, establishing a strong foundation for controllable music editing in real-world scenarios.</description>

      <title>PixCLIP: Achieving Fine-grained Visual Language Understanding via Any-granularity Pixel-Text Alignment Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04601v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While the Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining(CLIP) model has achieved remarkable success in a variety of downstream vison language understanding tasks, enhancing its capability for fine-grained image-text alignment remains an active research focus. To this end, most existing works adopt the strategy of explicitly increasing the granularity of visual information processing, e.g., incorporating visual prompts to guide the model focus on specific local regions within the image. Meanwhile, researches on Multimodal Large Language Models(MLLMs) have demonstrated that training with long and detailed textual descriptions can effectively improve the model's fine-grained vision-language alignment. However, the inherent token length limitation of CLIP's text encoder fundamentally limits CLIP to process more granular textual information embedded in long text sequences. To synergistically leverage the advantages of enhancing both visual and textual content processing granularity, we propose PixCLIP, a novel framework designed to concurrently accommodate visual prompt inputs and process lengthy textual descriptions. Specifically, we first establish an automated annotation pipeline capable of generating pixel-level localized, long-form textual descriptions for images. Utilizing this pipeline, we construct LongGRIT, a high-quality dataset comprising nearly 1.5 million samples. Secondly, we replace CLIP's original text encoder with the LLM and propose a three-branch pixel-text alignment learning framework, facilitating fine-grained alignment between image regions and corresponding textual descriptions at arbitrary granularity. Experiments demonstrate that PixCLIP showcases breakthroughs in pixel-level interaction and handling long-form texts, achieving state-of-the-art performance.</description>

      <title>Cross-modal Causal Intervention for Alzheimer's Disease Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13956v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) serves as a prodromal stage of Alzheimer's Disease (AD), where early identification and intervention can effectively slow the progression to dementia. However, diagnosing AD remains a significant challenge in neurology due to the confounders caused mainly by the selection bias of multi-modal data and the complex relationships between variables. To address these issues, we propose a novel visual-language causality-inspired framework named Cross-modal Causal Intervention with Mediator for Alzheimer's Disease Diagnosis (MediAD) for diagnostic assistance. Our MediAD employs Large Language Models (LLMs) to summarize clinical data under strict templates, therefore enriching textual inputs. The MediAD model utilizes Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), clinical data, and textual data enriched by LLMs to classify participants into Cognitively Normal (CN), MCI, and AD categories. Because of the presence of confounders, such as cerebral vascular lesions and age-related biomarkers, non-causal models are likely to capture spurious input-output correlations, generating less reliable results. Our framework implicitly mitigates the effect of both observable and unobservable confounders through a unified causal intervention method. Experimental results demonstrate the outstanding performance of our method in distinguishing CN/MCI/AD cases, outperforming other methods in most evaluation metrics. The study showcases the potential of integrating causal reasoning with multi-modal learning for neurological disease diagnosis.</description>

      <title>Node-Based Editing for Multimodal Generation of Text, Audio, Image, and Video</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03227v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a node-based storytelling system for multimodal content generation. The system represents stories as graphs of nodes that can be expanded, edited, and iteratively refined through direct user edits and natural-language prompts. Each node can integrate text, images, audio, and video, allowing creators to compose multimodal narratives. A task selection agent routes between specialized generative tasks that handle story generation, node structure reasoning, node diagram formatting, and context generation. The interface supports targeted editing of individual nodes, automatic branching for parallel storylines, and node-based iterative refinement. Our results demonstrate that node-based editing supports control over narrative structure and iterative generation of text, images, audio, and video. We report quantitative outcomes on automatic story outline generation and qualitative observations of editing workflows. Finally, we discuss current limitations such as scalability to longer narratives and consistency across multiple nodes, and outline future work toward human-in-the-loop and user-centered creative AI tools.</description>
