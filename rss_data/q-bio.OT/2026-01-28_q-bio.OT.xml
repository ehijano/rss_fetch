      <title>Hyperdisorder in tumor growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19852v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tumor growth is constrained by spatial, mechanical, and metabolic factors whose alignment progressively breaks down across cellular, mesoscopic, and tissue scales as tumors expand. We hypothesize that this misalignment drives tumors toward a distinct architectural regime, termed hyperdisorder. Hyperdisorder is not defined by increased heterogeneity alone, but by the coexistence of elevated disorder across scales and spatial nonstationarity within the same tumor. Unlike ordinary randomness, where independent fluctuations diminish under spatial averaging, disorder here persists, reorganizes, or even amplifies with increasing observation scale, preventing convergence toward a stable architectural description. Using hematoxylin and eosin stained whole-slide images of gastric cancer from The Cancer Genome Atlas, we quantify tumor architecture using tile-based metrics that capture complementary aspects of organization, including texture entropy, microstructural fragmentation, orientation isotropy, and multiscale entropy variation. These measures are combined into a standardized hyperdisorder index, enabling unsupervised comparison across spatial regions. We find that architectural disruption is unevenly distributed and partially decoupled across scales within individual slides, consistent with growth-driven multiscale incoherence rather than uniform stochastic variability. Testable consequences include anomalous scaling of heterogeneity with sampling size, failure of coarse graining to converge, and systematic differences between tumor cores and invasive fronts. In diagnostic and clinical contexts, this framework clarifies when measurements from limited tissue samples are representative of the whole tumor and when they are dominated by scale- and location-dependent effects.</description>

      <title>Assessing metadata privacy in neuroimaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15278v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The ethical and legal imperative to share research data without causing harm requires careful attention to privacy risks. While mounting evidence demonstrates that data sharing benefits science, legitimate concerns persist regarding the potential leakage of personal information that could lead to reidentification and subsequent harm. We reviewed metadata accompanying neuroimaging datasets from heterogeneous studies openly available on OpenNeuro, involving participants across the lifespan, from children to older adults, with and without clinical diagnoses, and including associated clinical score data. Using metaprivBIDS (https://github.com/CPernet/metaprivBIDS), a software application for BIDS compliant tsv/json files that computes and reports different privacy metrics (k-anonymity, k-global, l-diversity, SUDA, PIF), we found that privacy is generally well maintained, with serious vulnerabilities being rare. Nonetheless, issues were identified in nearly all datasets and warrant mitigation. Notably, clinical score data (e.g., neuropsychological results) posed minimal reidentification risk, whereas demographic variables: age, sex assigned at birth, sexual orientations, race, income, and geolocation, represented the principal privacy vulnerabilities. We outline practical measures to address these risks, enabling safer data sharing practices.</description>
