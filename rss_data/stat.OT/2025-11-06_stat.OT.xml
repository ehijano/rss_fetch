      <title>From Hume to Jaynes: Induction as the Logic of Plausible Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02881v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The problem of induction has persisted since Hume exposed the logical gap between repeated observation and universal inference. Traditional attempts to resolve it have oscillated between two extremes: the probabilistic optimism of Laplace and Jeffreys, who sought to quantify belief through probability, and the critical skepticism of Popper, who replaced confirmation with falsification. Both approaches, however, assume that induction must deliver certainty or its negation. In this paper, I argue that the problem of induction dissolves when recast in terms of logical coherence (understood as internal consistency of credences under updating) rather than truth. Following E. T. Jaynes, probability is interpreted not as frequency or decision rule but as the extension of deductive logic to incomplete information. Under this interpretation, Bayes's theorem is not an empirical statement but a consistency condition that constrains rational belief updating. Induction thus emerges as the special case of deductive reasoning applied to uncertain premises. Falsification appears as the limiting form of Bayesian updating when new data drive posterior plausibility toward zero, while the Bayes Factor quantifies the continuous spectrum of evidential strength. Through analytical examples, including Laplace's sunrise problem, Jeffreys's mixed prior, and confidence-based reformulations, I show that only the logic of plausible reasoning unifies these perspectives without contradiction. Induction, properly understood, is not the leap from past to future but the discipline of maintaining coherence between evidence, belief, and information.</description>

      <title>Topography, climate, land cover, and biodiversity: Explaining endemic richness and management implications on a Mediterranean island</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03242v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Island endemism is shaped by complex interactions among environmental, ecological, and evolutionary factors, yet the relative contributions of topography, climate, and land cover remain incompletely quantified. We investigated the drivers of endemic plant richness across Crete, a Mediterranean biodiversity hotspot, using spatially explicit data on species distributions, topographic complexity, climatic variability, land cover, and soil characteristics. Artificial Neural Network models, a machine learning tool, were employed to assess the relative importance of these predictors and to identify hotspots of endemism. We found that total species richness, elevation range, and climatic variability were the strongest predictors of endemic richness, reflecting the role of biodiversity, topographic heterogeneity, and climatic gradients in generating diverse habitats and micro-refugia that promote speciation and buffer extinction risk. Endemic hotspots only partially overlapped with areas of high total species richness, indicating that total species richness was the optimal from the ones examined, yet an imperfect surrogate. These environmentally heterogeneous areas also provide critical ecosystem services, including soil stabilization, pollination, and cultural value, which are increasingly threatened by tourism, renewable energy development, land-use change, and climate impacts. Our findings underscore the importance of prioritizing mountainous and climatically variable regions in conservation planning, integrating ecosystem service considerations, and accounting for within-island spatial heterogeneity. By explicitly linking the environmental drivers of endemism to both biodiversity patterns and ecosystem function, this study provides a framework for evidence-based conservation planning in Crete and other Mediterranean islands with similar geological and biogeographic contexts.</description>
