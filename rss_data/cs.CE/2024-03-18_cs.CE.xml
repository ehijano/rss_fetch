      <title>Overcoming the cohesive zone limit in the modelling of composites delamination with TUBA cohesive elements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09895v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The wide adoption of composite structures in the aerospace industry requires reliable numerical methods to account for the effects of various damage mechanisms, including delamination. Cohesive elements are a versatile and physically representative way of modelling delamination. However, using their standard form which conforms to solid substrate elements, multiple elements are required in the narrow cohesive zone, thereby requiring an excessively fine mesh and hindering the applicability in practical scenarios. The present work focuses on the implementation and testing of triangular thin plate substrate elements and compatible cohesive elements, which satisfy C1-continuity in the domain. The improved regularity meets the continuity requirement coming from the Kirchhoff Plate Theory and the triangular shape allows for conformity to complex geometries. The overall model is validated for mode I delamination, the case with the smallest cohesive zone. Very accurate predictions of the limit load and crack propagation phase are achieved, using elements as large as 11 times the cohesive zone.</description>

      <title>GradNav: Accelerated Exploration of Potential Energy Surfaces with Gradient-Based Navigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10358v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The exploration of molecular systems' potential energy surface is important for comprehending their complex behaviors, particularly through identifying various metastable states. However, the transition between these states is often hindered by substantial energy barriers, demanding prolonged molecular simulations that consume considerable computational efforts. Our study introduces the GradNav algorithm, which enhances the exploration of the energy surface, accelerating the reconstruction of the potential energy surface (PES). This algorithm employs a strategy of initiating short simulation runs from updated starting points, derived from prior observations, to effectively navigate across potential barriers and explore new regions. To evaluate GradNav's performance, we introduce two metrics: the deepest well escape frame (DWEF) and the search success initialization ratio (SSIR). Through applications on Langevin dynamics within Mueller-type potential energy surfaces and molecular dynamics simulations of the Fs-Peptide protein, these metrics demonstrate GradNav's enhanced ability to escape deep energy wells, as shown by reduced DWEF values, and its reduced reliance on initial conditions, highlighted by increased SSIR values. Consequently, this improved exploration capability enables more precise energy estimations from simulation trajectories.</description>

      <title>Learning Flexible Body Collision Dynamics with Hierarchical Contact Mesh Transformer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.12467v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, many mesh-based graph neural network (GNN) models have been proposed for modeling complex high-dimensional physical systems. Remarkable achievements have been made in significantly reducing the solving time compared to traditional numerical solvers. These methods are typically designed to i) reduce the computational cost in solving physical dynamics and/or ii) propose techniques to enhance the solution accuracy in fluid and rigid body dynamics. However, it remains under-explored whether they are effective in addressing the challenges of flexible body dynamics, where instantaneous collisions occur within a very short timeframe. In this paper, we present Hierarchical Contact Mesh Transformer (HCMT), which uses hierarchical mesh structures and can learn long-range dependencies (occurred by collisions) among spatially distant positions of a body -- two close positions in a higher-level mesh corresponds to two distant positions in a lower-level mesh. HCMT enables long-range interactions, and the hierarchical mesh structure quickly propagates collision effects to faraway positions. To this end, it consists of a contact mesh Transformer and a hierarchical mesh Transformer (CMT and HMT, respectively). Lastly, we propose a flexible body dynamics dataset, consisting of trajectories that reflect experimental settings frequently used in the display industry for product designs. We also compare the performance of several baselines using well-known benchmark datasets. Our results show that HCMT provides significant performance improvements over existing methods.
