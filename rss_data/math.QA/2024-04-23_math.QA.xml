      <title>On commutative set-theoretic solutions of the Pentagon Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13758v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend the so-called retract relation given in [6] for involutive set-theoretic solutions of the Pentagon Equation and we introduce the notion of associated permutation group to study the family of the commutative non-degenerate ones. Moreover, we develop a machinery to construct all these solutions and we use it to give a quite explicit classification of the irretractable ones. Finally, non-degenerate solutions on left-zero semigroup are studied in detail, with an emphasis on the ones with cyclic associated permutation group and on the ones having small size.</description>

      <title>Solutions to quantum tetrahedron equation with two colors and nonnegative matrix entries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this short note, we construct solutions to quantum tetrahedron equation in which there are two $\mathcal R$-operators each depending on one parameter, while these parameters are independent from each other. The equation is of the kind "with variables on the edges", and these variables take just two values (called sometimes "colors"). All matrix entries of our $\mathcal R$-operators are nonnegative, if the parameters are chosen properly, and the number of strictly positive entries is either 12 or 14.</description>

      <title>Highest-weight vectors and three-point functions in GKO coset decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the classical Goddard-Kent-Olive coset construction. We find the formulas for the highest weight vectors in coset decomposition and calculate their norms. We also derive formulas for matrix elements of natural vertex operators between these vectors. This leads to relations on conformal blocks. Due to the AGT relation, these relations are equivalent to blowup relations on Nekrasov partition functions with the presence of the surface defect. These relations can be used to prove Kyiv formulas for the Painlev\'e tau-functions (following Nekrasov's method).</description>

      <title>Broken lines and compatible pairs for rank 2 quantum cluster algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14369v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There have been several combinatorial constructions of universally positive bases in cluster algebras, and these same combinatorial objects play a crucial role in the known proofs of the famous positivity conjecture for cluster algebras. The greedy basis was constructed in rank $2$ by Lee-Li-Zelevinsky using compatible pairs on Dyck paths. The theta basis, introduced by Gross-Hacking-Keel-Kontsevich, has elements expressed as a sum over broken lines on scattering diagrams. It was shown by Cheung-Gross-Muller-Musiker-Rupel-Stella-Williams that these bases coincide in rank $2$ via algebraic methods, and they posed the open problem of giving a combinatorial proof by constructing a (weighted) bijection between compatible pairs and broken lines.
  We construct a quantum-weighted bijection between compatible pairs and broken lines for the quantum type $A_2$ and the quantum Kronecker cluster algebras. By specializing the quantum parameter, this handles the problem of Cheung et al. for skew-symmetric cluster algebras of finite and affine type. For cluster monomials in skew-symmetric rank-$2$ cluster algebras, we construct a quantum-weighted bijection between positive compatible pairs (which comprise almost all compatible pairs) and broken lines of negative angular momentum.</description>

      <title>A route to quantum computing through the theory of quantum graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13773v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Based on our previous works, and in order to relate them with the theory of quantum graphs and the quantum computing principles, we once again try to introduce some newly developed technical structures just by relying on our toy example, i.e. the coordinate ring of $n\times n$ quantum matrix algebra $M_q(n)$, and the associated directed locally finite graphs $\mathcal{G}(\Pi_n)$, and the Cuntz-Krieger $C^*$-graph algebras. Meaningly, we introduce a $(4i-6)$-quantum entangled system by using the Cuntz-Krieger $\mathcal{G}(\Pi_i)$-families associated to the $4i-6$ distinct Hamiltonian paths of $\mathcal{G}(\Pi_i)$, for $i\in\{2,\cdots,n\}$.</description>

      <title>A remark on the B-model Comparison of Hodge structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13805v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this note we record a comparison theorem on the B-model variation of semi-infinite Hodge structures. This result is considered a folklore theorem by experts in the field. We only take this opportunity to write it down. Our motivation is to apply it in the study of B-model categorical enumerative invariants.</description>

      <title>Pointed quandles of linkoinds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14083v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we define the fundamental quandle of knotoids and linkoids and prove that it is invariant under the under forbidden-move and hence encodes only the information of the underclosure of the knotoid. We then introduce $n$-pointed quandles, which generalize quandles by specifying $n$ elements as ordered basepoints. This leads to the notion of fundamental pointed quandles of linkoids, which enhances the fundamental quandle. Using $2$-pointed quandle allows us to distinguish 1-linkoids with equivalent under-closures and leads to a couple of 1-linkoid invariants. We also generalize the notion of homogeneity of quandles to $n$-homogeneity of quandles. We classify all $\infty$-homogeneous, finite quandles.</description>

      <title>The coproduct for the affine Yangian and the parabolic induction for non-rectangular $W$-algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14096v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By using the coproduct and evaluation map for the affine Yangian and the Miura map for non-rectangular $W$-algebras, we construct a homomorphism from the affine Yangian associated with $\widehat{\mathfrak{sl}}(n)$ to the universal enveloping algebra of a non-rectangular $W$-algebra of type $A$, which is an affine analogue of the one given in De Sole-Kac-Valeri. As a consequence, we find that the coproduct for the affine Yangian is compatible with the parabolic induction for non-rectangular $W$-algebras via this homomorphism. We also show that the image of this homomorphism is contained in the affine coset of the $W$-algebra in the special case that the $W$-algebra is associated with a nilpotent element of type $(1^{m-n},2^n)$.</description>
