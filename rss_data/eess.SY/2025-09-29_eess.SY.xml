      <title>A Crime/S.I.R. optimal control problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21406v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents and discusses a mathematical model inspired by control theory to derive optimal public policies for minimizing costs associated with the reduction and control of criminal activity in a population. Specifically, we analyze the optimal control problem \begin{equation*} \min G(u_1, u_2, u_3) = \int_{0}^{t_{\text{F}}} \left( I(t) - R(t) + \frac{B_1}{2} u_1^2(t) + \frac{B_2}{2} u_2^2(t) + \frac{B_3}{2} u_3^2(t) \right) \, dt. \end{equation*} where $I=I(t)$ and $R=R(t)$ satisfies the system of equations \begin{equation*} \left\{ \begin{aligned} \dot{S} &amp;= \Lambda - (1-u_1)SI - \mu S + ((1+u_3)\gamma_2)I + \rho \Omega R,\\ \dot{I} &amp;= (1-u_1)SI - (\mu + \delta_1)I - ((1+u_2)\gamma_1)I - ((1+u_3)\gamma_2)I + (1-\Omega)\rho R,\\ \dot{R} &amp;= ((1+u_2)\gamma_1)I - (\mu + \delta_2 + \rho)R. \end{aligned} \right. \end{equation*} Our approach assumes that the social and economic effects of criminal behavior can be modeled by a dynamic SIR-type system, which serves as a constraint on a cost functional associated with the strategies implemented by government and law enforcement authorities to reduce criminal behavior. Using optimal control theory, the proposed controls, i.e., preventive policies (such as community and social cohesion programs), are expected to have a significant and positive impact on crime reduction, generating opportunities for the most disadvantaged sectors of Cali society and contributing to long-term security. Given that resources to address this problem are limited, this research aims to determine an optimal combination of public interventions and policies that minimize criminality at the lowest possible economic cost, using an SIR model, tools from variational calculus, and optimal control theory.</description>

      <title>Quaternionic Pole Placement via Companion Forms and the Ackermann Formula</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21425v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an extension of state-feedback pole placement for quaternionic systems, based on companion forms and the Ackermann formula. For controllable single-input quaternionic LTI models, we define a companion polynomial that right-annihilates its companion matrix, characterize spectra via right-eigenvalue similarity classes, and prove coefficient-matching design in controllable coordinates. We then derive a coordinate-free Ackermann gain expression valid for real target polynomials, and state its scope and limitations. Short examples demonstrate correctness, practical use, and numerical simplicity.</description>

      <title>Mitigation of Active Power Oscillation in Multi-VSG Grids: An Impedance-Based Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21642v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Active power oscillations frequently arise in inverter-dominated power systems with multiple converters operating under Virtual Synchronous Generator control, posing risks to system stability and protection coordination. While various mitigation strategies have been proposed, many rely on prior knowledge of system parameters, offer limited damping performance, or involve complex models that lack physical interpretability, making them difficult to apply in practice. To address these challenges, this paper first introduces a physically intuitive RLC equivalent circuit model to explain the root causes of APOs in both stand-alone and grid-connected modes. By mapping inertia, damping, and feeder impedance to capacitive, resistive, and inductive elements, respectively, the model reveals how mismatches among converters lead to inter-unit oscillations characterized by LC resonance. Building on this insight, we propose two mode-specific mitigation strategies: in SA mode, a graph theory based impedance control ensures proportional reactive power sharing and effectively suppresses APOs; and in GC mode, adaptive inertia and damping control with feedforward filtering is designed to reshape transient power dynamics while preserving frequency stability. The proposed methods are validated through extensive simulations and real-time hardware-in-the-loop experiments, demonstrating their effectiveness in suppressing oscillations and enhancing the robustness of multi-converter power systems.</description>

      <title>NEO-Grid: A Neural Approximation Framework for Optimization and Control in Distribution Grids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21668v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rise of distributed energy resources (DERs) is reshaping modern distribution grids, introducing new challenges in attaining voltage stability under dynamic and decentralized operating conditions. This paper presents NEO-Grid, a unified learning-based framework for volt-var optimization (VVO) and volt-var control (VVC) that leverages neural network surrogates for power flow and deep equilibrium models (DEQs) for closed-loop control. Our method replaces traditional linear approximations with piecewise-linear ReLU networks trained to capture the nonlinear relationship between power injections and voltage magnitudes. For control, we model the recursive interaction between voltage and inverter response using DEQs, allowing direct fixed-point computation and efficient training via implicit differentiation. We evaluated NEO-Grid on the IEEE 33-bus system, demonstrating that it significantly improves voltage regulation performance compared to standard linear and heuristic baselines in both optimization and control settings. Our results establish NEO-Grid as a scalable, accurate, and interpretable solution for learning-based voltage regulation in distribution grids.</description>

      <title>On Suboptimal Safety-Critical Tracking Controller Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21726v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel framework for safety-critical optimal trajectory tracking in nonlinear systems based on the state-dependent Riccati equation (SDRE) methodology. By embedding barrier states into the system dynamics, the proposed strategy simultaneously ensures safety and tracking requirements, even in scenarios where these objectives may be inherently conflicting. A discounted pseudo-quadratic cost function is formulated to achieve a suboptimal trade-off between tracking accuracy, control effort, and safety objective. We present two distinct controller designs: one utilizing a single barrier state to enforce overall safety constraints, and another employing multiple barrier states to individually tuning the system's conservatism with respect to each safety constraint, providing enhanced flexibility in tuning the system's conservatism toward individual constraints. We establish sufficient conditions to ensure the solvability of the associated Riccati equations. The proposed safe controller is well-suited for real-time implementation in practical systems, given its reasonable computational requirements and compatibility with widely available embedded microprocessors. This is supported by simulation studies involving a mechanical system and a mobile robot collision avoidance scenario, where the safe SDRE controller consistently maintained safety while achieving trajectory tracking objectives in challenging conditions. Additionally, experimental results on a cable-driven parallel robot further demonstrate the practical applicability and effectiveness of the proposed method in real-world control tasks.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement Learning Based Traffic Signal Design to Minimize Queue Lengths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21745v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficient traffic signal control (TSC) is crucial for reducing congestion, travel delays, pollution, and for ensuring road safety. Traditional approaches, such as fixed signal control and actuated control, often struggle to handle dynamic traffic patterns. In this study, we propose a novel adaptive TSC framework that leverages Reinforcement Learning (RL), using the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm, to minimize total queue lengths across all signal phases. The challenge of efficiently representing highly stochastic traffic conditions for an RL controller is addressed through multiple state representations, including an expanded state space, an autoencoder representation, and a K-Planes-inspired representation. The proposed algorithm has been implemented using the Simulation of Urban Mobility (SUMO) traffic simulator and demonstrates superior performance over both traditional methods and other conventional RL-based approaches in reducing queue lengths. The best performing configuration achieves an approximately 29% reduction in average queue lengths compared to the traditional Webster method. Furthermore, comparative evaluation of alternative reward formulations demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed queue-based approach, showcasing the potential for scalable and adaptive urban traffic management.</description>

      <title>Optimized Control of Duplex Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21767v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many real-world complex systems can be modeled as multiplex networks, where each layer represents a distinct set of interactions among the same entities. Controlling such systems-steering them toward desired states using external inputs-is crucial across many domains. However, existing network control theory largely focuses on single-layer networks, and applying separate controls to each layer of a multiplex system often leads to redundant sets of driver nodes, increasing cost and complexity.
  To address this challenge, we formulate the Universal Minimum Union Driver Set (MinUDS) problem for duplex networks. The goal is to find the smallest set of driver nodes that can simultaneously control both layers.
  We propose a novel algorithm, Shortest Cross-Layer Augmenting Path Search (CLAP-S). This method introduces the concept of a Cross-Layer Augmenting Path (CLAP) and efficiently explores the combinatorial space of control configurations. CLAP-S iteratively realigns each layer's Minimum Driver Set (MDS) to maximize their overlap. We prove the algorithm's global optimality and demonstrate its efficiency on both synthetic networks and real-world multiplex systems.
  The results show that CLAP-S consistently outperforms baseline approaches by significantly reducing the number of required driver nodes and cutting computational time by an order of magnitude. This work provides a powerful, general-purpose tool for optimizing control strategies in multi-layer networks, enabling more economical interventions in diverse fields.</description>

      <title>A Parallel Ultra-Low Power Silent Speech Interface based on a Wearable, Fully-dry EMG Neckband</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21964v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a wearable, fully-dry, and ultra-low power EMG system for silent speech recognition, integrated into a textile neckband to enable comfortable, non-intrusive use. The system features 14 fully-differential EMG channels and is based on the BioGAP-Ultra platform for ultra-low power (22 mW) biosignal acquisition and wireless transmission. We evaluate its performance on eight speech commands under both vocalized and silent articulation, achieving average classification accuracies of 87$\pm$3% and 68$\pm$3% respectively, with a 5-fold CV approach. To mimic everyday-life conditions, we introduce session-to-session variability by repositioning the neckband between sessions, achieving leave-one-session-out accuracies of 64$\pm$18% and 54$\pm$7% for the vocalized and silent experiments, respectively. These results highlight the robustness of the proposed approach and the promise of energy-efficient silent-speech decoding.</description>

      <title>A Preliminary Assessment of Shipboard Power System Architectures for LVDC Integration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22567v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The adoption of low-voltage direct current sections within grid architectures is emerging as a promising design option in the naval sector. This paper presents a preliminary comparative assessment of three different grid topologies, using an existing MVAC-LVAC shipboard power system as a reference: a conventional MVAC-LVAC radial distribution with an additional LVDC section, a full LVDC radial distribution and a zonal LVDC distribution. Each architecture includes typical elements such as synchronous generators, propulsion motors, energy storage system units, extra propulsive loads, and pulse power loads. The analysis exploits five key performance indicators: weight, volume, technology readiness level, average system interruption duration index, and pulsed power loads interruption index.</description>

      <title>Optimized Operation of Standalone Battery Energy Storage Systems in the Cross-Market Energy Arbitrage Business</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21337v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The provision of renewable electricity is the foundation for a sustainable future. To achieve the goal of sustainable renewable energy, Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS) could play a key role to counteract the intermittency of solar and wind generation power. In order to aid the system, the BESS can simply charge at low wholesale prices and discharge during high prices, which is also called energy arbitrage. However, the real-time execution of energy arbitrage is not straightforward for many companies due to the fundamentally different behavior of storages compared to conventional power plants. In this work, the optimized operation of standalone BESS in the cross-market energy arbitrage business is addressed by describing a generic framework for trading integrated BESS operation, the development of a suitable backtest engine and a specific optimization-based strategy formulation for cross-market optimized BESS operation. In addition, this strategy is tested in a case study with a sensitivity analysis to investigate the influence of forecast uncertainty. The results show that the proposed strategy allows an increment in revenues by taking advantage of the increasing market volatility. Furthermore, the sensitivity analysis shows the robustness of the proposed strategy, as only a moderate portion of revenues will be lost if real forecasts are adopted.</description>

      <title>Neuromorphic Deployment of Spiking Neural Networks for Cognitive Load Classification in Air Traffic Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21345v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a neuromorphic system for cognitive load classification in a real-world setting, an Air Traffic Control (ATC) task, using a hardware implementation of Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs). Electroencephalogram (EEG) and eye-tracking features, extracted from an open-source dataset, were used to train and evaluate both conventional machine learning models and SNNs. Among the SNN architectures explored, a minimalistic, single-layer model trained with a biologically inspired delta-rule learning algorithm achieved competitive performance (80.6%). To enable deployment on neuromorphic hardware, the model was quantized and implemented on the mixed-signal DYNAP-SE chip. Despite hardware constraints and analog variability, the chip-deployed SNN maintained a classification accuracy of up to 73.5% using spike-based input. These results demonstrate the feasibility of event-driven neuromorphic systems for ultra-low-power, embedded cognitive state monitoring in dynamic real-world scenarios.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.21416v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The synthesis of optimization algorithms typically follows a design-first-analyze-later approach, which often obscures fundamental performance limitations and hinders the systematic design of algorithms operating at the achievable theoretical boundaries. Recently, a framework based on frequency-domain techniques from robust control theory has emerged as a powerful tool for automating algorithm synthesis. By integrating the design and analysis stages, this framework enables the identification of fundamental performance limits. In this paper, we build on this framework and extend it to address algorithms for solving strongly convex problems with equality constraints. As a result, we obtain a new class of algorithms that offers sharp trade-off between number of matrix multiplication per iteration and convergence rate.</description>

      <title>A comprehensive equivalent circuit model for high overtone bulk acoustic resonators (HBARs)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21640v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a new and comprehensive equivalent circuit model for high overtone bulk acoustic resonators (HBARs). HBARs demonstrate several very sharp resonance modes distributed nearly periodically over a very wide frequency range. This spectrum response of HBARs offers unique advantages but poses significant modeling challenges. The proposed circuit incorporates and models the unique physical components of the HBAR: piezoelectric transducer, substrate (a perfectly periodic multimode cavity), piezoelectric coupling, and critically, the imperfectly matched transducer-substrate interface which imparts characteristic aperiodicity to the HBAR mode spectrum. By judicious use of fixed, periodic, or tightly constrained virtual lumped-element branches, and sets of branches, the model retains clear and intuitive links to the physical device, while reducing the complexity needed for fitting dense, broadband datasets. We demonstrate the validity and power of this model by simultaneously fitting measured data for 61 modes of a GaN/NbN/sapphire HBAR over a span of 1 GHz, and extracting modal parameters such as quality factors and coupling coefficients. We show that this new model is compact and yet scalable: by leveraging the inherent internal relationships in an HBAR, the model can be easily expanded to include multiple transducer overtones and envelopes, multiple distinct transducers, and spurious modes. In addition to fitting measured datasets, the new model can also be used to easily analyze various perturbations to the nominal state of the HBAR. We expect the new model to be useful for the design of classical HBAR-based oscillators, filters, and sensors, and for the integration of HBARs into quantum circuits.</description>

      <title>Distributed Time-Varying Optimization via Unbiased Extremum Seeking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21814v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel distributed optimization framework that addresses time-varying optimization problems without requiring explicit derivative information of the objective functions. Traditional distributed methods often rely on derivative computations, limiting their applicability when only real-time objective function measurements are available. Leveraging unbiased extremum seeking, we develop continuous-time algorithms that utilize local measurements and neighbor-shared data to collaboratively track time-varying optima. Key advancements include compatibility with directed communication graphs, customizable convergence rates (asymptotic, exponential, or prescribed-time), and the ability to handle dynamically evolving objectives. By integrating chirpy probing signals with time-varying frequencies, our unified framework achieves accelerated convergence while maintaining stability under mild assumptions. Theoretical guarantees are established through Lie bracket averaging and Lyapunov-based analysis, with linear matrix inequality conditions ensuring rigorous convergence. Numerical simulations validate the effectiveness of the algorithms.</description>

      <title>Effect of Gait Design on Proprioceptive Sensing of Terrain Properties in a Quadrupedal Robot</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22065v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In-situ robotic exploration is an important tool for advancing knowledge of geological processes that describe the Earth and other Planetary bodies. To inform and enhance operations for these roving laboratories, it is imperative to understand the terramechanical properties of their environments, especially for traversing on loose, deformable substrates. Recent research suggested that legged robots with direct-drive and low-gear ratio actuators can sensitively detect external forces, and therefore possess the potential to measure terrain properties with their legs during locomotion, providing unprecedented sampling speed and density while accessing terrains previously too risky to sample. This paper explores these ideas by investigating the impact of gait on proprioceptive terrain sensing accuracy, particularly comparing a sensing-oriented gait, Crawl N' Sense, with a locomotion-oriented gait, Trot-Walk. Each gait's ability to measure the strength and texture of deformable substrate is quantified as the robot locomotes over a laboratory transect consisting of a rigid surface, loose sand, and loose sand with synthetic surface crusts. Our results suggest that with both the sensing-oriented crawling gait and locomotion-oriented trot gait, the robot can measure a consistent difference in the strength (in terms of penetration resistance) between the low- and high-resistance substrates; however, the locomotion-oriented trot gait contains larger magnitude and variance in measurements. Furthermore, the slower crawl gait can detect brittle ruptures of the surface crusts with significantly higher accuracy than the faster trot gait. Our results offer new insights that inform legged robot "sensing during locomotion" gait design and planning for scouting the terrain and producing scientific measurements on other worlds to advance our understanding of their geology and formation.</description>

      <title>Safe-by-Design: Approximate Nonlinear Model Predictive Control with Real Time Feasibility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22422v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper establishes relationships between continuous-time, receding horizon, nonlinear model predictive control (MPC) and control Lyapunov and control barrier functions (CLF/CBF). We show that, if the cost function "behaves well" for points in the terminal set, then the optimal value function and the feasible set, respectively, define a compatible CLF/CBF pair on the MPC's region of attraction. We then proceed to prove that any approximation of the value function and the feasible set also define a CLF/CBF pair, as long as those approximations satisfy the same "well behavedness" condition; and that a feasible state feedback can be computed by solving an infinitesimal version of the MPC problem. This methodology permits the formulation of continuous-time small-sized quadratic programs for feedback and enables approximate solutions of the nonlinear model predictive controller with theoretical safety and convergence guarantee. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach when compared to other constrained control techniques through numerical experiments for nonlinear constrained spacecraft control.</description>

      <title>Gaussian-Process-based Adaptive Tracking Control with Dynamic Active Learning for Autonomous Ground Vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14672v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article proposes an active-learning-based adaptive trajectory tracking control method for autonomous ground vehicles to compensate for modeling errors and unmodeled dynamics. The nominal vehicle model is decoupled into lateral and longitudinal subsystems, which are augmented with online Gaussian Processes (GPs), using measurement data. The estimated mean functions of the GPs are used to construct a feedback compensator, which, together with an LPV state feedback controller designed for the nominal system, gives the adaptive control structure. To assist exploration of the dynamics, the paper proposes a new, dynamic active learning method to collect the most informative samples to accelerate the training process. To analyze the performance of the overall learning tool-chain provided controller, a novel iterative, counterexample-based algorithm is proposed for calculating the induced L2 gain between the reference trajectory and the tracking error. The analysis can be executed for a set of possible realizations of the to-be-controlled system, giving robust performance certificate of the learning method under variation of the vehicle dynamics. The efficiency of the proposed control approach is shown on a high-fidelity physics simulator and in real experiments using a 1/10 scale F1TENTH electric car.</description>

      <title>Linear Phase Balancing Scheme using Voltage Unbalance Sensitivities in Multi-phase Power Distribution Grids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00519v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Power distribution networks, especially in North America, are often unbalanced due to the mix of single-, two- and three-phase networks as well as due to the high penetration of single-phase devices at the distribution level such as electric vehicle (EV) chargers and single-phase solar plants. However, the network operator must adhere to the voltage unbalance levels within the limits specified by IEEE, IEC, and NEMA standards for the safety of the equipment as well as the efficiency of the network operation. Existing works have proposed active and reactive power control in the network to minimize imbalances. However, these optimization problems are highly nonlinear and nonconvex due to the inherent non-linearity of unbalanced metrics and power-flow equations. In this work, we propose a linearization approach of unbalance metrics such as voltage unbalance factors (VUF), phase voltage unbalance rate (PVUR), and line voltage unbalance rate (LVUR) using the first order Taylor's approximation. This linearization is then applied to the phase balancing control scheme; it is formulated as a feedback approach where the linearization is updated successively after the active/reactive control setpoint has been actuated and shows improvement in voltage imbalances. We demonstrate the application of the proposed scheme on a standard IEEE benchmark test case, demonstrating its effectiveness.</description>

      <title>An approach to the LQG/LTR design problem with specifications for finite-dimensional SISO control systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14952v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This is an expository paper which discusses an approach to the LQG/LTR design problem for finite-dimensional SISO control systems. The approach is based on the utilisation of weighting augmentation for incorporating design specifications into the framework of the LTR technique for LQG compensator design. The LQG compensator is to simultaneously meet given analytical low- and high-frequency design specifications expressed in terms of desirable sensitivity and controller noise sensitivity functions. The paper is aimed at nonspecialists and, in particular, practitioners in finite-dimensional LQG theory interested in the design of feedback compensators for closed-loop performance and robustness shaping of SISO control systems in realistic situations. The proposed approach is illustrated by a detailed numerical example: the torque control of a geared DC motor with an elastically mounted output shaft.</description>

      <title>The need for and feasibility of alternative ground robots to traverse sandy and rocky extraterrestrial terrain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.11984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2201.11984v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Robotic spacecraft have helped expand our reach for many planetary exploration missions. Most ground mobile planetary exploration robots use wheeled or modified wheeled platforms. Although extraordinarily successful at completing intended mission goals, because of the limitations of wheeled locomotion, they have been largely limited to benign, solid terrain and avoided extreme terrain with loose soil/sand and large rocks. Unfortunately, such challenging terrain is often scientifically interesting for planetary geology. Although many animals traverse such terrain at ease, robots have not matched their performance and robustness. This is in major part due to a lack of fundamental understanding of how effective locomotion can be generated from controlled interaction with complex terrain on the same level of flight aerodynamics and underwater vehicle hydrodynamics. Early fundamental understanding of legged and limbless locomotor-ground interaction has already enabled stable and efficient bio-inspired robot locomotion on relatively flat ground with small obstacles. Recent progress in the new field of terradynamics of locomotor-terrain interaction begins to reveal the principles of bio-inspired locomotion on loose soil/sand and over large obstacles. Multi-legged and limbless platforms using terradynamics insights hold the promise for serving as robust alternative platforms for traversing extreme extraterrestrial terrain and expanding our reach in planetary exploration.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Policy Learning to Additional Tasks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.15193v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper develops a policy learning method for tuning a pre-trained policy to adapt to additional tasks without altering the original task. A method named Adaptive Policy Gradient (APG) is proposed in this paper, which combines Bellman's principle of optimality with the policy gradient approach to improve the convergence rate. This paper provides theoretical analysis which guarantees the convergence rate and sample complexity of $\mathcal{O}(1/T)$ and $\mathcal{O}(1/\epsilon)$, respectively, where $T$ denotes the number of iterations and $\epsilon$ denotes the accuracy of the resulting stationary policy. Furthermore, several challenging numerical simulations, including cartpole, lunar lander, and robot arm, are provided to show that APG obtains similar performance compared to existing deterministic policy gradient methods while utilizing much less data and converging at a faster rate.</description>

      <title>Divide, Conquer and Verify: Improving Symbolic Execution Performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.03598v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Symbolic Execution is a formal method that can be used to verify the behavior of computer programs and detect software vulnerabilities. Compared to other testing methods such as fuzzing, Symbolic Execution has the advantage of providing formal guarantees about the program. However, despite advances in performance in recent years, Symbolic Execution is too slow to be applied to real-world software. This is primarily caused by the \emph{path explosion problem} as well as by the computational complexity of SMT solving. In this paper, we present a divide-and-conquer approach for symbolic execution by executing individual slices and later combining the side effects. This way, the overall problem size is kept small, reducing the impact of computational complexity on large problems.</description>

      <title>GNN-DT: Graph Neural Network Enhanced Decision Transformer for Efficient Optimization in Dynamic Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01778v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods used for solving real-world optimization problems often involve dynamic state-action spaces, larger scale, and sparse rewards, leading to significant challenges in convergence, scalability, and efficient exploration of the solution space. This study introduces GNN-DT, a novel Decision Transformer (DT) architecture that integrates Graph Neural Network (GNN) embedders with a novel residual connection between input and output tokens crucial for handling dynamic environments. By learning from previously collected trajectories, GNN-DT tackles the sparse rewards limitations of online RL algorithms and delivers high-quality solutions in real-time. We evaluate GNN-DT on the complex electric vehicle (EV) charging optimization problem and prove that its performance is superior and requires significantly fewer training trajectories, thus improving sample efficiency compared to existing DT and offline RL baselines. Furthermore, GNN-DT exhibits robust generalization to unseen environments and larger action spaces, addressing a critical gap in prior offline and online RL approaches.</description>

      <title>Optimal Behavior Planning for Implicit Communication using a Probabilistic Vehicle-Pedestrian Interaction Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15098v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In interactions between automated vehicles (AVs) and crossing pedestrians, modeling implicit vehicle communication is crucial. In this work, we present a combined prediction and planning approach that allows to consider the influence of the planned vehicle behavior on a pedestrian and predict a pedestrian's reaction. We plan the behavior by solving two consecutive optimal control problems (OCPs) analytically, using variational calculus. We perform a validation step that assesses whether the planned vehicle behavior is adequate to trigger a certain pedestrian reaction, which accounts for the closed-loop characteristics of prediction and planning influencing each other. In this step, we model the influence of the planned vehicle behavior on the pedestrian using a probabilistic behavior acceptance model that returns an estimate for the crossing probability. The probabilistic modeling of the pedestrian reaction facilitates considering the pedestrian's costs, thereby improving cooperative behavior planning. We demonstrate the performance of the proposed approach in simulated vehicle-pedestrian interactions with varying initial settings and highlight the decision making capabilities of the planning approach.</description>

      <title>On the Sharp Input-Output Analysis of Nonlinear Systems under Adversarial Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11688v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with learning the input-output mapping of general nonlinear dynamical systems. While the existing literature focuses on Gaussian inputs and benign disturbances, we significantly broaden the scope of admissible control inputs and allow correlated, nonzero-mean, adversarial disturbances. With our reformulation as a linear combination of basis functions, we prove that the $\ell_2$-norm estimator overcomes the challenges as long as the probability that the system is under adversarial attack at a given time is smaller than a certain threshold. We provide an estimation error bound that decays with the input memory length and prove its optimality by constructing a problem instance that suffers from the same bound under adversarial attacks. Our work provides a sharp input-output analysis for a generic nonlinear and partially observed system under significantly generalized assumptions compared to existing works.</description>
