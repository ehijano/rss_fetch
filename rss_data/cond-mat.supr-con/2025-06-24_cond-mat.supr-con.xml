      <title>Robustness of Majorana modes to potential disorder in Fe chains on a superconducting Rashba alloy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17414v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Majorana modes offer great potential for fault-tolerant quantum computation due to their topological protection. However, for superconductor-semiconductor nanowire hybrids, intrinsic disorder makes the unambiguous detection of Majorana modes difficult. Here, we construct 1D spin chains from individual Fe atoms on the Rashba surface alloy BiAg2/Ag(111) with proximity-induced superconductivity from a Nb(110) substrate. While the Fe chains exhibit perfect crystalline order, we observe nano-scale potential disorder of the BiAg2/Ag(111)/Nb(110) heterostructure by scanning tunneling microscopy. However, this does not prevent the emergence of zero-energy modes at both ends of the Fe chains, in agreement with tight-binding calculations showing that they are only found in the topologically non-trivial regime of the phase diagram. These Majorana modes are indeed robust against potential disorder.</description>

      <title>Field-Free Superconducting Diode Enabled by Geometric Asymmetry and Perpendicular Magnetization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17651v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The superconducting diode effect (SDE)- manifested as directional, dissipationless supercurrents - is pivotal for realizing energy-efficient superconducting logic and memory technologies. Achieving high-efficiency SDE without external magnetic fields, however, remains a fundamental challenge. Here, we report a strongly enhanced, field-free SDE in Pt/Co/Nb heterostructures, enabled by the interplay of engineered geometric asymmetry and stray fields from a perpendicularly magnetized Co layer. This configuration promotes directional vortex entry and spatially selective pinning, yielding diode efficiencies that exceed all previously reported field-free values. Temperature- and field-dependent transport measurements, supported by micromagnetic simulations, reveal that the enhanced nonreciprocity stems from three cooperative mechanisms: asymmetric vortex entry, localized magnetic pinning, and Lorentz-force imbalance. These findings establish a scalable, CMOS-compatible platform for high-performance superconducting rectifiers, offering new opportunities for cryogenic spintronics and quantum electronics.</description>

      <title>Vertex corrections to nonlinear photoinduced currents in 2D superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17714v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The emergence of a rectified steady-state supercurrent as a response to the photoexcited current of the quasiparticles constitutes the concept of a superconducting photodiode. This phenomenon occurs in a two-dimensional thin superconducting film with a built-in DC supercurrent that is exposed to a circularly polarized external electromagnetic field. The flow of a Cooper-pair condensate, resulting as a second-order photo-response in a direction transverse to the initially built-in supercurrent, represents a superconducting counterpart to the photogalvanic effect. In this paper, we examine the photodiode supercurrent by restoring gauge invariance within the mean-field BCS framework. To achieve this, we derive an impurity-sensitive BCS-interaction-induced correction to the vertex function by performing self-consistent calculations within the Keldysh Green's function technique. The resulting photodiode current can be utilized for spectroscopic analysis of typical relaxation times in superconducting films.</description>

      <title>Influence of nanostructuring through high-pressure torsion (HPT) on superconductivity of a high-entropy alloy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17850v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-entropy alloys (HEAs) have emerged as favorable choices for different applications, including superconductors. The present work examines the impact of nanostructuring via high-pressure torsion (HPT) on the superconducting properties of the equiatomic TiZrHfNbTa HEA. Structural characterization reveals a progressive refinement of grain size and increased dislocation density, together with partial phase transformation to an {\omega} phase with HPT processing. Magnetic susceptibility and magnetization measurements indicate a systematic enhancement in the superconducting transition temperature (from $T_c =$ 6.2 K to 7.2 K) and critical magnetic field, as well as the stabilization of the superconductivity state by HPT processing. The improvement of superconducting properties is attributed to microstructural modifications such as grain boundary density, defect generation and phase transformations, and their impact on vortex pinning, quantum confinement and electron scattering. The results suggest that nanostructuring through severe plastic deformation provides an appropriate route to optimize superconducting properties in high-entropy superconductors.</description>

      <title>Threshold Displacement Energies of Oxygen in YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_7$: A Multi-Physics Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17976v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neutron bombardment of high temperature superconducting (HTS) magnets may compromise the integrity of the magnetic confinement in future fusion reactors. The amount of damage produced by a single neutron can be predicted from the threshold displacement energies (TDE) of the constituent ions in the HTS materials, such as the Rare Earth Cuperates. Therefore, in this work a Multiphysics simulation approach is adopted to determine the threshold displacement energies for oxygen in YBa2Cu3O7. Classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are employed to determine statistically representative TDEs for all four oxygen sites and these results are validated using Born-Oppenheimer MD employing forces derived from Density Functional Theory (DFT). The simulations were performed at the operational temperature (25 K) and the temperature of existing neutron irradiation studies (360 K) enabling a discussion about the relevance of this data. Overall, these findings enhance our understanding of radiation-induced damage in HTS materials and provide data that can be incorporated into higher order models offering critical insights into shielding design and magnet longevity.</description>

      <title>Pairing-induced Momentum-space Magnetism and Its Implication In Optical Anomalous Hall Effect In Chiral Superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The intrinsic mechanisms of the magneto-optical Kerr signal in chiral superconductors often involve multi-orbital degree of freedom. Here by considering a generic single-orbital and spinful Hamiltonian, we generalize the Onsager's relation to obtain the necessary conditions for the optical anomalous Hall effect. Using the down-folding method, we identify two types of effective momentum-space magnetism responsible for the optical anomalous Hall conductivity from non-unitary and unitary pairing potentials respectively. The former is due to the angular momentum of Cooper pair, while the latter requires the participation of the spin-orbit coupling in the normal state and has been largely overlooked previously. Using concrete examples, we show that the unitary pairing can lead to both ferromagnetism and complicated antiferromagnetic spin texture in the momentum space, resulting in an in-plane optical anomalous Hall effect with the magnetism parallel to the Hall-deflection plane. Our work reveals the essential role of spin degree of freedom in the optical anomalous Hall effect.</description>

      <title>Superfluid stiffness bounds in time-reversal symmetric superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18081v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum geometry has been shown to make an important contribution to the superfluid stiffness of superconductors, especially for flat-band systems such as moir\'e materials. In this work we use mean-field theory to derive an expression for the superfluid stiffness of time-reversal symmetric superconductors at zero temperature by computing the energy of the mean-field ground state as a function of pairing momentum. We show that the quantum geometric contribution to superfluid stiffness is a consequence of broken Galilean invariance in the interaction Hamiltonian, arising from momentum-dependent form factors related to the momentum dependence of Bloch states. The effects of broken Galilean invariance are not fully parametrized by the quantum metric considered in previous work. We obtain general lower and upper bounds that apply to both continuum and lattice models and present numerical calculations of the precise value in several important cases. The superfluid stiffness of superconductivity in a Landau level saturates the lower bound and the superfluid stiffness of the other cases we consider is close to the general lower bound we derive. In multilayer rhombohedral graphene the geometric contribution is shown not to be the dominant contribution to the superfluid stiffness, despite the flat band behavior in the vicinity of the Fermi level. Finally, assuming contact interaction and uniform pairing, we show that the superfluid stiffness is proportional to the ``minimal quantum metric" introduced in previous work. We provide a continuum version of the minimal quantum metric and explain its physical origin.</description>

      <title>Thermal phase slips in superconducting films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A dissipationless supercurrent state in superconductors can be destroyed by thermal fluctuations. Thermally activated phase slips provide a finite resistance of the sample and are responsible for dark counts in superconducting single photon detectors. The activation barrier for a phase slip is determined by a space-dependent saddle-point (instanton) configuration of the order parameter. In the one-dimensional wire geometry, such a saddle point has been analytically obtained by Langer and Ambegaokar in the vicinity of the critical temperature, $T_c$, and for arbitrary bias currents below the critical current $I_c$. In the two-dimensional geometry of a superconducting strip, which is relevant for photon detection, the situation is much more complicated. Depending on the ratio $I/I_c$, several types of saddle-point configurations have been proposed, with their energies being obtained numerically. We demonstrate that the saddle-point configuration for an infinite superconducting film at $I\to I_c$ is described by the exactly integrable Boussinesq equation solved by Hirota's method. The instanton size is $L_x\sim\xi(1-I/I_c)^{-1/4}$ along the current and $L_y\sim\xi(1-I/I_c)^{-1/2}$ perpendicular to the current, where $\xi$ is the Ginzburg-Landau coherence length. The activation energy for thermal phase slips scales as $\Delta F^\text{2D}\propto (1-I/I_c)^{3/4}$. For sufficiently wide strips of width $w\gg L_y$, a half-instanton is formed near the boundary, with the activation energy being 1/2 of $\Delta F^\text{2D}$.</description>

      <title>Probing d-wave superconducting gap of high-$T_\mathrm{c}$ cuprate $\mathrm{Bi}_2\mathrm{Sr}_2\mathrm{Ca}_2\mathrm{Cu}_3\mathrm{O}_{10+\delta}$ by resonant inelastic X-ray scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18363v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The superconducting gap is a characteristic feature of high-T$_c$ superconductors and provides crucial information on the pairing mechanism underlying high-temperature superconductivity. Here, we employ high-resolution resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (RIXS) at the Cu $L_3$-edge to investigate the superconducting gap in the overdoped cuprate $\mathrm{Bi}_2\mathrm{Sr}_2\mathrm{Ca}_2\mathrm{Cu}_3\mathrm{O}_{10+\delta}$ ($T_\mathrm{c}$ = 107 K). By analyzing antisymmetrized, temperature-dependent RIXS spectra over a range of in-plane momentum transfers, we observe a clear suppression of low-energy spectral weight below T$_c$, indicative of superconducting gap formation. This suppression is most pronounced at small momentum transfers ($|\boldsymbol{q}_\parallel| \leq 0.18$ r.l.u.) and corresponds to a gap size of approximately 2$\Delta_0 \sim$ 130 meV. Comparison with theoretical calculations of the momentum-dependent charge susceptibility supports a d-wave symmetry of the superconducting gap, while an isotropic s-wave gap fails to reproduce key experimental features. These findings establish RIXS as a powerful, bulk-sensitive probe of superconducting gap symmetry and highlight its utility for studying materials beyond the reach of surface-sensitive techniques such as ARPES and STM.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic Proximity Effect: Superconducting Magnonics and Beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18502v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The exchange interaction at interfaces between superconductors (SCs) and ferromagnets (FMs) has been a central topic in condensed matter physics for many decades, starting with the prediction of exotic phases such as the Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov states and leading to the discovery of triplet superconductivity. This review focuses on new phenomena in SC$|$FM heterostructures caused by the \textit{non-contact dipolar interaction} between magnons, i.e., the quanta of spin wave excitations in the ferromagnet, and the superconducting order. A universal non-relativistic spin-orbit coupling locks the polarization and momentum of their evanescent stray magnetic fields and leads to chiral screening by proximate superconductors. The interaction-induced hybrid quasiparticles are magnon-Meissner collective modes, magnon-cooparon, Josephson plasmonic modes, and nodal magnon-photon polaritons. Superconducting and normal metallic gates modulate and control the magnetodipolar interaction and thereby magnetization and energy transport at interfaces and in thin films.</description>

      <title>Finite-momentum superconductivity from chiral bands in twisted MoTe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18886v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A recent experiment has reported unconventional superconductivity in twisted bilayer MoTe$_2$, emerging from a normal state that exhibits a finite anomalous Hall effect -- a signature of intrinsic chirality. Motivated by this discovery, we construct a continuum model for twisted MoTe$_2$ constrained by lattice symmetries from first-principles calculations that captures the moir\'{e}-induced inversion symmetry breaking even in the absence of a displacement field. Building on this model, we show that repulsive interactions give rise to finite-momentum superconductivity via the Kohn-Luttinger mechanism in this chiral moir\'{e} system. Remarkably, the finite-momentum superconducting state can arise solely from internal symmetry breaking of the moir\'{e} superlattice, differentiating it from previously studied cases that require external fields. It further features a nonreciprocal quasiparticle dispersion and an intrinsic superconducting diode effect. Our results highlight a novel route to unconventional superconducting states in twisted transition metal dichalcogenides moir\'{e} systems, driven entirely by intrinsic symmetry-breaking effects.</description>

      <title>Electrostatic control of quantum phases in KTaO3-based planar constrictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18894v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional electron gases (2DEGs) formed at complex oxide interfaces offer a unique platform to engineer quantum nanostructures. However, scalable fabrication of locally addressable devices in these materials remains challenging. Here, we demonstrate an efficient fabrication approach by patterning narrow constrictions in a superconducting KTaO3-based heterostructure. The constrictions are individually tunable via the coplanar side gates formed within the same 2DEG plane. Our technique leverages the high dielectric permittivity of KTaO3 (epsilon_r ~ 5000) to achieve strong electrostatic modulation of the superconducting 2DEG. Transport measurements through the constriction reveal a range of transport regimes: Within the superconducting state, we demonstrate efficient modulation of the critical current and Berezinskii Kosterlitz Thouless (BKT) transition temperature at the weak link. Further tuning of the gate voltage reveals an unexpectedly regular Coulomb blockade pattern. All of these states are achievable with a side gate voltage |V_SG| &lt; 1 V. The fabrication process is scalable and versatile, enabling a platform both to make superconducting field-effect transistors and to study a wide array of physical phenomena present at complex oxide interfaces.</description>

      <title>Refining Tc Prediction in Hydrides via Symbolic-Regression-Enhanced Electron-Localization-Function-Based Descriptors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17456v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hydrogen-based materials are able to possess extremely high superconducting critical temperatures, \tc s, due to hydrogen's low atomic mass and strong electron-phonon interaction. Recently, a descriptor based on the Electron Localization Function (ELF) has enabled the rapid estimation of the \tc\ of hydrogen-containing compounds from electronic networking properties, but its applicability has been limited by the small size and homogeneity of the training dataset used. Herein, the model is re-examined compiling a publicly available combined dataset of 244 binary and ternary hydride superconductors. Our analysis shows that though ELF-based networking remains a valuable descriptor, its predictive power declines with increasing compositional complexity. However, by introducing the molecularity index, defined as the highest value of the ELF at which two hydrogen atoms connect, and applying symbolic regression, the accuracy of the predictions can be substantially enhanced. These results establish a more robust framework for assessing superconductivity in hydride materials, facilitating accelerated screening of novel candidates through integration with crystal structure prediction methods or high-throughput searches.</description>

Abstract: Exchanging energy below the superconducting gap introduces quasiparticle energy distributions in superconducting quantum circuits, which will be responsible for their decoherence. This study examines the impact of quasiparticle energy on the performance of NbN superconducting microwave coplanar waveguide resonators on silicon chips. We measured the resonance frequency and internal quality factor in response to temperature sweeps to evaluate the effect of quasiparticle dynamics. Moreover, by calculating the complex conductivity of the NbN film, we identified the contribution of quasiparticle density to the experimental results.</description>

      <title>Bimodal distribution of delay times and splitting of the zero-bias conductance peak in a double-barrier normal-superconductor junction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18515v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We formulate a scattering theory of the proximity effect in a weakly disordered SININ junction (S = superconductor, I = insulating barrier, N = normal metal). This allows to relate the conductance and density of states of the junction to the scattering times $\tau$ (eigenvalues of the Wigner-Smith time-delay matrix). The probability density $P(\tau)$ has two peaks, at a short time $\tau_{\rm min}$ and a late time $\tau_{\rm max}$. The density of states at the Fermi level is the geometric mean of the two times. The splitting of the zero-bias conductance peak is given by $\hbar/\tau_{\rm max}$.</description>

      <title>Atomic and bond polarization causing strong screening of short-range Coulomb interactions and its effect in cuprate superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00787v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a novel and efficient real space, semiclassical model of electric polarization with general applicability to any system in which screening plays an important role. This model includes the effects of both atomic and bond polarizabilities, the latter originating from the modification of local bond charge transfer energies induced by polarizing charges. The nonlinear interference of multiple polarization clouds and the emergence of local field effects are highlighted as key phenomena highly influencing the short-range screening of the Coulomb interaction. As a representative system to showcase this model, the screened interaction between doped holes in the CuO$_2$ planes of cuprate high-temperature superconductors is investigated. This leads to the emergence of striking direction-dependent short-range minima in their Coulomb repulsion, which can strongly reduce the need for retardation effects and allow for an enhancement of the attractive interaction resulting from the exchange of bosons between two electrons or holes. This in turn enhances T$_C$, shortens the Cooper pair coherence length and supports the materialization of the pseudogap phase anisotropy observed in many high-T$_C$ superconductors.</description>

      <title>Does the Meissner effect violate the second law of thermodynamics? Comment on "The Law of Entropy Increase and the Meissner Effect" by A. Nikulov</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14704v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In Entropy 24, 83 (2022) [1], titled "The Law of Entropy Increase and the Meissner Effect", A. Nikulov claims that the Meissner effect exhibited by type I superconductors violates the second law of thermodynamics. Contrary to this claim, I show that the Meissner effect is consistent with the second law of thermodynamics provided that a mechanism exists for the supercurrent to start and stop without generation of Joule heat. The theory of hole superconductivity provides such a mechanism, the conventional theory of superconductivity does not. It requires the existence of hole carriers in the normal state of the system.</description>

      <title>Pairing phase diagram for electron-doped cuprates in the square-lattice $t-U-V$ Hubbard model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07079v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by significant discrepancies between experimental observations of electron-doped cuprates and numerical results of the Hubbard model, we investigate the role of nearest-neighbor (NN) electron interactions $V$ by studying the $t-U-V$ model on square lattices. Upon doping $\delta$= 0.153, by using constrained path quantum Monte Carlo (CPQMC) method, we find that NN electron attraction $V$ can notably drive an exotic $p$-wave spin-triplet pairing, while the NN electron repulsion $V$ will suppress the $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave ($d$-wave) pairing and triggers the $d_{xy}$-wave pairing. Especially in the intermediate coupling regime, as NN repulsion increases, the intensity of $d_{xy}$-wave pairing also increases, further suppressing the presence of $d$-wave pairing, which may help explain the notable suppression of $d$-wave pairing in electron-doped cuprate superconductors. Besides the pairing phase, we also find that the NN electron attraction $V$ has no significant effect on spin density wave (SDW) and charge density wave (CDW), but repulsion $V$ significantly enhanced CDW and suppressed SDW. Our study suggests the $t-U-V$ Hubbard model can serve as the minimal model to capture the essential physics of the electron-doped cuprates.</description>

      <title>Frustrated Frustration of Arrays with Four-Terminal Nb-Pt-Nb Josephson Junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14423v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the frustration pattern of a square lattice with in-situ fabricated Nb-Pt-Nb four-terminal Josephson junctions. The four-terminal geometry gives rise to a checker board pattern of alternating fluxes f, f' piercing the plaquettes, which stabilizes the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition even at irrational flux quanta per plaquette, due to an unequal repartition of integer flux sum f+f' into alternating plaquettes. This type of frustrated frustration manifests as a beating pattern of the dc resistance, with state configurations at the resistance dips gradually changing between the conventional zero-flux and half-flux states. Hence, the four-terminal Josephson junction array offers a promising platform to study previously unexplored flux and vortex configurations, and provides an estimate on the spatial expansion of the four-terminal Josephson junction central weak link area.</description>

      <title>Directional driving of vortex lines with oscillating magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09321v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The possibility of driving vortex lines with an oscillating magnetic field could be useful in many applications. For example, it can be used for the removal of undesired trapped flux from contactless elements of superconducting devices. We investigate the dynamics of vortex lines in a superconducting film with a ratchet thickness profile driven by an oscillating magnetic field applied parallel to the film. We numerically simulate the dynamics of a single flux line modeled as an elastic string with a variable length. We explore the behavior for different frequencies and amplitudes of the oscillating magnetic field and find several dynamic regimes. For moderate frequencies, the average velocity is finite only within specific amplitude ranges. A notable feature is the presence of extended velocity plateaus, which correspond to regimes when the line moves by integer multiples of the spatial period $w$ during integer multiples of the time period $T$. The transitions to these plateau states are rather steep, especially at low frequencies. The plateau at velocity $w/T$ dominates at intermediate frequencies but vanishes at high frequencies. The onset field amplitude of finite velocity nonmonotonically depends on the frequency and passes through a minimum at a certain frequency value. At low frequencies, the velocity exceeds $w/T$ and progressively increases with the amplitude. These findings provide valuable insights into the dynamic behavior of vortex lines driven by oscillating magnetic field in patterned superconducting films, offering potential pathways for controlling the magnetic flux in superconducting devices.</description>

      <title>Multiple-Nanowire Superconducting Quantum Interference Devices: Critical Currents, Symmetries, and Vorticity Stability Regions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23095v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An ordinary superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) contains two weak links connected in parallel. We model a multiple-wire SQUID (MW-SQUID), generalized in two ways. First, the number of weak links, which are provided by parallel superconducting nanowires, is larger than two. Second, the current-phase relationship of each nanowire is assumed linear, which is typical for a homogeneous superconducting thin wire. For such MW-SQUIDs, our model predicts that the critical current ($I_c$) is a multi-valued function of the magnetic field. We also calculate vorticity stability regions (VSR), i.e., regions in the current-magnetic field plane in which, for a given distribution of vortices, the currents in all wires are below their critical values, so the vortices do not move between the cells. The VSRs have rhombic shapes in the case of two-wire SQUIDS and have more complicated shapes in the case of many nanowires. We present a classification of such VSRs and determine conditions under which VSR is disjoint, leading to 100\% supercurrent modulation and quantum phase transitions. According to the model, the maximum critical current curves obey $IB$ symmetry, while each VSR obeys $IBV$ symmetry. The model predicts conditions at which MW-SQUID exhibits a perfect diode effect in which the critical current of one polarity is zero while it is not zero for the opposite polarity of the bias current. We also provide a classification of the stability regions produced by (1) completely symmetric, (2) phase disordered, (3) position disordered, (4) critical current disordered, and (5) completely disordered multi-wire SQUIDs.</description>

      <title>Superconducting Proximity Effect in Two-Dimensional Hole Gases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04084v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Technology involving hybrid superconductor-semiconductor materials is a promising avenue for engineering quantum devices for information storage, manipulation, and transmission. Proximity-induced superconducting correlations are an essential part of such devices. While the proximity effect in the conduction band of common semiconductors is well understood, its manifestation in confined hole gases, realized for instance in germanium, is an active area of research. Lower-dimensional hole-based systems, particularly in germanium, are emerging as an attractive platform for a variety of solid-state quantum devices, due to their combination of efficient spin and charge control and long coherence times. The recent experimental realization of the proximity effect in germanium thus calls for a theoretical description that is tailored to hole gases. In this work, we propose a simple model to describe proximity-induced superconductivity in two-dimensional hole gases, incorporating both the heavy-hole (HH) and light-hole (LH) bands. We start from the Luttinger-Kohn model, introduce three parameters that characterize hopping across the superconductor-semiconductor interface, and derive explicit intraband and interband effective pairing terms for the HH and LH bands. Unlike previous approaches, our theory provides a quantitative relationship between induced pairings and interface properties. Restricting our general model to an experimentally relevant case where only the HH band crosses the chemical potential, we predict the coexistence of $s$-wave and $d$-wave singlet pairings, along with triplet-type pairings, and modified Zeeman and Rashba spin-orbit couplings. Our results thus present a starting point for theoretical modeling of quantum devices based on proximitized hole gases, fueling further progress in quantum technology.</description>

      <title>Theory of superconducting proximity effect in hole-based hybrid semiconductor-superconductor devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00088v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hybrid superconductor-semiconductor systems have received a great deal of attention in the last few years because of their potential for quantum engineering, including novel qubits and topological devices. The proximity effect, the process by which the semiconductor inherits superconducting correlations, is an essential physical mechanism of such hybrids. Recent experiments have demonstrated the proximity effect in hole-based semiconductors, but, in contrast to electrons, the precise mechanism by which the hole bands acquire superconducting correlations remains an open question. In addition, hole spins exhibit a complex strong spin-orbit interaction, with largely anisotropic responses to electric and magnetic fields, further motivating the importance of understanding the interplay between such effects and the proximity effect. In this work, we analyze this physics with focus on germanium-based two-dimensional gases. Specifically, we develop an effective theory supported by full numerics, allowing us to extract various analytical expressions and predict different types of superconducting correlations including non-standard forms of singlet and triplet pairing mechanisms with non-trivial momentum dependence; as well as different Zeeman and Rashba spin-orbit contributions. This, together with their precise dependence on electric and magnetic fields, allows us to make specific experimental predictions, including the emergence of f-type superconductivity, Bogoliubov Fermi surfaces, and gapless regimes caused by large in-plane magnetic fields.</description>
