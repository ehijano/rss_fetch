      <title>Hedge Fund Index Rules and Construction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15925v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A Hedge Fund Index is very useful for tracking the performance of hedge fund investments, especially the timing of fund redemption. This paper presents a methodology for constructing a hedge fund index that is more like a quantitative fund of fund, rather than a weighted sum of a number of early replicable market indices, which are re-balanced periodically. The constructed index allows hedge funds to directly hedge their exposures to index-linked products. That is important given that hedge funds are an asset class with reduced transparency, and the returns are traditionally difficult to replicate using liquid instruments.</description>

      <title>Determinants of Uruguay's Real Effective Exchange Rate: A Mundell-Fleming Model Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16452v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study examines the factors influencing the short-term real effective exchange rate (REER) in Uruguay by applying an extended Mundell-Fleming model. Analyzing the impact of the US lending rate (USLR), money supply (M2), inflation (CPI), and the world interest rate (WIR), the paper uses a linear regression model with Newey-West standard errors. Key findings reveal that an increase in the USLR, CPI, and M2 is associated with a depreciation of the REER. In contrast, WIR shows no significant impact. These findings are consistent with the theoretical expectations of the Mundell-Fleming model regarding open economies under floating exchange rates. Therefore, authorities should tighten monetary policy, control inflation, adjust fiscal strategies, and boost exports in response to Peso depreciation.</description>

      <title>The Costs of Competition in Distributing Scarce Research Funds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Research funding systems are not isolated systems - they are embedded in a larger scientific system with an enormous influence on the system. This paper aims to analyze the allocation of competitive research funding from different perspectives: How reliable are decision processes for funding? What are the economic costs of competitive funding? How does competition for funds affect doing risky research? How do competitive funding environments affect scientists themselves, and which ethical issues must be considered? We attempt to identify gaps in our knowledge of research funding systems; we propose recommendations for policymakers and funding agencies, including empirical experiments of decision processes and the collection of data on these processes. With our recommendations we hope to contribute to developing improved ways of organizing research funding.</description>

      <title>Economic DAO Governance: A Contestable Control Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16980v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we propose a new form of DAO governance that uses a sequential auction mechanism to overcome entrenched control issues that have emerged for DAOs by creating a regime of temporary contestable control. The mechanism avoids potential public choice problems inherent in voting approaches but at the same time provides a vehicle that can enhance and secure value than inheres to DAO voting and other DAO non-market governance procedures. It is robust to empty voting and is code feasible. It facilitates the ability of DAOs to meet their normative and operational goals in the face of diverse regulatory approaches. Designed to shift control to the party with the most promising business plan, at the same time it distributes surplus in a way that tends to promote investment by other parties.</description>

      <title>Price and Payoff Autocorrelations in a Multi-Period Consumption-Based Asset Pricing Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.07506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.07506v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper highlights the hidden dependence of the basic pricing equation of a multi-period consumption-based asset pricing model on price and payoff autocorrelations. We obtain the approximations of the basic pricing equation that describe the mean price "to-day," mean payoff "next-day," price and payoff volatilities, and price and payoff autocorrelations. The deep conjunction of the consumption-based model with other versions of asset pricing, such as ICAPM, APM, etc. (Cochrane, 2001), emphasizes that our results are valid for other pricing models.</description>

      <title>The welfare effects of nonlinear health dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.03816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.03816v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We generate a continuous measure of health to estimate a non-parametric model of health dynamics, showing that adverse health shocks are highly persistent when suffered by people in poor health. Canonical models cannot account for this pattern. We incorporate this health dynamic into a life-cycle model of consumption, savings, and labor force participation. After estimating the model parameters, we simulate the effects of health shocks on economic outcomes. We find that bad health shocks have long-term adverse economic effects that are more extreme for those in poor health. Furthermore, bad health shocks also increase the disparity of asset accumulation among this group of people. A canonical model of health dynamics would not reveal these effects.</description>

      <title>New Concept for the Value Function of Prospect Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.00131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.00131v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the prospect theory, value function is typically concave for gains, commonly convex for losses, with losses usually having a steeper slope than gains. The neural system largely differs from the loss and gains sides. Five new studies on neurons related to this issue have examined neuronal responses to losses, gains, and reference points. This study investigates a new concept of the value function. A value function with a neuronal cusp may show variations and behavior cusps with catastrophe where a trader closes one's position.</description>

      <title>The Distributional Impact of Inflation in Pakistan: A Case Study of a New Price Focused Microsimulation Framework, PRICES</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.00231v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper develops a microsimulation model to simulate the distributional impact of price changes using Household Budget Survey data, income survey data and an Input Output Model. The primary purpose is to describe the model components. The secondary purpose is to demonstrate one component of the model by assessing the distributional and welfare impact of recent price changes in Pakistan. Over the period of November 2020 to November 2022, headline inflation 41.5 percent, with food and transportation prices increasing most. The analysis shows that despite large increases in energy prices, the importance of energy prices for the welfare losses due to inflation is limited because energy budget shares are small and inflation is relatively low. The overall distributional impact of recent price changes is mildly progressive, but household welfare is impacted significantly irrespective of households position along the income distribution. The biggest driver of welfare losses at the bottom of the income distribution was food price inflation, while inflation in other goods and services was the biggest driver at the top. To compensate households for increased living costs, transfers would need to be on average 40 percent of pre-inflation expenditure, assuming constant incomes. Behavioural responses to price changes have a negligible impact on the overall welfare cost to households.</description>

      <title>A prototype software framework for transferable computational health economic models and its early application in youth mental health</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.14138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.14138v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We are developing an economic model to explore multiple topics in Australian youth mental health policy. We want that model to be readily transferable to other jurisdictions. We developed a software framework for authoring transparent, reusable and updatable Computational Health Economic Models (CHEMs) (the software files that implement health economic models). We specified framework user requirements of a template CHEM module that facilitates modular model implementations, a simple programming syntax and tools for authoring new CHEM modules, supplying CHEMs with data, reporting reproducible CHEM analyses, searching for CHEM modules and maintaining a CHEM project website. We implemented the framework as six development version code libraries in the programming language R that integrate with online services for software development and research data archiving. We used the framework to author five development version R libraries of CHEM modules focused on utility mapping in youth mental health. These modules provide tools for variable validation, dataset description, multi-attribute instrument scoring, construction of mapping models, reporting of mapping studies and making out of sample predictions. We assessed these CHEM module libraries as mostly meeting transparency, reusability and updatability criteria that we have previously developed, but requiring more detailed documentation and unit testing of individual modules. Our software framework has potential value as a prototype for future tools to support the development of transferable CHEMs.</description>
