      <title>Universal non-Hermitian flow in one-dimensional PT-symmetric quantum criticalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01640v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The critical point of a topological phase transition is described by a conformal field theory (CFT), where the finite-size corrections to the ground state energy are uniquely related to its central charge. We study the finite-size scaling of the energy of non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model with parity and time-reversal symmetry ($\mathcal{PT}$) symmetry. We find that under open boundary condition (OBC), the energy scaling $E(L)\sim c/L$ reveals a negative central charge $c=-2$ at the non-Hermitian critical point, indicative of a non-unitary CFT. Furthermore, we discover a universal scaling function capturing the flow of a system from Dirac CFT with $c=1$ to a non-unitary CFT with $c=-2$. The scaling function demonstrates distinct behaviors at topologically non-trivial and trivial sides of critical points. Notably, within the realm of topological criticality, the scaling function exhibits an universal rise-dip-rise pattern, manifesting a characteristic singularity inherent in the non-Hermitian topological critical points. The analytic expression of the scaling function has been derived and is in good agreement with the numerical results.</description>

      <title>Spectral form factor in chaotic, localized, and integrable open quantum many-body systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01641v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We numerically study the spectral statistics of open quantum many-body systems (OQMBS) as signatures of quantum chaos (or the lack thereof), using the dissipative spectral form factor (DSFF), a generalization of the spectral form factor to complex spectra. We show that the DSFF of chaotic OQMBS generically displays the $\textit{quadratic}$ ramp-plateau behaviour of the Ginibre ensemble from random matrix theory, in contrast to the linear ramp-plateau behaviour of the Gaussian ensemble in closed quantum systems. Furthermore, in the presence of many-body interactions, such RMT behaviour emerges only after a time scale $\tau_{\mathrm{dev}}$, which generally increases with system size for sufficiently large system size, and can be identified as the non-Hermitian analogue of the $\textit{many-body Thouless time}$. The universality of the random matrix theory behavior is demonstrated by surveying twelve models of OQMBS, including random Kraus circuits (quantum channels) and random Lindbladians (Liouvillians) in several symmetry classes, as well as Lindbladians of paradigmatic models such as the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK), XXZ, and the transverse field Ising models. We devise an unfolding and filtering procedure to remove variations of the averaged density of states which would otherwise hide the universal RMT-like signatures in the DSFF for chaotic OQMBS. Beyond chaotic OQMBS, we study the spectral statistics of non-chaotic OQMBS, specifically the integrable XX model and a system in the many-body localized (MBL) regime in the presence of dissipation, which exhibit DSFF behaviours distinct from the ramp-plateau behaviour of random matrix theory. Lastly, we study the DSFF of Lindbladians with the Hamiltonian term set to zero, i.e. only the jump operators are present, and demonstrate that the results of RMT universality and scaling of many-body Thouless time survive even without coherent evolution.</description>

      <title>Added mass effect in coupled Brownian particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01696v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The added mass effect is the contribution to a Brownian particle's effective mass arising from the hydrodynamic flow its motion induces. For a spherical particle in an incompressible fluid, the added mass is half the fluid's displaced mass, but in a compressible fluid its value depends on a competition between timescales. Here we illustrate this behavior with a solvable model of two harmonically coupled Brownian particles of mass $m$, one representing the sphere, the other the immediately surrounding fluid. The measured distribution of the Brownian particle's velocity, $P(\bar{v})$, follows a Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution with an effective mass $m^*$. Solving analytically for $m^*$, we find that its value is determined by three relevant timescales: the momentum relaxation time, $t_p$, the harmonic oscillation period, $\tau$, and the velocity measurement time resolution, $\Delta t$. In limiting cases $\Delta t \ll \tau,t_p$ and $\tau\ll\Delta t\ll t_p$, our expression for $m^*$ reduces to $m$ and $2m$, respectively. We find similar behavior upon generalizing the model to the case of unequal masses.</description>

      <title>Smoothly vanishing density in the contact process by an interplay of disorder and long-distance dispersal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02003v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Realistic modeling of ecological population dynamics requires spatially explicit descriptions that can take into account spatial heterogeneity as well as long-distance dispersal. Here, we present Monte Carlo simulations and numerical renormalization group results for the paradigmatic model, the contact process, in the combined presence of these factors in both one and two-dimensional systems. Our results confirm our analytic arguments stating that the density vanishes smoothly at the extinction threshold, in a way characteristic of infinite-order transitions. This extremely smooth vanishing of the global density entails an enhanced exposure of the population to extinction events. At the same time, a reverse order parameter, the local persistence displays a discontinuity characteristic of mixed-order transitions, as it approaches a non-universal critical value algebraically with an exponent $\beta_p'&lt;1$.</description>

      <title>Local number fluctuations in ordered and disordered phases of water across temperatures: Higher-order moments and degrees of tetrahedrality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02271v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The isothermal compressibility (i.e., the asymptotic number variance) of equilibrium liquid water as a function of temperature is minimal near ambient conditions. This anomalous non-monotonic temperature dependence is due to a balance between thermal fluctuations and the formation of tetrahedral hydrogen-bond networks. Since tetrahedrality is a many-body property, it will also influence the higher-order moments of density fluctuations, including the skewness and kurtosis. To gain a more complete picture, we examine these higher-order moments that encapsulate many-body correlations using a recently developed, advanced platform for local density fluctuations. We study an extensive set of simulated phases of water across a range of temperatures (80 K to 1600 K) with various degrees of tetrahedrality, including ice phases, equilibrium liquid water, supercritical water, and disordered nonequilibrium quenches. We find clear signatures of tetrahedrality in the higher-order moments, including the skewness and excess kurtosis, that scale for all cases with the degree of tetrahedrality. More importantly, this scaling behavior leads to non-monotonic temperature dependencies in the higher-order moments for both equilibrium and non-equilibrium phases. Specifically, at near-ambient conditions, the higher-order moments vanish most rapidly for large length scales, and the distribution quickly converges to a Gaussian in our metric. However, at non-ambient conditions, higher-order moments vanish more slowly and hence become more relevant especially for improving information-theoretic approximations of hydrophobic solubility. The temperature non-monotonicity that we observe in the full distribution across length-scales could shed light on water's nested anomalies, i.e., reveal new links between structural, dynamic, and thermodynamic anomalies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this letter we use the thermodynamics of a passive fluid to constrain transport in the corresponding active fluid which is subsequently described by the Toner-Tu equations. Acknowledging that the system fundamentally breaks boost symmetry we compel what were previously entirely phenomenological parameters in the Toner-Tu model to satisfy precise relationships among themselves. Consequently, we determine exact scalings for the transport coefficients under dynamical renormalisation group flow that reproduce the results of recent simulations.</description>

      <title>Interacting quasiperiodic spin chains in the prethermal regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01622v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent progress in the study of many-body localization (MBL) in strongly disordered interacting spin chains has emphasized the importance of distinguishing finite time prethermal behavior from long time and large volume asymptotics. We re-examine a reported non-ergodic extended (NEE) regime in quasiperiodically disordered chains from this perspective, and propose that this regime is a prethermal feature. Indeed, we argue that the NEE regime may be identified through a change in the functional form of spin-spin autocorrelation functions, demonstrating that the NEE regime is distinguishable within intermediate-time dynamics. This is in contrast with existing conjectures relating the NEE regime to the presence of an asymptotic mobility edge in the single-particle spectrum. Thus, we propose a mechanism for the formation of an NEE regime which does not rely on asymptotic properties of the spin chain. Namely, we propose that the NEE regime emerges due to regularly spaced deep wells in the disorder potential. The highly detuned sites suppress spin transport across the system, effectively cutting the chain, and producing a separation of time scales between the spreading of different operators. To support this proposal, we show that the NEE phenomenology also occurs in random models with deep wells but with no mobility edges, and does not occur in quasiperiodic models with mobility edges but with no deep wells. Our results support the broad conclusion that there is not a sharp distinction between the dynamics of quasiperiodically and randomly disordered systems in the prethermal regime. More specifically, we find that generic interacting quasiperiodic models do not have stable intermediate dynamical phases arising from their single-particle mobility edges, and that NEE phenomenology in such models is transient.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Freezing in Exactly Solvable Models of Driven Chaotic Quantum Dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01627v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The late-time equilibrium behavior of generic interacting models is determined by the coupled hydrodynamic equations associated with the globally conserved quantities. In the presence of an external time-dependent drive, non-integrable systems typically thermalize to an effectively infinite-temperature state, losing all memory of their initial states. However, in the presence of a large time-periodic Floquet drive, there exist special points in phase-space where the strongly interacting system develops approximate {\it emergent} conservation laws. Here we present results for an exactly solvable model of two coupled chaotic quantum dots with multiple orbitals interacting via random two and four-fermion interactions in the presence of a Floquet drive. We analyze the phenomenology of dynamically generated freezing using a combination of exact diagonalization, and field-theoretic analysis in the limit of a large number of electronic orbitals. The model displays universal freezing behavior irrespective of whether the theory is averaged over the disorder configurations or not. We present explicit computations for the growth of many-body chaos and entanglement entropy, which demonstrates the long-lived coherence associated with the interacting degrees of freedom even at late-times at the dynamically frozen points. We also compute the slow timescale that controls relaxation away from exact freezing in a high-frequency expansion.</description>

      <title>Aubry transition with small distortions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01878v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that when the Aubry transition occurs in incommensurately distorted structures, the amplitude of the distortions is not necessarily large as suggested by the standard Frenkel-Kontorova mechanical model. By modifying the shape of the potential in such a way that the mechanical force is locally stronger (i.e. increasing the nonlinearities), the transition may occur at a small amplitude of the potential with small distortions. A ``phason'' gap then opens, while the phonon spectrum resembles a standard undistorted spectrum at higher energies. This may explain the existence of pinned phases with small distortions as experimentally observed in charge-density waves.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01954v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Depending on their mechanism of self-propulsion, active particles can exhibit a time-dependent, often periodic, propulsion velocity. The precise propulsion velocity profile determines their mean square displacement and their effective diffusion coefficient at long times. Here we demonstrate that any periodic propulsion profile results in a larger diffusion coefficient than the corresponding case with constant propulsion velocity. We investigate in detail the case of periodic exponentially decaying velocity pulses, expected in propulsion mechanisms based on sudden absorption of finite amounts of energy. We show both analytically and with numerical simulations that in these cases the effective diffusion coefficient can be arbitrarily enhanced with respect to the case with constant velocity equal to the average speed. Our results may help interpret in a new light observations on the diffusion enhancement of active particles.</description>

      <title>The atomizing pulsed jet</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01959v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Direct Numerical Simulations of the injection of a pulsed round liquid jet in a stagnant gas are performed. The Reynolds and Weber numbers and the density ratio are sufficiently large for reaching a complex high-speed atomization regime. The Weber number based on grid size is small, an indication that the simulations are very well resolved. Computations are performed using octree adaptive mesh refinement using the Basilisk free-code platform, down to a specified minimum grid size $\Delta$. Qualitative analysis of the flow and its topology reveal a complex structure of ligaments, sheets, droplets and bubbles that evolve and interact through impacts, ligament breakup, sheet rupture and engulfment of air bubbles in the liquid. A rich gallery of images of entangled structures is produced. Most processes occurring in this type of atomization are reproduced in detail, except at the instant of thin sheet perforation or breakup. We analyze drop statistics, showing that as the grid resolution is increased, the small-scale part of the distribution does not converge, and contains a large number of droplets close in order of magnitude to the minimum grid size with a significant peak at $d = 3\Delta$ . This non-convergence arises from the {\em numerical sheet breakup} effect, in which the interface becomes rough just before it breaks. The rough appearance of the interface is associated to a high-wavenumber oscillation of the curvature. To recover convergence, we apply the controlled "manifold death" numerical procedure, in which thin sheets are detected, and then pierced by fiat before they reach a set critical thickness $h_c$ that is always larger than $6 \Delta$. This allows convergence of the droplet frequency above a certain critical diameter $d_c$ above and close to $h_c$. A unimodal distribution is observed in the converged range.</description>

      <title>Proliferation-driven mechanical feedback regulates cell dynamics in growing tissues</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01960v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Local stresses in a tissue, a collective property, regulate cell division and apoptosis. In turn, cell growth and division induce active stresses in the tissue. As a consequence, there is a feedback between cell growth and local stresses. However, how the cell dynamics depend on local stress-dependent cell division and the feedback strength is not fully understood. Here, we probe the consequences of stress-mediated growth and cell division on cell dynamics using agent-based simulations of a two-dimensional growing tissue. We discover a rich dynamical behavior of individual cells, ranging from jamming (mean square displacement, $\Delta (t) \sim t^{\alpha}$ with $\alpha$ less than unity), to hyperdiffusion ($\alpha &gt; 2$) depending on cell division rate and the strength of the mechanical feedback. Strikingly, $\Delta (t)$ is determined by the tissue growth law, which quantifies cell proliferation (number of cells $N(t)$ as a function of time). The growth law ($N(t) \sim t^{\lambda}$ at long times) is regulated by the critical pressure that controls the strength of the mechanical feedback and the ratio between cell division-apoptosis rates. We show that $\lambda \sim \alpha$, which implies that higher growth rate leads to a greater degree of cell migration. The variations in cell motility are linked to the emergence of highly persistent forces extending over several cell cycle times. Our predictions are testable using cell-tracking imaging techniques.</description>

      <title>Many-body Localization Transition of Ising Spin-1 Chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02028v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we theoretically investigate the many-body localization properties of one-dimensional Ising spin-1 chains by using the methods of exact matrix diagonalization. We compare it with the MBL properties of the Ising spin-1/2 chains. The results indicate that the one-dimensional Ising spin-1 chains can also undergo MBL phase transition. There are various forms of disorder, and we compare the effects of different forms of quasi-disorder and random disorder on many-body localization in this paper. First, we calculate the exctied-state fidelity to study the MBL phase transtion. By changing the form of the quasi-disorder, we study the MBL transition of the system with different forms of quasi-disorder and compare them with those of the random disordered system. The results show that both random disorder and quasi-disorder can cause the MBL phase transition in the one-dimensional Ising spin-1 chains. In order to study the effect of spin interactions, we compare Ising spin-1 chains and spin-1/2 chains with the next-nearest-neighbour(N-N) two-body interactions and the next-next-nearest-neighbour (N-N-N)interactions. The results show that the critical point increases with the addition of the interaction. Then we study the dynamical properties of the model by the dynamical behavior of diagonal entropy (DE), local magnetization and the time evolution of fidelity to further prove the occurrence of MBL phase transition in the disordered Ising spin-1 chains with the (N-N) coupling term and distinguish the ergodic phase (thermal phase) and the many-body localized phase. Lastly, we delve into the impact of periodic driving on one-dimensional Ising spin-1 chains. And we compare it with the results obtained from the Ising spin-1/2 chains. It shows that periodic driving can cause Ising spin-1 chains and Ising spin-1/2 chains to occur the MBL transition.</description>

      <title>Anomalous transport in the quantum East-West kinetically constrained model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02102v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a chaotic particle-conserving kinetically constrained model, with a single parameter which allows us to break reflection symmetry. Through extensive numerical simulations we find that the domain wall state shows a variety of dynamical behaviors from localization all the way to ballistic transport, depending on the value of the reflection breaking parameter. Surprisingly, such anomalous behavior is not mirrored in infinite-temperature dynamics, which appear to scale diffusively, in line with expectations for generic interacting models. However, studying the particle density gradient, we show that the lack of reflection symmetry affects infinite-temperature dynamics, resulting in an asymmetric dynamical structure factor. This is in disagreement with normal diffusion and suggests that the model may also exhibit anomalous dynamics at infinite temperature in the thermodynamic limit. Finally, we observe low-entangled eigenstates in the spectrum of the model, a telltale sign of quantum many body scars.</description>

      <title>Energy-filtered quantum states and the emergence of non-local correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02158v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Energy-filtered quantum states are promising candidates for efficiently simulating thermal states. We explore a protocol designed to transition a product state into an eigenstate located in the middle of the spectrum; this is achieved by gradually reducing its energy variance, which allows us to comprehensively understand the crossover phenomenon and the subsequent convergence towards thermal behavior. We introduce and discuss three energy-filtering regimes (short, medium and long), and we interpret them as stages of thermalization. We show that the properties of the filtered states are locally indistinguishable from those of time-averaged density matrices, routinely employed in the theory of thermalization. On the other hand, unexpected non-local quantum correlations are generated in the medium regimes and are witnessed by the R\'enyi entanglement entropies of subsystems, which we compute via replica methods. Specifically, two-point correlation functions break cluster decomposition and the entanglement entropy of large regions scales as the logarithm of the volume during the medium filter time.</description>

      <title>Mobility-induced kinetic effects in multicomponent mixtures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02159v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give an overview exploring the role of kinetics in multicomponent mixtures. Compared to the most commonly studied binary (single species plus solvent) case, multicomponent fluids show a rich interplay between kinetics and thermodynamics due to the possibility of fractionation, interdiffusion of mixture components and collective motion. This leads to a competition between multiple timescales that change depending on the underlying kinetics. At high densities, crowding effects are relevant and non-equilibrium structures can become long-lived. We present the main approaches for the study of kinetic effects in multicomponents mixtures, including the role of crowding, and explore their consequences for equilibrium and non-equilibrium scenarios. We conclude by identifying the main challenges in the field.</description>

      <title>Integrating Molecular Dynamics Simulations and Experimental Data for Azeotrope Predictions in Binary Mixtures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02216v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An azeotrope is a constant boiling point mixture, and its behavior is important for fluid separation processes. Predicting azeotropes from atomistic simulations is difficult, due to the complexities and convergence problems in Monte Carlo and free-energy perturbation techniques. Here, we present a methodology for predicting the azeotropes of binary mixtures, which computes the compositional dependence of chemical potentials from molecular dynamics simulations using the S0 method, and employs experimental boiling point and vaporization enthalpy data. Using this methodology, we reproduce the azeotropes or the lack of in five case studies, including ethanol/water, ethanol/isooctane, methanol/water, hydrazine/water, and acetone/chloroform mixtures. We find that it is crucial to use the experimental boiling point and vaporization enthalpy for reliable azeotrope predictions, as empirical force fields are not accurate enough for these quantities. Finally, we use regular solution models to rationalize the azeotropes, and reveal that they tend to form when the mixture components have similar boiling points and strong interactions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.09079v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Randomly coupled phase oscillators may synchronize into disordered patterns of collective motion. We analyze this transition in a large, fully connected Kuramoto model with symmetric but otherwise independent random interactions. Using the dynamical cavity method we reduce the dynamics to a stochastic single-oscillator problem with self-consistent correlation and response functions that we study analytically and numerically. We clarify the nature of the volcano transition and elucidate its relation to the existence of an oscillator glass phase.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.13372v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the phase transitions at the onset of time-crystalline order in $O(N)$ models driven out-of-equilibrium. The spontaneous breaking of time translation symmetry and its Goldstone mode are captured by an effective description with $O(N)\times SO(2)$ symmetry. Using the renormalization group and the $\epsilon=4-d$ expansion in a leading two-loop analysis, we identify a new non-equilibrium universality class. Strikingly, it controls the long-distance physics no matter how small the microscopic breaking of equilibrium conditions is. The $O(N=2)\times SO(2)$ symmetry group is realized for magnon condensation in pumped yttirum iron garnet (YIG) films and in exciton-polariton systems with a polarization degree of freedom.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic and Stoichiometric Laws Ruling the Fates of Growing Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.14435v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We delve into growing open chemical reaction systems (CRSs) characterized by autocatalytic reactions within a variable volume, which changes in response to these reactions. Understanding the thermodynamics of such systems is crucial for comprehending biological cells and constructing protocells, as it sheds light on the physical conditions necessary for their self-replication. Building on our recent work, where we developed a thermodynamic theory for growing CRSs featuring basic autocatalytic motifs with regular stoichiometric matrices, we now expand this theory to include scenarios where the stoichiometric matrix has a nontrivial left kernel space. This extension introduces conservation laws, which limit the variations in chemical species due to reactions, thereby confining the system's possible states to those compatible with its initial conditions. By considering both thermodynamic and stoichiometric constraints, we clarify the environmental and initial conditions that dictate the CRSs' fate-whether they grow, shrink, or reach equilibrium. We also find that the conserved quantities significantly influence the equilibrium state achieved by a growing CRS. These results are derived independently of specific thermodynamic potentials or reaction kinetics, therefore underscoring the fundamental impact of conservation laws on the growth of the system.</description>

      <title>Proof of the nonintegrability of the PXP model and general spin-$1/2$ systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02335v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a general framework for proving non-integrability of the quantum systems. For spin-$1/2$ systems, we show that the presence or absence of the local conserved quantity can be shown using the graph theoretical analysis. This approach helps to systematically classify the number of local conserved quantity, as aiding the proof of non-integrability of the Hamiltonian. Using this approach, we prove for the first time that the PXP model is nonintegrable. We also show that our method is applicable to the well-known proof of the non-integrability of other spin-$1/2$ systems. Our new approach offers a significant simplification of the proof of non-integrability and provides a deeper understanding of quantum dynamics.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic Quantum Hall Droplets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.01726v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study two-dimensional (2D) droplets of noninteracting electrons in a strong magnetic field, placed in a confining potential with arbitrary shape. Using semiclassical methods adapted to the lowest Landau level, we obtain near-Gaussian energy eigenstates that are localized on level curves of the potential and have a position-dependent height. This one-particle insight allows us to deduce explicit formulas for expectation values of local many-body observables, such as density and current, in the thermodynamic limit. In particular, correlations along the edge are long-ranged and inhomogeneous. As we show, this is consistent with the system's universal low-energy description as a free 1D chiral conformal field theory of edge modes, known from earlier works in simple geometries. A delicate interplay between radial and angular dependencies of eigenfunctions ultimately ensures that the theory is homogeneous in terms of the canonical angle variable of the potential, despite its apparent inhomogeneity in terms of more na\"ive angular coordinates. Finally, we propose a scheme to measure the anisotropy by subjecting the droplet to microwave radiation; we compute the corresponding absorption rate and show that it depends on the droplet's shape and the waves' polarization. These results, both local and global, are likely to be observable in solid-state systems or quantum simulators of 2D electron gases with a high degree of control on the confining potential.</description>

      <title>Entanglement negativity between separated regions in quantum critical systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.15273v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the entanglement between disjoint subregions in quantum critical systems through the lens of the logarithmic negativity. We work with systems in arbitrary dimensions, including conformal field theories and their corresponding lattice Hamiltonians, as well as resonating valence-bond states. At small separations, the logarithmic negativity is big and displays universal behavior, but we show non-perturbatively that it decays faster than any power at large separations. This can already be seen in the minimal setting of single-spin subregions. The corresponding absence of distillable entanglement at large separations generalizes the 1d result, and indicates that quantum critical groundstates do not possess long-range bipartite entanglement, at least for bosons. For systems with fermions, a more suitable definition of the logarithmic negativity exists that takes into account fermion parity, and we show that it decays algebraically. Along the way we obtain general results for the moments of the partially transposed density matrix.</description>

      <title>From Chaos to Integrability in Double Scaled SYK</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01950v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study thermodynamic phase transitions between integrable and chaotic dynamics. We do so by analyzing models that interpolate between the chaotic double scaled Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) and the integrable $p$-spin systems, in a limit where they are described by chord diagrams. We develop a path integral formalism by coarse graining over the diagrams, which we use to argue that the system has two distinct phases: one is continuously connected to the chaotic system, and the other to the integrable. They are separated by a line of first order transition that ends at a critical point.</description>

      <title>A Path Integral for Chord Diagrams and Chaotic-Integrable Transitions in Double Scaled SYK</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.05980v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study transitions from chaotic to integrable Hamiltonians in the double scaled SYK and $p$-spin systems. The dynamics of our models is described by chord diagrams with two species. We begin by developing a path integral formalism of coarse graining chord diagrams with a single species of chords, which has the same equations of motion as the bi-local ($G\Sigma$) Liouville action, yet appears otherwise to be different and in particular well defined. We then develop a similar formalism for two types of chords, allowing us to study different types of deformations of double scaled SYK and in particular a deformation by an integrable Hamiltonian. The system has two distinct thermodynamic phases: one is continuously connected to the chaotic SYK Hamiltonian, the other is continuously connected to the integrable Hamiltonian, separated at low temperature by a first order phase transition. We also analyze the phase diagram for generic deformations, which in some cases includes a zero-temperature phase transition.</description>

      <title>Functional reducibility of higher-order networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08547v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Empirical complex systems are widely assumed to be characterized not only by pairwise interactions, but also by higher-order (group) interactions that affect collective phenomena, from metabolic reactions to epidemics. Nevertheless, higher-order networks' superior descriptive power -- compared to classical pairwise networks -- comes with a much increased model complexity and computational cost. Consequently, it is of paramount importance to establish a quantitative method to determine when such a modeling framework is advantageous with respect to pairwise models, and to which extent it provides a parsimonious description of empirical systems. Here, we propose a principled method, based on information compression, to analyze the reducibility of higher-order networks to lower-order interactions, by identifying redundancies in diffusion processes while preserving the relevant functional information. The analysis of a broad spectrum of empirical systems shows that, although some networks contain non-compressible group interactions, others can be effectively approximated by lower-order interactions -- some technological and biological systems even just by pairwise interactions. More generally, our findings mark a significant step towards minimizing the dimensionality of models for complex systems</description>
