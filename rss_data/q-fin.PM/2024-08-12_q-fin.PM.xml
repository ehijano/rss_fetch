      <title>Optimizing Portfolio with Two-Sided Transactions and Lending: A Reinforcement Learning Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents a Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based portfolio management model tailored for high-risk environments, addressing the limitations of traditional RL models and exploiting market opportunities through two-sided transactions and lending. Our approach integrates a new environmental formulation with a Profit and Loss (PnL)-based reward function, enhancing the RL agent's ability in downside risk management and capital optimization. We implemented the model using the Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) agent with a Convolutional Neural Network with Multi-Head Attention (CNN-MHA). This setup effectively manages a diversified 12-crypto asset portfolio in the Binance perpetual futures market, leveraging USDT for both granting and receiving loans and rebalancing every 4 hours, utilizing market data from the preceding 48 hours. Tested over two 16-month periods of varying market volatility, the model significantly outperformed benchmarks, particularly in high-volatility scenarios, achieving higher return-to-risk ratios and demonstrating robust profitability. These results confirm the model's effectiveness in leveraging market dynamics and managing risks in volatile environments like the cryptocurrency market.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking M6 Competitors: An Analysis of Financial Metrics and Discussion of Incentives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19105v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The M6 Competition assessed the performance of competitors using a ranked probability score and an information ratio (IR). While these metrics do well at picking the winners in the competition, crucial questions remain for investors with longer-term incentives. To address these questions, we compare the competitors' performance to a number of conventional (long-only) and alternative indices using standard industry metrics. We apply factor models to measure the competitors' value-adds above industry-standard benchmarks and find that competitors with more extreme performance are less dependent on the benchmarks. We also uncover that most competitors could not generate significant out-performance compared to randomly selected long-only and long-short portfolios but did generate out-performance compared to short-only portfolios. We further introduce two new strategies by picking the competitors with the best (Superstars) and worst (Superlosers) recent performance and show that it is challenging to identify skill amongst investment managers. We also discuss the incentives of winning the competition compared to professional investors, where investors wish to maximize fees over an extended period of time.</description>

      <title>AI-Powered Energy Algorithmic Trading: Integrating Hidden Markov Models with Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19858v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In quantitative finance, machine learning methods are essential for alpha generation. This study introduces a new approach that combines Hidden Markov Models (HMM) and neural networks, integrated with Black-Litterman portfolio optimization. During the COVID period (2019-2022), this dual-model approach achieved a 83% return with a Sharpe ratio of 0.77. It incorporates two risk models to enhance risk management, showing efficiency during volatile periods. The methodology was implemented on the QuantConnect platform, which was chosen for its robust framework and experimental reproducibility. The system, which predicts future price movements, includes a three-year warm-up to ensure proper algorithm function. It targets highly liquid, large-cap energy stocks to ensure stable and predictable performance while also considering broker payments. The dual-model alpha system utilizes log returns to select the optimal state based on the historical performance. It combines state predictions with neural network outputs, which are based on historical data, to generate trading signals. This study examined the architecture of the trading system, data pre-processing, training, and performance. The full code and backtesting data are available under the QuantConnect terms.</description>
