      <title>DiffNMR3: Advancing NMR Resolution Beyond Instrumental Limits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06845v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is a crucial analytical technique used for molecular structure elucidation, with applications spanning chemistry, biology, materials science, and medicine. However, the frequency resolution of NMR spectra is limited by the "field strength" of the instrument. High-field NMR instruments provide high-resolution spectra but are prohibitively expensive, whereas lower-field instruments offer more accessible, but lower-resolution, results. This paper introduces an AI-driven approach that not only enhances the frequency resolution of NMR spectra through super-resolution techniques but also provides multi-scale functionality. By leveraging a diffusion model, our method can reconstruct high-field spectra from low-field NMR data, offering flexibility in generating spectra at varying magnetic field strengths. These reconstructions are comparable to those obtained from high-field instruments, enabling finer spectral details and improving molecular characterization. To date, our approach is one of the first to overcome the limitations of instrument field strength, achieving NMR super-resolution through AI. This cost-effective solution makes high-resolution analysis accessible to more researchers and industries, without the need for multimillion-dollar equipment.</description>

      <title>First experimental proof of PET imaging based on multi-anode MCP-PMTs with Cherenkov radiator-integrated window</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Improving the coincidence time resolution (CTR) of time-of-flight positron emission tomography (TOF-PET) systems to achieve a higher signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) gain or even direct positron emission imaging (dPEI) is of paramount importance for many advanced new clinical applications of PET imaging. This places higher demands on the timing performance of all aspects of PET systems. One effective approach is to use microchannel plate photomultiplier tubes (MCP-PMTs) for prompt Cherenkov photon detection. In this study, we developed a dual-module Cherenkov PET imaging experimental platform, utilising our proprietary 8 * 8-anode Cherenkov radiator-integrated window MCP-PMTs in combination with custom-designed multi-channel electronics, and designed a specific calibration and correction method for the platform. Using this platform, a CTR of 103 ps FWHM was achieved. We overcame the limitations of single-anode detectors in previous experiments, significantly enhanced imaging efficiency and achieved module-level Cherenkov PET imaging for the first time. Imaging experiments involving radioactive sources and phantoms of various shapes and types were conducted, which preliminarily validated the feasibility and advancement of this imaging method. In addition, the effects of normalisation correction and the interaction probability between the gamma rays and the MCP on the images and experimental results were analysed and verified.</description>

      <title>Precision Control of Resistive Power in Kibble Balance Coils: An Advanced Method for Minimizing Temperature-Related Magnetic Errors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07264v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Temperature changes affect the coercivity of permanent magnets, thereby impacting the $Bl$ factor and potentially introducing systematic errors in Kibble balance measurements. While the thermal-magnetic effect is negligible in large magnet systems, it increases substantially as the magnet size decreases, posing an engineering difficulty for tabletop Kibble balance systems. We discuss the mechanism of thermal-magnetic effects through finite element analysis, which has not been sufficiently emphasized in previous studies. A bifilar-coil power regulator is proposed to eliminate thermal-magnetic errors in Kibble balances. The approach aims to keep the power of the internal heating source -- coil ohmic power -- constant over time, allowing the $Bl$ drift to be mitigated through ABA or ABBA measurement sequences. Experimental results validate the proposal, demonstrating that the thermal effect can be reduced by more than two orders of magnitude compared to the conventional two-mode, two-phase measurement scheme, and by about one order of magnitude compared to the one-mode, two-phase scheme. The proposed approach can eliminate the influence of thermal-magnetic effects on the measurement results, thus further breaking down the limitations on the minimum size of tabletop Kibble balances.</description>

      <title>Position reconstruction and surface background model for the PandaX-4T detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07317v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the position reconstruction methods and surface background model for the PandaX-4T dark matter direct search experiment. This work develops two position reconstruction algorithms: template matching (TM) method and photon acceptance function (PAF) method. Both methods determine the horizontal position of events based on the light pattern of secondary scintillation collected by the light sensors. After a comprehensive evaluation of resolution, uniformity, and robustness, the PAF method was selected for position reconstruction, while the TM method was employed for verification. The PAF method achieves a bulk event resolution of 1.0 mm and a surface event resolution of 4.4 mm for a typical $S2$ signal with a bottom charge of 1500 PE (about 14 keV). The uniformity is around 20\%. Robustness studies reveal average deviations of 5.1 mm and 8.8 mm for the commissioning run (Run0) and the first science run (Run1), respectively, due to the deactivation of certain PMTs. A data-driven surface background model is developed based on the PAF method. The surface background is estimated to be $0.09 \pm 0.06$ events for Run0 (0.54 tonne$\cdot$year) and $0.17 \pm 0.11$ events for Run1 (1.00 tonne$\cdot$year).</description>

      <title>Towards energy-insensitive and robust neutron/gamma classification: a learning-based frequency-domain parametric approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07359v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neutron/gamma discrimination has been intensively researched in recent years, due to its unique scientific value and widespread applications. With the advancement of detection materials and algorithms, nowadays we can achieve fairly good discrimination. However, further improvements rely on better utilization of detector raw signals, especially energy-independent pulse characteristics. We begin by discussing why figure-of-merit (FoM) is not a comprehensive criterion for high-precision neutron/gamma discriminators, and proposing a new evaluation method based on adversarial sampling. Inspired by frequency-domain analysis in existing literature, parametric linear/nonlinear models with minimum complexity are created, upon the discrete spectrum, with tunable parameters just as neural networks. We train the models on an open-source neutron/gamma dataset (CLYC crystals with silicon photomultipliers) preprocessed by charge normalization to discover and exploit energy-independent features. The performance is evaluated on different sampling rates and noise levels, in comparison with the frequency classification index and conventional methods. The frequency-domain parametric models show higher accuracy and better adaptability to variations of data integrity than other discriminators. The proposed method is also promising for online inference on economical hardware and portable devices.</description>

      <title>Rethinking Timing Residuals: Advancing PET Detectors with Explicit TOF Corrections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: PET is a functional imaging method that visualizes metabolic processes. TOF information can be derived from coincident detector signals and incorporated into image reconstruction to enhance the SNR. PET detectors are typically assessed by their CTR, but timing performance is degraded by various factors. Research on timing calibration seeks to mitigate these degradations and restore accurate timing information. While many calibration methods use analytical approaches, machine learning techniques have recently gained attention due to their flexibility. We developed a residual physics-based calibration approach that combines prior domain knowledge with the power of machine learning models. This approach begins with an initial analytical calibration addressing first-order skews. The remaining deviations, regarded as residual effects, are used to train machine learning models to eliminate higher-order skews. The key advantage is that the experimenter guides the learning process through the definition of timing residuals. In earlier studies, we developed models that directly predicted the expected time difference, which offered corrections only implicitly (implicit correction models). In this study, we introduce a new definition for timing residuals, enabling us to train models that directly predict correction values (explicit correction models). The explicit correction approach significantly simplifies data acquisition, improves linearity, and enhances timing performance from $371 \pm 6$ ps to $281 \pm 5$ ps for coincidences from 430 keV to 590 keV. Additionally, the new definition reduces model size, making it suitable for high-throughput applications like PET scanners. Experiments were conducted using two detector stacks composed of $4 \times 4$ LYSO:Ce,Ca crystals ($3.8\times 3.8\times 20$ mm$^{3}$) coupled to $4 \times 4$ Broadcom NUV-MT SiPMs and digitized with the TOFPET2 ASIC.</description>

      <title>Low thermal noise mirror coatings utilising titanium dioxide and germanium dioxide mixtures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07679v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Upgrades to ground-based gravitational-wave observatories will require mirror coatings with reduced thermal noise, enabling improved detector sensitivity and extended astrophysical reach. Recent studies have shown that optical coatings utilising amorphous materials that exhibit a larger fraction of corner-sharing between adjacent structural units of metal-centered polyhedra are a promising route for reducing mechanical dissipation and thus thermal noise at room temperature. We report on multilayer optical coatings that are fabricated using germanium dioxide mixed with titanium dioxide (TiO$_2$:GeO$_2$) for the high index layers, and silicon dioxide (SiO$_2$) for the low index material. Single layers of TiO$_2$:GeO$_2$ are characterised to optimise the mixture proportion and based on that highly reflective multilayer stacks were deposited. Exceptional optical absorption at 1064 nm below 1 part-per-million (ppm) is observed in the multilayer stacks after heat treatment. The annealing process also induces the formation of blisters which leads to increased optical scattering. However, there is indication that blisters can be suppressed by decreasing the water partial pressure in the deposition chamber. Direct thermal noise measurements provide experimental verification of a significant 25\% reduction of thermal noise over the mirrors currently employed, which combined with sub-ppm levels of optical absorption show the potential of TiO$_2$:GeO$_2$ to improve the sensitivity of gravitational-wave observatories.</description>

      <title>Towards a quantum realization of the ampere using single-electron resolution Skipper-CCDs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a proof-of-concept demonstration of the Skipper-CCD, a sensor with single-electron counting capability, as a promising technology for implementing an electron-pump-based current source. Relying on its single-electron resolution and built-in charge sensing, it allows self-calibration of the charge packets. This article presents an initial discussion of how low ppm and high current realizations can be achieved with this technology. We report experimental results that illustrate the key functionalities in manipulating both small and large electron charge packets, including a comparison of the charge generated, self-measured, and drained by the sensor against measurements from an electrometer. These results were obtained using a standard sensor and readout electronics without specific optimizations for this application. The objective is to explore the potential of Skipper-CCD for realizing an electron-based current source.</description>

      <title>Feasibility study of multiplexing analog signals from SiPMs for a single layer monolithic PET detector design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07777v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semi monolithic detector designs with a series of stacked thin monolithic scintillator plates and side readout are an attractive approach for potentially achieving very high performance in a positron emission tomography (PET) scanner. In this work, a simulation study of a single layer monolithic detector module was performed with side read out of scintillation light using GATEv8.2. In this design, a single layer LSO crystal was used with dimensions 40 mm*40 mm*40 mm, with 0.60 mm thickness of the ESR (enhanced specular reflector) films covering the crystal's top and bottom surfaces. The photons generated in the scintillation process induced by the gamma ray hitting the crystal were detected by four 1*8 SiPM (silicon photomultiplier) arrays placed along the four sides of the crystal. The scintillation light distribution detected by all of the 32 SiPMs surrounding the crystal layer was then used to extract the gamma-crystal interaction location based on machine learning analysis. In this work, the spatial resolution of the detector module was explored when analog signals from each of the 32 SiPMs were summed to 28, 24, 20, 16, 12, 8, and 4 total outputs. This study showed that good spatial resolution can be achieved even when the number of read out channels is decreased by multiplexing, which can reduce the overall detector manufacturing cost.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast 4D scanning transmission electron microscopy for imaging of localized optical fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07338v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ultrafast electron microscopy aims for imaging transient phenomena occurring on nanoscale. One of its goals is to visualize localized optical and plasmonic modes generated by coherent excitation in the vicinity of various types of nanostructures. Such imaging capability was enabled by photon-induced near-field optical microscopy, which is based on spectral filtering of electrons inelastically scattered due to the stimulated interaction with the near-field. Here we report on the development of ultrafast 4D scanning transmission electron microscopy, which allows us to image the transverse components of the optical near-field while avoiding the need of electron spectral filtering. We demonstrate that this method is capable of imaging optical near-fields of a tungsten nanotip and ponderomotive potential of an optical standing wave with a spatial resolution of 21 nm.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.07383v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sagnac Speed Meter and ring resonators can be used as high precision instruments, but they are limited in their sensitivity through scattered light causing non-linear noise. Here, we experimentally demonstrate a technique called Tunable Coherence, where the long coherence length of the laser is broken in a controlled way, to suppress the coupling of scattered light in a Sagnac interferometer. We demonstrate a scattered light suppression of 24.2 dB in a Sagnac interferometer and discuss the experimental limitations. Further, we show an analytical discussion on how Tunable Coherence could be a fundamental solution to light scattering back from optical surfaces into the counter propagating beam, which is an issue particularly in ring resonators.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03722v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To search for $\beta\beta0\nu$ decay with unprecedented sensitivity, the R2D2 collaboration is developing a radial time projection chamber with a fiducial mass of half a tonne of $^{136}$Xe at high pressure. The various approaches implemented to eliminate the radioactive background are presented in terms of detector design, topological recognition of interactions, and event energy reconstruction. The developed tools enable the disentangling of the sought-after signal from the background. The projected sensitivity after ten years of data taking yields a half-life limit exceeding $10^{27}$ years, along with a constraint on the effective neutrino mass $m_{\beta\beta}$ that could cover a large fraction of the inverted mass hierarchy region, depending on the final experimental background.</description>

      <title>The Impact of Helium Exposure on the PMTs of the SuperNEMO Experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13755v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The performance of Hamamatsu 8" photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) of the type used in the SuperNEMO neutrinoless double-beta decay experiment (R5912-MOD), is investigated as a function of exposure to helium (He) gas. Two PMTs were monitored for over a year, one exposed to varying concentrations of He, and the other kept in standard atmospheric conditions as a control. Both PMTs were exposed to light signals generated by a Bi-207 radioactive source that provided consistent large input PMT signals similar to those that are typical of the SuperNEMO experiment. The energy resolution of PMT signals corresponding to 1 MeV energy scale determined from the Bi-207 decay spectrum, shows a negligible degradation with He exposure; however the rate of after-pulsing shows a clear increase with He exposure, which is modelled and compared to diffusion theory. A method for reconstructing the partial pressure of He within the PMT and a method for determining the He breakdown point, are introduced. The implications for long-term SuperNEMO operations are briefly discussed.</description>

      <title>Development of a bunching ionizer for TOF mass spectrometers with reduced resources</title>

Abstract: In some types of mass spectrometers, such as Time of Flight mass spectrometers (TOF-MSs), it is necessary to control pulsed beams of ions. This can be easily accomplished by applying a pulsed voltage to the pusher electrode while the ionizer is continuously flowing ions. This method is preferred for its simplicity, although the ion utilization efficiency is not optimized. Here we employed another pulse-control method with a higher ion utilization rate, which is to bunch ions and kick them out instead of letting them stream. The benefit of this method is that higher sensitivity can be achieved; since the start of new ions cannot be allowed during TOF separation, it is highly advantageous to bunch ions that would otherwise be unusable. In this study, we used analytical and numerical methods to design a new bunching ionizer with reduced resources, adopting the principle of electrostatic ion beam trap. The test model experimentally demonstrated the bunching performance with respect to sample gas density and ion bunching time using gas samples and electron impact ionization. We also conducted an experiment in connection with a miniature TOF-MS, and showed that the sensitivity was improved by more than one order of magnitude using the newly developed ionizer. Since the device is capable of bunching ions with lower voltage and lower power consumption (~100 V, ~0.8 W) compared with conventional RF ion trap bunchers (several kilovolts, ~10 W), it will be possible to find applications in portable mass spectrometer with reduced resources.</description>
