      <title>Exploring generalized Starobinsky Model of Inflation: Observational Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04401v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine the power-law Starobinsky model, a generalized version of the Starobinsky inflation model, characterized by a power-law correction to Einstein gravity. Employing the $f(R)$ formalism, the scalar and tensor power spectra were numerically computed as functions of the dimensionless parameters $M$ and $\beta$. A Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis was conducted using Planck-2018, BICEP3 and BAO observational data, yielding precise constraints on $\beta = 1.987^{+0.013}_{-0.016},\, 95\%\, C.\, L.$. and $ \log_{10}M = -4.72^{+0.21}_{-0.20}$. The derived scalar spectral index $n_s=0.9676^{+0.0069}_{-0.0068}$ and tensor-to-scalar ratio $r=0.0074^{+0.0061}_{-0.0044}$ lie within the bounds set by Planck observations. We analyse a general reheating scenario while keeping the number of e-folds during inflation, $N_{pivot}$, fixed. The analysis confirms that deviations from the Starobinsky $R^2$ model are observationaly viable, with implications for high-energy physics and supergravity-based inflationary models.</description>

      <title>Page Time of Primordial Black Holes: Standard Model and Beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04430v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Page time marks the moment when the von Neumann entropy of the emitted Hawking radiation equals the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy of an evaporating black hole, which is assumed to quantify its degrees of freedom as seen from the outside. Beyond this point, from unitarity we would expect that the entropy of the radiation begins to decrease, ensuring that information is eventually recovered. In this work, we investigate the dependence of the Page time on black hole properties and the particle content of nature. Specifically, we analyze its sensitivity to the Standard Model (SM) and potential Beyond-the-SM degrees of freedom, incorporating the effects of particle masses. We find that a Schwarzschild primordial black hole (PBH) with an initial mass of $6.23\times 10^{14}~{\rm g}$ would have a Page time equal to the age of the Universe, assuming emission of SM particles only. We further explore the impact of a non-negligible PBH angular momentum, finding that light spin-2 particles are predominantly emitted before the Page time for Kerr black holes. For For initial angular momenta values exceeding $a_\star &gt; 0.5$, approximately $70\%$ of the total graviton emission occurs prior to the Page time for PBHs with an initial mass $M_{\rm BH} \lesssim 10^{10}~{\rm g}$. Finally, we discuss the implications for PBH phenomenology, particularly regarding potential constraints from $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$ measurements.</description>

      <title>Searching for Inflationary Physics with the CMB Trispectrum: 1. Primordial Theory &amp; Optimal Estimators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The primordial four-point function encodes a wealth of information about the inflationary Universe. Despite extensive theoretical work, most models of four-point physics have never been compared to data. In this series, we conduct a detailed analysis of Cosmic Microwave Background temperature and polarization trispectra, searching for a wide variety of phenomena including local effects, self-interactions, curvatons, DBI inflation, gauge fields, solid inflation, scalar field exchange, spinning massive field exchange, chiral physics, point sources, and gravitational lensing. After presenting a suite of separable primordial templates, we derive thirteen quasi-optimal estimators that directly estimate the underlying template amplitudes. These are unbiased, minimum variance, mask-deconvolved, and account for correlations between templates (including with lensing). Each estimator can be efficiently implemented using spherical harmonic transforms, Monte Carlo methods, and optimization techniques, and asymptotes to standard forms in certain limits. In Paper 2, we implement these estimators in public code, and in Paper 3, use them to constrain primordial trispectra with Planck data. This enables a wide variety of tests of inflation, including some of the first direct constraints on cosmological collider physics.</description>

      <title>KiDS-1000: Detection of deviations from a purely cold dark-matter power spectrum with tomographic weak gravitational lensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04449v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Model uncertainties in the nonlinear structure growth limit current probes of cosmological parameters. To shed more light on the physics of nonlinear scales, we reconstruct the finely binned three-dimensional power-spectrum from lensing data of the Kilo-Degree Survey (KiDS), relying solely on the background cosmology, source redshift distributions, and the intrinsic alignment (IA) amplitude of sources (and their uncertainties). The adopted Tikhonov regularisation stabilises the deprojection, enabling a Bayesian reconstruction in separate $z$-bins. Following a detailed description of the algorithm and performance tests with mock data, we present our results for the power spectrum as relative deviations from a $\Lambda\rm CDM$ reference spectrum that includes only structure growth by cold dark matter. Averaged over the full range $z\lesssim1$, a \emph{Planck}-consistent reference then requires a significant suppression on nonlinear scales, $k=0.05$--$10\,h\,\rm Mpc^{-1}$, of up to $20\%$--$30\%$ to match KiDS-1000 ($68\%$ credible interval, CI). Conversely, a reference with a lower $S_8\approx0.73$ avoids suppression and matches the KiDS-1000 spectrum within a $20\%$ tolerance. When resolved into three $z$-bins, however, and regardless of the reference, we detect structure growth only between $z\approx0.4$--$0.13$, but not between $z\approx0.7$--$0.4$. This could indicate spurious systematic errors in KiDS-1000, inaccuracies in the intrinsic alignment (IA) model, or potentially a non-standard cosmological model with delayed structure growth. In the near future, analysing data from stage-IV surveys with our algorithm promises a substantially more precise reconstruction of the power spectrum.</description>

      <title>Challenges and Opportunities for time-delay cosmography with multi-messenger gravitational lensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04472v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strong gravitational lensing of variable sources, such as quasars or supernovae, can be used to constrain cosmological parameters through a technique known as "time-delay cosmography''. Competitive constraints on the Hubble constant have been achieved with electromagnetic observations of lensed quasars and lensed supernovae. Gravitational wave (GW) astronomy may open up a new channel for time-delay cosmography with GW signal replacing the electromagnetic (EM) one. We highlight the similarities of using GW signals to be applied to time-delay cosmography compared to EM signal. We then discuss key differences between GW and EM signals and their resulting advantages and inconveniences from the angle of the current state-of-the-art using quasars and lensed supernovae for time-delay cosmography. We identify the astrometric precision requirement of the images as a key challenge to overcome and highlight the potentially significant impact that near-perfect time-delay measurements of lensed GWs can bring to the table.</description>

      <title>Dark energy and lensing anomaly in Planck CMB data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04641v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the impact of the lensing anomaly in Planck cosmic microwave background (CMB) data on the nature of dark energy (DE). We constrain the state equation ($w_0,w_a$) of DE with the lensing scaling parameter $A_L=1$ and varying $A_L$, using the Planck PR3 and two updated Planck PR4 likelihoods, CamSpec and HiLLiPoP respectively, combined with DESI baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) and Pantheon+ supernova data. As expected, when $A_L$ is allowed to vary, the evolving DE is not preferred due to the degeneracy between $w_0,w_a$ and $A_L$. In particular, we also consider replacing DESI BAO data with pre-DESI BAO in our analysis, and observe that DESI BAO appears to exacerbate the lensing anomaly, which is caused by the smaller matter density $\Omega_m$ it prefers, however, this effect can be offset by the shifts in $w_0$ and $w_a$ preferring the evolving DE. Our work indicates that the lensing anomaly in Planck data is worth carefully reconsidering when one combined new cosmological survey data with CMB.</description>

      <title>Is there a chiral dark dynamo in the universe induced by quantum correction, Nieh-Yan gravity and Barbero-Immirzi field?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bombagcino investigated the role of Immirzi parameter when promoted to a field in Einstein-Cartan-Holst black hole and they found that the Immirzi field acts similar to the axion field, as both axial pseudo-vector and vectorial torsion trace appear to be expressed in terms of the 4-gradient of the Immirzi parameter. In this paper we introduced two important ingredients absent in the previous work: the torsion mass, significant for the torsion detection the Large Hadron Collider, and the quantum correction proportional to the 4-divergent of torsion squared. Without the quantum correction, a simple analytical solution is obtained, while the more complicated field equations incorporating the BI field are obtained also analytically. The lower bound of quantum correction parameter is determined in terms of the torsion trace mass squared and axial torsion squared. Our findings reveal that in the late universe, the BI parameter approaches infinity restoring to the Einstein-Cartan theory in the early universe with the dynamical reduction of the Immirzi parameter to a constant BI parameter. Additionally, we derive analytical solutions for magnetic dynamos in the early universe, demonstrating that magnetic helicity is proportional to chiral chemical potential. A magnetic field at the QCD phase is found out of $10^{17}$ G, without quantum correction. Furthermore, from this dark magnetogenesis, we estimate light torsion with mass of the order of 1 TeV, An example of unitary preserved Lagrangian with axion as an Immirzi field is obtained. In the present universe we find a magnetic field strength of approximately $10^{-12}$ G which is quite close to the range found by Miniati at the QCD threshold, between $10^{-18}-10^{-15}$ G. Given that unitary violation on theoretical grounds may indicate new physics, exploring unitary violations in dark magnetogenesis could be particularly intriguing.</description>

      <title>The XXL Survey LIV. X-ray Luminosity Function and Luminosity-Mass Relation of Optically Selected Galaxy Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04816v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The overlap between the GAMA spectroscopic survey and the XXL X-ray survey was used to study the X-ray properties of optically-selected groups of galaxies. Forced X-ray aperture photometry was applied to an optically-selected sample of 235 groups (containing at least five member galaxies) to measure their X-ray luminosities in the regime of low signal to noise X-ray data. The sample encompasses X-ray luminosities over an order of magnitude fainter than typical X-ray selected samples, and avoids X-ray selection biases. This gives access to low mass groups where the effects of non-gravitational processes, such as AGN-feedback, should be most apparent and could inhibit their detection in an X-ray survey. We measured the X-ray luminosity function (XLF) of the sample, and found it to be consistent with the extrapolation of the XLF from X-ray selected samples at higher luminosities. The XLF was combined with a theoretical halo mass function to infer the form of the scaling relation between X-ray luminosity and mass (LM relation) for the GAMA groups. We found a slope of $1.87 \pm 0.12$, which is steeper than self similarity in this mass regime. When comparing with other measurements of the LM relation, we find evidence for a steepening of the slope in the low mass regime, likely due to the impact of non-gravitational processes. Our approach can be translated to eROSITA data using multi-wavelength surveys to constrain the X-ray properties of galaxy groups in the limits of high redshift and low mass.</description>

      <title>Radio emission from a massive node of the cosmic web. A discovery powered by machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04823v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aims. We aim to understand the nature of the diffuse radio emission surrounding the massive galaxy cluster PSZ2 G083.29-31.03, at z=0.412, already known to host a radio halo. Our investigation was triggered by Radio U-Net, a novel machine learning algorithm for detecting diffuse radio emission, which was previously applied to the LOFAR Two Meter Sky Survey (LoTSS). Methods. We re-processed LoTSS (120-168 MHz) data and analyzed archival XMM-Newton (0.7-1.2 keV) observations. We also analyzed optical and near-infrared data from the DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys and asses the mass distribution with weak-lensing analysis based on archival Subaru Suprime-Cam and CFHT MegaPrime/MegaCam observations. Results. We report the discovery of large-scale diffuse radio emission around PSZ2 G083.29-31.03, with a projected largest linear size of 5 Mpc at 144 MHz. The radio emission is aligned with the thermal X-ray emission and the distribution of galaxies, unveiling the presence of two low-mass systems, at similar redshifts on either side of the central cluster. The weak lensing analysis supports this scenario, demonstrating the presence of an extended and complex mass distribution. Conclusions. We propose to interpret the two faint radio sources as connected to the central cluster, thus illuminating the presence of two substructures merging into a massive node of the cosmic web. However, because of uncertainties in redshift and mass estimates, combined with the low resolution required to detect these sources, the classification of the two sources as independent radio halos associated with nearby low-mass clusters or even as a mixture of different types of diffuse radio emission cannot be definitively ruled out.</description>

      <title>Observational constraints on vector-like dark energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04828v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The canonical cosmological model to explain the recent acceleration of the universe relies on a cosmological constant, and most dynamical dark energy and modified gravity model alternatives are based on scalar fields. Still, further alternatives are possible. One of these involves vector fields: under certain conditions, they can lead to accelerating universes while preserving large-scale homogeneity and isotropy. We report quantitative observational constraints on a model previously proposed by Armend\'ariz-Pic\'on and known as the cosmic triad. We consider several subclasses of the model, which generically is a parametric extension of the canonical $\Lambda$CDM model, as well as two possible choices of the triad's potential. Our analysis shows that any deviations from this limit are constrained to be small. In particular the preferred present-day values of the matter density and the dark energy equation of state are fully consistent with those obtained, for the same datasets, in flat $\Lambda$CDM and $w_0$CDM. The constraints mildly depend on the priors on the dark energy equation of state, specifically on whether phantom values thereof are allowed, while the choice of potential does not play a significant role since any such potential is constrained to be relatively flat.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Galactic Halo Reconstruction from Rotation Curves in Self-Interacting Fuzzy Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04838v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fuzzy Dark Matter with an explicitly non-zero quartic self-interaction (gFDM) is shown to be a viable model for simultaneously fitting 17 dark-matter-dominated galaxies from the SPARC database, constraining both the boson mass, $m$, and the self-coupling constant, $g$, to values within the range $\log_{10}\left(\frac{m}{\mathrm{eV}/c^2}\right) = \log_{10}(1.98)-22^{+0.8}_{-0.6}$ and $\log_{10}\left(\frac{g}{\mathrm{Jm}^3/kg}\right) = \log_{10}(1.45)-28^{+0.4}_{-1.2}$; this is based on the combination of an appropriately constructed static super-Gaussian profile for the inner galactic core (`soliton') region, and a Navarro-Frenk-White profile for the surrounding halo region. Identification of these parameters enables the explicit {\em dynamical} reconstruction of potential host halos for such galaxies, for which we outline a procedure with a proof-of-principle demonstration for two galaxies (UGCA444, UGC07866) shown to yield viable rotation curves over a dynamical period of $O(1) \, Gyr$.</description>

      <title>The head-tail radio galaxy and revived fossil plasma in Abell 1775</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Head-tail radio galaxies are characterized by a head, corresponding to an elliptical galaxy, and two radio jets sweeping back from the head, forming an extended structure behind the host galaxy that is moving through the intracluster medium (ICM). This morphology arises from the interaction between the diffuse radio-emitting plasma and the surrounding environment. Sometimes revived fossil plasma is found in galaxy clusters, tracing old active galactic nucleus ejecta with a very steep spectrum re-energized through processes in the ICM, unrelated to the progenitor galaxy. We aim to study the central region of Abell 1775, a galaxy cluster in an unclear dynamical state at z = 0.072. It hosts two giant radio-loud elliptical galaxies, the head-tail radio galaxy that "breaks" at the position of a cold front detected in the X-rays, filamentary revived fossil plasma, and central diffuse emission. This study aims to investigate and constrain the spectral properties and trends along the head-tail, as well as the revived fossil plasma, to better understand the formation process of the non-thermal phenomena in A1775. We make use of LOFAR (144 MHz), and new deep uGMRT observations (400 and 650 MHz). We observe an overall steepening along the tail of the head-tail radio galaxy. In the radio colour-colour diagram, ageing models reproduce the emission of the head-tail. An unexpected brightness increase at the head of the tail suggests a complex bending of the jets. We derived the equipartition magnetic field and minimum pressure along the tail. We recovered the structure of the revived fossil plasma, which appears as thin filaments with ultra-steep spectra. We show that high-sensitivity, high-resolution observations at low frequencies are essential for detecting the full extent of the tail, enabling a deeper spectral analysis and resolving the structure and spectral properties of revived fossil plasma.</description>

      <title>Robustness of Dark Energy Phenomenology Across Different Parameterizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04929v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent evidence for dynamical dark energy from DESI, in combination with other cosmological data, has generated significant interest in understanding the nature of dark energy and its underlying microphysics. However, interpreting these results critically depends on how dark energy is parameterized. This paper examines the robustness of conclusions about the viability of particular kinds of dynamical dark energy models to the choice of parameterization, focusing on four popular two-parameter families: the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL), Jassal-Bagla-Padmanabhan (JBP), Barboza-Alcaniz (BA), and exponential (EXP) parameterizations. We find that conclusions regarding the viability of minimally and non-minimally coupled quintessence models are independent of the parameterization adopted. We demonstrate this both by mapping these dark energy models into the $(w_0, w_a)$ parameter space defined by these various parameterizations and by showing that all of these parameterizations can equivalently account for the phenomenology predicted by these dark energy models to a high degree of accuracy.</description>

      <title>Relationship between 2D and 3D Galaxy Stellar Mass and Correlations with Halo Mass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05158v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent studies suggest that the stars in the outer regions of massive galaxies trace halo mass better than the inner regions and that an annular stellar mass provides a low scatter method of selecting galaxy clusters. However, we can only observe galaxies as projected two-dimensional objects on the sky. In this paper, we use a sample of simulated galaxies to study how well galaxy stellar mass profiles in three dimensions correlate with halo mass, and what effects arise when observationally projecting stellar profiles into two dimensions. We compare 2D and 3D outer stellar mass selections and find that they have similar performance as halo mass proxies and that, surprisingly, a 2D selection sometimes has marginally better performance. We also investigate whether the weak lensing profiles around galaxies selected by 2D outer stellar mass suffer from projection effects. We find that the lensing profiles of samples selected by 2D and 3D definitions are nearly identical, suggesting that the 2D selection does not create a bias. These findings underscore the promise of using outer stellar mass as a tool for identifying galaxy clusters.</description>

      <title>Finding Pegasus: Enhancing Unsupervised Anomaly Detection in High-Dimensional Data using a Manifold-Based Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04310v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unsupervised machine learning methods are well suited to searching for anomalies at scale but can struggle with the high-dimensional representation of many modern datasets, hence dimensionality reduction (DR) is often performed first. In this paper we analyse unsupervised anomaly detection (AD) from the perspective of the manifold created in DR. We present an idealised illustration, "Finding Pegasus", and a novel formal framework with which we categorise AD methods and their results into "on manifold" and "off manifold". We define these terms and show how they differ. We then use this insight to develop an approach of combining AD methods which significantly boosts AD recall without sacrificing precision in situations employing high DR. When tested on MNIST data, our approach of combining AD methods improves recall by as much as 16 percent compared with simply combining with the best standalone AD method (Isolation Forest), a result which shows great promise for its application to real-world data.</description>

      <title>Searching for coupled, hyperlight scalars across cosmic history</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04432v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cosmological scalar fields coupled to the Standard Model drive temporal variations in the fundamental constants that grow with redshift, positioning the early Universe as a powerful tool to study such models. We investigate the dynamics and phenomenology of coupled scalars from the early Universe to the present to consistently leverage the myriad searches for time-varying constants and the cosmological signatures of scalars' gravitational effects. We compute the in-medium contribution from Standard Model particles to the scalar's dynamics and identify only a limited range of couplings for which the scalar has an observable impact on the fundamental constants without either evolving before recombination or gravitating nonnegligibly. We then extend existing laboratory and astrophysical bounds to the hyperlight scalar regime. We present joint limits from the early and late Universe, specializing to hyperlight, quadratically coupled scalars that modulate the mass of the electron or the strength of electromagnetism and make up a subcomponent of the dark matter today. Our dedicated analysis of observations of the cosmic microwave background, baryon acoustic oscillations, and type Ia supernovae provides the most stringent constraints on quadratically coupled scalars with masses from $10^{-28.5}$ to $\sim 10^{-31}~\mathrm{eV}$, below which quasar absorption spectra yield stronger bounds. These results jointly limit hyperlight scalars that comprise a few percent of the current dark matter density to near- or subgravitational couplings to electrons or photons.</description>

      <title>Higgs-Induced Gravitational Waves: the Interplay of Non-Minimal Couplings, Kination and Top Quark Mass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04445v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore a minimal scenario where the sole Standard-Model Higgs is responsible for reheating the Universe after inflation, produces a significant background of gravitational waves and maintains the full classical stability of the electroweak vacuum. As the Higgs self-coupling runs toward negative values at high energy scales, a non-minimal interaction with curvature during a stiff background expansion era drives the Higgs fluctuations closer to the instability scale. This curvature-induced tachyonic instability leads to an intense production of Higgs particles, accompanied by a stochastic gravitational-wave background. The characteristic features of such signal can be directly correlated to the inflationary scale, the non-minimal coupling parameter and the top quark Yukawa coupling. We distinguish between three possible scenarios: absolute stability with low top quark masses, potential vacuum instability, and absolute stability with new physics above the instability scale. Our findings suggest that the detection of a peaked background of gravitational waves together with its inflationary tail has the potential to unveil the features of the Higgs effective potential at very high energy scales while providing a minimal explanation for the reheating phase and the emergence of the Standard-Model plasma in the early Universe. Unlike other studies in the literature, the generation of gravitational waves in our scenario does not depend on the quantum instability of the Standard Model vacuum.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Axion-wind near Earth's Surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04456v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Several detection strategies for wave-like dark matter make use of gradients in the dark matter field, e.g. searches for spin-dependent derivative interactions in CASPEr-wind or experiments looking for oscillating forces. These gradients are usually suppressed by the local dark matter velocity $\sim 10^{-3}$. In this note we investigate how these gradients are modified in the presence of additional quadratic interactions of the dark matter field with ordinary matter. In this case the dark matter density and field are modified in the vicinity of Earth, affecting the detection sensitivity due to the change in the local field value at the Earth's surface but also due to the gradient of the field profile itself. We also use this opportunity to present results on the expected field profiles in presence of a non-vanishing relative velocity of the dark matter with respect to Earth. We also comment how this ameliorates the divergences that appear for certain attractive coupling values.</description>

      <title>Correspondence between Myrzakulov $F(R,Q)$ gravity and Tsallis cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04462v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the correspondence between Myrzakulov $F(R,Q)$ gravity and Tsallis cosmology. The former is a modified gravity that uses both curvature and nonmetricity, while the latter is a modified cosmology arising from the gravity-thermodynamics conjecture, employing Tsallis entropy instead of the Bekenstein-Hawking one. By appropriately identifying the functional dependencies and the model parameters, we demonstrate that both frameworks can give identical background evolution, reproducing the standard cosmological sequence of matter and dark energy domination. However, their perturbation behavior exhibits differences, since the growth of density fluctuations and the effective Newton constant deviate between the two scenarios, indicating that perturbative observables, such as structure formation and weak-lensing ones, could serve as distinguishing factors between them.</description>

      <title>Observations of Holographic Quantum-Foam Blurring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04474v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The "foamy" nature of spacetime at the Planck scale was an idea first introduced by John Wheeler in the 1950s. And for the last twenty years or so it has been debated whether those inherent uncertainties in time and path-length might also accumulate in transiting electromagnetic wavefronts, resulting in measurable blurring for images of distant galaxies and quasars. A confusing aspect is that "pointlike" objects will always be blurred out somewhat by the optics of a telescope, especially in the optical. But it turns out that Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) are more useful to test this, and have been observed by a host of ground-based and space-based telescopes, including by the Fermi observatory for well over a decade. And a recent one was unprecedented: GRB221009A was extremely bright, allowing follow-up from the infrared through the ultraviolet to X-rays and gamma-rays, including a first association with photons at high TeV energies. I will discuss how that observation is in direct tension with the calculus of how spacetime "foaminess" can add up in an image of a pointsource at cosmological distances, which at high-enough energy could spread these out over the whole sky without resulting in photon loss. A simple multiwavelength average of foam-induced blurring consistent with holographic quantum gravity is described, analogous to atmospheric seeing from the ground. This fits with measured instrumental point-spread functions and with the highest-energy localization of GRB221009A, resolving the observational issues and pointing to a key physical implication: spacetime does not look smooth.</description>

      <title>Core to Cosmic Edge: SIMBA-C's New Take on Abundance Profiles in the Intragroup Medium at z = 0</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04657v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We employ the SIMBA-C cosmological simulation to study the impact of its upgraded chemical enrichment model (Chem5) on the distribution of metals in the intragroup medium (IGrM). We investigate the projected X-ray emission-weighted abundance profiles of key elements over two decades in halo mass ($10^{13} \leq M_{500}/\mathrm{M_\odot} \leq 10^{15}$). Typically, SIMBA-C generates lower-amplitude abundance profiles than SIMBA with flatter cores, in better agreement with observations. For low-mass groups, both simulations over-enrich the IGrM with Si, S, Ca, and Fe compared to observations, a trend likely related to inadequate modeling of metal dispersal and mixing. We analyze the 3D mass-weighted abundance profiles, concluding that the lower SIMBA-C IGrM abundances are primarily a consequence of fewer metals in the IGrM, driven by reduced metal yields in Chem5, and the removal of the instantaneous recycling of metals approximation employed by SIMBA. Additionally, an increased IGrM mass in low-mass SIMBA-C groups is likely triggered by changes to the AGN and stellar feedback models. Our study suggests that a more realistic chemical enrichment model broadly improves agreement with observations, but physically motivated sub-grid models for other key processes, like AGN and stellar feedback and turbulent diffusion, are required to realistically reproduce observed group environments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.05052v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We outline the theory of spin QGP (quark-gluon plasma) magnetization. We explore the primordial epoch shortly after the Big-Bang within temperatures of 150 MeV to 500 MeV, also of interest to laboratory experiments. The ferro-magnetized fermion gas we consider consists of (light) quarks in laboratory QGP, and also leptons (electrons) for the case of the primordial Universe. We show that a fully spin-polarized up-quark gas could generate cosmic magnetic fields in excess of $10^{15}$ Tesla. We suggest that even a weakly spin-polarized gas would have a profound impact on properties of the primordial Universe which can be explored in laboratory QGP experiments. We present details of how the magnetization is obtained using a grand partition function approach. This requires evaluating slowly convergent magnetized Fermi-Dirac integrals.</description>

      <title>Testing Cotton gravity as dark matter substitute with weak lensing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07215v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Harada proposed a modified theory of gravity called Cotton gravity, and argued that it successfully explains the rotation curves of $84$ galaxies without the need of dark matter. In this work we use galaxy-galaxy lensing technique to test whether the modification effect of Cotton gravity can indeed be a viable substitute for dark matter. Using the spherically symmetric solution of Cotton gravity, we obtain the deflection angle via Gauss-Bonnet theorem and the weak lensing shear. We use five galaxy catalogs divided in 5 stellar mass bins from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 7 (SDSS DR7), each of which is further divided into blue star forming galaxy and red passive galaxy sub-catalogs. We find that Cotton gravity on its own has significant deviation from the measured galaxy-galaxy lensing signals, thus it cannot replace the role of dark matter. If we consider the combination of dark matter and Cotton gravity, the modification is tightly constrained. Our analysis also applies to other modified gravity theories whose an additional linear term appears in the Schwarzschild solution.</description>

      <title>Anisotropy of Nanohertz Gravitational Wave Background and Individual Sources from Supermassive Binary Black Holes Based on Cosmological Simulation</title>

Abstract: Several pulsar timing array (PTA) groups have recently claimed the detection of nanohertz gravitational wave background (GWB), but the origin of this gravitational wave (GW) signal remains unclear. Nanohertz GWs generated by supermassive binary black holes (SMBBHs) are one of the most important GW sources in the PTA band. Utilizing data from cosmological simulation, we construct a comprehensive dataset of SMBBHs within a mock observable universe incorporates the cosmic large-scale structure. We carry out an exhaustive analysis of the distribution characteristics of these merger events, as well as the GWB signals they produce. Specifically, we predict the characteristic amplitude of GWB to be $h_c=4.85\times10^{-16}$ at the frequency of ${\rm yr^{-1}}$, while the energy density of GWB signal exhibit an anisotropic part with $C_1/C_0\approx2.50\times10^{-3}\pm2.04\times10^{-3}$. We study the clustering pattern of the positional distribution of SMBBHs, and found that they show similar behavior with that of galaxies on relatively small scales. Furthermore, for the upcoming Chinese Pulsar Timing Array (CPTA) and Square Kilometre Array (SKA)-PTA, we predict the spatial distribution, numbers and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) distribution of individual GW sources that may be detected with SNR$&gt;$8, and study the anisotropic properties in the spatial distribution of these individual GW sources. We finally investigated the impact of lensing effects and found that their influence is rather limited.</description>

      <title>AI-assisted super-resolution cosmological simulations IV: An emulator for deterministic realizations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09051v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Super-resolution (SR) models in cosmological simulations use deep learning (DL) to rapidly enhance low-resolution (LR) runs with statistically correct fine details. These models preserves large-scale structures by conditioning on an LR version of the simulation. On smaller scales, the generative process is inherently stochastic, producing multiple possible SR realizations with distinct small-scale structures. Validation of reconstructed SR runs from LR simulations requires ensuring that specific statistics of interest are accurately reproduced by comparing SR outputs with target high resolution (HR) runs. In this study, we develop an emulator designed to reproduce the small-scale structures of target HR simulation with high fidelity. By processing an SR realization alongside the high-resolution initial condition (HRIC), we transform the SR output to emulate the result of a full simulation with that HRIC. By comparing various metrics, from visualization to individual halo measurements, we demonstrate that the emulated SR runs closely align with the target HR simulation, even at length scales an order of magnitude smaller than the corresponding LR run. These results show the potential of this method for efficiently generating accurate simulations and mock observations for large galaxy surveys.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17019v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that a Universe with a nonminimally coupled scalar field can fit current measurements of the expansion rate of the Universe better than the standard $\Lambda$-Cold Dark Matter ($\Lambda$CDM) model or other minimally coupled dark energy models. In particular, the nonminimal coupling in this model allows for the dark energy model to exhibit stable phantom crossing behavior, which seems to be suggested by the constraints on the dark energy equation of state coming from the most recent data. While we find a clear improvement in the goodness of fit for this dark energy model with respect to others that have been considered in the recent literature, using information theoretic criteria, we show that the evidence for it is still inconclusive.</description>

      <title>Non-Gaussian Statistics of Nanohertz Stochastic Gravitational Waves</title>

Abstract: Recent detection of nHz stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) by multiple pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) has stimulated intensive discussions about its physical origin. In principle, either supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs) or processes in the early universe may be the sources. One key difference between the two lies in the statistics of the SGWB frequency power spectrum. In particular, the often assumed Gaussian random SGWB does not accurately describe the distribution of the collective SMBHB emission. In this work, we present a semi-analytical framework for calculating the non-Gaussian statistics of SGWB power expected from SMBHBs. We find that (a) wave interference between individual SMBHBs with indistinguishable observed frequencies and (b) the Poisson fluctuation of the source numbers, together shape the non-Gaussian statistics. Implementing the non-Gaussian statistics developed in this work, we investigate the sensitivity of current and future PTA datasets in distinguishing the origin of the SGWB through non-Gaussian information. Additionally, we find an interesting approximation of the non-Gaussian statistics, which has implications for accurately and practically treating non-Gaussianity in PTA Bayesian analyses.</description>

      <title>Neural Networks for cosmological model selection and feature importance using Cosmic Microwave Background data</title>

Abstract: The measurements of the temperature and polarisation anisotropies of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) by the ESA Planck mission have strongly supported the current concordance model of cosmology. However, the latest cosmological data release from ESA Planck mission still has a powerful potential to test new data science algorithms and inference techniques. In this paper, we use advanced Machine Learning (ML) algorithms, such as Neural Networks (NNs), to discern among different underlying cosmological models at the angular power spectra level, using both temperature and polarisation Planck 18 data. We test two different models beyond $\Lambda$CDM: a modified gravity model: the Hu-Sawicki model, and an alternative inflationary model: a feature-template in the primordial power spectrum. Furthermore, we also implemented an interpretability method based on SHAP values to evaluate the learning process and identify the most relevant elements that drive our architecture to certain outcomes. We find that our NN is able to distinguish between different angular power spectra successfully for both alternative models and $\Lambda$CDM. We conclude by explaining how archival scientific data has still a strong potential to test novel data science algorithms that are interesting for the next generation of cosmological experiments.</description>

      <title>Scale-dependence in $\Lambda$CDM parameters inferred from the CMB: a possible sign of Early Dark Energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10559v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The early dark energy (EDE) model is one of the promising solutions to the Hubble tension. One of the successes of the EDE model is that it can provide a similar fit to the $\Lambda$CDM model for the CMB power spectrum. In this work, I analyze the phenomenology of the EDE and $\Lambda$CDM parameters on the CMB temperature power spectrum and notice that this cannot hold on all scales. Thus, if the real cosmology is as described by the EDE model, the $\Lambda$CDM parameters will be scale-dependent when fitting the CMB power spectrum with the $\Lambda$CDM model, which can be hints for the EDE model. I examine CMB-S4-like observations through mock data analysis and find that parameter shifts are notable. As observations include smaller scales, I find lower $H_0$, $n_s$, $\omega_b$ and higher $\omega_m$, $A_s e^{-2\tau}$, which will also constitute new tensions with other observations. They can serve as a possible signal for the EDE model.</description>

      <title>Cooling rate and turbulence in the intracluster medium of the cool-core cluster Abell 2667</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16831v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a detailed analysis of the thermal X-ray emission from the intracluster medium (ICM) in the cool-core galaxy cluster Abell 2667 ($z=0.23$). Our goal is to detect low-temperature ($&lt;2$ keV) X-ray emitting gas, potentially associated to a cooling flow that connects the hot ICM reservoir to the cold gas phase responsible for star formation and supermassive black hole feeding. We use new deep XMM-Newton EPIC and RGS data, combined with archival Chandra data, to perform a spectral analysis for the core region. We find 1$\sigma$ upper limits to the cooling gas fraction of $\sim$40 $\rm M_{\odot}yr^{-1}$ and $\sim$50-60 $\rm M_{\odot}yr^{-1}$ in the temperature ranges 0.5-1 keV and 1-2 keV, respectively. The lack of OVII, FeXXI-FeXXII, and FeXVII emission lines in the RGS spectra suggest that the fraction of gas cooling below 1 keV is limited to a few tens of $\rm M_{\odot}yr^{-1}$ at most. However, we detect several lines (e.g. SiXIV, MgXII, FeXXIII/FeXXIV, NeX, OVIII$\alpha$) that allow us to estimate a 1$\sigma$ upper limit for turbulent broadening of $\sim$320 km $\rm s^{-1}$, higher that other cool-core clusters such as Abell 1835, implying mechanisms that boost turbulence in Abell 2667's atmosphere. Imaging analysis of Chandra data suggests the presence of a cold front, possibly lined to sloshing or ICM cavities. However, current data do not clearly identify the physical mechanism driving turbulence. These finding indicate that Abell 2667 is similar to other low-redshift cool-core clusters, though the large upper limit on turbulence hints at significant ICM heating, which may suppress cooling for extended periods and contribute to future condensation events.</description>

      <title>Reheating chiral dynamos with spin-0 and massive spin-1 torsions via chiral asymmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00419v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, Syderenko et al. (JCAP, 10: 018, 2016) investigated magnetogenesis and chiral asymmetry in the early hot universe. This study explores the impact of minimally coupling a constant torsion in their cosmological model, suggesting new chiral physics. Physically, this means that if torsion is right chiral, the difference between the number of right and left chiralities does not change. Moreover, the decay of chiral asymmetry depends on torsion chirality. We solve the chiral torsionful dynamo equation for magnetic field seeds. Magnetic helical fields are considered important for chiral fermion asymmetry. Even in $(3+1)$ dimensional spacetime, torsion is highly suppressed beyond inflation (Eur Phys J C 82: 291, 2022). However, torsion of $1\,\mathrm{MeV}$ appears in the early universe. Equations for correlated magnetic field coefficients are solved in terms of torsion. Weak magnetic fields of the order of $10^{-42}$ Gauss are boosted by powerful torsionful dynamo amplification, generating a much stronger magnetic field of the order of $10^{-9}$ Gauss in the present universe. A galactic magnetic field of $10^{-6}$ Gauss in the present universe, with torsion of $10^{-15}$ Gauss, leads us to a galactic dynamo seed of $10^{-9}$ Gauss. We also discuss reheating dynamo regeneration of decaying cosmic magnetic fields during the hadronization era. The relation between the reheating contribution to e-folds and the connection between CMF and temperature squared allows us to obtain dynamo amplification in terms of N-folds of inflation. The main innovation of this work is the exploration of constant torsion in a cosmological model, revealing new chiral physics. This study offers a new perspective on the origin and evolution of magnetic fields in the early universe.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15038v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Continuous gravitational waves (CGWs) from various astrophysical sources are one of the many future probes of upcoming gravitational wave (GW) search missions. Neutron stars (NSs) with deformity are one of the leading sources of CGW emissions. In this work, for the first time, a novel attempt to estimate the dark matter (DM) capture rate is performed using CGW as the probe to the local NS population. Competitive bounds on DM capture from the local NS population are reported when compared with DM direct search experiments and other astrophysical observations.</description>

      <title>Discrete dark matter with light Dirac neutrinos</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17861v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a new realisation of light Dirac neutrino mass and dark matter (DM) within the framework of a non-Abelian discrete flavour symmetry based on $A_4$ group. In addition to $A_4$, we also consider a $Z_2$ and an unbroken global lepton number symmetry $U(1)_L$ to keep unwanted terms away while guaranteeing the Dirac nature of light neutrinos. The field content, their transformations and flavon vacuum alignments are chosen in such a way that the type-I Dirac seesaw generates only one light Dirac neutrino mass while the other two masses arise from scotogenic contributions at one-loop. This leads to the Dirac scoto-seesaw framework, a generalisation of the widely studied scoto-seesaw model to Dirac neutrinos. The symmetry breaking of $A_4$ leaves a remnant $\mathcal{Z}_2$ symmetry responsible for stabilising DM. Dirac nature of light neutrinos introduces additional relativistic degrees of freedom $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$ within reach of cosmic microwave background experiments.</description>

      <title>Pseudo-Dirac Neutrinos and Relic Neutrino Matter Effect on the High-energy Neutrino Flavor Composition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18507v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that if neutrinos are pseudo-Dirac, they can potentially affect the flavor ratio predictions for the high-energy astrophysical neutrino flux observed by IceCube. In this context, we point out a novel matter effect induced by the cosmic neutrino background (C$\nu$B) on the flavor ratio composition. Specifically, the active-sterile neutrino oscillations over the astrophysical baseline lead to an energy-dependent flavor ratio at Earth due to the C$\nu$B matter effect, which is in principle distinguishable from the vacuum oscillation effect, provided there is an asymmetry between the neutrino and antineutrino number densities, as well as a local C$\nu$B overdensity. Considering the projected precision of the 3-neutrino oscillation parameter measurements and improved flavor triangle measurements, we show that the next-generation neutrino telescopes, such as KM3NeT and IceCube-Gen2, can in principle probe the pseudo-Dirac neutrino hypothesis and the C$\nu$B matter effect.</description>

      <title>Inner radius and energy conditions of dark matter halos surrounding Schwarzschild black holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.05417v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a class of analytic models for a dark matter halo surrounding a Schwarzschild black hole sitting at the center of a galaxy, with a variable inner radius $r_{\text{in}}$ at which the density profile of the dark matter halo vanishes. We examine in detail how the three energy conditions are satisfied in such models. In particular, independent of concrete profile, we find that the three energy conditions are satisfied when $r_{\text{in}}\ge5M/2$, where $M$ denotes the mass of the black hole. This indicates it is crucial to include inner radius when discussing dark matter distributions. All our solutions expressed explicitly in closed form are particularly valuable for the studies of the gravitational waveforms of extreme/intermediate mass ratio inspirals and the nature of dark matter in galaxies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22155v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the present-day universe, the most massive galaxies are ellipticals located in the cores of galaxy clusters, harboring the heaviest super-massive black holes (SMBHs). However the mechanisms that drive the early growth phase and subsequent transformation of these morphology and kinematics of galaxies remain elusive. Here we report (sub)kiloparsec scale observations of stars, gas, and dust in ADF22.A1, a bright dusty starburst galaxy at z=3.1, hosting a heavily obscured active galactic nucleus and residing in a proto-cluster core. ADF22.A1 is a giant spiral galaxy with the kinematics of a rotating disk with rotation velocity Vrot=530+/-10km/s and diameter larger than 30 kpc. The high specific stellar angular momentum of this system, j*=3400+/-600 kpc km/s, requires a mechanism to effectively spin-up ADF22.A1, indicating the importance of accretion from the cosmic web to supply both gas and angular momentum to galaxies in their early gas-rich starburst phase. In its inner region, gas flows along dust lanes in a bar connected with the bright dusty core and the estimated mass ratio of a bulge to SMBH matches the local relation, suggesting that bars are a key mechanism to shape the early co-evolution of these components. Comparison with cosmological simulations shows that ADF22.A1 will likely evolve into a massive elliptical at the present day, experiencing a significant reduction in angular momentum associated with subsequent galaxy mergers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.05911v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the effects of Chern-Simons-Gauss-Bonnet gravity on fundamental metrics. This theory involves perturbative corrections to general relativity, as well as two scalar fields, the axion and the dilaton, that arise from Chern-Simons and Gauss-Bonnet gravity modifications respectively. The combined Chern-Simons-Gauss-Bonnet gravity is motivated by a wide range of theoretical and phenomenological perspectives, including particle physics, string theory, and parity violation in the gravitational sector. In this work, we provide the complete set of field equations and equations of motion of the Chern-Simons-Gauss-Bonnet modified gravity theory for a suite of fundamental metrics (Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker, Schwarzschild, spherically symmetric, and perturbed Minkowski), under no prior assumptions on the behavior of the fields. The full set of field equations and equations of motion can be numerically solved and applied to specific observables under certain assumptions, and can be used to place constraints on the Chern-Simons-Gauss-Bonnet modified gravity theory.</description>

Abstract: Alexei Alexandrovich Starobinsky was one of the greatest cosmologists of all times, who made fundamental contributions to gravitational theory and cosmology based on geometrical ideas in physics, in the spirit of Einstein. One of his big achievements is the famous Starobinsky model of cosmological inflation in the early universe, proposed in 1979-1980. In this memorial paper, the Starobinsky inflation model is systematically reviewed from the modern perspective. Its deformation to include production of primordial black holes is proposed, and possible quantum corrections in the context of superstring theory and the Swampland Program are discussed. Starobinsky inflation also leads to the universal reheating mechanism for particle production after inflation.</description>

Abstract: Domain walls formed during a phase transition in a simple field theory model with $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry in a periodic box have been demonstrated to annihilate as fast as causality allows and their area density scales $\propto t^{-1}$. We have performed numerical simulations of the dynamics of domain walls in the Two-Higgs Doublet Model (2HDM) where the potential has $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry in two spatial dimensions. We observed significant differences with the standard case. Although the extreme long-time limit is the same for the $\approx 10^{5}$ sets of random initial configurations analysed, the percolation process is much slower due to the formation of long-lived loops. We suggest that this is due to the build up of superconducting currents on the walls which could lead ultimately to stationary configurations known as Kinky Vortons. We discuss the relevance of these findings for the production of Vortons in three spatial dimensions.</description>
