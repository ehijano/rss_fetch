      <title>Multiple binding modes of AKT on PIP$_3$-containing membranes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21216v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The PI3K/AKT signaling pathway is triggered by recruitment of AKT to cellular membranes. Although AKT is a multidomain serine/threonine kinase composed of an N-terminal pleckstrin homology (PH) domain and a C-terminal kinase domain, how these domains cooperate to regulate AKT activation on membranes remains unclear at the molecular level. Here, using molecular dynamics simulations of full-length AKT on PIP$_3$-containing lipid bilayers, we identify four distinct membrane-binding modes that differ in the orientations and membrane contacts of the PH and kinase domains. In addition to PIP$_3$ binding to the PH domain, we observe specific PIP$_3$ interactions with basic residues in the kinase domain. In the most stable mode, PIP$_3$ interacts with both the canonical and a secondary binding site in the PH domain, while the kinase domain adopts an orientation in which the activation-loop phosphorylation site is exposed to the solvent. Interestingly, the populations of these binding modes depend on the PIP$_3$ concentration in the membrane, leading to changes in the preferred orientation of AKT. These findings shed light on how lipid recognition by the PH domain and the kinase domain of AKT cooperatively shape its membrane-bound conformations.</description>

      <title>AI Developments for T and B Cell Receptor Modeling and Therapeutic Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17138v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is accelerating progress in modeling T and B cell receptors by enabling predictive and generative frameworks grounded in sequence data and immune context. This chapter surveys recent advances in the use of protein language models, machine learning, and multimodal integration for immune receptor modeling. We highlight emerging strategies to leverage single-cell and repertoire-scale datasets, and optimize immune receptor candidates for therapeutic design. These developments point toward a new generation of data-efficient, generalizable, and clinically relevant models that better capture the diversity and complexity of adaptive immunity.</description>

      <title>RNAGenScape: Property-Guided, Optimized Generation of mRNA Sequences with Manifold Langevin Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24736v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generating property-optimized mRNA sequences is central to applications such as vaccine design and protein replacement therapy, but remains challenging due to limited data, complex sequence-function relationships, and the narrow space of biologically viable sequences. Generative methods that drift away from the data manifold can yield sequences that fail to fold, translate poorly, or are otherwise nonfunctional. We present RNAGenScape, a property-guided manifold Langevin dynamics framework for mRNA sequence generation that operates directly on a learned manifold of real data. By performing iterative local optimization constrained to this manifold, RNAGenScape preserves biological viability, accesses reliable guidance, and avoids excursions into nonfunctional regions of the ambient sequence space. The framework integrates three components: (1) an autoencoder jointly trained with a property predictor to learn a property-organized latent manifold, (2) a denoising autoencoder that projects updates back onto the manifold, and (3) a property-guided Langevin dynamics procedure that performs optimization along the manifold. Across three real-world mRNA datasets spanning two orders of magnitude in size, RNAGenScape increases median property gain by up to 148% and success rate by up to 30% while ensuring biological viability of generated sequences, and achieves competitive inference efficiency relative to existing generative approaches.</description>
