      <title>Ordering-disordering dynamics of the voter model under random external bias</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05669v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a variant of the two-state voter model in which agents update their states under a random external field (which points upward with probability $s$ and downward with probability $1-s$) with probability $p$ or adopt the unanimous opinion of $q$ randomly selected neighbors with probability $ 1-p$. Using mean-field analysis and Monte Carlo simulations, we identify an ordering-disorder transition at $p_c$ when $s=1/2$. Notably, in the regime of $p&gt;p_c$, we estimate the time for systems to reach polarization from consensus and find the logarithmic scaling $T_{\text{pol}} \sim \mathcal{B}\ln N$, with $\mathcal{B} = 1/(2p)$ for $q = 1$, while for $q &gt; 1$, $\mathcal{B}$ depends on both $p &gt; p_c$ and $q$. We observe that polarization dynamics slow down significantly for nonlinear strengths $q$ between $2$ and $3$, independent of the probability $p$. On the other hand, when $s=0$ or $s=1$, the system is bound to reach consensus, with the consensus time scaling logarithmically with system size as $T_{\text{con}} \sim \mathcal{B}\ln N$, where $\mathcal{B} = 1/p$ for $q = 1$ and $\mathcal{B} = 1$ for $q &gt; 1$. Furthermore, in the limit of $p = 0$, we analytically derive a general expression for the exit probability valid for arbitrary values of $q$, yielding universal scaling behavior. These results provide insights into how bipolar media environment and peer pressure jointly govern the opinion dynamics in social systems.</description>

      <title>Twenty-Five Years of the Intelligent Driver Model: Foundations, Extensions, Applications, and Future Directions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Intelligent Driver Model (IDM), proposed in 2000, has become a foundational tool in traffic flow modeling, renowned for its simplicity, computational efficiency, and ability to capture diverse traffic dynamics. Over the past 25 years, IDM has significantly advanced car-following theory and found extensive application in intelligent transportation systems, including driver assistance systems and autonomous vehicle control. However, IDM's deterministic framework and simplified assumptions face limitations in addressing real-world complexities such as stochastic variability, driver heterogeneity, and mixed traffic conditions. This paper provides a systematic review and critical reflection on IDM's theoretical foundations, academic influence, practical applications, and model extensions. While highlighting IDM's contributions, we emphasize the need to extend the model into a modular and extensible framework. Future directions include integrating stochastic elements, human behavioral insights, and hybrid modeling approaches that combine physics-based structures with data-driven methodologies. By reimagining IDM as a flexible modeling basis, this paper aims to inspire its continued development to meet the demands of intelligent, connected, and increasingly complex traffic systems.</description>

      <title>A Driving Regime-Embedded Deep Learning Framework for Modeling Intra-Driver Heterogeneity in Multi-Scale Car-Following Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05902v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A fundamental challenge in car-following modeling lies in accurately representing the multi-scale complexity of driving behaviors, particularly the intra-driver heterogeneity where a single driver's actions fluctuate dynamically under varying conditions. While existing models, both conventional and data-driven, address behavioral heterogeneity to some extent, they often emphasize inter-driver heterogeneity or rely on simplified assumptions, limiting their ability to capture the dynamic heterogeneity of a single driver under different driving conditions. To address this gap, we propose a novel data-driven car-following framework that systematically embeds discrete driving regimes (e.g., steady-state following, acceleration, cruising) into vehicular motion predictions. Leveraging high-resolution traffic trajectory datasets, the proposed hybrid deep learning architecture combines Gated Recurrent Units for discrete driving regime classification with Long Short-Term Memory networks for continuous kinematic prediction, unifying discrete decision-making processes and continuous vehicular dynamics to comprehensively represent inter- and intra-driver heterogeneity. Driving regimes are identified using a bottom-up segmentation algorithm and Dynamic Time Warping, ensuring robust characterization of behavioral states across diverse traffic scenarios. Comparative analyses demonstrate that the framework significantly reduces prediction errors for acceleration (maximum MSE improvement reached 58.47\%), speed, and spacing metrics while reproducing critical traffic phenomena, such as stop-and-go wave propagation and oscillatory dynamics.</description>

      <title>Measuring the co-evolution of online engagement with (mis)information and its visibility at scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06106v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Online attention is an increasingly valuable resource in the digital age, with extraordinary events such as the COVID-19 pandemic fuelling fierce competition around it. As misinformation pervades online platforms, users seek credible sources, while news outlets compete to attract and retain their attention. Here we measure the co-evolution of online "engagement" with (mis)information and its "visibility", where engagement corresponds to user interactions on social media, and visibility to fluctuations in user follower counts. Using a scalable temporal network modelling framework applied to over 100 million COVID-related retweets spanning 3 years, we find that highly engaged sources experience sharp spikes in follower growth during major events (e.g., vaccine rollouts, epidemic severity), whereas sources with more questionable credibility tend to sustain faster growth outside of these periods. Our framework lends itself to studying other large-scale events where online attention is at stake, such as climate and political debates.</description>

      <title>A bounded confidence model to predict how group work affects student math anxiety</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06351v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Math anxiety is negatively correlated with student performance and can result in avoidance of further math/STEM classes and careers. Cooperative learning (i.e., group work) is a proven strategy that can reduce math anxiety and has additional social and pedagogical benefits. However, depending on the group individuals, some peer interactions can mitigate anxiety while others exacerbate it. We propose a mathematical modeling approach to help untangle and explore this complex dynamic. We introduce a modification of the Hegselmann-Krause bounded confidence model, including both attractive and repulsive interactions to simulate how math anxiety levels are affected by pairwise student interactions. The model is simple but provides interesting qualitative predictions. In particular, Monte Carlo simulations show that there is an optimal group size to minimize average math anxiety, and that switching group members randomly at certain frequencies can dramatically reduce math anxiety levels. The model is easily adaptable to incorporate additional personal and societal factors, making it ripe for future research.</description>

      <title>Collective motion from quantum-inspired dynamics in visual perception</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18985v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a model of collective behavior in self-propelled active agents that incorporates a perceptual decision-making process. In this framework, the decision-making dynamics is modeled using quantum formalism. The perceptual decision state of each agent is an entangled or superposed state of the decision states for the neighboring agents within the vision cone. We suggest that in this framework, the force driving the movement of active agents is governed by the quantum average of its perception operator, providing a bridge between perceptual decision-making processes and classical dynamics. Additionally, we introduce two perceptual measures of cohesion in the flock, namely, perception strength and perceptual energy, to characterize collective behavior in terms of decision-making dynamics. Our model demonstrates that, with an appropriate choice of perceptual decision state, the well-known Vicsek model of flocking behavior can be derived as a specific case of this quantum-inspired approach. This approach provides fresh insights into collective behavior and multi-agent coordination, revealing how classical patterns of collective behavior emerge naturally from perception.</description>

      <title>Finance as Extended Biology: Reciprocity as the Cognitive Substrate of Financial Behavior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00099v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A central challenge in economics and artificial intelligence is explaining how financial behaviors-such as credit, insurance, and trade-emerge without formal institutions. We argue that these functions are not products of institutional design, but structured extensions of a single behavioral substrate: reciprocity. Far from being a derived strategy, reciprocity served as the foundational logic of early human societies-governing the circulation of goods, regulation of obligation, and maintenance of long-term cooperation well before markets, money, or formal rules. Trade, commonly regarded as the origin of financial systems, is reframed here as the canonical form of reciprocity: simultaneous, symmetric, and partner-contingent. Building on this logic, we reconstruct four core financial functions-credit, insurance, token exchange, and investment-as expressions of the same underlying principle under varying conditions. By grounding financial behavior in minimal, simulateable dynamics of reciprocal interaction, this framework shifts the focus from institutional engineering to behavioral computation-offering a new foundation for modeling decentralized financial behavior in both human and artificial agents.</description>

      <title>Computing well-balanced spanning trees of unweighted networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.06628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.06628v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A spanning tree of a network or graph is a subgraph that connects all nodes with the least number or weight of edges. The spanning tree is one of the most straightforward techniques for network simplification and sampling, and for discovering its backbone or skeleton. Prim's algorithm and Kruskal's algorithm are well-known algorithms for computing a spanning tree of a weighted network, and are therefore also the default procedure for unweighted networks in the most popular network libraries. In this paper, we empirically study the performance of these algorithms on unweighted networks and compare them with different priority-first search algorithms. We show that the structure of a network, such as the distances between the nodes, is better preserved by a simpler algorithm based on breadth-first search. The spanning trees are also most compact and well-balanced as measured by classical graph indices. We support our findings with experiments on synthetic graphs and more than a thousand real networks, and demonstrate practical applications of the computed spanning trees. We conclude that if a spanning tree is to maintain the structure of an unweighted network, the breadth-first search algorithm should be the preferred choice, and it should be implemented as such in network libraries.</description>

      <title>Spatiotemporal evolution of PM2.5 diffusion in Cheng-Yu urban agglomeration in response to COVID-19 lockdown using complex network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01502v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As the decrease in human activities resulting from the COVID-19 control measures had a significant impact on air quality, the epidemic provided an opportunity to investigate the extent to which air pollution is influenced by human activities and review existing measures. However, the corresponding diffusion pattern on a city scale is seldom mentioned at present stage, therefore, we chose the Cheng-Yu urban agglomeration, which is the largest city cluster in Southwest China, as our study area during the COVID-19 period, and attempted to investigate the process of PM2.5 diffusion using a complex network method. The results displayed that there was an evident external spillover effect of PM2.5 across all regions, and the PM2.5 spillovers were concentrated in several cities in the Cheng-Yu urban agglomeration during the lockdown period, whereas they are more dispersed during the recovery period. The overall decline in the impact of PM2.5 pollution source areas on receptor areas from a normal year to the pandemic year, and the intensity of PM2.5 spillover decreases gradually as the distance from the center increases. The implementation of the lockdown measures had an impact on both the input and output patterns of PM2.5 pollution in the region, the input pattern of PM2.5 pollution exhibited higher vulnerability, while the output pattern showed higher resilience. Additionally, the spillover relationship of PM2.5 pollution varies between different blocks, with relatively simple spillover relationships observed during the lockdown period and more complex dynamics during the recovery period. These findings have highlighted the importance of joint controls in combating regional air pollution.</description>

      <title>A semantic embedding space based on large language models for modelling human beliefs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07237v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Beliefs form the foundation of human cognition and decision-making, guiding our actions and social connections. A model encapsulating beliefs and their interrelationships is crucial for understanding their influence on our actions. However, research on belief interplay has often been limited to beliefs related to specific issues and relied heavily on surveys. We propose a method to study the nuanced interplay between thousands of beliefs by leveraging an online user debate data and mapping beliefs onto a neural embedding space constructed using a fine-tuned large language model (LLM). This belief space captures the interconnectedness and polarization of diverse beliefs across social issues. Our findings show that positions within this belief space predict new beliefs of individuals and estimate cognitive dissonance based on the distance between existing and new beliefs. This study demonstrates how LLMs, combined with collective online records of human beliefs, can offer insights into the fundamental principles that govern human belief formation.</description>

      <title>Risk and Reward of Transitioning from a National to a Zonal Electricity Market in Great Britain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04107v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: More spatially granular electricity wholesale markets promise more efficient operation and better asset siting in highly renewable power systems. Great Britain is considering moving from its current single-price national wholesale market to a zonal design. Existing studies reach varying and difficult-to-reconcile conclusions about the desirability of a zonal market in GB, partly because they rely on models that vary in their transparency and assumptions about future power systems. Using a novel open-source electricity market model, calibrated to match observed network behaviour, this article quantifies consumer savings, unit-level producer surplus impacts, and broader socioeconomic benefits that would have arisen had a six-zone market operated in Great Britain during 2022-2024. In the absence of mitigating policies, it is estimated that during those three years GB consumers would save approximately {\pounds}9.4/MWh (equalling an average of more than {\pounds}2.3B per year), but generators in northern regions would experience revenue reductions of 30-40\%. Policy interventions can restore these units' national market revenues to up to 97\% while still preserving around {\pounds}3.1/MWh in consumer savings (about {\pounds}750M per year). It is further estimated that the current system could achieve approximately {\pounds}380-{\pounds}770 million in annual welfare gain during 2022-2024 through improved operational efficiency alone. The drivers behind these benefits, notably wind curtailment volumes, are expected to become more pronounced towards 2030, suggesting that purely operationally achieved annual benefits of around {\pounds}1-2 billion beyond 2029 are likely. It is found that the scale of these benefits would outweigh the potential downsides related to increases in the cost of capital that have been estimated elsewhere.</description>
