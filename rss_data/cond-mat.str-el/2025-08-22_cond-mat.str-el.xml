      <title>Thermodynamics of dilute anyon gases from fusion constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14961v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent measurements on 2d materials tuning between fractional quantum anomalous Hall phases and a plethora of correlated electronic states call for a detailed understanding of the dynamics of anyons. Here we develop a general theory of the statistical mechanics of anyon gases at finite temperature, valid in regimes where the anyons are sufficiently dilute and can be treated as weakly interacting particles. We find that with a minimal set of universal braiding and fusion data, along with information about the hierarchy of anyon gaps, it is possible to construct a distribution function for any dilute anyon gas, as well as derive thermodynamic observables. Our results are built on an anyon exclusion principle manifesting as a constraint on fusion outcomes of physical states. Our approach unifies and streamlines a range of results for itinerant anyon models, from solvable lattice Hamiltonians to large-N field theories.</description>

      <title>The beginning of the endpoint bootstrap for conformal line defects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14964v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A challenge in the study of conformal field theory (CFT) is to characterize the possible defects in specific bulk CFTs. Given the success of numerical bootstrap techniques applied to the characterization of bulk CFTs, it is desirable to develop similar tools to study conformal defects. In this work, we successfully demonstrate this possibility for endable conformal line defects. We achieve this by incorporating the endpoints of a conformal line defect into the numerical four-point bootstrap and exploit novel crossing symmetry relations that mix bulk and defect CFT data in a way that further possesses positivity, so that rigorous numerical bootstrap techniques are applicable. We implement this approach for the pinning field line defect of the $3d$ Ising CFT, obtaining estimates of its defect CFT data that agree well with other recent estimates, particularly those obtained via the fuzzy sphere regularization. An interesting consequence of our bounds is nearly rigorous evidence that the $\mathbb Z_2$-symmetric defect exhibiting long range order obtained as a direct sum of two conjugate pinning field defects is unstable to domain wall proliferation.</description>

      <title>Role of Ward-Takahashi identity in an electron-phonon coupled system -- Revisiting phonon shift current</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15347v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study bulk photovoltaic effects in electron-phonon coupled systems. The conservation of current or gauge invariance, manifested as the Ward-Takahashi identity, plays an essential role in the analysis of the Feynman diagrams, and the leading order contribution to the phonon shift current is identified accordingly. The leading order contribution essentially arises from the electric polarization carried by optically excited phonons, where the shift current is generated due to a change of electric polarization in the steady state under the optical excitation of phonons.</description>

      <title>Constrained Random Phase Approximation: the spectral method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new constrained Random Phase Approximation (cRPA) method, termed spectral cRPA (s-cRPA), and compare it to established cRPA approaches for Scandium and Copper by varying the 3d shell filling. The s-cRPA consistently yields larger Hubbard $U$ interaction values. Applied to the realistic system CaFeO$_3$, s-cRPA produces interaction parameters significantly closer to those required within DFT+$U$ to induce the experimentally observed insulating state, overcoming the metallic behavior predicted by standard density functionals. We also address the issue of negative interaction values found in the projector cRPA method for filled d-shells, demonstrating that s-cRPA offers superior numerical stability through electron conversion. Overall, s-cRPA is more robust and effectively overcomes the known underestimation of $U$ in standard cRPA, making it a promising tool for the community. Additionally, we have enhanced our implementation with features for computing multi-center interactions to analyze spatial decay and developed a low-scaling variant with a compressed Matsubara grid to efficiently obtain full frequency-dependent interactions.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous nonreciprocal transport in a gate-tunable ferromagnetic Rashba 2-dimensional electron gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15424v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The broken inversion symmetry at interfaces of complex oxides gives rise to emergent phenomena, including ferromagnetism and Rashba spin-orbit coupling (SOC), which profoundly influence the electronic structure by entangling spin and momentum. While the interplay between Rashba SOC and ferromagnetism is theoretically intriguing, its experimental manifestations remain largely unexplored. Here, we demonstrate that ferromagnetic 2DEGs at SrTiO$_3$-based interfaces exhibit spontaneous nonreciprocal transport - a distinctive hallmark of Rashba ferromagnets - even in the absence of an external magnetic field. This nonreciprocal response, along with clear signatures of ferromagnetism such as anisotropic magnetoresistance and the anomalous Hall effect (AHE), is strongly tunable by gate voltage. Remarkably, the AHE not only varies in amplitude but even reverses sign, reflecting a subtle interplay between Fermi level position and Berry curvature distribution. These results establish SrTiO$_3$ 2DEGs as a model platform for studying Rashba ferromagnetism and demonstrate active control over transport phenomena in time- and inversion-symmetry-broken systems, paving the way for gate-tunable spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Classification of Magnetism and Altermagnetism in Quasicrystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15702v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Altermagnetism, an unconventional magnetic phase characterized by zero net magnetism and a spin-split electronic band, has been studied exclusively in conventional crystalline materials. In this work, we extend the theoretical framework of altermagnetism to quasicrystals (QCs), which lack translational symmetry. We classify magnetic phases in 2D QCs with $n$-fold rotational symmetry without spin-orbit coupling, by using the irreducible representation (IRRP) of the $D_n$ point group. Based on symmetry analysis, we propose the conjecture that magnetic phases corresponding to 1D non-identity IRRPs are generally altermagnetic, with the exception of those possessing parity-time symmetry. To verify our conjecture, we take the Hubbard model as an example and develop a systematic approach to determine the magnetic pattern in the QC, which effectively avoids getting trapped at local energy minima. Consequently, our tests for the Hubbard model on various QCs with different symmetries are unexceptionally consistent with our proposal. Our work highlights the QC as a platform where the altermagnetism is common among magnetic phases.</description>

      <title>Defect Anomalies, a Spin-Flux Duality, and Boson-Kondo Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14963v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the infrared phases of certain line defects in 2+1d quantum field theories are determined by anomalies, including anomalies in the space of defect coupling constants, together with a symmetry-refined corollary of the $g$-theorem. As an example, we prove that the spin-$1/2$ impurities in the 2+1d critical $O(2)$ and $O(3)$ models (known respectively as the Halon and Boson-Kondo defects) flow to non-trivial conformal line operators in the IR, and we supply evidence that the same extends to all spin $s$. We also argue that, under particle/vortex duality, the Halon impurity is exchanged with the $\pi$-flux vortex line leading to spin-flux duality, a proposal which we test with a detailed matching of symmetries, anomalies, and phases. Finally, we write down quantum lattice Hamiltonians which can be used to test our predictions, and give an argument on the lattice in favor of spin-flux duality.</description>

      <title>A rutile-based homologous series Na(PtO$_2$)$_{2\it{n}+1}$ discovered by computationally assisted high-pressure synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15223v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Layered transition metal oxides typified by the Ruddlesden-Popper phase have been extensively studied for its applications in high-temperature superconductivity, catalysis, and battery technologies. Despite the remarkable structural diversity and catalytic functionality of platinum oxides, the exploration of layered polymorphs has remained significantly constrained mainly due to the high inertness of platinum. Here, we discover a new homologous series of layered ternary oxides, Na(PtO$_2$)$_{2\it{n}+1}$, by a combination of highly oxidizing high-pressure methods and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. This series features unprecedented layered structural motifs, rutile-based PtO$_6$ octahedra and one-dimensional PtO$_4$ square-planar columns, which enables systematic control of dimensionality. Furthermore, we demonstrate a computationally-assisted identification of isomeric and putative members of this homologous series as confirmed by controlled synthesis and quantitative analysis of diffuse scattering data. This approach provides an effective platform for the exhaustive exploration of metastable transition metal oxides with rich structural variations.</description>

      <title>Electron-Hole Crossover in $\mathrm{La}_{3-x}\mathrm{Sr}_{x}\mathrm{Ni}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{7-\delta}$ Thin Films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15284v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ambient-pressure superconductivity in $\mathrm{La}_{3}\mathrm{Ni}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{7}$ thin films via compressive epitaxial strain provides a highly accessible platform for diverse characterization techniques, facilitating the studies of high-temperature superconductivity. Here, we systematically map the superconducting dome in compressively strained $\mathrm{La}_{3-x}\mathrm{Sr}_{x}\mathrm{Ni}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{7-\delta}$ thin films by simultaneously tuning Sr doping and oxygen content and reveal an electron-hole crossover associated with the maximum transition temperature (${T}_{c}$). This electron-hole crossover, marked by an anomalous sign change in the Hall coefficient (${R}_{H}$), is reminiscent of electron-doped cuprates, which may signal a Fermi surface reconstruction. Beyond the superconducting dome, a $\ln1/T$ insulating regime and a $T$-linear resistivity regime are also resolved, resembling behaviors observed in cuprates and infinite-layer nickelates. This work reveals a dome-shaped relationship between ${T}_{c}$ and ${R}_{H}$ and establishes a key framework for understanding unconventional superconductivity in nickelate systems.</description>

      <title>Assessing the Reliability of Truncated Coupled Cluster Wavefunction: Estimating the Distance from the Exact Solution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15681v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A new approach is proposed to assess the reliability of the truncated wavefunction methods by estimating the deviation from the full configuration interaction (FCI) wavefunction. While typical multireference diagnostics compare some derived property of the solution with the ideal picture of a single determinant, we try to answer a more practical question, how far is the solution from the exact one. Using the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) method to provide an approximate FCI solution for the self-consistently determined relevant active space, we compare the low-level CI expansions and one-body reduced density matrixes to determine the distance of the two solutions ($\tilde{d}_\Phi$, $\tilde{d}_\gamma$). We demonstrate the applicability of the approach for the CCSD method by benchmarking on the W4-17 dataset, as well as on transition metal-containing species. We also show that the presented moderate-cost, purely wavefunction-based metric is truly unique in the sense that it does not correlate with any popular multireference measures. We also explored the usage of CCSD natural orbitals ($\tilde{d}_{\gamma,\mathrm{NO}}$) and its effect on the active space size and the metric. The proposed diagnostic can also be applied to other wavefunction approximations, and it has the potential to provide a quality measure for post-Hartree-Fock procedures in general.</description>

      <title>Learning phases with Quantum Monte Carlo simulation cell</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23098v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose the use of the "spin-opstring", derived from Stochastic Series Expansion Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) simulations as machine learning input data. It offers a compact, memory-efficient representation of QMC simulation cells, combining the initial state with an operator string that encodes the state's evolution through imaginary time. Using supervised machine learning, we demonstrate the input's effectiveness in capturing both conventional and topological phase transitions. Additionally, we conduct a regression task to predict superfluid density, which reflects non-local properties of the quantum system, and achieve good accuracy. We also demonstrate the capability of spin-opstring data in transfer learning by training models on one quantum system and successfully predicting on another, as well as showing that models trained on smaller system sizes generalize well to larger ones. Finally, using two state-of-the-art interpretability techniques, Layer-wise Relevance Propagation and SHapley Additive exPlanations, we show that the machine learning models learn and rely on physically meaningful features from the input data. Together, these findings establish the spin-opstring as a broadly-applicable and interpretable input format for machine learning in quantum many-body physics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.10114v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive a $t$-$J$ model applicable to strongly correlated two-orbital systems including bilayer nickelate superconductors. Using the Schrieffer-Wolff transformation, we exclude the doubly occupied states, which raise the onsite Coulomb energy, and derive the resulting spin interactions from the two-orbital Hubbard model. We also introduce effective interactions attributed to the interorbital Coulomb interaction. To adapt the effective model to bilayer nickelates that exhibit high-temperature superconductivity, we quantitatively evaluate the strengths of the spin interactions based on the hopping parameters in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$. Considering the evaluated effective interactions, we propose a simplified $t$-$J$ model for bilayer nickelate superconductors.</description>

      <title>Impact of Thermal Effects on the Current-Tunable Electrical Transport in the Ferrimagnetic Semiconductor Mn$_3$Si$_2$Te$_6$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01518v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the ferrimagnetic semiconductor Mn$_3$Si$_2$Te$_6$, a colossal magnetoresistance (CMR) is observed only when a magnetic field is applied along the magnetic hard axis ($\mathbf{H}\parallel c$). This phenomenon suggests an unconventional CMR mechanism potentially driven by the interplay between magnetism, topological band structure, and/or chiral orbital currents (COC). By comparing electrical resistance measurements using continuous direct currents and pulse currents, we found that the current-induced insulator-metal transition, supporting the COC-driven CMR mechanism, is likely a consequence of Joule heating effects. First-principles calculations reveal a pronounced band gap reduction upon tilting the magnetic moments toward the $c$-axis, accompanied by increased carrier concentration and Fermi velocity. Combining spin orientation-dependent electronic structure with Boltzmann transport theory, the calculated electrical resistance closely reproduces the CMR observed experimentally. These findings suggest that the CMR in Mn$_3$Si$_2$Te$_6$ stems primarily from band gap reduction induced by partial polarization of magnetic moments along the magnetic hard axis.</description>

      <title>Wavefunction optimization at the complete basis set limit with Multiwavelets and DMRG</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.10808v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) is a powerful numerical technique to solve strongly correlated quantum systems: it deals well with systems which are not dominated by a single configuration (unlike Coupled Cluster) and it converges rapidly to the Full Configuration Interaction (FCI) limit (unlike truncated Configuration Interaction (CI) expansions). In this work, we develop an algorithm integrating DMRG within the multiwavelet-based multiresolution analysis (MRA). Unlike fixed basis sets, multiwavelets offer an adaptive and hierarchical representation of functions, approaching the complete basis set limit to a specified precision. As a result, this combined technique leverages the multireference capability of DMRG and the complete basis set limit of MRA and multiwavelets. More specifically, we adopt a pre-existing Lagrangian optimization algorithm for orbitals represented in the MRA domain and improve its computational efficiency by replacing the original CI calculations with DMRG. Additionally, we substitute the reduced density matrices computation with the direct extraction of energy gradients from the DMRG tensors. We apply our method to small systems such H2, He, HeH2, BeH2 and N2. The results demonstrate that our approach reduces the final energy while keeping the number of orbitals low compared to FCI calculations on an atomic orbital basis set.</description>

      <title>Large $N$ Wess-Zumino model at finite temperature and large chemical potential in $3d$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17999v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the supersymmetric Wess-Zumino model at large $N$ in $(2+1)$ dimension. We introduce a chemical potential($\mu$) at finite temperature($T$). The non-trivial fixed point of this model is described by a pair of coupled gap equations. This fixed point behaves as a thermal CFT for all values of the coupling. We find that at large chemical potential these coupled equations simplify and solutions become analytically tractable. We solve them analytically for all values of the coupling at this limit. The solutions admit a systematic series expansion in $\frac{T}{\mu}$. Thus, using the solutions of the gap equation at large chemical potential we can evaluate the analytic form of the partition function, stress tensor and spin-1 current as a perturbative expansion in orders of $\frac{T}{\mu}$. Applying the OPE inversion formula on the scalar and fermion two point functions of the theory, we compute higher spin currents at large $\mu$.</description>

      <title>Determining Spin-Dependent Light Dark Matter Rates from Neutron Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02927v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The scattering and absorption rates of light dark matter with electron spin-dependent interactions depend on the target's spin response. We show how this response is encoded by the target's dynamical magnetic susceptibility, which can be measured using neutron scattering. We directly use existing neutron scattering data to compute the dark matter scattering rate in a candidate target material, finding close agreement with the previous first-principles calculation at MeV dark matter masses. Complementary experiments and measurements can extend the reach of this technique to other dark matter models and masses, and identify promising target materials for future experiments.</description>

      <title>Analytical model for non-linear magnetotransport in viscous electron fluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07767v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop an analytical theoretical model for non-linear hydrodynamic magnetotransport of two-dimensional (2D) electron fluid with strong pair correlations in the electron dynamics. Within classical kinetics of 2D electrons, such correlations are described as subsequent ``extended'' collisions of the same electrons, temporarily joined in pairs. Corresponding correlation-induced retarded terms in the fluid dynamic equations can be described for slow flows as the dependence of the electron fluid viscosity on the flow velocity gradient, that is Non-Newtonian behavior of the fluid. We analytically calculate flow profiles in long samples in a stationary highly non-linear regime and the corresponding magnetoresistance. Pair correlations lead to a characteristic non-monotonic dependence of the differential resistance on magnetic field. We compare our results with experimental data on non-linear magnetotransport of high-purity GaAs quantum wells; we conclude that our model can be responsible for a part of the observed features of the differential magnetoresistance.</description>

      <title>Electron-Transfer and Exchange-Interaction Model of the Ligand Hyperfine Structure of Alkylated Iron-Sulfur Clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15838v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Iron-sulfur clusters conduct a wide variety of biochemical reactions that are conserved across all domains of life. The hyperfine structure of reactive ligands of these clusters can be studied experimentally and theoretically by means of hyperfine spectroscopy, which can reveal catalytic intermediates in these biochemical processes. Their theoretical prediction, however, requires either advanced methods that describe strongly correlated systems, or Hamiltonian modeling based on symmetry-broken electronic structure methods. This work shows that the addition of electron-transfer interactions to the Heisenberg-Dirac-van Vleck Hamiltonian model leads to the quantitative explanation of hyperfine coupling constants at active organic ligand sites. Comparison with experimentally available results confirms our extended approach can be used in calculations aimed at describing cutting-edge systems.</description>
