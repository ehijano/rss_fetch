      <title>Modeling Filamentary Conduction in Reset Phase Change Memory Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00866v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We performed a computational analysis on percolation transport and filament formation in amorphous $Ge_2Sb_2Te_5$ (a-GST) using 2D finite-element multi-physics simulations with 2 nm out-of-plane depth using an electric-field and temperature dependent electronic transport model with carrier activation energies that vary locally around 0.3 eV and as a function of temperature. We observe the snapback (threshold switching) behavior in the current-voltage (I-V) characteristics at ~50 MV/m electric field with 0.63 $\mu$A current for 300 K ambient temperature, where current collapses onto a single molten filament with ~ 2 nm diameter, aligned with the electric field, and the device switches from a high resistance state (108 $\Omega$) to a low resistance state (103 $\Omega$). Further increase in voltage across the device leads to widening of the molten filament. Snap-back current and electric field are strong functions of ambient temperature, ranging from ~ 0.53 $\mu$A at 200 K to ~ 16.93 $\mu$A at 800 K and ~ 85 MV/m at 150 K to 45 MV/m at 350 K, respectively. Snap-back electric-field decreases exponentially with increasing device length, converging to ~ 38 MV/m for devices longer than 200 nm.</description>

      <title>1/f and Random Telegraph Noise of Single-Layer Graphene Devices with Interdigitated Electrodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Single-layer Graphene (SLG) is a promising material for sensing applications. High performance graphene sensors can be achieved when Interdigitated Electrodes (IDE) are used. In this research work, we fabricated SLG micro-ribbon (GMR) devices with IDE having different geometric parameters. 1/f noise behavior was observed in all of the examined devices, and in some cases random telegraph noise (RTN) signals suggesting that carrier trapping/de-trapping is taking place. Our experimental results indicate that the geometrical characteristics can have a crucial impact on device performance, due to the direct area dependence of the noise level.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Doping stoichiometric SiNx layers (x=[N]/[Si]=1.33) with Si atoms by ultra-low energy ion implantation (ULE-II) and annealing them at different temperatures can significantly impact the switching characteristics. Electrical characterization and dielectric breakdown measurements are used to identify the main switching properties and performance of the fabricated devices and the effect that the Si dopants and annealing temperature have. In addition, impedance spectroscopy measurements revealed the dielectric properties of the silicon nitride films, as well as the ac conductance, which is utilized to identify the conduction mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Electrically induced negative differential resistance states mediated by oxygen octahedra coupling in manganites for neuronaldynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00137v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The precipitous rise of consumer network applications reiterates the urgency to redefine computing hardware with low power footprint. Neuromorphic computing utilizing correlated oxides offers an energy-efficient solution. By designing anisotropic functional properties in LSMO on a twinned LAO substrate and driving it out of thermodynamic equilibrium, we demonstrate two distinct negative differential resistance states in such volatile memristors. These were harnessed to exhibit oscillatory dynamics in LSMO at different frequencies and an artificial neuron with leaky integrate-and-fire dynamics. A material based modelling incorporating bond angle distortions in neighboring perovskites and capturing the inhomogeneity of domain distribution and propagation explains both the NDR regimes. Our findings establish LSMO as an important material for neuromorphic computing hardware.</description>

      <title>Waveguide Excitation and Spin Pumping of Chirally Coupled Quantum Dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00218v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report on an integrated semiconductor chip where a single quantum dot (QD) is excited in-plane via a photonic-crystal waveguide through its nearest p-shell optical transition. The chirality of the waveguide mode is exploited to achieve both directional absorption and directional emission, resulting in a substantial enhancement in directional contrast, as measured for the Zeeman components of the waveguide-coupled QD. This remote excitation scheme enables high directionality (greater than or equal to 0.95) across approximately 56% of the waveguide area, with significant overlap with the Purcell-enhanced region, where the electric field intensity profile is near its peak. In contrast, local excitation methods using an out-of-plane excitation beam focused directly over the area of the QD achieve only approximately 25% overlap. This enhancement increases the likelihood of locating Purcell-enhanced QDs in regions that support high directionality, enabling the experimental demonstration of a six-fold enhancement in the decay rate of a QD with greater than 90% directionality. The remote p-shell excitation protocol establishes a new benchmark for waveguide quantum optics in terms of the combination of Purcell enhancement and high directionality, thereby paving the way for on-chip excitation of spin-based solid-state quantum technologies in regimes of high beta-factor.</description>

      <title>Can 2D materials enable passively $Q$-switched lasers in the nanoscale?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00431v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Achieving compact on-chip pulsed lasers with attractive performance metrics and compatibility with the silicon photonics platform is an important, yet elusive, goal in contemporary nanophotonics. Here, the fundamental question of whether 2D materials can be utilized as both gain and saturable absorption media to enable compact integrated passively Q-switched nanophotonic lasers is posed and addressed by examining a broad range of 2D material families. The study is conducted by developing a temporal coupled-mode theory framework involving semi-classical rate equations that is capable of rigorously handling gain and saturable absorption by 2D materials, allowing to perform stability and bifurcation analysis covering broad parameter spaces. The range of pulse-train metrics (repetition rate, pulse width, peak power) that can be obtained via different 2D materials is thoroughly assessed. Our work illustrates that nanophotonic cavities enhanced with 2D materials can enable passive Q-switching with repetition rates ranging up to 50~GHz, short pulse duration down to few picoseconds, and peak power exceeding several milliwatts. Such attractive metrics, along with the ultrathin nature of 2D materials and the ability to electrically tune their properties, demonstrate the potential of the proposed platform for compact and flexible integrated laser sources.</description>

      <title>Star-shaped nanostructure-based multifunctional chiral metasurface for near-infrared wavelengths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00479v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Here, we reported, for the first time, a chiral metasurface with multifunctional capabilities tailored for the near-infrared (NIR) wavelength range, garnering tremendous interest in applications such as optical communication and chiral sensing. The structure comprised star and bar-shaped silver antennas immersed in SiO2. In computational simulations based on the finite-difference time-domain method, the proposed architecture yielded a maximum circular dichroism of 0.7 at 971.5 nm wavelength and a maximum asymmetric transmission under linearly polarized excitation of 0.92 at 1020 nm wavelength. Moreover, this multifunctional structure manifested near-perfect cross-polarization conversions for both linear and circular polarizations, as well as linear to circular and elliptical polarization conversion effects at different bands within the NIR spectral region. The enhanced light-matter interaction of the proposed structure was utilized to detect and differentiate two enantiomers of 1,2-propanediol, yielding excellent chirality sensing capability. As a multifunctional compact chiral platform, the proposed structure is expected to find direct applications in integrated and miniaturized multi-channel optical communication platforms, materials and biomolecules sensing in attomolar concentrations, and the pharmaceutical industry.</description>

      <title>Expedited Noise Spectroscopy of Transmon Qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00679v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There has been tremendous progress in the physical realization of quantum computing hardware in recent times, bringing us closer than ever before to realizing the promise of quantum computing. However, noise continues to pose a crucial challenge when it comes to scaling up present day quantum processors. While decoherence limits the qubits ability to store information for long periods in the presence of uncontrollable noise sources, the erroneous implementation of control methods for state preparation and measurements leads to faulty implementations of quantum circuits. Conventional noise spectroscopy protocols can characterize and model environmental noise but are usually resource intensive and lengthy. Moreover, the underlying noise can vary in nature over time, making noise profile extraction futile as this new information cannot be harnessed to improve quantum error correction or dynamical decoupling protocols. In this work, we address this challenge using a machine learning-based methodology to quickly extract noise spectra of multiple qubits and demonstrate a possible noise mitigation strategy. The procedure involves implementing undemanding dynamical decoupling sequences to record coherence decays of the investigated qubits and then predict the underlying noise spectra with the help of a convolution neural network pre-trained on a synthetic dataset. While our protocol is virtually hardware-agnostic, we validate its effectiveness using superconducting qubits available on the IBM Quantum platform. We further use these rapidly obtained, yet accurate, noise spectra to design bespoke dynamic decoupling sequences and perform time-dependent noise spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>On Overlap Ratio in Defocused Electron Ptychography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00762v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Four-dimensional Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy (4D STEM) with data acquired using a defocused electron probe is a promising tool for characterising complex biological specimens and materials through a phase retrieval process known as Electron Ptychography (EP). The efficacy of 4D STEM acquisition and the resulting quality of EP reconstruction depends on the overlap ratio of adjacent illuminated areas. This paper demonstrates how the overlap ratio impacts the data redundancy and the quality of the EP reconstruction. We define two quantities as a function of the overlap ratio that are independent of both the object and the EP algorithm. Subsequently, we evaluate an EP algorithm for varying overlap ratios using simulated 4D STEM datasets. Notably, a 40% or greater overlap ratio yields stable, high-quality reconstructions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.00875v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study presents a detailed plasma kinetics model for laser-induced non-equilibrium plasmas in atmospheric pressure air, incorporating a self-consistent energy balance and refined rate expressions within a three-temperature framework. The model is validated against experimental data of femtosecond-laser-induced filaments, showing good agreement in electron dynamics and gas temperature. The analysis focuses on femtosecond filament decay kinetics and characteristic properties across varying initial electron densities and electron temperatures, including cases with oxygen addition and its influence on decay behavior. The study further examines energy coupling between the femtosecond filament and nanosecond laser pulse, identifying dominant kinetic pathways and optimal time delays through a comparative analysis of single-pulse and dual-pulse plasmas. Additionally, results indicate that temporal shaping of the nanosecond laser pulse intensity enhances dual-pulse performance relative to Gaussian pulses.</description>

Abstract: The next generation of photonic circuits will require on-chip, ultrafast, compact, and energy-efficient components in a scalable platform to power technologies like quantum and neuromorphic computing. Here we present a significant advancement in ultrafast electrical control of highly nonlinear hybrid light-matter quasi-particles, called waveguide exciton-dipolaritons, with extremely low power consumption. Our device, that was shown to perform as an optical transistor with an optical switching power as low as $\sim$1 fJ/operation, achieves a GHz-rate electrical modulation with a record-low total energy consumption $\sim$3 fJ/bit and a compact active area of down to 25 $\mu$m$^2$. This work establishes waveguide-dipolariton platforms for scalable, electrically reconfigurable, ultra-low power photonic circuits for both classical and quantum computing and communication.</description>

      <title>Scalable, nanoscale positioning of highly coherent color centers in prefabricated diamond nanostructures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.01198v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nanophotonic devices in color center-containing hosts provide efficient readout, control, and entanglement of the embedded emitters. Yet control over color center formation - in number, position, and coherence - in nanophotonic devices remains a challenge to scalability. Here, we report a controlled creation of highly coherent diamond nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers with nanoscale three-dimensional localization in prefabricated nanostructures with high yield. Combining nitrogen $\delta$-doping during chemical vapor deposition diamond growth and localized electron irradiation, we form shallow NVs registered to the center of diamond nanopillars with wide tunability over NV number. We report positioning precision of ~ 4 nm in depth and 46(1) nm laterally in pillars (102(2) nm in bulk diamond). We reliably form single NV centers with long spin coherence times (average $T_2^{Hahn}$ = 98 $\mu s$) and 1.8x higher average photoluminescence compared to NV centers randomly positioned in pillars. We achieve a 3x improved yield of NV centers with single electron-spin sensitivity over conventional implantation-based methods. Our high-yield defect creation method will enable scalable production of solid-state defect sensors and processors.</description>

Abstract: The thermal memory effect, TME, has been studied in Ni55Fe19Ga26 shape memory alloys, fabricated as ribbons via melt-spinning and as pellets via arc-melting, to evaluate its dependence on the martensitic structure and the macrostructure of the samples. When the reverse martensitic transformation is interrupted, a kinetic delay in the subsequent complete transformation is only evident in the ribbon samples, where the 14M modulated structure is the dominant phase. In contrast, degradation of the modulated structure or the presence of the gamma-phase significantly reduces the observed TME. In such cases, the magnitude of the TME approaches the detection limits of commercial calorimeters, and only high-resolution calorimeter at very low heating rate (40 mK h-1) can show the effect. Following the kinetic arrest and subsequent cooling, the reverse martensitic transformation was completed at several heating rates to confirm the athermal nature of the phenomenon.</description>

      <title>Modeling of photonic integrated resonators using advanced scattering matrix methods</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.01552v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a universal approach for modeling complex integrated photonic resonators based on the scattering matrix method. By dividing devices into basic elements including directional cou-plers and connecting waveguides, our approach can be used to model integrated photonic reso-nators with both unidirectional and bidirectional light propagation, with the simulated spectral response showing good agreement with experimental results. A simplified form of our ap-proach, which divides devices into several independent submodules such as microring resonators and Sagnac interferometers, is also introduced to streamline the calculation of spectral transfer functions. Finally, we discuss the deviations introduced by approximations in our modeling, along with strategies for improving modeling accuracy. Our approach is universal across dif-ferent integrated platforms, providing a useful tool for designing and optimizing integrated photonic devices with complex configurations.</description>

Abstract: Anisotropic subwavelength particles combine the strong response and tunability of nanostructures with the exotic properties of anisotropic materials. Here we analytically derive the quasielectrostatic eigenmodes and eigenpermittivity relations of anistropic spheres and ellipsoids and present the results for spheres. We show that anisotropic particles exhibit novel radiation patterns and axial-eigenpermittivity sum rules, resulting in resonance splitting and eigenvalue degeneracy. Our results pave the way for a new generation of directional and multispectral detectors and biomarkers and apply to other fields of physics.</description>

      <title>Static and dynamic analysis of auxetic three-dimensional curved metamaterials in both axial and circumferential directions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.15013v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Metamaterials can enable unique mechanical properties based on their geometry rather than their chemical composition. Such properties can go beyond what is possible using conventional materials. Most of the existing literature consider metamaterials in Cartesian coordinates with zero curvature. However, realistic utilization of meta-structures is highly likely to involve a degree of curvature. In this paper, we study both the effective static and dynamic properties of metamaterials in the presence of curvature. To capture the effect of curvature on the static behavior of our metamaterial, we calculate the effective Poisson's ratio of the metamaterial in the presence of curvature. We conduct our analysis on three-dimensional metamaterials with varying effective Poisson's ratio. We observe a significant change in the values of the effective Poisson's ratio of the metamaterial duo to curvature. To capture the effect of curvature on the dynamics of our metamaterials, we calculate dispersion curves of curved metamaterial at different circumferential directions. We show both numerically and experimentally the change of the dynamic behavior of auxetic metamaterial from attenuation to transmission and vice-versa due to curvature. Our findings underscore the importance of curvature in both static and dynamic analysis of metamaterial design and could provide the means to guide practical implementations of metamaterials for functional use.</description>

      <title>Quantifying Argon Concentration within Insulating Glass Units using Low Frequency Ultrasonic Technique</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10317v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Insulating glass units (IGUs) account for over 30% of thermal transmission losses in building envelopes. To mitigate this, IGUs are often filled with low-conductivity gases like Argon. However, Argon concentration decreases over time due to IGU aging and manufacturing processes, which lessens their insulating effectiveness. This study presents a novel nondestructive methodology to quantify Argon concentration in IGUs using ultrasonic technique. The ultrasonic energy transmitted through the IGU is correlated with Argon concentration, validated through both experimental measurements and numerical models using COMSOL Multiphysics. The models simulate acoustic-structure interaction by adjusting gas density to reflect Argon presence, showing increased ultrasonic energy with higher Argon concentrations. Experimental measurements on two IGU samples with twenty Argon-air mixtures (ranging from 100% to 25% Argon) show that the proposed ultrasonic technique achieves a mean absolute error of 0.13, outperforming Spark Emission Spectroscopy and Helantec ISO-GAS-Control, which have errors of 2.31 and 0.33, respectively.</description>

      <title>Ultra-high endurance silicon photonic memory using vanadium dioxide</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10162v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Silicon photonics arises as a viable solution to address the stringent resource demands of emergent technologies, such as neural networks. Within this framework, photonic memories are fundamental building blocks of photonic integrated circuits that have not yet found a standardized solution due to several trade-off among different metrics such as energy consumption, speed, footprint, or fabrication complexity, to name a few. In particular, a photonic memory exhibiting ultra-high endurance performance (&gt; 10^6 cycles) has been elusive to date. Here, we report an ultra-high endurance silicon photonic memory using vanadium dioxide (VO_2) exhibiting a record cyclability of up to 10^7 cycles without degradation. Moreover, our memory features an ultra-compact footprint below 5 {\mu}m with potential for nanosecond and picojoule programming performance. Our silicon photonic memory could find application in emerging photonic applications demanding high number of memory updates such as photonic neural networks with in-situ training.</description>

      <title>Nonvolatile reconfigurable polarization rotator at datacom wavelengths based on a Sb2Se3/Si waveguide</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04477v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Silicon photonics has become a key platform for photonic integrated circuits (PICs) due to its high refractive index and compatibility with complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor manufacturing. However, the inherent birefringence in silicon waveguides requires efficient polarization management. Here, we report a reconfigurable polarization rotator (PR) using a Sb2Se3/Si waveguide operating at datacom wavelengths (1310 nm), providing nonvolatile switching with zero static power consumption. The polarization conversion relies on the interference of hybrid electric-magnetic (EH) modes, which can be reconfigured by changing the Sb2Se3 state between amorphous and crystalline. Our experimental device exhibits a polarization conversion efficiency (PCE) and a polarization extinction ratio (PER) as high as -0.08 dB and 17.65 dB, respectively, in a compact footprint of just 21$\mu$m length. Therefore, the proposed reconfigurable PR offers a compact and energy-efficient solution for polarization management in silicon photonics, with potential applications in data communication networks and emerging applications benefiting from polarization information encodings, such as optical neural networks and quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Vector Network Analysis With a Photonic Frequency Extender Setup</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02532v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a photonic ultra-wideband frequency extension for a commercial Vector Network Analyzer (VNA) to perform free-space measurements in a frequency range from 70 GHz up to 520 GHz with a Hz level resolution. The concept is based on the synchronization of continuous-wave (CW) lasers with highly frequency-stable electronic emitter sources as a reference. The use of CW photomixers with bandwidths up to several terahertz allows for the straightforward expansion of the covered frequency range to 1 THz or even beyond. This can be achieved, for instance, by cascading additional lasers within the synchronization scheme. Consequently, the necessity for additional frequency extender modules, as seen in current state-of-the-art VNAs, is eliminated, thereby reducing the complexity and cost of the system significantly. To showcase the capabilities of the Photonic Vector Network Analyzer (PVNA) extender concept, we conducted S21 transmission measurements of various cross-shaped bandpass filters and waveguide-coupled high-frequency (HF) components. Additionally, the analyzed magnitude and phase data were either compared to electro-magnetic (EM) simulations or referenced against data obtained from commercial electronic frequency extender modules.</description>

      <title>Photo-Heating of Optically Transparent Solids Driven by Electronic Light Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05922v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Light absorption in opaque solids is directly governed by optical transitions between the electronic states near the bandgap. This physical mechanism underlies the optical heating of a medium that efficiently absorbs light at resonance. However, such a strategy is true for a homogeneous bulk medium that is temporally dispersive. This work focuses on the photo-heating of optically transparent solids owing to light scattering rather than absorption. A light-induced optical inhomogeneity (vacancy, ad-atom, etc.) produces an optical near-field photon with expanded momentum that enhances light-matter interaction. As a result, indirect optical transitions become accessible throughout the entire Brillouin zone due to electron-photon momentum matching. According to the Kramers-Kronig relation, nonlocal media can capture light solely through electronic light scattering. Herein, we demonstrate this effect by melting spatially confined semiconductors (silicon atomic-force-microscopy cantilever) and metals (gold shear-force-microscopy tip) under continuous-wave sub-band pumping. Light scattering based on electron-photon interaction becomes the dominant physical process in media with strong spatial dispersion. These findings are critical for cutting-edge technologies in optoelectronics, photovoltaics, and biomedicine.</description>

      <title>Analytical modelling for the frequency behavior of two distinct modes in nano-constriction spin Hall nano-oscillator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09277v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nano-constriction spin-Hall nano-oscillators (NC-SHNOs) have garnered considerable interest due to their potential use as efficient and adjustable nano-sized sources of microwave signals, with high-frequency tunability, adaptable design layout, and CMOS compatibility. In order to facilitate system- and circuit-level designs based on the NC-SHNOs, it is essential to have an analytical model capable of predicting the behavior of the NC-SHNO. In this paper, we introduce an analytical model to describe the frequency behavior of a single NC-SHNO in an in-plane magnetic field while considering the Oersted field. The model is divided into two regions based on the direct current value: the "linear-like" and "bullet" modes. Each region is characterized by distinct concepts and equations. The first region, the "linear-like mode," emerges from the nano-constriction edges and progresses toward the center of the active area of the NC-SHNO. In contrast, the second regime, the localized "bullet mode," exhibits negative nonlinearity, where increasing the current will lead to a decrease in frequency. The model's validity is confirmed through experimental data obtained from electrical RF measurements on a single 180nm wide NC-SHNO, and the model demonstrates excellent agreement with experimental data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.09453v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate non-reciprocal scattering within the modes of a microwave frequency comb. Adjusting the pump frequencies, amplitudes, and phases of a Josephson parametric oscillator, we control constructive interference for the $m \longrightarrow \ell$ scattering processes, while concurrently achieving destructive interference for the inverse process $\ell \longrightarrow m$. We outline the methodology for realizing non-reciprocity in the context of two-mode isolation and a three-mode circulation, which we extend to multiple modes. We find good agreement between the experiments and a linearized theoretical model. Nonreciprocal scattering expands the toolset for parametric control, with the potential to engineer novel quantum correlations.</description>

      <title>Spectral tuning and nanoscale localization of single color centers in silicon via controllable strain</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17290v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The development of color centers in silicon enables scalable quantum technologies by combining telecom-wavelength emission and compatibility with mature silicon fabrication. However, large-scale integration requires precise control of each emitter's optical transition to generate indistinguishable photons for quantum networking. Here, we demonstrate a foundry-fabricated photonic integrated circuit (PIC) combining suspended silicon waveguides with a microelectromechanical (MEMS) cantilever to apply local strain and spectrally tune individual G-centers. Applying up to 35 V between the cantilever and the substrate induces a reversible wavelength shift of the zero-phonon line exceeding 100 pm, with no loss in brightness. Moreover, by modeling the strain-induced shifts with a `digital twin' physical model, we achieve vertical localization of color centers with sub-3 nm vertical resolution, directly correlating their spatial position, dipole orientation, and spectral behavior. This method enables on-demand, low-power control of emission spectrum and nanoscale localization of color centers, advancing quantum networks on a foundry-compatible platform.</description>
