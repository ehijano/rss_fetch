      <title>Development and Comprehensive Evaluation of TMR Sensor-Based Magnetrodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15411v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to their compact size and exceptional sensitivity at room temperature, magnetoresistance (MR) sensors have garnered considerable interest in numerous fields, particularly in the detection of weak magnetic signals in biological systems. The magnetrodes, integrating MR sensors with needle-shaped Si-based substrates, are designed to be inserted into the brain for local magnetic field detection. Although recent research has predominantly focused on giant magnetoresistance (GMR) sensors, tunnel magnetoresistance (TMR) sensors exhibit significantly higher sensitivity. In this study, we introduce TMR-based magnetrodes featuring TMR sensors at both the tip and mid-section of the probe, enabling detection of local magnetic fields at varied spatial positions. To enhance detectivity, we have designed and fabricated magnetrodes with varied aspect ratios of the free layer, incorporating diverse junction shapes, quantities, and serial arrangements. Utilizing a custom-built magnetotransport and noise measurement system for characterization, our TMR-based magnetrode demonstrates a limit of detection (LOD) of 300pT/Hz1/2 at 1 kHz. This implies that neuronal spikes can be distinguished with minimal averaging, thereby facilitating the elucidation of their magnetic properties.</description>

      <title>Periodically Poled Aluminum Scandium Nitride Bulk Acoustic Wave Resonators and Filters for Communications in the 6G Era</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bulk Acoustic Wave (BAW) filters find applications in radio frequency (RF) communication systems for Wi-Fi, 3G, 4G, and 5G networks. In the beyond-5G (potential 6G) era, high frequency bands (&gt;8 GHz) are expected to require resonators with high-quality factor (Q) and electromechanical coupling (k_t^2) to form filters with low insertion loss and high selectivity. However, both the Q and k_t^2 of resonator devices formed in traditional uniform polarization piezoelectric films of aluminum nitride (AlN) and aluminum scandium nitride (AlScN) decrease when scaled beyond 8 GHz. In this work, we utilized 4-layer AlScN periodically poled piezoelectric films (P3F) to construct high frequency (~17-18 GHz) resonators and filters. The resonator performance is studied over a range of device geometries, with the best resonator achieving a k_t^2 of 11.8% and a Q_p of 236.6 at the parallel resonance frequency (fp) of 17.9 GHz. These resulting figures of merit are ((FoM)_1=(k_t^2 Q)_p and (FoM_2=f_p(FoM)_1x10^-9) ) 27.9 and 500 respectively. These and the k_t^2 are significantly higher than previously reported An/AlScN-based resonators operating at similar frequencies. Fabricated 3-element and 6-element filters formed from these resonators demonstrated low insertion losses (IL) of 1.86 dB and 3.25 dB, and -3 dB bandwidths (BW) of 680 MHz (fractional BW of 3.9%) and 590 MHz (fractional BW of 3.3%) at ~17.4 GHz center frequency. The 3-element and 6-element filters achieved excellent linearity with in-band input third-order intercept point (IIP3) values of +36 dBm and +40 dBm, respectively, which are significantly higher than previously reported acoustic filters operating at similar frequencies.</description>

      <title>Phase space framework enables a variable-scale diffraction model for coherent imaging and display</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15456v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The fast algorithms in Fourier optics have invigorated multifunctional device design and advanced imaging technologies. However, the necessity for fast computations has led to limitations in the widely used conventional Fourier methods, manifesting as fixed size image plane at a certain diffraction distance. These limitations pose challenges in intricate scaling transformations, 3D reconstructions and full-color displays. Currently, there is a lack of effective solutions, often resorting to pre-processing that compromise fidelity. In this paper, leveraging a higher-dimensional phase space method, we present a universal framework allowing for customized diffraction calculation methods. Within this framework, we establish a variable-scale diffraction computation model which allows the adjustment of the size of the image plane and can be operated by fast algorithms. We validate the model's robust variable-scale capabilities and its aberration automatic correction capability for full-color holography, achieving high fidelity. The large-magnification tomography experiment demonstrates that this model provides a superior solution for holographic 3D reconstruction. In addition, this model is applied to achieve full-color metasurface holography with near-zero crosstalk, showcasing its versatile applicability at nanoscale. Our model presents significant prospects for applications in the optics community, such as beam shaping, computer-generated holograms (CGHs), augmented reality (AR), metasurface optical elements (MOEs) and advanced holographic head-up display (HUD) systems.</description>

      <title>Impedance Spectroscopy for Electroceramics and Electrochemical System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15467v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This tutorial review focuses on the basic theoretical backgrounds, their working principles, and implementation of impedance spectroscopy in both electroceramics and electrochemical research and technological applications. Various contributions to the impedance, admittance, dielectric, and conductivity characteristics of electroceramic materials can be disentangled and independently characterized with the help of impedance spectroscopy as a function of frequency and temperature. In polycrystalline materials, the impedance, charge transport/ conduction mechanism, and the macroscopic dielectric properties i.e., dielectric constant and loss are typically composed of many contributions, including the bulk or grain resistance/capacitance, grain boundary, and sample-electrode interface effect. Similarly, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) endeavors to the charging kinetics, diffusion, and mechanical impact of various electrochemical systems widely used in energy storage (i.e., supercapacitor, battery), corrosion resistance, chemical and bio-sensing, diagnostics, etc. in electrolytes as a function of frequency. The understanding of various contributions in the EIS spectra i.e., kinetic control, mass control, and diffusion control is essential for their practical implications. It is demonstrated that electrochemical and electroceramics impedance spectroscopy is an effective method to explain and simulate such behavior. Deconvolute these contributions to obtain a detailed understanding of the functionality of polycrystalline electroceramic materials. This short review aims to endow the expertise of senior researchers in many fields where both EIS (electrochemical and ceramics) are involved, as well as to provide the necessary background information for junior researchers working in these fields.</description>

      <title>Towards optical neuromodulation using nitrogen-doped ultrananocrystalline diamond photoelectrodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nitrogen-doped ultrananocrystalline diamond (N-UNCD) is a form of diamond electrode with near-infrared photoresponsivity, making it well suited for physiological applications. N-UNCD's photoresponsivity is strongly influenced by its surface. While it is known that oxygen treatment provides a higher photoresponsivity, a better understanding of its surface processes is needed to tailor the material for optical neuromodulation. This work examines the impact of various oxygen treatment methods, with aim of creating oxygen rich surfaces with different chemical and structural properties. Surface characterisation methods along with electrochemical and photoelectrochemical measurements and modelling were used to investigate the films. It was found that oxygen furnace annealing resulted in orders of magnitude improvement in the near-infrared photoresponsivity, to 3.75 +/- 0.05 uA/W. This translates to an approximate 200 times increase in the photocurrent compared to the untreated surface. This enhancement in photocurrent is largely due to the changes in the chemical species present at the surface. The photocurrent is estimated to be sufficient for extra-cellular stimulation of brain neurons within the safe optical exposure limit, positioning N-UNCD as an excellent candidate to be used in next-generation photoelectrodes for photobiomodulation.</description>

      <title>Impact of surface treatments on the electron affinity of nitrogen-doped ultrananocrystalline diamond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, various forms of nanocrystalline diamond (NCD) have emerged as an attractive group of diamond/graphite mixed-phase materials for a range of applications from electron emission sources to electrodes for neural interfacing. To tailor their properties for different uses, NCD surfaces can be terminated with various chemical functionalities, in particular hydrogen and oxygen, which shift the band edge positions and electron affinity values. While the band edge positions of chemically terminated single crystal diamond are well understood, the same is not true for nanocrystalline diamond, which has uncontrolled crystallographic surfaces with a variety of chemical states as well as graphitic grain boundary regions. In this work, the relative band edge positions of as-grown, hydrogen terminated, and oxygen terminated nitrogen-doped ultrananocrystalline diamond (N-UNCD) are determined using ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS), while the band bending is investigated using photoelectrochemical measurements. In contrast to the widely reported negative electrode affinity of hydrogen terminated single crystal diamond, our work demonstrates that hydrogen terminated N-UNCD exhibits a positive electron affinity owing to the increased surface and bulk defect densities. These findings elucidate the marked differences in electrochemical properties of hydrogen and oxygen terminated N-UNCD, such as the dramatic changes in electrochemical capacitance.</description>

      <title>Fluxon transmission measurements of engineered long Josephson junctions for efficient computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15671v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Single-Flux Quantum (SFQ) digital logic is typically both energy efficient and fast, but the logic that uses reversibility provides the most extreme method for improving efficiency. We are studying engineered long Josephson junctions (LJJs) that are components for future ballistic logic gates within a logic family named Reversible Fluxon Logic (RFL). Therein, the bit states are represented by two possible polarities of an SFQ. Here we test engineered LJJs with component JJ critical currents of 7.5uA and a Josephson penetration depth of approximately 2.4 unit cells. In our study, the SFQ rest energy in the Long JJ is determined to be 47zJ (regardless of bit state). The LJJs were tested in two environments, at 4.2K in a helium dunk probe (DP) and 3.5K in a cryogen-free refrigerator (CFR). The on-chip circuit consists of three parts in sequence: an SFQ launcher, the LJJ under test, and a detector that uses biased 20uA JJs. Data show that SFQ detection events are synchronous with SFQ launch events in both setups, indicating possible ballistic SFQ transmission in the LJJs. The jitter of the events in the CFR setup indicates that we are limited by signal filtering in our CFR setup and by noise in the DP setup.</description>

      <title>Over 600 V Lateral AlN-on-AlN Schottky Barrier Diodes with Ultra-Low Ideality Factor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15688v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This letter reports the demonstration of lateral AlN Schottky barrier diodes (SBDs) on single-crystal AlN substrates by metalorganic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) with an ultra-low ideality factor ({\eta}) of 1.65, a breakdown voltage (BV) of 640 V, and a record high normalized BV by the anode-to-cathode distance (LAC). The homoepitaxially grown AlN epilayers had much lower defect densities and excellent surface morphology, and the AlN ohmic contacts also showed improvements. At forward bias, the devices exhibited ultra-low {\eta} of 1.65 and high Schottky barrier height of 1.94 eV. The device current was dominated by thermionic emission, while most previously reported AlN SBDs suffered from defect-induced current with much higher {\eta} of &gt;4. Additionally, the devices also had excellent rectifying characteristics with ON/OFF ratios on the order of 10^7 to 10^9 and excellent thermal stability from 298 to 573 K. At reverse bias, the devices showed a high BV of 640 V and record-high normalized breakdown voltage (BV/LAC) in lateral AlN SBDs. This work represents a big step towards high-performance ultra-wide bandgap AlN-based high-voltage and high-power devices.</description>

      <title>Observation of Heat Pumping Effect by Radiative Shuttling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15738v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Heat shuttling phenomenon is characterized by the presence of a non-zero heat flow between two bodies without net thermal bias on average. It was initially predicted in the context of nonlinear heat conduction within atomic lattices coupled to two time-oscillating thermostats. Recent theoretical works revealed an analog of this effect for heat exchanges mediated by thermal photons between two solids having a temperature dependent emissivity. In this paper, we present the experimental proof of this effect using systems made with composite materials based on phase change materials. By periodically modulating the temperature of one of two solids we report that the system akin to heat pumping with a controllable heat flow direction. Additionally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of a simultaneous modulation of two temperatures to control both the strength and direction of heat shuttling by exploiting the phase delay between these temperatures. These results show that this effect is promising for an active thermal management of solid-state technology, to cool down solids, to insulate them from their background or to amplify heat exchanges.</description>

      <title>Low-Voltage Electron Emission by Graphene-hBN-graphene Heterostructure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15807v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scanning Electron Microscopes (SEM) with low energy electron sources (accelerating voltage of less than 1000V) have important application requirements in many application scenarios. Tunneling junction can potentially achieve low-voltage and planar-type electron sources with good emission current density. However, further lower the extracting voltage while ensure the emission current density remains challenging. In this paper, we report a low-voltage planar-type electron source based on graphene-hBN-graphene heterostructures (GBGH) under a really low out-plane extracting voltage. The external electric field strength applied to the electron sources is only 4 times 10^4V/m and the accelerating voltage as low as 20V is realized. Steady electron emission of over 1nA and operating duration of several hours is observed from the GBGH with size of 59.29um^2 in our experiments, and thus the maximum emission current density reaches 7mA/cm^2. Great electrical contacts, extremely low thickness, and excellent layer properties of two-dimensional (2D) materials lead to easy-fabrication and miniature on-chip electron sources, which would significantly contribute to the development of next-generation free electron devices.</description>

      <title>Localized Topological States beyond Fano Resonances via Counter-Propagating Wave Mode Conversion in Piezoelectric Microelectromechanical Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15903v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A variety of scientific fields like proteomics and spintronics have created a new demand for on-chip devices capable of sensing parameters localized within a few tens of micrometers. Nano and microelectromechanical systems (NEMS/MEMS) are extensively employed for monitoring parameters that exert uniform forces over hundreds of micrometers or more, such as acceleration, pressure, and magnetic fields. However, they can show significantly degraded sensing performance when targeting more localized parameters, like the mass of a single cell. To address this challenge, we present a new MEMS device that leverages the destructive interference of two topological radiofrequency (RF) counter-propagating wave modes along a piezoelectric Aluminum Scandium Nitride (AlScN) Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) interface. The reported MEMS device opens up opportunities for further purposes, including achieving more stable frequency sources for communication and timing applications.</description>

      <title>Disclosing the Impact of Local Host-Emitter Interactions on Donor-Acceptor Type TADF Dynamics and the Significance for Emissive Layer Design in OLEDs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15911v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Donor-Acceptor (D-A) type thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters which constitute the key functional units in proposed Gen3 Organic Light Emitting Diodes (OLEDs), are sensitive to the rigidity and polarity of their local environment. In particular, the torsional freedom of the D-A dihedral angle and the excited state dipole moments of the occurring charge transfer states, condition a distribution of TADF dynamics over the emitter ensemble, concealed in standard optical spectroscopy. Here we apply spectroscopy on the single molecule level to directly access individual emitter properties, and, thus, bypass the downside of ensemble averaging. By photon correlation data and locally resolved spectral information on single D-A type TADF molecules embedded in technological relevant host materials of different polarity and rigidity, we derive host-dependent characteristics and distributions in the TADF dynamics. Those can be related to the conformational freedom and the dielectric environment imposed by the specific local host rigidity and polarity, thereby pointing out new selection criteria for host-emitter combinations in OLEDs.</description>

      <title>Target Characteristics on Rotation in Euclidean Space Using Full Polarimetric SAR Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In radar polarimetry, the target characteristics significantly depend on the rotation of the target concerning the radar line of sight. Hence, several attempts have been made in the literature to compensate for the rotational dependency or to derive a complete roll-invariant parameter using full polarimetric SAR data. However, the degree of dependency of the targets on the rotation domain has yet to be well explored. Hence, in this study, we have proposed a new parameter that characterizes the targets concerning rotation in Euclidean space. The parameter shows similar values for the targets, which can be related to each other through a unitary transformation. The advantage of this parameter has been demonstrated over different canonical targets. Further, the characteristics of the natural targets have been shown using the Single Look Complex data of C band Radarsat-2 and ALOS PALSAR over the San Francisco Bay area and Cuba, respectively.</description>

      <title>Likelihood-based inference, identifiability and prediction using count data from lattice-based random walk models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16296v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In vitro cell biology experiments are routinely used to characterize cell migration properties under various experimental conditions. These experiments can be interpreted using lattice-based random walk models to provide insight into underlying biological mechanisms, and continuum limit partial differential equation (PDE) descriptions of the stochastic models can be used to efficiently explore model properties instead of relying on repeated stochastic simulations. Working with efficient PDE models is of high interest for parameter estimation algorithms that typically require a large number of forward model simulations. Quantitative data from cell biology experiments usually involves non-negative cell counts in different regions of the experimental images, and it is not obvious how to relate finite, noisy count data to the solutions of continuous PDE models that correspond to noise-free density profiles. In this work we illustrate how to develop and implement likelihood-based methods for parameter estimation, parameter identifiability and model prediction for lattice-based models describing collective migration with an arbitrary number of interacting subpopulations. We implement a standard additive Gaussian measurement error model as well as a new physically-motivated multinomial measurement error model that relates noisy count data with the solution of continuous PDE models. Both measurement error models lead to similar outcomes for parameter estimation and parameter identifiability, whereas the standard additive Gaussian measurement error model leads to non-physical prediction outcomes. In contrast, the new multinomial measurement error model involves a lower computational overhead for parameter estimation and identifiability analysis, as well as leading to physically meaningful model predictions.</description>

      <title>Impact of the Top SiO2 Interlayer Thickness on Memory Window of Si Channel FeFET with TiN/SiO2/Hf0.5Zr0.5O2/SiOx/Si (MIFIS) Gate Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15478</link>

Abstract: We study the impact of top SiO2 interlayer thickness on the memory window (MW) of Si channel ferroelectric field-effect transistor (FeFET) with TiN/SiO2/Hf0.5Zr0.5O2/SiOx/Si (MIFIS) gate structure. We find that the MW increases with the increasing thickness of the top SiO2 interlayer, and such an increase exhibits a two-stage linear dependence. The physical origin is the presence of the different interfacial charges trapped at the top SiO2/Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 interface. Moreover, we investigate the dependence of endurance characteristics on initial MW. We find that the endurance characteristic degrades with increasing the initial MW. By inserting a 3.4 nm SiO2 dielectric interlayer between the gate metal TiN and the ferroelectric Hf0.5Zr0.5O2, we achieve a MW of 6.3 V and retention over 10 years. Our work is helpful in the device design of FeFET.</description>

      <title>Photonics-integrated terahertz transmission lines</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15651v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern communication and sensing technologies rely on connecting the optical domain with the microwave domain. Terahertz technologies, spanning increased frequencies from 100 GHz to 10 THz, are critical for providing larger bandwidths and faster switching capabilities. Despite progress in high-frequency electronic sources and detectors, these technologies lack a direct link to the optical domain, and face challenges with increasing frequencies (&gt; 1 THz). Nonlinear processes, such as optical rectification, offer potential solutions for terahertz generation but are currently limited to discrete components based on bulk nonlinear crystals, missing out miniaturisation opportunities from integration of optical circuits with terahertz ones. We address this challenge by integrating phase-matched terahertz transmission lines with photonic circuits in a single hybrid architecture on the thin-film lithium niobate~(TFLN) platform. This design demonstrates phase-matched, broadband terahertz emission spanning four octaves (200 GHz to 3.5 THz) through broadband down-conversion of optical signals at telecommunication wavelengths. The micron-sized transmission lines provide terahertz field confinement with minimal radiative loss, enabling compact THz cavities embedded in integrated photonic circuits. This integration is crucial for leveraging photonics' advantages in low-noise, low-loss, and high-speed operations for terahertz generation. Our platform can readily be integrated with other mature photonics components, such as electro-optic modulators, frequency comb sources, or femtosecond sources to pave the way for compact, power-efficient, and frequency-agile broadband sources with applications in telecommunications, spectroscopy, quantum electrodynamics and optical computing.</description>

      <title>Nanoscale Mapping of Magnetic Auto-oscillations with a single Spin Sensor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15849v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic auto-oscillations are damping-compensated magnetization precessions. They can be generated in spin Hall nano-oscillators (SHNO) among others. Current research on these devices is dedicated to create next generation energy-efficient hardware for communication technologies. However, the underlying physics governing the formation of auto-oscillation modes, their output power and line width in a single SHNO device have remained elusive so far. We image the sources of magnetic auto-oscillations in a metallic SHNO using a single spin quantum sensor. We directly measure the microwave field generated by an auto-oscillation spot at the nanoscale by driving the electron spin resonance transition of the sensor spin, enabling faster acquisition speed (100 ms/pixel). Instead of being defined by the points of the largest antidamping only, we experimentally demonstrate for the first time with quantitative magnetometry that the auto-oscillation spots are determined by the positions of the magnetic field minima. The latter act as local potential wells for confining spin-waves, thus supporting large amplitude auto-oscillations. By comparing the magnitude of the magnetic stray field at these spots, we decipher the different frequencies of the auto-oscillation modes. The insights gained regarding the interaction between auto-oscillation modes and spin-wave potential wells enable advanced engineering of real devices.</description>

      <title>Physical simulation of nucleation and crystallization processes in transparent organic melts</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16472v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The aim of this work is the development of scientifically based ways of influencing the process of nucleation of crystallization centres to control the cast structure and the properties of blanks at the casting stage. The possibility of controlling crystal nucleation was studied on transparent modelling media using the droplet method. The dependence of the crystallization kinetics of drops with a size of 100{\div}200 {\mu}m on the overheating temperature, the exposure in the overheated state and the degree of supercooling was established. The curves of the crystallization kinetics of drops from their melts as the criteria for evaluating the crystallization process were chosen. The nature of the change in the experimental media crystallization kinetics curves confirms the assumption about the decisive role of impurities in the crystallization processes of any alloys. The confirmation of the hypothesis about the decisive role of impurities in the processes of crystallization from positions of heterogeneous nucleation is the dependence of the number of solidified drops with the same diameter on the degree and duration of their overheating.</description>

      <title>Terahertz Emission From Diamond Nitrogen-Vacancy Centers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16616v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Coherent light sources emitting in the terahertz range are highly sought after for fundamental research and applications. THz lasers rely on achieving population inversion. We demonstrate the generation of THz radiation using nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in a diamond single crystal. Population inversion is achieved through the Zeeman splitting of the $S=1$ state in $15\ \text{T}$, resulting in a splitting of $0.42\ \text{THz}$, where the middle $S_z=0$ sublevel is selectively pumped by visible light. To detect the THz radiation, we utilize a phase-sensitive THz setup, optimized for electron spin resonance measurements (ESR). We determine the spin-lattice relaxation time up to $15\ \text{T}$ using the light-induced ESR measurement, which shows the dominance of phonon-mediated relaxation and the high efficacy of the population inversion. The THz radiation is tunable by the magnetic field, thus these findings may lead to the next generation of tunable coherent THz sources.</description>

      <title>Ensemble-Embedding Graph Neural Network for Direct Prediction of Optical Spectra from Crystal Structure</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16654v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optical properties in solids, such as refractive index and absorption, hold vast applications ranging from solar panels to sensors, photodetectors, and transparent displays. However, first-principles computation of optical properties from crystal structures is a complex task due to the high convergence criteria and computational cost. Recent progress in machine learning shows promise in predicting material properties, yet predicting optical properties from crystal structures remains challenging due to the lack of efficient atomic embeddings. Here, we introduce GNNOpt, an equivariance graph-neural-network architecture featuring automatic embedding optimization. This enables high-quality optical predictions with a dataset of only 944 materials. GNNOpt predicts all optical properties based on the Kramers-Kr{\"o}nig relations, including absorption coefficient, complex dielectric function, complex refractive index, and reflectance. We apply the trained model to screen photovoltaic materials based on spectroscopic limited maximum efficiency and search for quantum materials based on quantum weight. First-principles calculations validate the efficacy of the GNNOpt model, demonstrating excellent agreement in predicting the optical spectra of unseen materials. The discovery of new quantum materials with high predicted quantum weight, such as SiOs which hosts exotic quasiparticles, demonstrates GNNOpt's potential in predicting optical properties across a broad range of materials and applications.</description>

      <title>Probing Yu-Shiba Rushinov state via quantum noise and $\Delta_T$ noise</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16717v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent attention has been drawn to temperature gradient generated $\Delta_T$ noise at vanishing charge current. This study delves into examining the properties of spin-polarised $\Delta T$ noise in conjunction with $\Delta_T$-shot noise, $\Delta_T$-thermal noise, and quantum noise (again both shot and thermal noise) in a one-dimensional (1D) structure comprising metal/spin-flipper/metal/insulator/superconductor junction to probe Yu-Shiba-Rusinov (YSR) bound states. YSR bound states, which are localized states within the superconducting gap of a superconductor are induced by a magnetic impurity acting as a spin-flipper. A YSR bound state should be distinguished from a Majorana bound state (MBS), which too can occur due to interaction with magnetic impurities, e.g., magnetic adatoms on superconductors, and this can lead to false positives in detecting MBS. Clarifying this by providing a unique signature for the YSR-bound state is the main aim of this work. In this paper, we show that YSR bound states can be effectively probed using quantum noise and the recently discovered $\Delta_T$ noise, with a focus on especially spin transport. We see that the spin $\Delta_T$ noise is a superior tool compared to the charge $\Delta_T$ noise as a probe for YSR bound states. Additionally, our analysis of quantum noise reveals that similar to $\Delta_T$ noise, spin quantum noise is more effective than charge quantum noise in detecting YSR bound states.</description>

      <title>In-situ surface porosity prediction in DED (directed energy deposition) printed SS316L parts using multimodal sensor fusion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.08658v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study aims to relate the time-frequency patterns of acoustic emission (AE) and other multi-modal sensor data collected in a hybrid directed energy deposition (DED) process to the pore formations at high spatial (0.5 mm) and time (&lt; 1ms) resolutions. Adapting an explainable AI method in LIME (Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations), certain high-frequency waveform signatures of AE are to be attributed to two major pathways for pore formation in a DED process, namely, spatter events and insufficient fusion between adjacent printing tracks from low heat input. This approach opens an exciting possibility to predict, in real-time, the presence of a pore in every voxel (0.5 mm in size) as they are printed, a major leap forward compared to prior efforts. Synchronized multimodal sensor data including force, AE, vibration and temperature were gathered while an SS316L material sample was printed and subsequently machined. A deep convolution neural network classifier was used to identify the presence of pores on a voxel surface based on time-frequency patterns (spectrograms) of the sensor data collected during the process chain. The results suggest signals collected during DED were more sensitive compared to those from machining for detecting porosity in voxels (classification test accuracy of 87%). The underlying explanations drawn from LIME analysis suggests that energy captured in high frequency AE waveforms are 33% lower for porous voxels indicating a relatively lower laser-material interaction in the melt pool, and hence insufficient fusion and poor overlap between adjacent printing tracks. The porous voxels for which spatter events were prevalent during printing had about 27% higher energy contents in the high frequency AE band compared to other porous voxels. These signatures from AE signal can further the understanding of pore formation from spatter and insufficient fusion.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02442v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Adapting electronics to perfectly conform to non-planar and rough surfaces, such as human skin, is a very challenging task which, if solved, could open up new applications in fields of high economic and scientific interest ranging from health to robotics, wearable electronics, human machine interface and Internet of Things. The key to success lies in defining a technology that can lead to the fabrication of ultra-thin devices while exploiting materials that are ultimately thin, with high mechanical flexibility and excellent electrical properties. Here, we report a hybrid approach for the definition of high-performance, ultra-thin and conformable electronic devices and circuits, based on the integration of ultimately thin semiconducting transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDC), i.e., MoS2, with organic gate dielectric material, i.e., polyvinyl formal (PVF) combined with the ink-jet printing of conductive PEDOT:PSS ink for electrodes definition. Through this cost-effective, fully bottom-up and solution-based approach, transistors and simple digital and analogue circuits are fabricated by a sequential stacking of ultrathin (nanometer) layers on a few micron thick polyimide substrate, which guarantees the high flexibility mandatory for the targeted applications.</description>

      <title>Accelerating materials discovery for polymer solar cells: Data-driven insights enabled by natural language processing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.19462v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a simulation of various active learning strategies for the discovery of polymer solar cell donor/acceptor pairs using data extracted from the literature spanning $\sim$20 years by a natural language processing pipeline. While data-driven methods have been well established to discover novel materials faster than Edisonian trial-and-error approaches, their benefits have not been quantified for material discovery problems that can take decades. Our approach demonstrates a potential reduction in discovery time by approximately 75 %, equivalent to a 15 year acceleration in material innovation. Our pipeline enables us to extract data from greater than 3300 papers which is $\sim$5 times larger and therefore more diverse than similar data sets reported by others. We also trained machine learning models to predict the power conversion efficiency and used our model to identify promising donor-acceptor combinations that are as yet unreported. We thus demonstrate a pipeline that goes from published literature to extracted material property data which in turn is used to obtain data-driven insights. Our insights include active learning strategies that can be used to train strong predictive models of material properties or be robust to the initial material system used. This work provides a valuable framework for data-driven research in materials science.</description>

      <title>Real-time Deformation Correction in Additively Printed Flexible Antenna Arrays</title>

Abstract: Conformal phased arrays provide multiple degrees of freedom to the scan angle, which is typically limited by antenna aperture in rigid arrays. Silicon-based RF signal processing offers reliable, reconfigurable, multi-functional, and compact control for conformal phased arrays that can be used for on-the-move communication. While the lightweight, compactness, and shape-changing properties of the conformal phased arrays are attractive, these features result in dynamic deformation of the array during motion leading to significant dynamic beam pointing errors. We propose a silicon-based, compact, reconfigurable solution to self-correct these dynamic deformation-induced beam pointing errors. Furthermore, additive printing is leveraged to enhance the flexibility of the conformal phased arrays, as the printed conductive ink is more flexible than bulk copper and can be easily deposited on flexible sheets using different printing tools, providing an environmentally-friendly solution for large-scale production. The inks such as conventional silver inks are expensive and copper-based printable inks suffer from spontaneous metal oxidation that alters trace impedance and degrades beamforming performance. This work uses a low-cost molecular copper decomposition ink with reliable RF properties at different temperature and strain to print the proposed intelligent conformal phased array operating at 2.1 GHz. Proof-of-concept prototype $2\times2$ array self-corrects the deformation induces beampointing error with an error $&lt;1.25^\circ$. The silicon based array processing part occupying only 2.58 mm$^2$ area and 83 mW power per tile.</description>

Abstract: Integration of 2D materials in nanoelectromechanical systems (NEMS) marries the robustness of silicon-based materials with exceptional electrical controllability in 2D materials, drastically enhancing system performance which now is the key for many advanced applications in nanotechnology. Here, we experimentally demonstrate and theoretically analyze a powerful on-chip graphene integrated NEMS device consisting of a hybrid graphene/silicon-nitride membrane with metallic leads that enables an extremely large static and dynamic parameter regulation. When a static voltage is applied to the leads, the force induced by the thermal expansion difference between the leads and the membrane results in ultra-wide frequency tuning, deformation (post-buckling transition) and regulation of mechanical properties. Moreover, by injecting an alternating voltage to the leads, we can excite the resonator vibrating even far beyond its linear regime without a complex and space consuming actuation system. Our results prove that the device is a compact integrated system possessing mechanical robustness, high controllability, and fast response. It not only expands the limit of the application range of NEMS devices but also pushes multidimensional nanomechanical resonators into working in the nonlinear regime.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14689v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Optical photothermal microscopy is a powerful, emerging method that overcomes the diffraction limit in infrared hyperspectral imaging by utilizing a visible probe laser beam to detect local temperature-induced modulation at the visible diffraction limit. However, the spectral range of this technique has been limited by the tuning range of infrared sources, which is generally restricted to the fingerprint window with commercially available quantum cascade lasers. In this work, ultra-broadband synchrotron infrared radiation was used for infrared photothermal imaging and spectroscopy, spanning the entire mid-infrared range. Both optical- and fluorescence-detected photothermal modalities were performed, demonstrating improved spectral range when compared to optical photothermal microscopy using commercial sources and improved spatial resolution when compared to synchrotron micro-spectroscopy measurements. Following these initial validation studies, synchrotron Fourier-transform optical photothermal infrared spectroscopy (FT-OPTIR) in combination with synchrotron micro-spectroscopy measurements were used to differentiate cells in mouse brain tissue sections.</description>
