      <title>Improving DF-Conformer Using Hydra For High-Fidelity Generative Speech Enhancement on Discrete Codec Token</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02454v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Dilated FAVOR Conformer (DF-Conformer) is an efficient variant of the Conformer architecture designed for speech enhancement (SE). It employs fast attention through positive orthogonal random features (FAVOR+) to mitigate the quadratic complexity associated with self-attention, while utilizing dilated convolution to expand the receptive field. This combination results in impressive performance across various SE models. In this paper, we propose replacing FAVOR+ with bidirectional selective structured state-space sequence models to achieve two main objectives:(1) enhancing global sequential modeling by eliminating the approximations inherent in FAVOR+, and (2) maintaining linear complexity relative to the sequence length. Specifically, we utilize Hydra, a bidirectional extension of Mamba, framed within the structured matrix mixer framework. Experiments conducted using a generative SE model on discrete codec tokens, known as Genhancer, demonstrate that the proposed method surpasses the performance of the DF-Conformer.</description>

      <title>Perceived Femininity in Singing Voice: Analysis and Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02726v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper focuses on the often-overlooked aspect of perceived voice femininity in singing voices. While existing research has examined perceived voice femininity in speech, the same concept has not yet been studied in singing voice. The analysis of gender bias in music content could benefit from such study. To address this gap, we design a stimuli-based survey to measure perceived singing voice femininity (PSVF), and collect responses from 128 participants. Our analysis reveals intriguing insights into how PSVF varies across different demographic groups. Furthermore, we propose an automatic PSVF prediction model by fine-tuning an x-vector model, offering a novel tool for exploring gender stereotypes related to voices in music content analysis beyond binary sex classification. This study contributes to a deeper understanding of the complexities surrounding perceived femininity in singing voices by analyzing survey and proposes an automatic tool for future research.</description>

      <title>Condition-Invariant fMRI Decoding of Speech Intelligibility with Deep State Space Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01868v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Clarifying the neural basis of speech intelligibility is critical for computational neuroscience and digital speech processing. Recent neuroimaging studies have shown that intelligibility modulates cortical activity beyond simple acoustics, primarily in the superior temporal and inferior frontal gyri. However, previous studies have been largely confined to clean speech, leaving it unclear whether the brain employs condition-invariant neural codes across diverse listening environments. To address this gap, we propose a novel architecture built upon a deep state space model for decoding intelligibility from fMRI signals, specifically tailored to their high-dimensional temporal structure. We present the first attempt to decode intelligibility across acoustically distinct conditions, showing our method significantly outperforms classical approaches. Furthermore, region-wise analysis highlights contributions from auditory, frontal, and parietal regions, and cross-condition transfer indicates the presence of condition-invariant neural codes, thereby advancing understanding of abstract linguistic representations in the brain.</description>

      <title>An Evaluation of Interleaved Instruction Tuning on Semantic Reasoning Performance in an Audio MLLM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02234v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Standard training for Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) involves concatenating non-textual information, like vision or audio, with a text prompt. This approach may not encourage deep integration of modalities, limiting the model's ability to leverage the core language model's reasoning capabilities. This work examined the impact of interleaved instruction tuning in an audio MLLM, where audio tokens are interleaved within the prompt. Using the Listen, Think, and Understand (LTU) model as a testbed, we conduct an experiment using the Synonym and Hypernym Audio Reasoning Dataset (SHARD), our newly created reasoning benchmark for audio-based semantic reasoning focusing on synonym and hypernym recognition. Our findings show that while even zero-shot interleaved prompting improves performance on our reasoning tasks, a small amount of fine-tuning using interleaved training prompts improves the results further, however, at the expense of the MLLM's audio labeling ability.</description>

      <title>From the perspective of perceptual speech quality: The robustness of frequency bands to noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02252v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Speech quality is one of the main foci of speech-related research, where it is frequently studied with speech intelligibility, another essential measurement. Band-level perceptual speech intelligibility, however, has been studied frequently, whereas speech quality has not been thoroughly analyzed. In this paper, a Multiple Stimuli With Hidden Reference and Anchor (MUSHRA) inspired approach was proposed to study the individual robustness of frequency bands to noise with perceptual speech quality as the measure. Speech signals were filtered into thirty-two frequency bands with compromising real-world noise employed at different signal-to-noise ratios. Robustness to noise indices of individual frequency bands was calculated based on the human-rated perceptual quality scores assigned to the reconstructed noisy speech signals. Trends in the results suggest the mid-frequency region appeared less robust to noise in terms of perceptual speech quality. These findings suggest future research aiming at improving speech quality should pay more attention to the mid-frequency region of the speech signals accordingly.</description>

      <title>H-Infinity Filter Enhanced CNN-LSTM for Arrhythmia Detection from Heart Sound Recordings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02379v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Early detection of heart arrhythmia can prevent severe future complications in cardiac patients. While manual diagnosis still remains the clinical standard, it relies heavily on visual interpretation and is inherently subjective. In recent years, deep learning has emerged as a powerful tool to automate arrhythmia detection, offering improved accuracy, consistency, and efficiency. Several variants of convolutional and recurrent neural network architectures have been widely explored to capture spatial and temporal patterns in physiological signals. However, despite these advancements, current models often struggle to generalize well in real-world scenarios, especially when dealing with small or noisy datasets, which are common challenges in biomedical applications. In this paper, a novel CNN-H-Infinity-LSTM architecture is proposed to identify arrhythmic heart signals from heart sound recordings. This architecture introduces trainable parameters inspired by the H-Infinity filter from control theory, enhancing robustness and generalization. Extensive experimentation on the PhysioNet CinC Challenge 2016 dataset, a public benchmark of heart audio recordings, demonstrates that the proposed model achieves stable convergence and outperforms existing benchmarks, with a test accuracy of 99.42% and an F1 score of 98.85%.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.09378v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Parallel to rapid advancements in foundation model research, the past few years have witnessed a surge in music AI applications. As AI-generated and AI-augmented music become increasingly mainstream, many researchers in the music AI community may wonder: what research frontiers remain unexplored? This paper outlines several key areas within music AI research that present significant opportunities for further investigation. We begin by examining foundational representation models and highlight emerging efforts toward explainability and interpretability. We then discuss the evolution toward multimodal systems, provide an overview of the current landscape of music datasets and their limitations, and address the growing importance of model efficiency in both training and deployment. Next, we explore applied directions, focusing first on generative models. We review recent systems, their computational constraints, and persistent challenges related to evaluation and controllability. We then examine extensions of these generative approaches to multimodal settings and their integration into artists' workflows, including applications in music editing, captioning, production, transcription, source separation, performance, discovery, and education. Finally, we explore copyright implications of generative music and propose strategies to safeguard artist rights. While not exhaustive, this survey aims to illuminate promising research directions enabled by recent developments in music foundation models.</description>

      <title>Audio-Thinker: Guiding Audio Language Model When and How to Think via Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08039v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models, multimodal large language models, and large audio language models (LALMs) have significantly improved their reasoning capabilities through reinforcement learning with rule-based rewards. However, the explicit reasoning process has yet to show significant benefits for audio question answering, and effectively leveraging deep reasoning remains an open challenge, with LALMs still falling short of human-level auditory-language reasoning. To address these limitations, we propose Audio-Thinker, a reinforcement learning framework designed to enhance the reasoning capabilities of LALMs, with a focus on improving adaptability, consistency, and effectiveness. Our approach introduces an adaptive think accuracy reward, enabling the model to adjust its reasoning strategies based on task complexity dynamically. Furthermore, we incorporate an external reward model to evaluate the overall consistency and quality of the reasoning process, complemented by think-based rewards that help the model distinguish between valid and flawed reasoning paths during training. Experimental results demonstrate that our Audio-Thinker model outperforms existing reasoning-oriented LALMs across various benchmark tasks, exhibiting superior reasoning and generalization capabilities.</description>

      <title>DARAS: Dynamic Audio-Room Acoustic Synthesis for Blind Room Impulse Response Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08135v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Room Impulse Responses (RIRs) accurately characterize acoustic properties of indoor environments and play a crucial role in applications such as speech enhancement, speech recognition, and audio rendering in augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR). Existing blind estimation methods struggle to achieve practical accuracy. To overcome this challenge, we propose the dynamic audio-room acoustic synthesis (DARAS) model, a novel deep learning framework that is explicitly designed for blind RIR estimation from monaural reverberant speech signals. First, a dedicated deep audio encoder effectively extracts relevant nonlinear latent space features. Second, the Mamba-based self-supervised blind room parameter estimation (MASS-BRPE) module, utilizing the efficient Mamba state space model (SSM), accurately estimates key room acoustic parameters and features. Third, the system incorporates a hybrid-path cross-attention feature fusion module, enhancing deep integration between audio and room acoustic features. Finally, our proposed dynamic acoustic tuning (DAT) decoder adaptively segments early reflections and late reverberation to improve the realism of synthesized RIRs. Experimental results, including a MUSHRA-based subjective listening study, demonstrate that DARAS substantially outperforms existing baseline models, providing a robust and effective solution for practical blind RIR estimation in real-world acoustic environments.</description>

      <title>MultiSoundGen: Video-to-Audio Generation for Multi-Event Scenarios via SlowFast Contrastive Audio-Visual Pretraining and Direct Preference Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19999v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Current video-to-audio (V2A) methods struggle in complex multi-event scenarios (video scenarios involving multiple sound sources, sound events, or transitions) due to two critical limitations. First, existing methods face challenges in precisely aligning intricate semantic information together with rapid dynamic features. Second, foundational training lacks quantitative preference optimization for semantic-temporal alignment and audio quality. As a result, it fails to enhance integrated generation quality in cluttered multi-event scenes. To address these core limitations, this study proposes a novel V2A framework: MultiSoundGen. It introduces direct preference optimization (DPO) into the V2A domain, leveraging audio-visual pretraining (AVP) to enhance performance in complex multi-event scenarios. Our contributions include two key innovations: the first is SlowFast Contrastive AVP (SF-CAVP), a pioneering AVP model with a unified dual-stream architecture. SF-CAVP explicitly aligns core semantic representations and rapid dynamic features of audio-visual data to handle multi-event complexity; second, we integrate the DPO method into V2A task and propose AVP-Ranked Preference Optimization (AVP-RPO). It uses SF-CAVP as a reward model to quantify and prioritize critical semantic-temporal matches while enhancing audio quality. Experiments demonstrate that MultiSoundGen achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in multi-event scenarios, delivering comprehensive gains across distribution matching, audio quality, semantic alignment, and temporal synchronization. Demos are available at https://v2aresearch.github.io/MultiSoundGen/.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.20410v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spoken dialogue models have significantly advanced intelligent human-computer interaction, yet they lack a plug-and-play full-duplex prediction module for semantic endpoint detection, hindering seamless audio interactions. In this paper, we introduce Phoenix-VAD, an LLM-based model that enables streaming semantic endpoint detection. Specifically, Phoenix-VAD leverages the semantic comprehension capability of the LLM and a sliding window training strategy to achieve reliable semantic endpoint detection while supporting streaming inference. Experiments on both semantically complete and incomplete speech scenarios indicate that Phoenix-VAD achieves excellent and competitive performance. Furthermore, this design enables the full-duplex prediction module to be optimized independently of the dialogue model, providing more reliable and flexible support for next-generation human-computer interaction.</description>

      <title>AuthGlass: Enhancing Voice Authentication on Smart Glasses via Air-Bone Acoustic Features</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.20799v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the rapid advancement of smart glasses, voice interaction has become widely deployed due to its naturalness and convenience. However, its practicality is often undermined by the vulnerability to spoofing attacks and interference from surrounding sounds, making seamless voice authentication crucial for smart glasses usage. To address this challenge, we propose AuthGlass, a voice authentication approach that leverages both air- and bone-conducted speech features to enhance accuracy and liveness detection. Aiming to gain comprehensive knowledge on speech-related acoustic and vibration features, we built a smart glasses prototype with redundant synchronized microphones: 14 air-conductive microphones and 2 bone-conductive units. In a study with 42 participants, we validated that combining sound-field and vibration features significantly improves authentication robustness and attack resistance. Furthermore, experiments demonstrated that AuthGlass maintains competitive accuracy even under various practical scenarios, highlighting its applicability and scalability for real-world deployment.</description>
