      <title>Fast and explicit European option pricing under tempered stable processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01211v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide series expansions for the tempered stable densities and for the price of European-style contracts in the exponential L\'evy model driven by the tempered stable process. These formulas recover several popular option pricing models, and become particularly simple in some specific cases such as bilateral Gamma process and one-sided TS process. When compared to traditional Fourier pricing, our method has the advantage of being hyperparameter free. We also provide a detailed numerical analysis and show that our technique is competitive with state-of-the-art pricing methods.</description>

      <title>Can Machine Learning Algorithms Outperform Traditional Models for Option Pricing?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01446v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the application of machine learning techniques, specifically Neural Networks, Random Forests, and CatBoost for option pricing, in comparison to traditional models such as Black-Scholes and Heston Model. Using both synthetically generated data and real market option data, each model is evaluated in predicting the option price. The results show that machine learning models can capture complex, non-linear relationships in option prices and, in several cases, outperform both Black-Scholes and Heston models. These findings highlight the potential of data-driven methods to improve pricing accuracy and better reflect market dynamics.</description>

      <title>FINCH: Financial Intelligence using Natural language for Contextualized SQL Handling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01887v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Text-to-SQL, the task of translating natural language questions into SQL queries, has long been a central challenge in NLP. While progress has been significant, applying it to the financial domain remains especially difficult due to complex schema, domain-specific terminology, and high stakes of error. Despite this, there is no dedicated large-scale financial dataset to advance research, creating a critical gap. To address this, we introduce a curated financial dataset (FINCH) comprising 292 tables and 75,725 natural language-SQL pairs, enabling both fine-tuning and rigorous evaluation. Building on this resource, we benchmark reasoning models and language models of varying scales, providing a systematic analysis of their strengths and limitations in financial Text-to-SQL tasks. Finally, we propose a finance-oriented evaluation metric (FINCH Score) that captures nuances overlooked by existing measures, offering a more faithful assessment of model performance.</description>

      <title>One More Question is Enough, Expert Question Decomposition (EQD) Model for Domain Quantitative Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01526v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Domain-specific quantitative reasoning remains a major challenge for large language models (LLMs), especially in fields requiring expert knowledge and complex question answering (QA). In this work, we propose Expert Question Decomposition (EQD), an approach designed to balance the use of domain knowledge with computational efficiency. EQD is built on a two-step fine-tuning framework and guided by a reward function that measures the effectiveness of generated sub-questions in improving QA outcomes. It requires only a few thousand training examples and a single A100 GPU for fine-tuning, with inference time comparable to zero-shot prompting. Beyond its efficiency, EQD outperforms state-of-the-art domain-tuned models and advanced prompting strategies. We evaluate EQD in the financial domain, characterized by specialized knowledge and complex quantitative reasoning, across four benchmark datasets. Our method consistently improves QA performance by 0.6% to 10.5% across different LLMs. Our analysis reveals an important insight: in domain-specific QA, a single supporting question often provides greater benefit than detailed guidance steps.</description>

      <title>Mean-field theory of the Santa Fe model revisited: a systematic derivation from an exact BBGKY hierarchy for the zero-intelligence limit-order book model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01814v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Santa Fe model is an established econophysics model for describing stochastic dynamics of the limit order book from the viewpoint of the zero-intelligence approach. While its foundation was studied by combining a dimensional analysis and a mean-field theory by E. Smith et al. in Quantitative Finance 2003, their arguments are rather heuristic and lack solid mathematical foundation; indeed, their mean-field equations were derived with heuristic arguments and their solutions were not explicitly obtained. In this work, we revisit the mean-field theory of the Santa Fe model from the viewpoint of kinetic theory -- a traditional mathematical program in statistical physics. We study the exact master equation for the Santa Fe model and systematically derive the Bogoliubov-Born-Green-Kirkwood-Yvon (BBGKY) hierarchical equation. By applying the mean-field approximation, we derive the mean-field equation for the order-book density profile, parallel to the Boltzmann equation in conventional statistical physics. Furthermore, we obtain explicit and closed expression of the mean-field solutions. Our solutions have several implications: (1)Our scaling formulas are available for both $\mu\to 0$ and $\mu\to \infty$ asymptotics, where $\mu$ is the market-order submission intensity. Particularly, the mean-field theory works very well for small $\mu$, while its validity is partially limited for large $\mu$. (2)The ``method of image'' solution, heuristically derived by Bouchaud-M\'ezard-Potters in Quantitative Finance 2002, is obtained for large $\mu$, serving as a mathematical foundation for their heuristic arguments. (3)Finally, we point out an error in E. Smith et al. 2003 in the scaling law for the diffusion constant due to a misspecification in their dimensional analysis.</description>

      <title>Rolling intrinsic for battery valuation in day-ahead and intraday markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01956v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS) are a cornerstone of the energy transition, as their ability to shift electricity across time enables both grid stability and the integration of renewable generation. This paper investigates the profitability of different market bidding strategies for BESS in the Central European wholesale power market, focusing on the day-ahead auction and intraday trading at EPEX Spot. We employ the rolling intrinsic approach as a realistic trading strategy for continuous intraday markets, explicitly incorporating bid--ask spreads to account for liquidity constraints. Our analysis shows that multi-market bidding strategies consistently outperform single-market participation. Furthermore, we demonstrate that maximum cycle limits significantly affect profitability, indicating that more flexible strategies which relax daily cycling constraints while respecting annual limits can unlock additional value.</description>
