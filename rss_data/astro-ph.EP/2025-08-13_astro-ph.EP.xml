      <title>Orbits and Masses for 156 Companions from Combined Astrometry and Radial Velocities, and A Validation of Gaia Non-Single Star Solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We combine absolute astrometry from Hipparcos and Gaia with archival radial velocities from the Keck/HIRES and ESO/HARPS spectrographs, as well as relative astrometry (when available), to derive masses and orbits for 156 companions around main-sequence stars, including 111 stellar companions, 12 brown dwarfs, and 33 planets. Although this sample is not compiled for occurrence-rate statistics due to systematic biases in non-uniform target selection and varied observing strategies, we nonetheless clearly detect the Brown Dwarf desert in the distribution of companion masses (as well as in mass ratio), out to separations of more than 10 AU. This work also enables a validation of Gaia DR3 non-single-star solutions by predicting Gaia's measured Right Ascension and Declination acceleration terms. For stars with Gaia astrometric acceleration solutions, we find qualitative agreement with Gaia DR3 results. Our predicted accelerations agree with the Gaia DR3 values overall, showing a median offset of 1.85 sigma, with a tail extending to about 10 sigma. These residuals suggest modestly underestimated uncertainties, broadly consistent with previous results for parallaxes and proper motions. Three of our systems have full Gaia orbital fits; however, their true orbital periods are long and all three Gaia solutions are spurious. Gaia DR4 will provide individual astrometric measurements and enable more detailed and extensive investigations of accelerating and orbital fits.</description>

      <title>Hot Jupiter formation in dense stellar clusters: A Monte Carlo model applied to 47 Tucanae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08406v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the efficiency of high-e migration as a pathway for Hot Jupiter formation in the dense globular cluster 47 Tuc. Gravitational N-body simulations are performed to investigate the orbital evolution of star-planet systems due to dynamical stellar perturbations. Planetary systems that have been scattered into orbits of sufficiently high eccentricity can undergo tidal circularisation, with Hot Jupiter formation being one possible stopping condition. We also account for the possibility of (i) ionisation due to high-energy encounters, (ii) tidal disruption of the planet by tidal forces inside the Roche limit and (iii) Warm Jupiter formation. The orbital evolution of a population of cold Jupiter progenitors, with initial semi-major axes between 1-30 au, is simulated over 12 Gyr using a simplified dynamical model of 47 Tuc. Our computational treatment of dynamical encounters yields an overall HJ occurrence rate of F_HJ = 5.9 x 10^-4 per cluster star (a 51 per cent enhancement relative to the analytic baseline). The probability of Hot Jupiter formation is highest in the core and falls off steeply beyond a few parsecs from the centre of the cluster, where the stellar density is too low to drive efficient eccentricity diffusion. The code can be found here: https://github.com/James-Wirth/HotJupiter.</description>

      <title>Statistical significance of meteorite-asteroid pairs using geocentric parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08409v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aims. We will test the statistical significance of meteorite-dropping fireballs and NEA clustering using the DN similarity function based on four geocentric quantities (U, theta, phi, and lambda).
  Methods. We calculated the cumulative similarity found between 46 meteorite falls, 535 potential meteorite-dropping fireballs, 20,516 NEAs maintained by NEODyS-2, along with 34,836 NEAs maintained by NASA/JPL HORIZONS. Statistical significance was estimated by either: (1) Kernel Density Estimation-based method to estimate the sporadic background distribution to draw random samples, or (2) applying a uniform random solar longitude (lambda). Each comparison to the synthetic sporadic population is repeated to estimate the 3-sigma region for which the cumulative similarity distribution is consistent with random association levels.
  Results. The observed DN cumulative similarity distribution between 46 instrumentally observed meteorite falls, 535 potential meteorite-dropping fireballs, and over 30k NEAs radiants (estimated using 6 different radiant methods) reveals no statistically significant excess of similarity between the populations consistent with streams.
  Conclusions. Based on nearly 600 fireball observations, there is no statistically significant clustering between meteorite falls and NEAs using geocentric impact parameters. If some meteorites arrive in streams, they make up less than ~0.1% of all falls. Recent asteroid or meteoroid physical processes could still explain features found in meteorites, but this activity is not producing distinguishable orbital streams or pairs.</description>

      <title>Strict limits on potential secondary atmospheres on the temperate rocky exo-Earth TRAPPIST-1 d</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The nearby TRAPPIST-1 system, with its seven small rocky planets orbiting a late-type M8 star, offers an unprecedented opportunity to search for secondary atmospheres on temperate terrestrial worlds. In particular, the 0.8 Earth-radii planet TRAPPIST-1 d lies at the edge of the habitable zone (equilibrium temperature ~262 K). Here we present the first 0.6-5.2 micron NIRSpec/PRISM transmission spectrum of TRAPPIST-1 d from two transits with JWST. We find that stellar contamination from unocculted bright heterogeneities introduces 500-1,000 ppm visit-dependent slopes, consistent with constraints from the out-of-transit stellar spectrum. Once corrected, the transmission spectrum is flat within $\pm$100-150 ppm, showing no evidence for a haze-like slope or molecular absorption despite NIRSpec/PRISM's sensitivity to CH4, H2O, CO, SO2, and CO2. Our observations exclude clear, hydrogen-dominated atmospheres with high confidence (greater than 3$\sigma$). We leverage our constraints on even trace amounts of CH4, H2O, and CO2 to further reject high mean molecular weight compositions analogous to Titan, a cloud-free Venus, early Mars, and both Archean Earth and a cloud-free modern Earth scenario (greater than 95% confidence). If TRAPPIST-1 d retains an atmosphere, it is likely extremely thin or contains high-altitude aerosols, with water cloud formation at the terminator predicted by 3D global climate models. Alternatively, if TRAPPIST-1 d is airless, our evolutionary models indicate that TRAPPIST-1 b, c, and d must have formed with less than approximately 4 Earth oceans of water, though this would not preclude atmospheres on the cooler habitable-zone planets TRAPPIST-1 e, f, and g.</description>

      <title>Warm, water-depleted rocky exoplanets with surface ionic liquids: A proposed class for planetary habitability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08437v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discovery of thousands of exoplanets and the emergence of telescopes capable of exoplanet atmospheric characterization have intensified the search for habitable worlds. Due to selection biases, many exoplanets under study are planets deemed inhospitable because their surfaces are too warm to support liquid water. We propose that such planets could still support life through ionic liquids: Liquid salts with negligible vapor pressure that can persist on warm planets with thin atmospheres, where liquid water cannot. Ionic liquids have not previously been considered as naturally occurring substances, and thus have not been discussed in planetary science. We demonstrate in laboratory experiments that ionic liquids can form from planetary materials: Sulfuric acid combined with nitrogen-containing organic molecules. Sulfuric acid can be volcanic in origin, and organic compounds are commonly found on planetary bodies. The required planetary surface is water-depleted and must support sulfuric acid transiently in liquid phase to dissolve organics, followed by evaporation of excess liquid, conditions spanning approximately 300 K at 10^-7 atm to 350-470 K at 0.01 atm. Because ionic liquids have extremely low vapor pressures, they are not prone to evaporation, allowing small droplets or pools to persist without ocean-like reservoirs. Ionic liquids' minuscule vapor pressure at room temperature suggests possible stability on planets with negligible atmospheres, shielded by magnetic fields or rock crevices against harsh cosmic radiation. Ionic liquids can stably dissolve enzymes and other biomolecules, enabling biocatalysis and offering a plausible solvent for life, broadening the definition of habitable worlds.</description>

      <title>A Bayesian Benchmarking of GBEES Applied to Outer Planet Orbiter Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Moment-based estimation filters have successfully aided spacecraft navigation for decades. However, future missions plan to venture into deep-space regimes with significant round-trip light-time telecommunication delays, operate in unstable, quasi-periodic orbits, and perform highly precise, low-altitude flybys of outer planet moons. These complex trajectories may necessitate ensemble-based filters for accurate estimation over realistic measurement cadences. To mitigate the inherent risk associated with testing novel navigation software, ensemble filters must be accurate, efficient, and robust. Grid-based, Bayesian Estimation Exploiting Sparsity, a high-dimensional Godunov-type finite volume method that propagates the full probability distribution function, demonstrates strong overall performance across all these criteria when compared with the contemporary landscape of filters. These qualities are exhibited via a Bayesian investigation in which the state uncertainty of a Saturn-Enceladus Distant Prograde Orbit is propagated, incorporating infrequent, nonlinear measurement updates. Along with root mean square error, we use the Bhattacharyya coefficient, a non-normal metric for measuring the dissimilarity between distributions, and the Effective Sampling Size, a measure of particle degeneracy, to quantitatively ascertain that in this application, Grid-based, Bayesian Estimation Exploiting Sparsity outperforms the other ensemble filters assessed, though it comes at a nontrivial computational cost.</description>

      <title>Searching for Planets Orbiting $\epsilon$~Eridani with JWST/NIRCam</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present observations of \epseri~with the JWST/NIRCam coronagraph aimed at imaging planets orbiting within this system. In particular, these observations targeted (1) the Jupiter-like planet, first detected orbiting at 3.5 AU with radial velocity observations, and (2) the planet postulated to be responsible for carving the edges of \epseri's outer ring, expected to orbit at 40-50 AU. However, no point sources were detected at a statistically significant level. We report new, improved upper limits at 4 $\mu$m: $\sim$1e-7~contrast at 1\arcsec, and $\sim$2e-8~beyond 5\arcsec. The latter contrast limit precludes Saturn-mass planets at separations $&gt;$16~AU given current models. We also report upper limits for \epseri's disk emission at 4 $\mu$m. While the radial surface brightness profile shows no evidence of emission, we detect a 1-$\sigma$ surface brightness signal on the east side of the system, consistent with forward scattering emission expected for \epseri's disk inclination. Finally, we evaluate the performance of the 3-roll observation strategy, which was first employed in these observations: the gains in contrast are modest, with 20-30\% improvements with respect to the conventional 2-roll strategy.</description>

      <title>Analytical modeling of the gravitational potential of irregularly shaped celestial bodies considering three distinct internal structures: application to (21) Lutetia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08538v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The classical polyhedral model is one of the most accurate methods currently used to represent the gravitational field of irregularly shaped bodies. However, it assumes a homogeneous density distribution, which may not accurately reflect the internal composition of real objects. This study aims to analyze the effects of the internal structure of asteroid (21) Lutetia on gravitational potential modeling by considering a three-layered composition with distinct densities. The gravitational approach adopted in this study is the Potential Series Expansion Method (PSEM), represents models the body as a polyhedron and decomposes it into tetrahedral elements to estimate of the total potential around the asteroid. This estimation involves summing the contributions of each tetrahedron using a direct triple integral over its volume. Although this method does not achieve the same level of accuracy as the classical polyhedral approach, it offers a reasonable degree of precision, expresses the potential in analytical form, significantly reduces computational time, and, due to the simplified algebraic manipulation of the potential, facilitates the analysis of the asteroid's internal structural composition.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous visible spectrophotometry of interstellar object 3I/ATLAS with Seimei/TriCCS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 3I/ATLAS, also known as C/2025 N$_1$ (ATLAS), is the third interstellar object (ISO) discovered in July 2025. ISOs are particularly interesting because characterizing their physical properties helps us understand and test our knowledge of Solar System formation. Several quick response observations of 3I/ATLAS were performed during the first few days after the discovery, and various results, such as reflectance spectra, have been reported. We performed simultaneous visible spectrophotometry of 3I/ATLAS from data taken using the TriColor CMOS Camera and Spectrograph (TriCCS) on the Seimei 3.8 m telescope. The Seimei/TriCCS observations of 3I/ALTAS were obtained in the $g$, $r$, $i$, and $z$ bands in the Pan-STARRS system on UTC July 15, 2025. Our lightcurves show no significant variations during the 2.3 h observation, which is in good agreement with previous studies. Visible color indices of 3I/ATLAS, $g-r=0.603\pm0.031$, $r-i=0.210\pm0.031$, $i-z=0.117\pm0.046$, and $r-z=0.327\pm0.035$ suggest it has a red surface similar to, or slightly redder than, that of D-type asteroids. Continuous observations of 3I/ATLAS before and after its perihelion passage in October 2025 are desired to investigate its physical properties.</description>

      <title>Theoretical Mass Function for Secondaries Forming via Gravitational Instability in Circumstellar Disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper constructs a theoretical framework for calculating the distribution of masses for secondary bodies forming via gravitational instability in the outer regions of circumstellar disks. We show that several alternate ways to specify the mass scale of forming objects converge to the same result under the constraint that the parental disks are marginally stable with stability parameter $Q=1$. Next we show that the well-known constraint that the formation of secondary bodies requires rapid cooling is equivalent to that of opacity limited fragmentation. These results are then used to derive a mass function for secondary objects forming through disk instablity. The resulting distribution is relatively narrow, with log-normal-like shape, a characteristic mass scale of order $M_{\scriptstyle \rm P}\sim10M_{\scriptstyle \rm Jup}$ and an approximate range of $4-80M_{\scriptstyle \rm Jup}$. Current estimates for the occurrence rate suggest that these objects are outnumbered by both stars and planets formed via core accretion.</description>

      <title>Luminaries in the Sky: The TESS Legacy Sample of Bright Stars. I. Asteroseismic detections in naked-eye main-sequence and sub-giant solar-like oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08699v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We aim to detect and characterise solar-like oscillations in bright naked-eye (V&lt;6) main-sequence (MS) and subgiant stars observed by TESS. We seek to expand the current benchmark sample of oscillators, provide accurate global asteroseismic parameters for these bright targets, and assess their potential for future detailed investigations -- including missions such as the HWO and PLATO. Our sample of bright stars was selected from the Hipparcos/Tycho catalogues. We analysed TESS 120-s and 20-s cadence photometry using SPOC light curves and custom apertures from target pixel files. After applying a filtering of the light curves, we extracted global asteroseismic parameters ($\nu_{\rm max}$ and $\Delta\nu$) using the pySYD pipeline. Results were cross-validated with independent pipelines and compared to predictions from the ATL, while noise properties were evaluated to quantify improvements from a 20-s observing cadence. We detect solar-like oscillations in a total of 196 stars -- including 128 new detections -- with extracted $\nu_{\rm max}$ and $\Delta\nu$ values showing strong conformity to expected scaling relations. This corresponds to an increase by more than an order of magnitude in the number of MS stars with detection of solar-like oscillations from TESS. Nearly 40% of our new detections are prime HWO targets, enabling systematic asteroseismic age determinations relevant for interpreting atmospheric biosignatures. Our analysis confirms that 20-s cadence data yields lower high-frequency noise levels compared to 120-s data. Moreover, the precise stellar parameters obtained through asteroseismology establish these bright stars as benchmarks for seismic investigations and provide useful constraints for refining stellar evolution models and for complementary analyses in interferometry, spectroscopy, and exoplanet characterisation.</description>

      <title>The Effects of Sunspots on Spectral Line Shapes in the Visible</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09030v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a comparative spectral analysis to explore the ability of a cooler Sun model to accurately capture the spectral line shape changes caused by Sunspots. In the search for small Earth-like planets, the effects of stellar surface activity can overwhelm the $\sim$10 cm/s planetary RV signal. This necessitates the development of new stellar modeling methods and a greater understanding of the impact of surface activity on stellar spectra. Some attempts to model out noise from Sunspot activity, in particular, have used a sum of a stellar model with a model of a cooler, but otherwise identical star. From our analysis, we find that a cooler effective temperature alone cannot capture the numerous spectral line shape variations seen in a Sunspot observation. The cooler temperature of a Sunspot not only deepens the cores of atomic lines, it also increases and strengthens molecular lines that are not fully represented in our line list. Furthermore, our LTE models and a comparison cool star also fail at capturing line strengthening, broadening, blending, and splitting induced by the magnetic field in the Sunspot.</description>

Abstract: The Keck Planet Imager and Characterizer (KPIC) combines high contrast imaging with high resolution spectroscopy (R~35,000 in K band) to study directly imaged exoplanets and brown dwarfs in unprecedented detail. KPIC aims to spectrally characterize substellar companions through measurements of planetary radial velocities, spins, and atmospheric composition. Currently, the dominant source of systematic noise for KPIC is fringing, or oscillations in the spectrum as a function of wavelength. The fringing signal can dominate residuals by up to 10% of the continuum for high S/N exposures, preventing accurate wavelength calibration, retrieval of atmospheric parameters, and detection of planets with flux ratios less than 1% of the host star. To combat contamination from fringing, we first identify its three unique sources and adopt a physically informed model of Fabry-Perot cavities to apply to post-processed data. We find this strategy can effectively model the fringing in observations of A0V/F0V stars, reducing the residual systematics caused by fringing by a factor of 2. Next, we wedge two of the transmissive optics internal to KPIC to eliminate two sources of fringing and confirm the third source as the entrance window to the spectrograph. Finally, we apply our previous model of the Fabry-Perot cavity to new data taken with the wedged optics to reduce the amplitude of the residuals by a factor of 10.</description>

      <title>The ALMA Survey of Gas Evolution of PROtoplanetary Disks (AGE-PRO): IV. Dust and Gas Disk Properties in the Upper Scorpius Star-forming Region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10735</link>

Abstract: The Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) large program AGE-PRO explores protoplanetary disk evolution by studying gas and dust across various ages. This work focuses on ten evolved disks in Upper Scorpius, observed in dust continuum emission, CO and its isotopologues, and N$_2$H$^+$ with ALMA Bands 6 and 7. Disk radii, from the radial location enclosing 68% of the flux, are comparable to those in the younger Lupus region for both gas and dust tracers. However, solid masses are about an order of magnitude below those in Lupus and Ophiuchus, while the dust spectral index suggests some level of dust evolution. These empirical findings align with a combination of radial drift, dust trapping, and grain growth into larger bodies. A moderate correlation between CO and continuum fluxes suggests a link between gas and dust content, through the increased scatter compared to younger regions, possibly due to age variations, gas-to-dust ratio differences, or CO depletion. Additionally, the correlation between C$^{18}$O and N$_2$H$^+$ fluxes observed in Lupus persists in Upper Sco, indicating a relatively stable CO gas abundance over the Class II stage of disk evolution. In conclusion, the AGE-PRO survey of Upper Scorpius disks reveals intriguing trends in disk evolution. The findings point towards potential gas evolution and the presence of dust traps in these older disks. Future high-resolution observations are needed to confirm these possibilities and further refine our understanding of disk evolution and planet formation in older environments.</description>

      <title>Shepherding Miorita and its flock: A group of near-Earth asteroids driven by apsidal and von Zeipel-Lidov-Kozai secular resonances. A source of low-perihelion asteroids</title>

Abstract: Context. Secular resonances can control the dynamical evolution of near-Earth asteroids (NEAs) and, in some cases, lead to increased orbital stability. Asteroid 622577 Miorita (2014 LU14) was the first NEA found by the Isaac Newton Telescope (INT) and exhibits unusual dynamical traits although it approaches Venus, Earth, and Mars at relatively close range.
  Aims. Here, we investigate the orbital context of Miorita and search for possible dynamical analogs within the NEA population.
  Methods. We studied the orbital evolution of Miorita using direct N-body calculations. We used the NEOMOD 3 orbital distribution model to verify our conclusions. Observational data were obtained with INT's Wide Field Camera.
  Results. Miorita is subjected to a von Zeipel-Lidov-Kozai secular resonance, but it is also in a near apsidal resonance, both controlled by Jupiter. We identified a group of dynamical analogs of Miorita that includes 387668 (2002 SZ), 2004 US1 , 299582 (2006 GQ2), and 2018 AC4. Miorita-like orbits can evolve into metastable, low-perihelion trajectories driven by apsidal and von Zeipel-Lidov-Kozai secular resonances like those of 504181 (2006 TC) and 482798 (2013 QK48). Objects in such paths may end up drawn into the Sun.
  Conclusions. Concurrent secular resonances tend to stabilize the orbits of these asteroids as they are protected against collision with Earth and other inner planets by the resonances. This group signals the existence of an active dynamical pathway capable of inserting NEAs in comet-like orbits. NEOMOD 3 gives a low probability for the existence of NEAs like Miorita, 504181 or 482798.</description>

      <title>Search for Dark Matter Induced Airglow in Planetary Atmospheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15318v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We point out that dark matter can illuminate planetary skies via ultraviolet airglow. Dark matter annihilation products can excite molecular hydrogen, which then deexcites to produce ultraviolet emission in the Lyman and Werner bands. We search for this new effect by analyzing nightside ultraviolet radiation data from Voyager 1, Voyager 2, and New Horizons flybys of Neptune, Uranus, Saturn, and Jupiter. Our findings set new constraints on the dark matter-nucleon scattering cross section down to about $10^{-40}~$cm$^2$. We highlight that future ultraviolet airglow measurements of Solar System planets or other worlds provide a new dark matter discovery avenue.</description>
