      <title>Heterogeneous Multi-Robot Graph Coverage with Proximity and Movement Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10083v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-Robot Coverage problems have been extensively studied in robotics, planning and multi-agent systems. In this work, we consider the coverage problem when there are constraints on the proximity (e.g., maximum distance between the agents, or a blue agent must be adjacent to a red agent) and the movement (e.g., terrain traversability and material load capacity) of the robots. Such constraints naturally arise in many real-world applications, e.g. in search-and-rescue and maintenance operations. Given such a setting, the goal is to compute a covering tour of the graph with a minimum number of steps, and that adheres to the proximity and movement constraints. For this problem, our contributions are four: (i) a formal formulation of the problem, (ii) an exact algorithm that is FPT in F, d and tw, the set of robot formations that encode the proximity constraints, the maximum nodes degree, and the tree-width of the graph, respectively, (iii) for the case that the graph is a tree: a PTAS approximation scheme, that given an approximation parameter epsilon, produces a tour that is within a epsilon times error(||F||, d) of the optimal one, and the computation runs in time poly(n) times h(1/epsilon,||F||). (iv) for the case that the graph is a tree, with $k=3$ robots, and the constraint is that all agents are connected: a PTAS scheme with multiplicative approximation error of 1+O(epsilon), independent of the maximal degree d.</description>

      <title>Cultural Evolution of Cooperation among LLM Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) provide a compelling foundation for building generally-capable AI agents. These agents may soon be deployed at scale in the real world, representing the interests of individual humans (e.g., AI assistants) or groups of humans (e.g., AI-accelerated corporations). At present, relatively little is known about the dynamics of multiple LLM agents interacting over many generations of iterative deployment. In this paper, we examine whether a "society" of LLM agents can learn mutually beneficial social norms in the face of incentives to defect, a distinctive feature of human sociality that is arguably crucial to the success of civilization. In particular, we study the evolution of indirect reciprocity across generations of LLM agents playing a classic iterated Donor Game in which agents can observe the recent behavior of their peers. We find that the evolution of cooperation differs markedly across base models, with societies of Claude 3.5 Sonnet agents achieving significantly higher average scores than Gemini 1.5 Flash, which, in turn, outperforms GPT-4o. Further, Claude 3.5 Sonnet can make use of an additional mechanism for costly punishment to achieve yet higher scores, while Gemini 1.5 Flash and GPT-4o fail to do so. For each model class, we also observe variation in emergent behavior across random seeds, suggesting an understudied sensitive dependence on initial conditions. We suggest that our evaluation regime could inspire an inexpensive and informative new class of LLM benchmarks, focussed on the implications of LLM agent deployment for the cooperative infrastructure of society.</description>

      <title>EI-Drive: A Platform for Cooperative Perception with Realistic Communication Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09782v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The growing interest in autonomous driving calls for realistic simulation platforms capable of accurately simulating cooperative perception process in realistic traffic scenarios. Existing studies for cooperative perception often have not accounted for transmission latency and errors in real-world environments. To address this gap, we introduce EI-Drive, an edge-AI based autonomous driving simulation platform that integrates advanced cooperative perception with more realistic communication models. Built on the CARLA framework, EI-Drive features new modules for cooperative perception while taking into account transmission latency and errors, providing a more realistic platform for evaluating cooperative perception algorithms. In particular, the platform enables vehicles to fuse data from multiple sources, improving situational awareness and safety in complex environments. With its modular design, EI-Drive allows for detailed exploration of sensing, perception, planning, and control in various cooperative driving scenarios. Experiments using EI-Drive demonstrate significant improvements in vehicle safety and performance, particularly in scenarios with complex traffic flow and network conditions.

      <title>AgentMixer: Multi-Agent Correlated Policy Factorization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.08728v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In multi-agent reinforcement learning, centralized training with decentralized execution (CTDE) methods typically assume that agents make decisions based on their local observations independently, which may not lead to a correlated joint policy with coordination. Coordination can be explicitly encouraged during training and individual policies can be trained to imitate the correlated joint policy. However, this may lead to an \textit{asymmetric learning failure} due to the observation mismatch between the joint and individual policies. Inspired by the concept of correlated equilibrium, we introduce a \textit{strategy modification} called AgentMixer that allows agents to correlate their policies. AgentMixer combines individual partially observable policies into a joint fully observable policy non-linearly. To enable decentralized execution, we introduce \textit{Individual-Global-Consistency} to guarantee mode consistency during joint training of the centralized and decentralized policies and prove that AgentMixer converges to an $\epsilon$-approximate Correlated Equilibrium. In the Multi-Agent MuJoCo, SMAC-v2, Matrix Game, and Predator-Prey benchmarks, AgentMixer outperforms or matches state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>See Behind Walls in Real-time Using Aerial Drones and Augmented Reality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13139v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work presents ARD2, a framework that enables real-time through-wall surveillance using two aerial drones and an augmented reality (AR) device. ARD2 consists of two main steps: target direction estimation and contour reconstruction. In the first stage, ARD2 leverages geometric relationships between the drones, the user, and the target to project the target's direction onto the user's AR display. In the second stage, images from the drones are synthesized to reconstruct the target's contour, allowing the user to visualize the target behind walls. Experimental results demonstrate the system's accuracy in both direction estimation and contour reconstruction.</description>

      <title>DroidSpeak: KV Cache Sharing for Efficient Multi-LLM Serving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02820v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly employed in complex workflows, where different LLMs and fine-tuned variants collaboratively address complex tasks. However, these systems face significant inefficiencies due to redundant context processing of the shared context. We propose DroidSpeak, a framework that optimizes context sharing between fine-tuned LLMs derived from the same foundational model. DroidSpeak identifies critical layers in the KV cache and selectively recomputes them, enabling effective reuse of intermediate data while maintaining high accuracy.
  Our approach balances computational efficiency and task fidelity, significantly reducing inference latency and throughput bottlenecks. Experiments on diverse datasets and model pairs demonstrate that DroidSpeak achieves up to 3x higher throughputs and 2.6x faster prefill times with negligible accuracy loss compared to full recomputation.</description>

      <title>Opinion Dynamic Under Malicious Agent Influence in Multi-Agent Systems: From the Perspective of Opinion Evolution Cost</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01524v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In human social systems, debates are often seen as a means to resolve differences of opinion. However, in reality, debates frequently incur significant communication costs, especially when dealing with stubborn opponents. Inspired by this phenomenon, this paper examines the impact of malicious agents on the evolution of normal agents' opinions from the perspective of opinion evolution cost, and proposes corresponding solutions for the scenario in which malicious agents hold different opinions in multi-agent systems(MASs). First, this paper analyzes the negative impact of malicious agents on the opinion evolution process, reveals the additional evolution cost it brings, and provides a theoretical basis for the subsequent solutions. Secondly, based on the characteristics of opinion evolution, the malicious agent isolation algorithm based on opinion evolution direction vector is proposed, which does not strongly restrict the proportion of malicious agents. Additionally, an evolution rate adjustment mechanism is introduced, allowing the system to flexibly regulate the evolution process in complex situations, effectively achieving the trade-off between opinion evolution rate and cost. Extensive numerical simulations demonstrate that the algorithm can effectively eliminate the negative influence of malicious agents and achieve a balance between opinion evolution costs and convergence speed.</description>
