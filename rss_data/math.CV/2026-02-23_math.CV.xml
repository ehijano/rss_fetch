      <title>A Sharp Lower Bound for the Spectrum of the Hodge Laplacian on K\"ahler Hyperbolic Manifolds and its Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18353v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish a sharp lower bound for the spectrum of the Hodge Laplacian on K\"ahler hyperbolic manifolds. This bound is expressed explicitly in terms of the supremum norm of the 1-form associated with the K\"ahler hyperbolic structure. As an application, we obtain explicit spectral lower bounds for bounded symmetric domains.</description>

      <title>An algebraic theory of Lojasiewicz exponents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18410v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a unified algebraic and valuative theory of Lojasiewicz exponents for pairs of graded families and filtrations of ideals. Within this framework, local Lojasiewicz exponents, gradient exponents, and exponents at infinity are all realized as asymptotic containment thresholds between filtrations, governed by integral closure. This reformulation shows that Lojasiewicz exponents are fundamentally valuative optimization problems.
  The central structural contribution of the paper is a finite-max principle. Under verifiable algebraic hypotheses, the a priori infinite valuative supremum bounding the Lojasiewicz exponent reduces to a finite maximum, and computes the Lojasiewicz exponent precisely. We identify two complementary mechanisms leading to this phenomenon: finite testing arising from normalized blowups and Noetherian Rees algebras, and attainment via compactness of normalized valuation spaces under linear boundedness assumptions.
  This finite-max framework yields strong structural consequences. We prove rigidity results showing that common extremal valuations force equality of Lojasiewicz ratios, and we establish stratification and stability phenomena for Lojasiewicz exponents in families, including fractional linearity and wall-chamber behavior along natural one-parameter deformations.
  The theory recovers and explains classical results in toric and Newton-polyhedral settings, particularly, for Newton nondegenete case, where the Lojasiewicz exponent is computed by finitely many toric divisorial valuations corresponding to facet data.
  Finally, we illustrate why the hypotheses underlying the finite-max principle are essential, delineating the precise scope of the theory.</description>

      <title>On the Bergman metric of symmetric spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15020v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study bounded domains $\Omega\subset\mathbb{C}^n$ whose Bergman metric is locally symmetric, i.e. its Riemannian curvature tensor is parallel with respect to the Levi-Civita connection. Following the strategy developed in \cite{UnifThm2}, we obtain two rigidity results. If the Bergman metric of $\Omega$ is complete, then $\Omega$ is (globally) symmetric. If instead $\Omega$ is pseudoconvex, then $\Omega$ is biholomorphic to $\widetilde\Omega\setminus E$, where $\widetilde\Omega\subset\mathbb{C}^n$ is a bounded symmetric domain and $E\subset\widetilde\Omega$ is relatively closed and pluripolar. The proofs combine the structure theory of Hermitian symmetric spaces with Calabi's theory of K\"ahler immersions into the infinite dimensional complex projective space (in particular, rigidity and the hereditary property of the diastasis), together with analytic and pluripotential tools based on extension properties of square-integrable holomorphic functions and the Bergman kernel.</description>

      <title>Pluricanonical Geometry of Varieties Isogenous to a Product and Pluricanonical Decompositions of Abelian Covers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21294v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study canonical and pluricanonical maps of varieties isogenous to a product of curves, i.e., quotients of the form $X = (C_1 \times \dots \times C_n)/G$ with $g(C_i)\ge 2$ and $G$ acting freely. For this purpose, we provide a technical result which is of general interest: a decomposition theorem for pluricanonical systems of abelian covers. This theorem provides an effective tool for the explicit study of geometric properties, such as base loci and the birationality of pluricanonical maps. For threefolds isogenous to a product, we prove that the 4-canonical map is birational for $p_g \ge 5$ and construct an example attaining the maximal canonical degree for this class of threefolds. In this example, the canonical map is the normalization of its image, which admits isolated non-normal singularities. Computational classifications also reveal threefolds where the bicanonical map fails to be birational, even in the absence of genus-2 fibrations. This illustrates an interesting phenomenon similar to the non-standard case for surfaces.</description>
