      <title>Interplay between Foraging Choices and Population Growth Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02552v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we couple a population dynamics model with a model for optimal foraging to study the interdependence between individual-level cost-benefits and population-scale dynamics. Specifically, we study the logistic growth model, which provides insights into population dynamics under resource limitations. Unlike exponential growth, the logistic model incorporates the concept of carrying capacity, thus offering a more realistic depiction of biological populations as they near environmental limits. We aim to study the impact of individual-level incentives driving behavioral responses in a dynamic environment. Specifically, explore the coupled dynamics between population density and individuals' foraging times. Our results yield insights into the effects of population size on individuals' optimal foraging efforts, which impacts the population's size.</description>

      <title>Population genetics: an introduction for physicists</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02650v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Population genetics lies at the heart of evolutionary theory. This topic forms part of many biological science curricula but is rarely taught to physics students. Since physicists are becoming increasingly interested in biological evolution, we aim to provide a brief introduction to population genetics, written for physicists. We start with two background chapters: chapter 1 provides a brief historical introduction to the topic, while chapter 2 provides some essential biological background. We begin our main content with chapter 3 which discusses the key concepts behind Darwinian natural selection and Mendelian inheritance. Chapter 4 covers the basics of how variation is maintained in populations, while chapter 5 discusses mutation and selection. In chapter 6 we discuss stochastic effects in population genetics using the Wright-Fisher model as our example, and finally we offer concluding thoughts and references to excellent textbooks in chapter 7.</description>

      <title>Selective pruning and neuronal death generate heavy-tail network connectivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02625v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: From the proliferative mechanisms generating neurons from progenitor cells to neuron migration and synaptic connection formation, several vicissitudes culminate in the mature brain. Both component loss and gain remain ubiquitous during brain development. For example, rodent brains lose over half of their initial neurons and synapses during healthy development. The role of deleterious steps in network ontogeny remains unclear, yet it is unlikely these costly processes are random. Like neurogenesis and synaptogenesis, synaptic pruning and neuron death likely evolved to support complex, efficient computations. In order to incorporate both component loss and gain in describing neuronal networks, we propose an algorithm where a directed network evolves through the selective deletion of less-connected nodes (neurons) and edges (synapses). Resulting in networks that display scale-invariant degree distributions, provided the network is predominantly feed-forward. Scale-invariance offers several advantages in biological networks: scalability, resistance to random deletions, and strong connectivity with parsimonious wiring. Whilst our algorithm is not intended to be a realistic model of neuronal network formation, our results suggest selective deletion is an adaptive mechanism contributing to more stable and efficient networks. This process aligns with observed decreasing pruning rates in animal studies, resulting in higher synapse preservation. Our overall findings have broader implications for network science. Scale-invariance in degree distributions was demonstrated in growing preferential attachment networks and observed empirically. Our preferential detachment algorithm offers an alternative mechanism for generating such networks, suggesting that both mechanisms may be part of a broader class of algorithms resulting in scale-free networks.</description>

      <title>Upper Bounds on Overshoot in SIR Models with Nonlinear Incidence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.01653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.01653v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We expand the calculation of the upper bound on epidemic overshoot in SIR models to account for nonlinear incidence. We lay out the general procedure and restrictions to perform the calculation analytically for nonlinear functions in the number of susceptibles. We demonstrate the procedure by working through several examples and also numerically study what happens to the upper bound on overshoot when nonlinear incidence manifests in the form of epidemic dynamics over a contact network. We find that both steeper incidence terms and larger contact heterogeneity can increase the range of communicable diseases at which the overshoot remains a relatively large public health hazard.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Theory for Adaptive Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.01403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.01403v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The study of adaptive dynamics, involving many degrees of freedom on two separated timescales, one for fast changes of state variables and another for the slow adaptation of parameters controlling the former's dynamics is crucial for understanding feedback mechanisms underlying evolution and learning. We present a path-integral approach \`a la Martin-Siggia-Rose-De Dominicis-Janssen (MSRDJ) to analyse nonequilibrium phase transitions in such dynamical systems. As an illustration, we apply our framework to the adaptation of gene-regulatory networks under a dynamic genotype-phenotype map: phenotypic variations are shaped by the fast stochastic gene-expression dynamics and are coupled to the slowly evolving distribution of genotypes, each encoded by a network structure. We establish that under this map, genotypes corresponding to reciprocal networks of coherent feedback loops are selected within an intermediate range of environmental noise, leading to phenotypic robustness.</description>

      <title>A consistent least-squares criterion for calibrating edge lengths in phylogenetic networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19343v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In phylogenetic networks, it is desirable to estimate edge lengths in substitutions per site or calendar time. Yet, there is a lack of scalable methods that provide such estimates. Here we consider the problem of obtaining edge length estimates from genetic distances, in the presence of rate variation across genes and lineages, when the network topology is known. We propose a novel criterion based on least-squares that is both consistent and computationally tractable. The crux of our approach is to decompose the genetic distances into two parts, one of which is invariant across displayed trees of the network. The scaled genetic distances are then fitted to the invariant part, while the average scaled genetic distances are fitted to the non-invariant part. We show that this criterion is consistent provided that there exists a tree path between some pair of tips in the network, and that edge lengths in the network are identifiable from average distances. We also provide a constrained variant of this criterion assuming a molecular clock, which can be used to obtain relative edge lengths in calendar time.</description>

      <title>Within-vector viral dynamics challenges how to model the extrinsic incubation period for major arboviruses: dengue, Zika, and chikungunya</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00409v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Arboviruses represent a significant threat to human, animal, and plant health worldwide. To elucidate transmission, anticipate their spread and efficiently control them, mechanistic modelling has proven its usefulness. However, most models rely on assumptions about how the extrinsic incubation period (EIP) is represented: the intra-vector viral dynamics (IVD), occurring during the EIP, is approximated by a single state. After an average duration, all exposed vectors become infectious. Behind this are hidden two strong hypotheses: (i) EIP is exponentially distributed in the vector population; (ii) viruses successfully cross the infection, dissemination, and transmission barriers in all exposed vectors. To assess these hypotheses, we developed a stochastic compartmental model which represents successive IVD stages, associated to the crossing or not of these three barriers. We calibrated the model using an ABC-SMC (Approximate Bayesian Computation - Sequential Monte Carlo) method with model selection. We systematically searched for literature data on experimental infections of Aedes mosquitoes infected by either dengue, chikungunya, or Zika viruses. We demonstrated the discrepancy between the exponential hypothesis and observed EIP distributions for dengue and Zika viruses and identified more relevant EIP distributions . We also quantified the fraction of infected mosquitoes eventually becoming infectious, highlighting that often only a small fraction crosses the three barriers. This work provides a generic modelling framework applicable to other arboviruses for which similar data are available. Our model can also be coupled to population-scale models to aid future arbovirus control.</description>

      <title>Rate of epidemic spreading on complex networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15449v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The initial phase of an epidemic is often characterized by an exponential increase in the number of infected individuals. In this Letter, we predict the exponential spreading rate of an epidemic on a complex network. We first find an expression of the reproduction number for a network, based on the degree distribution, the network assortativity, and the level of clustering. We then connect this reproduction number and the disease infectiousness to the spreading rate. Our result holds for a broad range of networks, apart from networks with very broad degree distribution, where no clear exponential regime is present. Our theory bridges the gap between classic epidemiology and the theory of complex network, with broad implications for model inference and policy making.</description>
