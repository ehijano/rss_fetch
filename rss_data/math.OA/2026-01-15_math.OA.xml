      <title>Twisted representations of product systems of $C^*$-correspondences: Wold decomposition and unitary extensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09391v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate Wold-type decompositions and unitary extension problems for multivariable isometric covariant representations associated with product systems of $C^*$-correspondences. First, we establish an operator-theoretic characterization for the existence of a Wold decomposition for the tuple $(\sigma, T_1, T_2, \ldots, T_n)$, where each $(\sigma,T_i)$ is an isometric covariant representation of a $C^*$\nobreakdash-correspondence. We then introduce twisted and doubly twisted covariant representations of product systems. For doubly twisted isometric representations, we prove the existence of a Wold decomposition, recovering earlier results for doubly commuting representations as special cases. We further obtain explicit descriptions of the resulting Wold summands and develop concrete Fock-type models realizing each component. We present non-trivial examples of these families. Finally, we construct unitary extensions via a direct-limit procedure. As applications, we obtain unitary extensions for several previously studied classes of operator tuples, including doubly twisted, doubly non-commuting, and doubly commuting isometries, and for a special class of doubly twisted representations of product system.</description>

      <title>The Baum-Connes and the Mishchenko-Kasparov assembly maps for group extensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09615v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Baum-Connes assembly map with coefficients $e_{\ast}$ and the Mishchenko-Kasparov assembly map with coefficients $\mu_{\ast}$ are two homomorphisms from the equivariant $K$-homology of classifying spaces of groups to the $K$-theory of reduced crossed products. In this paper, we investigate these two assembly maps for group extensions $1\rightarrow N \rightarrow \Gamma \xrightarrow{q} \Gamma/ N \rightarrow 1$. Firstly, under the assumption that $e_{\ast}$ is isomorphic for $q^{-1}(F)$ for any finite subgroup $F$ of $\Gamma/N$, we prove that $e_{\ast}$ is injective, surjective and isomorphic for $\Gamma$ if they are also true for $\Gamma/N$, respectively. Secondly, under the assumption that $e_{\ast}$ is rationally isomorphic for $N$, we verify that $\mu_{\ast}$ is rationally injective for $\Gamma$ if it is also rationally injective for $\Gamma/N$. Finally, when $\Gamma$ is an isometric semi-direct product $N\rtimes G$, we confirm that $e_{\ast}$ is injective, surjective and isomorphic for $\Gamma$ if they also hold for $G$ and $\Gamma$ satisfies three partial conjectures along $N$, respectively. As applications, we show that the strong Novikov conjecture, the surjective assembly conjecture and the Baum-Connes conjecture with coefficients are closed under direct products, central extensions of groups and extensions by finite groups. Meanwhile, we also show that the rational analytic Novikov conjecture with coefficients is preserved under extensions of finite groups. Besides, we employ these results to obtain some new examples for the rational analytic and the strong Novikov conjecture beyond the class of coarsely embeddable groups.</description>

      <title>A metric characterization of projections among positive norm-One elements in unital C$^*$-algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09669v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We characterize projections among positive norm-one elements in unital C$^*$-algebras in pure geometric terms determined by the norm of the underlying Banach space. Concretely, let $A$ be a C$^*$-algebra (or a JB$^*$-algebra) whose positive cone and unit sphere are denoted by ${A}^+$ and $\mathrm{S}_{A}$, respectively. The positive portion of the unit sphere in $A$, denoted by $\mathrm{S}_{{A}^+}$, is the set ${A}^+ \cap \mathrm{S}_{A}$, while the unit sphere of positive norm-one elements around a subset $\mathscr{S}$ in $\mathrm{S}_{A^+}$ is the set $$\hbox{Sph}_{_{\mathrm{S}_{{A}^+}}} (\mathscr{S}) :=\Big\{ x\in \mathrm{S}_{{A}^+} : \|x-s\|=1 \hbox{ for all } s\in \mathscr{S} \Big\}.$$ Assuming that $A$ is unital, we establish that an element $a\in \mathrm{S}_{{A}^+}$ is a projection if, and only if, it satisfies the double sphere property, that is, $ \hbox{Sph}_{_{\mathrm{S}_{{A}^+}}} \left(\hbox{Sph}_{_{\mathrm{S}_{{A}^+}}} \left(\{a\}\right) \right) = \{a\}.$</description>

      <title>A Well-Defined Jellyfish Algorithm for the Affine $E_7$ Subfactor Planar Algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09003v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we contribute to the Kuperberg program by giving a diagrammatic presentation of generators and relations for the affine $E_7$ unshaded subfactor planar algebra. Using this presentation, we prove that its jellyfish algorithm is a well-defined surjection onto $\mathbb{C}$. In particular, this shows that the jellyfish algorithm is an invariant on closed diagrams for this planar algebra.</description>

      <title>Quantum graphs of homomorphisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09685v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a category $\mathsf{qGph}$ of quantum graphs, whose definition is motivated entirely from noncommutative geometry. For all quantum graphs $G$ and $H$ in $\mathsf{qGph}$, we then construct a quantum graph $[G,H]$ of homomorphisms from $G$ to $H$, making $\mathsf{qGph}$ a closed symmetric monoidal category. We prove that for all finite graphs $G$ and $H$, the quantum graph $[G,H]$ is nonempty iff the $(G,H)$-homomorphism game has a winning quantum strategy, directly generalizing the classical case.
  The finite quantum graphs in $\mathsf{qGph}$ are tracial, real, and self-adjoint, and the morphisms between them are CP morphisms that are adjoint to a unital $*$-homomorphism. We show that Weaver's two notions of a CP morphism coincide in this context. We also show that every finite reflexive quantum graph is the confusability quantum graph of a quantum channel, answering a question of Daws.</description>

      <title>Nuclear dimension and virtually polycyclic groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07223v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the nuclear dimension of a (twisted) group C*-algebra of a virtually polycyclic group is finite. This prompts us to make a conjecture relating finite nuclear dimension of group C*-algebras and finite Hirsch length, which we then verify for a class of elementary amenable groups beyond the virtually polycyclic case. In particular, we give the first examples of finitely generated, non-residually finite groups with finite nuclear dimension. A parallel conjecture on finite decomposition rank is also formulated and an analogous result is obtained. Our method relies heavily on recent work of Hirshberg and the second named author on actions of virtually nilpotent groups on $C_0(X)$-algebras.</description>

      <title>Sherman-Takeda type theorems for locally C*-algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00717v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we will first establish some density results for a locally $C^*$-algebra $\mathcal A$ and then identify a property, called Kaplansky density property (KDP). We then give a induced faithful continuous $*$-representation $\varphi$ of $\mathcal A^{**}$ (equipped with unique Arens product) on the space $B_{loc}(\mathcal H)$ such that $\varphi(\mathcal A^{**})\subset \overline{\pi(\mathcal A)}^{WOT}$, where $\pi:\mathcal A\to B_{loc}(\mathcal H)$ is the associated universal $*$-representation and $\mathcal H$ is the associated locally Hilbert space. Finally we show that for a Fr\'echet locally $C^*$-algebra $\mathcal A$ possessing KDP, the second strong dual is algebraically and topologically $*$-isomorphic to $ \overline{\pi(\mathcal A)}^{WOT}$, which is a direct analogue of the classical Sherman-Takeda theorem for $C^*$-algebras. We shall also observe the joint continuity of some associated bilinear maps in the running.</description>

      <title>A reconstruction theorem for Connes-Landi deformations of commutative spectral triples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1408.4429</link>
      <description>arXiv:1408.4429v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We formulate and prove an extension of Connes's reconstruction theorem for commutative spectral triples to so-called Connes-Landi or isospectral deformations of commutative spectral triples along the action of a compact Abelian Lie group $G$, also known as toric noncommutative manifolds. In particular, we propose an abstract definition for such spectral triples, where noncommutativity is entirely governed by a deformation parameter sitting in the second group cohomology of the Pontrjagin dual of $G$, and then show that such spectral triples are well-behaved under further Connes-Landi deformation, thereby allowing for both quantisation from and dequantisation to $G$-equivariant abstract commutative spectral triples. We then use a refinement of the Connes-Dubois-Violette splitting homomorphism to conclude that suitable Connes-Landi deformations of commutative spectral triples by a rational deformation parameter are almost-commutative in the general, topologically non-trivial sense.</description>
