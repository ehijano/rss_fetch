      <title>A PINNs approach for the computation of eigenvalues in elliptic problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a method for computing eigenvalues of elliptic problems using Deep Learning techniques. A key feature of our approach is that it is independent of the space dimension and can compute arbitrary eigenvalues without requiring the prior computation of lower ones. Moreover, the method can be easily adapted to handle nonlinear eigenvalue problems.</description>

      <title>Parallel multilevel methods for solving the Darcy--Forchheimer model based on a nearly semicoercive formulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03192v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-velocity fluid flow through porous media is modeled by prescribing a nonlinear relationship between the flow rate and the pressure gradient, called Darcy--Forchheimer equation. This paper is concerned with the analysis of parallel multilevel methods for solving the Darcy--Forchheimer model. We begin by reformulating the Darcy--Forchheimer model as a nearly semicoercive convex optimization problem via the augmented Lagrangian method. Building on this formulation, we develop a parallel multilevel method within the framework of subspace correction for nearly semicoercive convex problems. The proposed method exhibits robustness with respect to both the nearly semicoercive nature of the problem and the size of the discretized system. To further enhance convergence, we incorporate a backtracking line search scheme. Numerical results validate the theoretical findings and demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Weak Form Scientific Machine Learning: Test Function Construction for System Identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03206v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Weak form Scientific Machine Learning (WSciML) is a recently developed framework for data-driven modeling and scientific discovery. It leverages the weak form of equation error residuals to provide enhanced noise robustness in system identification via convolving model equations with test functions, reformulating the problem to avoid direct differentiation of data. The performance, however, relies on wisely choosing a set of compactly supported test functions.
  In this work, we mathematically motivate a novel data-driven method for constructing Single-scale-Local reference functions for creating the set of test functions. Our approach numerically approximates the integration error introduced by the quadrature and identifies the support size for which the error is minimal, without requiring access to the model parameter values. Through numerical experiments across various models, noise levels, and temporal resolutions, we demonstrate that the selected supports consistently align with regions of minimal parameter estimation error. We also compare the proposed method against the strategy for constructing Multi-scale-Global (and orthogonal) test functions introduced in our prior work, demonstrating the improved computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>An ensemble Kalman approach to randomized maximum likelihood estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03207v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work proposes ensemble Kalman randomized maximum likelihood estimation, a new derivative-free method for performing randomized maximum likelihood estimation, which is a method that can be used to generate approximate samples from posterior distributions in Bayesian inverse problems. The new method has connections to ensemble Kalman inversion and works by evolving an ensemble so that each ensemble member solves an instance of a randomly perturbed optimization problem. Linear analysis demonstrates that ensemble members converge exponentially fast to randomized maximum likelihood estimators and, furthermore, that the new method produces samples from the Bayesian posterior when applied to a suitably regularized optimization problem. The method requires that the forward operator, relating the unknown parameter to the data, be evaluated once per iteration per ensemble member, which can be prohibitively expensive when the forward model requires the evolution of a high-dimensional dynamical system. We propose a strategy for making the proposed method tractable in this setting based on a balanced truncation model reduction method tailored to the Bayesian smoothing problem. Theoretical results show near-optimality of this model reduction approach via convergence to an optimal approximation of the posterior covariance as a low-rank update to the prior covariance. Numerical experiments verify theoretical results and illustrate computational acceleration through model reduction.</description>

      <title>Structured Backward Errors of Sparse Generalized Saddle Point Problems with Hermitian Block Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03335v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we derive the structured backward error (BE) for a class of generalized saddle point problems (GSPP) by preserving the sparsity pattern and Hermitian structures of the block matrices. Additionally, we construct the optimal backward perturbation matrices for which the structured BE is achieved. Our analysis also examines the structured BE in cases where the sparsity pattern is not maintained. Through numerical experiments, we demonstrate the reliability of the derived structured BEs and the corresponding optimal backward perturbations. Additionally, the derived structured BEs are used to assess the strong backward stability of numerical methods for solving the GSPP.</description>

      <title>On the non-convexity issue in the radial Calder\'on problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A classical approach to the Calder\'on problem is to estimate the unknown conductivity by solving a nonlinear least-squares problem. It is generally believed that it leads to a nonconvex optimization problem which is riddled with bad local minimums. This has motivated the development of reconstruction methods based on convex optimization, one recent contribution being the nonlinear convex semidefinite programming approach of Harrach (2023). In this work, we investigate the computational viability of this convex approach in a simple setting where the conductivities are piecewise constant and radial. We implement this convex reconstruction method and compare it extensively to the least squares approach. Our experiments suggest that this convex programming approach only allows to accurately estimate the unknown for problems with a very small size. Moreover, surprisingly, it is consistently outperformed by Newton-type least squares solvers, which are also faster and require less measurements. We revisit the issue of nonconvexity in this piecewise constant radial setting and prove that, contrary to previous claims, there are no local minimums in the case of two scalar unknowns with no measurement noise. We also provide a partial proof of this result in the general setting which holds under a numerically verifiable assumption.</description>

      <title>Generalized UGK scheme in the diffusive</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03385v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The unified gas kinetic scheme (UGKS) was initially designed to address multiscale challenges in rarefied gas dynamics and then extended to radiative transfert theory, as described by BGK like relaxation models. In this work, we extend its application to linear kinetic models with non isotropic scattering collision operators, as well as Fokker-Planck models . These problems typically exhibit a fully diffusive nature in the optically thick limit (corresponding to a small Knudsen number). It still leads to an asymptotic preserving (AP) property not only in this diffusive regime but also in the free transport limit. A series of numerical experiments confirm the effectiveness of the approach.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.03492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study an elliptic interface problem with discontinuous diffusion coefficients on unfitted meshes using the CutFEM method. Our main contribution is the reconstruction of conservative fluxes from the CutFEM solution and their use in a posteriori error estimation. We introduce a hybrid mixed formulation with locally computable Lagrange multipliers and reconstruct the flux in the immersed Raviart-Thomas space. Based on this, we propose a new a posteriori error estimator that includes both volume and interface terms. We state its robust reliability and local efficiency, and validate the approach through numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>PINN-DG: Residual neural network methods trained with Finite Elements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the past few years, neural network methods have evolved in various directions for approximating partial differential equations (PDEs). A promising new development is the integration of neural networks with classical numerical techniques such as finite elements and finite differences. In this paper, we introduce a new class of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) trained using discontinuous Galerkin finite element methods. Unlike standard collocation-based PINNs that rely on pointwise gradient evaluations and Monte Carlo quadrature, our approach computes the loss functional using finite element interpolation and integration. This avoids costly pointwise derivative computations, particularly advantageous for elliptic PDEs requiring second-order derivatives, and inherits key stability and accuracy benefits from the finite element framework. We present a convergence analysis based on variational arguments and support our theoretical findings with numerical experiments that demonstrate improved efficiency and robustness.</description>

      <title>Bilinear Quadratic Output Systems and Balanced Truncation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamical systems with quadratic outputs have recently attracted significant attention. In this paper, we consider bilinear dynamical systems, a special class of weakly nonlinear systems, with a quadratic output. We develop various primal-dual formulations for these systems and define the corresponding system Gramians. Conditions for the existence and uniqueness of these Gramians are established, and the generalized Lyapunov equations they satisfy are derived. Using these Gramians and their truncated versions, which are computationally more efficient, we construct a balanced truncation framework for bilinear systems with quadratic outputs. The proposed approach is demonstrated through two numerical examples.</description>

      <title>Noise-robust multi-fidelity surrogate modelling for parametric partial differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address the challenge of constructing noise-robust surrogate models for quantities of interest (QoIs) arising from parametric partial differential equations (PDEs), using multi-fidelity collocation techniques; specifically, the Multi-Index Stochastic Collocation (MISC). In practical scenarios, the PDE evaluations used to build a response surface are often corrupted by numerical noise, especially for the low-fidelity models. This noise, which may originate from loose solver tolerances, coarse discretisations, or transient effects, can lead to overfitting in MISC, degrading surrogate quality through nonphysical oscillations and loss of convergence, thereby limiting its utility in downstream tasks like uncertainty quantification, optimisation, and control. To correct this behaviour, we propose an improved version of MISC that can automatically detect the presence of solver noise during the surrogate model construction and then ignore the exhausted fidelities. Our approach monitors the spectral decay of the surrogate at each iteration, identifying stagnation in the coefficient spectrum that signals the onset of noise. Once detected, the algorithm selectively halts the use of noisy fidelities, focusing computational resources on those fidelities that still provide meaningful information. The effectiveness of this approach is numerically validated on two challenging test cases: a parabolic advection--diffusion PDE with uncertain coefficients, and a parametric turbulent incompressible Navier--Stokes problem. The results showcase the accuracy and robustness of the resulting multi-fidelity surrogate and its capability to extract relevant information, even from under-resolved meshes not suitable for reliable single-fidelity computations.</description>

      <title>Adjoint-based A Posteriori Error Analysis for Semi-explicit Index-1 and Hessenberg Index-2 Differential-Algebraic Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03712v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we develop and analyze adjoint-based analyses for \textit{a posteriori} error estimation for the temporal discretization of differential-algebraic equations (DAEs) of special type: semi-explicit index-1 and Hessenberg index-2. Our technique quantifies the error in a Quantity of Interest (QoI), which is defined as a bounded linear functional of the solution of a DAE. We derive representations for errors various trypes of QoIs (depending on the entire time interval, final time, algebraic variables, differential variables etc.). We form two analyses: one that defines the adjoint to the DAE system, and one that first converts the DAE to an ODE system and then applies classical \textit{a posteriori} analysis techniques. A number of examples are presented, including nonlinear and non-autonomous DAEs, as well as discretized partial differential-algebraic equations (PDAEs). Numerical results indicate a high degree of accuracy in the error estimation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.03909v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop and analyze a discontinuous Galerkin pressure correction scheme for the Oldroyd model of order one. The existence and uniqueness of the discrete solution as well as the consistency of the scheme are proved. The stability of the discrete velocity and pressure are established. We derive optimal $\textit{a priori}$ error bounds for the fully discrete velocity in the discontinuous discrete space. In addition, an improved error estimate for the velocity is derived in the $L^2$ norm which is optimal with respect to space and time. Furthermore, the error bound for the pressure is obtained via the estimates of discrete time derivative of the velocity. Finally, numerical experiments confirm the optimal convergence rates.</description>

      <title>On the discrete Poincar\'e inequality for B-schemes of 1D Fokker-Planck equations in full space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03941v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose two approaches to derive the discrete Poincar\'e inequality for the B-schemes, a family of finite volume discretization schemes, for the one-dimensional Fokker-Planck equation in full space. We study the properties of the spatially discretized Fokker-Planck equation in the viewpoint of a continuous-time Markov chain. The first approach is based on Gamma-calculus, through which we show that the Bakry-\'Emery criterion still holds in the discrete setting. The second approach employs the Lyapunov function method, allowing us to extend a local discrete Poincar\'e inequality to the full space. The assumptions required for both approaches are roughly comparable with some minor differences. These methods have the potential to be extended to higher dimensions. As a result, we obtain exponential convergence to equilibrium for the discrete schemes by applying the discrete Poincar\'e inequality.</description>

      <title>Mixed FEM for coupled unsteady fluid flow problems with $p$-type Brinkman-Forchheimer framework and its application for reverse-osmosis desalination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03974v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work analyzes a fully discrete mixed finite element method in a Banach space framework for solving nonstationary coupled fluid flow problems modeled by the Brinkman-Forchheimer equations, with applications to reverse osmosis. The model couples unsteady $p$-type convective Brinkman-Forchheimer and transport equations with nonlinear boundary conditions across a semi-permeable membrane. A mixed formulation is used for the fluid equation (pseudostress-velocity) and for the transport equation (concentration, its gradient, and a Lagrange multiplier from the membrane condition). The continuous problem is reformulated in Banach spaces as a fixed-point problem, enabling a well-posedness analysis via differential-algebraic system theory. Spatial discretization employs lowest-order Raviart-Thomas elements for fluxes and piecewise constants for primal variables, while linear elements are used for the Lagrange multiplier. A fully discrete Galerkin scheme with backward Euler time-stepping is proposed. Its well-posedness and stability are proven using a fixed-point argument, and optimal convergence rates are established. Numerical results confirm the theoretical error estimates and demonstrate the method's effectiveness.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.04024v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this survey, we provide an in-depth investigation of exponential Runge-Kutta methods for the numerical integration of initial-value problems. These methods offer a valuable synthesis between classical Runge-Kutta methods, introduced more than a century ago, and exponential integrators, which date back to the 1960s. This manuscript presents both a historical analysis of the development of these methods up to the present day and several examples aimed at making the topic accessible to a broad audience.</description>

      <title>Remarkable upper bounds for the interpolation error constants on the triangles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce remarkable upper bounds for the interpolation error constants on triangles, which are sharp and given by simple formulas. These constants are crucial in analyzing interpolation errors, particularly those associated with the Finite Element Method. In this study, we proved boundness via the numerical verification method and asymptotic analysis. This study is also essential in that it demonstrates a valuable application of the numerical verification method. The proof process of this study may be applied to the proof of various other norm inequalities.</description>

      <title>Physics-informed neural networks and neural operators for a study of EUV electromagnetic wave diffraction from a lithography mask</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) and neural operators (NOs) for solving the problem of diffraction of Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) electromagnetic waves from a mask are presented. A novel hybrid Waveguide Neural Operator (WGNO) is introduced, which is based on a waveguide method with its most computationally expensive part replaced by a neural network. Numerical experiments on realistic 2D and 3D masks show that the WGNO achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and inference time, providing a highly efficient solution for accelerating the design workflows of lithography masks.</description>

      <title>Generalized Rellich's lemmas, uniqueness theorem and inside-out duality for scattering poles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scattering poles correspond to non-trivial scattered fields in the absence of incident waves and play a crucial role in the study of wave phenomena. These poles are complex wavenumbers with negative imaginary parts. In this paper, we prove two generalized Rellich's lemmas for scattered fields associated with complex wavenumbers. These lemmas are then used to establish uniqueness results for inverse scattering problems. We further explore the inside-out duality, which characterizes scattering poles through the linear sampling method applied to interior scattering problems. Notably, we demonstrate that exterior Dirichlet/Neumann poles can be identified without prior knowledge of the actual sound-soft or sound-hard obstacles. Numerical examples are provided to validate the theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Multiquadratic Radial Basis Function-based Explicit Runge--Kutta Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04261v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Runge--Kutta (RK) methods are widely used techniques for solving a class of initial value problems. In this article, we introduce an adaptive multiquadratic (MQ) radial basis function (RBF)-based method to develop enhanced explicit RK methods. These methods achieve a higher order of convergence than the corresponding classical RK methods. To improve the local convergence of the numerical solution, we optimize the free parameters (shape functions) involved in the RBFs by forcing the local truncation errors to vanish. We also present a convergence and stability analysis of the proposed methods. To demonstrate the advantages of these methods in terms of accuracy and convergence, we consider several numerical examples and compare the performance of our methods with that of the classical RK methods. The Tables and Figures presented in this article clearly validate the superiority of the proposed methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.04297v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In randomized quasi-Monte Carlo methods for numerical integration, average estimators based on digital nets with fully nested and linear scrambling are known to exhibit the same variance. In this note, we show that this equivalence does not extend to the median estimators. Specifically, while the median estimator with linear scrambling can achieve faster convergence for smooth integrands, the median estimator with fully nested scrambling does not exhibit this advantage.</description>

      <title>Entropy stable high-order discontinuous Galerkin spectral-element methods on curvilinear, hybrid meshes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hyperbolic-parabolic partial differential equations are widely used for the modeling of complex, multiscale problems. High-order methods such as the discontinuous Galerkin (DG) scheme are attractive candidates for their numerical approximation. However, high-order methods are prone to instabilities in the presence of underresolved flow features. A popular counter measure to stabilize DG methods is the use of entropy-stable formulations based on summation-by-parts (SBP) operators. The present paper aims to construct a robust and efficient entropy-stable discontinuous Galerkin spectral element method (DGSEM) of arbitrary order on heterogeneous, curvilinear grids composed of triangular and quadrilateral elements or hexahedral, prismatic, tetrahedral and pyramid elements. To the author's knowledge, with the exception of hexahedral and quadrilateral elements, entropy-stable DGSE operators have been constructed exclusively for tetrahedral and triangular meshes. The extension of the DGSEM to more complex element shapes is achieved by means of a collapsed coordinate transformation. Legendre--Gauss quadrature nodes are employed as collocation points in conjunction with a generalized SBP operator and entropy-projected variables. The purely hyperbolic operator is extended to hyperbolic-parabolic problems by the use of a lifting procedure. To circumvent the penalizing time step restriction imposed by the collapsing, modal rather than nodal degrees of freedom are evolved in time, thereby relying on a memory-efficient weight-adjusted approximation to the inverse of the mass matrix. Essential properties of the proposed numerical scheme including free-stream preservation, polynomial and grid convergence as well as entropy conservation / stability are verified. Finally, with the flow around the common research model, the applicability of the presented method to real-world problems is demonstrated.</description>

      <title>Energy-conserving Kansa methods for Hamiltonian wave equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a fast, constrained meshfree solver designed specifically to inherit energy conservation (EC) in second-order time-dependent Hamiltonian wave equations. For discretization, we adopt the Kansa method, also known as the kernel-based collocation method, combined with time-stepping. This approach ensures that the critical structural feature of energy conservation is maintained over time by embedding a quadratic constraint into the definition of the numerical solution. To address the computational challenges posed by the nonlinearity in the Hamiltonian wave equations and the EC constraint, we propose a fast iterative solver based on the Newton method with successive linearization. This novel solver significantly accelerates the computation, making the method highly effective for practical applications. Numerical comparisons with the traditional secant methods highlight the competitive performance of our scheme. These results demonstrate that our method not only conserves the energy but also offers a promising new direction for solving Hamiltonian wave equations more efficiently. While we focus on the Kansa method and corresponding convergence theories in this study, the proposed solver is based solely on linear algebra techniques and has the potential to be applied to EC constrained optimization problems arising from other PDE discretization methods.</description>

      <title>When do World Models Successfully Learn Dynamical Systems?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04898v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we explore the use of compact latent representations with learned time dynamics ('World Models') to simulate physical systems. Drawing on concepts from control theory, we propose a theoretical framework that explains why projecting time slices into a low-dimensional space and then concatenating to form a history ('Tokenization') is so effective at learning physics datasets, and characterise when exactly the underlying dynamics admit a reconstruction mapping from the history of previous tokenized frames to the next. To validate these claims, we develop a sequence of models with increasing complexity, starting with least-squares regression and progressing through simple linear layers, shallow adversarial learners, and ultimately full-scale generative adversarial networks (GANs). We evaluate these models on a variety of datasets, including modified forms of the heat and wave equations, the chaotic regime 2D Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation, and a challenging computational fluid dynamics (CFD) dataset of a 2D K\'arm\'an vortex street around a fixed cylinder, where our model is successfully able to recreate the flow.</description>

      <title>Efficient implicit-explicit sparse stochastic method for high dimensional semi-linear nonlocal diffusion equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a sparse grid-based Monte Carlo method for solving high-dimensional semi-linear nonlocal diffusion equations with volume constraints. The nonlocal model is governed by a class of semi-linear partial integro-differential equations (PIDEs), in which the operator captures both local convection-diffusion and nonlocal diffusion effects, as revealed by its limiting behavior with respect to the interaction radius. To overcome the bottleneck of computational complexity caused by the curse of dimensionality and the dense linear systems arising from nonlocal operators, we propose a novel implicit-explicit scheme based on a direct approximation of the nonlinear Feynman-Kac representation. The incorporation of sparse grid interpolation significantly enhances the algorithm's scalability and enables its application to problems in high dimensions. To further address the challenges posed by hypersingular kernels, we design a sampling strategy tailored to their singular structure, which ensures accurate and stable treatment of the nonlocal operators within the probabilistic framework. Notably, the proposed method inherits unconditional stability from the underlying stochastic representation, without imposing constraints on the temporal and spatial discretization scales. A rigorous error analysis is provided to establish the convergence of the proposed scheme. Extensive numerical experiments, including some non-radial solutions in up to 100 dimensions, are presented to validate the robustness and accuracy of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Paired Explicit Relaxation Runge-Kutta Methods: Entropy-Conservative and Entropy-Stable High-Order Optimized Multirate Time Integration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04991v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present novel entropy-conservative and entropy-stable multirate Runge-Kutta methods based on Paired Explicit Runge-Kutta (P-ERK) schemes with relaxation for conservation laws and related systems of partial differential equations. Optimized schemes up to fourth-order of accuracy are derived and validated in terms of order of consistency, conservation of linear invariants, and entropy conservation/stability. We demonstrate the effectiveness of these P-ERRK methods when combined with a high-order, entropy-conservative/stable discontinuous Galerkin spectral element method on unstructured meshes. The Paired Explicit Relaxation Runge-Kutta methods(P-ERRK) are readily implemented for partitioned semidiscretizations arising from problems with equation-based scale separation such as non-uniform meshes. We highlight that the relaxation approach acts as a time-limiting technique which improves the nonlinear stability and thus robustness of the multirate schemes. The P-ERRK methods are applied to a range of problems, ranging from compressible Euler over compressible Navier-Stokes to the visco-resistive magnetohydrodynamics equations in two and three spatial dimensions. For each test case, we compare computational load and runtime to standalone relaxed Runge-Kutta methods which are outperformed by factors up to four. All results can be reproduced using a publicly available repository.</description>

      <title>Fourier Spectral Method for Nonlocal Equations on Bounded Domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work introduces efficient and accurate spectral solvers for nonlocal equations on bounded domains. These spectral solvers exploit the fact that integration in the nonlocal formulation transforms into multiplication in Fourier space and that nonlocality is decoupled from the grid size. As a result, the computational cost is reduced to $O(N\log N)$ for an $N$-point discretization grid. Our approach extends the spectral solvers developed by Alali and Albin (2020) for periodic domains by incorporating the two-dimensional Fourier continuation (2D-FC) algorithm introduced by Bruno and Paul (2022). We evaluate the performance of the proposed methods on two-dimensional nonlocal Poisson and nonlocal diffusion equations defined on bounded domains. While the regularity of solutions to these equations in bounded settings remains an open problem, we conduct numerical experiments to explore this issue, particularly focusing on studying discontinuities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.05083v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper a fourth order asymptotically optimal error bound for a new cubic interpolating spline function, denoted by Q-spline, is derived for the case that only function values at given points are used but not any derivative information. The bound seems to be stronger than earlier error bounds for cubic spline interpolation in such setting such as the not-a-knot spline. A brief analysis of the conditioning of the end conditions of cubic spline interpolation leads to a modification of the not-a-knot spline, and some numerical examples suggest that the interpolation error of this revised not-a-knot spline generally is comparable to the near optimal Q-spline and lower than for the not-a-knot spline when the mesh size is small.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.05091v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The stochastic finite volume method (SFV method) is a high-order accurate method for uncertainty quantification (UQ) in hyperbolic conservation laws. However, the computational cost of SFV method increases for high-dimensional stochastic parameter spaces due to the curse of dimensionality. To address this challenge, we incorporate interpolation-based reduced order modeling (ROM) techniques that reduce the cost of computing stochastic integrals in SFV method. Further efficiency gains are achieved through a Q-DEIM hyper-reduction method. Numerical experiments suggest that this approach can lower both computational cost and memory requirements for high-dimensional stochastic parameter spaces.</description>

      <title>A 3D Machine Learning based Volume Of Fluid scheme without explicit interface reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05218v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a machine-learning based Volume Of Fluid method to simulate multi-material flows on three-dimensional domains. One of the novelties of the method is that the flux fraction is computed by evaluating a previously trained neural network and without explicitly reconstructing any local interface approximating the exact one. The network is trained on a purely synthetic dataset generated by randomly sampling numerous local interfaces and which can be adapted to improve the scheme on less regular interfaces when needed. Several strategies to ensure the efficiency of the method and the satisfaction of physical constraints and properties are suggested and formalized. Numerical results on the advection equation are provided to show the performance of the method. We observe numerical convergence as the size of the mesh tends to zero $h=1/N_h\searrow 0$, with a better rate than two reference schemes.</description>

      <title>Closed-Form Robustness Bounds for Second-Order Pruning of Neural Controller Policies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02953v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep neural policies have unlocked agile flight for quadcopters, adaptive grasping for manipulators, and reliable navigation for ground robots, yet their millions of weights conflict with the tight memory and real-time constraints of embedded microcontrollers. Second-order pruning methods, such as Optimal Brain Damage (OBD) and its variants, including Optimal Brain Surgeon (OBS) and the recent SparseGPT, compress networks in a single pass by leveraging the local Hessian, achieving far higher sparsity than magnitude thresholding. Despite their success in vision and language, the consequences of such weight removal on closed-loop stability, tracking accuracy, and safety have remained unclear. We present the first mathematically rigorous robustness analysis of second-order pruning in nonlinear discrete-time control. The system evolves under a continuous transition map, while the controller is an $L$-layer multilayer perceptron with ReLU-type activations that are globally 1-Lipschitz. Pruning the weight matrix of layer $k$ replaces $W_k$ with $W_k+\delta W_k$, producing the perturbed parameter vector $\widehat{\Theta}=\Theta+\delta\Theta$ and the pruned policy $\pi(\cdot;\widehat{\Theta})$. For every input state $s\in X$ we derive the closed-form inequality $
\|\pi(s;\Theta)-\pi(s;\widehat{\Theta})\|_2 \le C_k(s)\,\|\delta W_k\|_2, $
where the constant $C_k(s)$ depends only on unpruned spectral norms and biases, and can be evaluated in closed form from a single forward pass. The derived bounds specify, prior to field deployment, the maximal admissible pruning magnitude compatible with a prescribed control-error threshold. By linking second-order network compression with closed-loop performance guarantees, our work narrows a crucial gap between modern deep-learning tooling and the robustness demands of safety-critical autonomous systems.</description>

      <title>Real-time prediction of plasma instabilities with sparse-grid-accelerated optimized dynamic mode decomposition</title>

Abstract: Parametric data-driven reduced-order models (ROMs) that embed dependencies in a large number of input parameters are crucial for enabling many-query tasks in large-scale problems. These tasks, including design optimization, control, and uncertainty quantification, are essential for developing digital twins in real-world applications. However, standard training data generation methods are computationally prohibitive due to the curse of dimensionality, as their cost scales exponentially with the number of inputs.This paper investigates efficient training of parametric data-driven ROMs using sparse grid interpolation with (L)-Leja points, specifically targeting scenarios with higher-dimensional input parameter spaces. (L)-Leja points are nested and exhibit slow growth, resulting in sparse grids with low cardinality in low-to-medium dimensional settings, making them ideal for large-scale, computationally expensive problems. Focusing on gyrokinetic simulations of plasma micro-instabilities in fusion experiments as a representative real-world application, we construct parametric ROMs for the full 5D gyrokinetic distribution function via optimized dynamic mode decomposition (optDMD) and sparse grids based on (L)-Leja points. We perform detailed experiments in two scenarios: First, the Cyclone Base Case benchmark assesses optDMD ROM prediction capabilities beyond training time horizons and across variations in the binormal wave number. Second, for a real-world electron temperature gradient driven micro-instability simulation featuring six input parameters, we demonstrate that an accurate parametric optDMD ROM can be constructed at a cost of only $28$ high-fidelity gyrokinetic simulations thanks to sparse grids. In the broader context of fusion research, these results demonstrate the potential of sparse grid-based parametric ROMs to enable otherwise intractable many-query tasks.</description>

      <title>Efficient Quantum Access Model for Sparse Structured Matrices using Linear Combination of Things</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03714v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a novel approach for Linear combination of unitaries (LCU) type decomposition for structured sparse matrices. Such matrices frequently arise during numerical solution of partial differential equations which are ubiquitous in science and engineering. LCU is a versatile quantum algorithmic primitive that plays an important role in context of both variational quantum algorithms (VQA) and fully fault-tolerant ones, and has been applied to a diverse range of problems. Conventionally, Pauli basis is used for LCU decomposition, which however in worst case can result in number of LCU terms that scale quadratically with respect to the matrix size. We show that by using an alternate basis one can better exploit the sparsity and underlying structure of matrix leading to number of tensor product terms which scale only logarithmically with respect to the matrix size. We develop numerical and semi-analytical approaches for computing sigma basis decomposition for an arbitrary matrix. Given this new basis is comprised of non-unitary operators, we employ the concept of unitary completion to design efficient quantum circuits for evaluation of the expectation values of operators composed of tensor product of elements from sigma basis which can be used for cost function evaluation in VQAs. We also develop an approach for block encoding of arbitrary operator given its decomposition in sigma basis which could be used in variety of fully fault-tolerant algorithms. We compare our approach with other related concepts in the literature including unitary dilation and provide numerical illustrations on several PDE examples.</description>

      <title>Spectrahedral relaxations of Eulerian rigidly convex sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03800v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a generalization of Eulerian polynomials to the multivariate setting introduced by Br\"and\'en. Although initially these polynomials were introduced using the language of hyperbolic and stable polynomials, we manage to translate some restrictions of these polynomials to our real zero setting. Once we are in this setting, we focus our attention on the rigidly convex sets (RCSs) defined by these polynomials. In particular, we study the corresponding rigidly convex sets looking at spectrahedral relaxations constructed through the use of monic symmetric linear matrix polynomials (MSLMPs) of small size and depending polynomially (actually just cubically) on the coefficients of the corresponding polynomials. We analyze how good are the obtained spectrahedral approximations to these rigidly convex sets. We do this analysis by measuring the behavior along the diagonal, where we precisely recover the original univariate Eulerian polynomials. Thus we conclude that, measuring through the diagonal, our relaxation-based spectrahedral method for approximation of the rigidly convex sets defined by multivariate Eulerian polynomials is highly accurate. In particular, we see that this relaxation-based spectrahedral method for approximation of the rigidly convex sets defined by multivariate Eulerian polynomials provides bounds for the extreme roots of the corresponding univariate Eulerian polynomials that are better than these already found in the literature. All in all, this tells us that, at least close to the diagonal, the global outer approximation to the rigidly convex sets provided by this relaxation-based spectrahedral method is itself highly accurate.</description>

      <title>Divergence-Kernel method for scores of random systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04035v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive the divergence-kernel formula for the scores of random dynamical systems, then formally pass to the continuous-time limit of SDEs. Our formula works for multiplicative noise systems over any period of time; it does not require hyperbolicity. We also consider several special cases: (1) for additive noise, we give a pure kernel formula; (2) for short-time, we give a pure divergence formula; (3) we give a formula which does not involve scores of the initial distribution. Based on the new formula, we derive a pathwise Monte-Carlo algorithm for scores, and demonstrate it on the 40-dimensional Lorenz 96 system with multiplicative noise.</description>

      <title>Kernels of trace operators via fine continuity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.04536v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study traces of elements of fractional Sobolev spaces $H_p^\alpha(\mathbb{R}^n)$ on closed subsets $\Gamma$ of $\mathbb{R}^n$, given as the supports of suitable measures $\mu$. We prove that if these measures satisfy localized upper density conditions, then quasi continuous representatives vanish quasi everywhere on $\Gamma$ if and only if they vanish $\mu$-almost everywhere on $\Gamma$. We use this result to characterize the kernel of the trace operator mapping from $H_p^\alpha(\mathbb{R}^n)$ into the space of $\mu$-equivalence classes of functions on $\Gamma$ as the closure of $C_c^\infty(\mathbb{R}^n\setminus \Gamma)$ in $H_p^\alpha(\mathbb{R}^n)$. The measures do not have to satisfy a doubling condition. In particular, the set $\Gamma$ may be a finite union of closed sets having different Hausdorff dimensions. We provide corresponding results for fractional Sobolev spaces $H_p^\alpha(\Omega)$ on domains $\Omega\subset \mathbb{R}^n$ satisfying the measure density condition.</description>

      <title>RAPTOR: Practical Numerical Profiling of Scientific Applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.04647v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The proliferation of low-precision units in modern high-performance architectures increasingly burdens domain scientists. Historically, the choice in HPC was easy: can we get away with 32 bit floating-point operations and lower bandwidth requirements, or is FP64 necessary? Driven by Artificial Intelligence, vendors introduced novel low-precision units for vector and tensor operations, and FP64 capabilities stagnate or are reduced. This is forcing scientists to re-evaluate their codes, but a trivial search-and-replace approach to go from FP64 to FP16 will not suffice. We introduce RAPTOR: a numerical profiling tool to guide scientists in their search for code regions where precision lowering is feasible. Using LLVM, we transparently replace high-precision computations using low-precision units, or emulate a user-defined precision. RAPTOR is a novel, feature-rich approach -- with focus on ease of use -- to change, profile, and reason about numerical requirements and instabilities, which we demonstrate with four real-world multi-physics Flash-X applications.</description>

      <title>Optimization of Transfers linking Ballistic Captures to Earth-Moon Periodic Orbit Families</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04739v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The design of transfers to periodic orbits in the Earth--Moon system has regained prominence with NASA's Artemis and CNSA's Chang'e programs. This work addresses the problem of linking ballistic capture trajectories - exploiting multi-body dynamics for temporary lunar orbit insertion - with bounded periodic motion described in the circular restricted three-body problem (CR3BP). A unified framework is developed for optimizing bi-impulsive transfers to families of periodic orbits via a high-order polynomial expansion of the CR3BP dynamics. That same expansion underlies a continuous 'abacus' parameterization of orbit families, enabling rapid targeting and analytic sensitivity. Transfers to planar periodic-orbit families (Lyapunov L1 and L2, and distant retrograde orbits) are addressed first, followed by extension to spatial families, such as butterfly and halo L1/L2 orbits, with an emphasis towards Near-Rectilinear Halo Orbits (NRHOs). Numerical results demonstrate low-cost solutions and validate the method's adaptability for the design of lunar missions. The optimized trajectories can inform an established low-energy transfer database, enriching it with detailed cost profiles that reflect both transfer feasibility and underlying dynamical relationships to specific periodic-orbit families. Finally, the proposed transfers provide reliable initial guesses for rapid refinement, readily adaptable for further optimization across mission-specific needs.</description>

      <title>A Discretization Scheme for BSDEs with Random Time Horizon</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.04882v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze a natural extension of the backward Euler approximation for a class of BSDEs with Lipschitz generators and random (unbounded) time horizons. We derive strong error bounds in terms of the underlying stepsize; the distance between the continuous terminal time and a discrete-time approximation; the distance between the terminal condition and a respective approximation; and an integrated distance depending on an approximation of the time component of the generator - all are scaled by the exponential of the maximal terminal time. As application we consider decoupled FBSDEs on bounded domains. We use an Euler-Maruyama scheme to approximate the diffusion and further refine our error bounds to only depend on the distance of the exit times.</description>

      <title>Accuracy and stability of the accelerated multi-direct-forcing immersed boundary method</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.04986v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The multi-direct-forcing immersed boundary method allows for high accuracy of the no-slip condition in moving-particle problems but suffers from numerical instability if simulation parameters are not carefully chosen. This study investigates the numerical accuracy and stability of the accelerated multidirect-forcing immersed boundary method. An analysis of the discretized equations of body motion in moving boundary problems identifies a critical parameter that solely determines the numerical stability for the body motion. Additionally, numerical simulations reveal the optimal acceleration parameter that minimizes the error in the no-slip condition and is independent of details of the boundary discretisation, the boundary shape, and spatial dimensionality. This study provides a guideline for establishing numerically stable simulations of moving boundary problems at optimal accuracy of the no-slip condition.</description>

      <title>On the convergence of N-body simulations of the Solar System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04987v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Most direct N-body integrations of planetary systems use a symplectic integrator with a fixed timestep. A large timestep is desirable because simulations run fast. However, simulations yield unphysical results if the timestep is too large. Surprisingly, no systematic convergence study has been performed on long (Gyr) timescales. In this paper we present numerical experiments to determine the minimum timestep one has to use in long-term integrations of the Solar System in order to recover the system's fundamental secular frequencies and instability rate. We find that timesteps of up to 32 days, i.e. a third of Mercury's orbital period, yield physical results in 5 Gyr integrations. We argue that the chaotic diffusion that drives the Solar System's long-term evolution dominates over numerical diffusion and timestep resonances. Our results bolster confidence that most simulations in the literature are indeed converged and provide guidance on how to run time and energy efficient simulations while making sure results can be trusted.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.05005v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The stochastic heat equation on the sphere driven by additive L\'evy random field is approximated by a spectral method in space and forward and backward Euler-Maruyama schemes in time, in analogy to the Wiener case. New regularity results are proven for the stochastic heat equation. The spectral approximation is based on a truncation of the series expansion with respect to the spherical harmonic functions. To do so, we restrict to square-integrable random field and optimal strong convergence rates for a given regularity of the initial condition and two different settings of regularity for the driving noise are derived for the Euler-Maruyama methods. Besides strong convergence, convergence of the expectation and second moment is shown. Weak rates for the spectral approximation are discussed. Numerical simulations confirm the theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Scale Dilation Dynamics in Flexible Bandwidth Needlet Constructions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05075v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Flexible bandwidth needlets offer a versatile multiscale framework for analyzing functions on the sphere. A key element in their construction is the dilation sequence, which controls how the multipole consecutive scales are spaced and overlapped. At any resolution level, this sequence determines the center positions of the needlet weight functions and influences their localization in the spatial domain and spectral concentration properties by means of the relative bandwidth ratio. In this paper, we explore the different asymptotic regimes that arise when the dilation sequence exhibits shrinking, stable (standard), or spreading behavior. Moreover, we assume the dilation sequence grows regularly enough to ensure well-defined asymptotic properties. For each regime, we characterize the impact on the geometry of the center scales and the shape of the multipole windows, with particular attention to their overlap structure and spectral coverage. These insights help to clarify the trade-offs between localization, redundancy, and scalability in the design of needlet-type systems, particularly in relation to the study of the asymptotic uncorrelation of needlet coefficients when applied to random fields.</description>

      <title>Sequential multiple importance sampling for high-dimensional Bayesian inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05114v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a sequential multiple importance sampling (SeMIS) algorithm for high-dimensional Bayesian inference. The method estimates Bayesian evidence using all generated samples from each proposal distribution while obtaining posterior samples through an importance-resampling scheme. A key innovation of SeMIS is the use of a softly truncated prior distribution as the intermediate proposal, providing a new way bridging prior and posterior distributions. By enabling samples from high-likelihood regions to traverse low-probability zones, SeMIS enhances mode mixing in challenging inference problems. Comparative evaluations against subset simulation (SuS) and adaptive Bayesian updating with structural reliability methods (aBUS) demonstrate that SeMIS achieves superior performance in evidence estimation (lower bias and variance) and posterior sampling (higher effective sample sizes and closer approximation to the true posterior), particularly for multimodal distributions. The efficacy of SeMIS is further validated in a high-dimensional finite element model updating application, where it successfully localizes structural damages by quantifying stiffness loss. The proposed algorithm not only advances Bayesian computation for complex posterior distributions but also provides a robust tool for uncertainty quantification in civil engineering systems, offering new possibilities for probabilistic structural health monitoring.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.06261v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modeling data using manifold values is a powerful concept with numerous advantages, particularly in addressing nonlinear phenomena. This approach captures the intrinsic geometric structure of the data, leading to more accurate descriptors and more efficient computational processes. However, even fundamental tasks like compression and data enhancement present meaningful challenges in the manifold setting. This paper introduces a multiscale transform that aims to represent manifold-valued sequences at different scales, enabling novel data processing tools for various applications. Similar to traditional methods, our construction is based on a refinement operator that acts as an upsampling operator and a corresponding downsampling operator. Inspired by Wiener's lemma, we term the latter as the reverse of the former. It turns out that some upsampling operators, for example, least-squares-based refinement, do not have a practical reverse. Therefore, we introduce the notion of pseudo-reversing and explore its analytical properties and asymptotic behavior. We derive analytical properties of the induced multiscale transform and conclude the paper with numerical illustrations showcasing different aspects of the pseudo-reversing and two data processing applications involving manifolds.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.02448v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Truss structures at macro-scale are common in a number of engineering applications and are now being increasingly used at the micro-scale to construct metamaterials. In analyzing the properties of a given truss structure, it is often necessary to understand how stress waves propagate through the system and/or its dynamic modes under time dependent loading so as to allow for maximally efficient use of space and material. This can be a computationally challenging task for particularly large or complex structures, with current methods requiring fine spatial discretization or evaluations of sizable matrices. Here we present a spectral method to compute the dynamics of trusses inspired by results from fluid flow networks. Our model accounts for the full dynamics of linearly elastic truss elements via a network Laplacian; a matrix object which couples the motions of the structure joints. We show that this method is equivalent to the continuum limit of linear finite element methods as well as capable of reproducing natural frequencies and modes determined by more complex and computationally costlier methods.</description>

      <title>On Universal Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors of Hypermatrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.14266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.14266v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A generalized eigenvector of a hypermatrix, called the universal (U-) eigenvector, is proposed, which extended the notion of diagonal (D-) eigenvectors in the literature. Using the semi-tensor product, the homogeneous U-eigenequation can be converted into a general eigenequation of matrix $(A-\lambda B)x=0$. A general technique for solving this equation is proposed, which leads to two kinds of eigenvalues: essential and quasi eigenvalues. The technique to convert nonhomogeneous eigenequation to homogeneous ones is also revealed. Then a hypervector decomposing method, called the monic decomposition algorithm (MDA), is developed. Using the MDA, the U-eigenproblem (including the D-eigenproblem) can be converted into general matrix eigenproblems. Some examples are presented, demonstrating the geometric meaning and potential applications of the U-eigenvalue/eigenvector.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.03487v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For the numerical solution of Dirichlet-type boundary value problems associated to nonlinear fractional differential equations of order $\alpha \in (1,2)$ that use Caputo derivatives, we suggest to employ shooting methods. In particular, we demonstrate that the so-called proportional secting technique for selecting the required initial values leads to numerical schemes that converge to high accuracy in a very small number of shooting iterations, and we provide an explanation of the analytical background for this favourable numerical behaviour.</description>

      <title>Chebyshev approximation by non-Chebyshev systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16330v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We address the problem of the best uniform approximation by linear combinations of a finite system of functions. If the system is Chebyshev and the problem is unconstrained, then the classical Remez algorithm provides a fast and precise solution. For non-Chebyshev systems, this problem may offer a great resistance. The same happens to approximations under linear constraints. We propose a solution by modifying the concept of alternance and of the Remez iterative procedure. A criterion of the best approximation is proved and the full set of polynomials of best approximation (which may not be unique in the non-Chebyshev case) is characterized. The method of finding the best polynomial is applicable for arbitrary functional systems under arbitrary linear constraints. The efficiency is demonstrated in examples with systems of complex exponents, Gaussian functions, and lacunar polynomials. As an application, the Markov-Bernstein type inequalities are obtained for those systems. Applications to signal processing, linear ODEs, switching dynamical systems are considered.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02758v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Domain decomposition (DD) methods are a natural way to take advantage of parallel computers when solving large scale linear systems. Their scalability depends on the design of the coarse space used in the two-level method. The analysis of adaptive coarse spaces we present here is quite general since it applies to symmetric and non-symmetric problems, to symmetric preconditioners such as the additive Schwarz method (ASM) and to the non-symmetric preconditioner restricted additive Schwarz (RAS), as well as to exact or inexact subdomain solves. The coarse space is built by solving generalized eigenproblems in the subdomains and applying a well-chosen operator to the selected eigenvectors.</description>

      <title>Multi-rate Runge-Kutta methods: stability analysis and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02139v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an approach for the efficient implementation of self-adjusting multi-rate Runge-Kutta methods and we introduce a novel stability analysis, that covers the multi-rate extensions of all standard Runge-Kutta methods and allows to assess the impact of different interpolation methods for the latent variables and of the use of an arbitrary number of sub-steps for the active variables. The stability analysis applies successfully to the model problem typically used in the literature for multi-rate methods. Furthermore,} we also propose a physically motivated model problem that can be used to assess stability to problems with purely imaginary eigenvalues and in situations closer to those arising in applications. Finally, we present an efficient implementation of multi-rate Runge-Kutta methods in the framework of the OpenModelica open-source modelling and simulation software. Results of several numerical experiments, performed with this implementation of the proposed methods, demonstrate the efficiency gains deriving from the use of the proposed multi-rate approach for physical modelling problems with multiple time scales.</description>

      <title>Nonharmonic multivariate Fourier transforms and matrices: condition numbers and hyperplane geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10313v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Consider an operator that takes the Fourier transform of a discrete measure supported in $\mathcal{X}\subset[-\frac 12,\frac 12)^d$ and restricts it to a compact $\Omega\subset\mathbb{R}^d$. We provide lower bounds for its smallest singular value when $\Omega$ is either a closed ball of radius $m$ or closed cube of side length $2m$, and under different types of geometric assumptions on $\mathcal{X}$. We first show that if distances between points in $\mathcal{X}$ are lower bounded by a $\delta$ that is allowed to be arbitrarily small, then the smallest singular value is at least $Cm^{d/2} (m\delta)^{\lambda-1}$, where $\lambda$ is the maximum number of elements in $\mathcal{X}$ contained within any ball or cube of an explicitly given radius. This estimate communicates a localization effect of the Fourier transform. While it is sharp, the smallest singular value behaves better than expected for many $\mathcal{X}$, including when we dilate a generic set by parameter $\delta$. We next show that if there is a $\eta$ such that, for each $x\in\mathcal{X}$, the set $\mathcal{X}\setminus\{x\}$ locally consists of at most $r$ hyperplanes whose distances to $x$ are at least $\eta$, then the smallest singular value is at least $C m^{d/2} (m\eta)^r$. For dilations of a generic set by $\delta$, the lower bound becomes $C m^{d/2} (m\delta)^{\lceil (\lambda-1)/d\rceil }$. The appearance of a $1/d$ factor in the exponent indicates that compared to worst case scenarios, the condition number of nonharmonic Fourier transforms is better than expected for typical sets and improve with higher dimensionality.</description>

      <title>Computing asymptotic eigenvectors and eigenvalues of perturbed symmetric matrices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17047v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Computing the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of a perturbed matrix can be remarkably difficult when the unperturbed matrix has repeated eigenvalues. In this work we show how the limiting eigenvectors and eigenvalues of a symmetric matrix $K(\varepsilon)$ as $\varepsilon \to 0$ can be obtained relatively easily from successive Schur complements, provided that the entries scale in different orders of $\varepsilon$. If the matrix does not directly exhibit this structure, we show that putting the matrix into a ``generalised kernel form'' can be very informative. The resulting formulas are much simpler than classical expressions obtained from complex integrals involving the resolvent. We apply our results to the problem of computing the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of kernel matrices in the ``flat limit'', a problem that appears in many applications in statistics and approximation theory. In particular, we prove a conjecture from [SIAM J. Matrix Anal. Appl., 2021, 42(1):17--57] which connects the eigenvectors of kernel matrices to multivariate orthogonal polynomials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11750v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a generalized shift-splitting (GSS) preconditioner, along with its two relaxed variants to solve the double saddle point problem (DSPP). The convergence of the associated GSS iterative method is analyzed, and sufficient conditions for its convergence are established. Spectral analyses are performed to derive sharp bounds for the eigenvalues of the preconditioned matrices. Numerical experiments based on examples arising from the PDE-constrained optimization problem and the leaky lid-driven cavity problem demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed preconditioners compared with existing state-of-the-art preconditioners.</description>

Abstract: In this article, we develop and present a novel regularization scheme for ill-posed inverse problems governed by nonlinear time-dependent partial differential equations (PDEs). In our recent work, we introduced a bi-level regularization framework. This study significantly improves upon the bi-level algorithm by sequentially initializing the lower-level problem, yielding accelerated convergence and demonstrable multi-scale effect, while retaining regularizing effect and allows for the usage of inexact PDE solvers. Moreover, by collecting the lower-level trajectory, we uncover an interesting connection to the incremental load method. The sequential bi-level approach illustrates its universality through several reaction-diffusion applications, in which the nonlinear reaction law needs to be determined. We moreover prove that the proposed tangential cone condition is satisfied.</description>

      <title>Deep Picard Iteration for High-Dimensional Nonlinear PDEs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08526v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the Deep Picard Iteration (DPI) method, a new deep learning approach for solving high-dimensional partial differential equations (PDEs). The core innovation of DPI lies in its use of Picard iteration to reformulate the typically complex training objectives of neural network-based PDE solutions into much simpler, standard regression tasks based on function values and gradients. This design not only greatly simplifies the optimization process but also offers the potential for further scalability through parallel data generation. Crucially, to fully realize the benefits of regressing on both function values and gradients in the DPI method, we address the issue of infinite variancein the estimators of gradients by incorporating a control variate, supported by our theoretical analysis. Our experiments on problems up to 100 dimensions demonstrate that DPI consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, with greater robustness to hyperparameters, particularly in challenging scenarios with long time horizons and strong nonlinearity. The code is available at https://github.com/DeepOptimalControl/DeepPicardIteration.</description>

      <title>Riemannian conjugate Sobolev gradients and their application to compute ground states of BECs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17302v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work considers the numerical computation of ground states of rotating Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) which can exhibit a multiscale lattice of quantized vortices. This problem involves the minimization of an energy functional on a Riemannian manifold. For this we apply the framework of nonlinear conjugate gradient methods in combination with the paradigm of Sobolev gradients to investigate different metrics. Here we build on previous work that proposed to enhance the convergence of regular Riemannian gradients methods by an adaptively changing metric that is based on the current energy. In this work, we extend this approach to the branch of Riemannian conjugate gradient (CG) methods and investigate the arising schemes numerically. Special attention is given to the selection of the momentum parameter in search direction and how this affects the performance of the resulting schemes. As known from similar applications, we find that the choice of the momentum parameter plays a critical role, with certain parameters reducing the number of iterations required to achieve a specified tolerance by a significant factor. Besides the influence of the momentum parameters, we also investigate how the methods with adaptive metric compare to the corresponding realizations with a standard $H^1_0$-metric. As one of our main findings, the results of the numerical experiments show that the Riemannian CG method with the proposed adaptive metric along with a Polak-Ribi\'ere or Hestenes-Stiefel-type momentum parameter show the best performance and highest robustness compared to the other CG methods that were part of our numerical study.</description>

      <title>Polynomial approximation of noisy functions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02317v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Approximating a univariate function on the interval $[-1,1]$ with a polynomial is among the most classical problems in numerical analysis. When the function evaluations come with noise, a least-squares fit is known to reduce the effect of noise as more samples are taken. The generic algorithm for the least-squares problem requires $O(Nn^2)$ operations, where $N+1$ is the number of sample points and $n$ is the degree of the polynomial approximant. This algorithm is unstable when $n$ is large, for example $n\gg \sqrt{N}$ for equispaced sample points. In this study, we blend numerical analysis and statistics to introduce a stable and fast $O(N\log N)$ algorithm called NoisyChebtrunc based on the Chebyshev interpolation. It has the same error reduction effect as least-squares and the convergence is spectral until the error reaches $O(\sigma \sqrt{{n}/{N}})$, where $\sigma$ is the noise level, after which the error continues to decrease at the Monte-Carlo $O(1/\sqrt{N})$ rate. To determine the polynomial degree, NoisyChebtrunc employs a statistical criterion, namely Mallows' $C_p$. We analyze NoisyChebtrunc in terms of the variance and concentration in the infinity norm to the underlying noiseless function. These results show that with high probability the infinity-norm error is bounded by a small constant times $\sigma \sqrt{{n}/{N}}$, when the noise {is} independent and follows a subgaussian or subexponential distribution. We illustrate the performance of NoisyChebtrunc with numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Offline-online approximation of multiscale eigenvalue problems with random defects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19614v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider an elliptic eigenvalue problem with multiscale, randomly perturbed coefficients. For an efficient and accurate approximation of the solutions for many different realizations of the coefficient, we propose a computational multiscale method in the spirit of the Localized Orthogonal Decomposition (LOD) method together with an offline-online strategy similar to [M{\aa}lqvist, Verf\"urth, ESIAM Math. Model. Numer. Anal., 56(1):237-260, 2022]. The offline phase computes and stores local contributions to the LOD stiffness matrix for selected defect configurations. Given any perturbed coefficient, the online phase combines the pre-computed quantities in an efficient manner. We further propose a modification in the online phase, for which numerical results indicate enhanced performances for moderate and high defect probabilities. We show rigorous a priori error estimates for eigenfunctions as well as eigenvalues.</description>

      <title>Convergent Sixth-order Compact Finite Difference Method for Variable-Coefficient Elliptic PDEs in Curved Domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10358v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Finite difference methods (FDMs) are widely used for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) due to their relatively simple implementation. However, they face significant challenges when applied to non-rectangular domains and in establishing theoretical convergence, particularly for high-order schemes. In this paper, we focus on solving the elliptic equation $-\nabla \cdot (a \nabla u) = f$ in a two-dimensional curved domain $\Omega$, where the diffusion coefficient $a$ is variable and smooth. We propose a sixth-order $9$-point compact FDM on uniform Cartesian grids within the domain, not relying on ghost points or information outside $\overline{\Omega}$. All the boundary stencils near $\partial \Omega$ have at most $6$ different configurations and use at most $8$ grid points inside $\Omega$. We rigorously establish the sixth-order convergence of the numerically approximated solution $u_h$ in the $\infty$-norm. Additionally, we derive a gradient approximation $\nabla u$ directly from $u_h$ without solving auxiliary equations. This gradient approximation achieves proven accuracy of order $5 + \frac{1}{q}$ in the $q$-norm for all $1 \leq q \leq \infty$ (with a logarithmic factor $\log h$ for $1 \leq q &lt; 2$). To validate our proposed sixth-order compact finite different method, we provide several numerical examples that illustrate the sixth-order accuracy and computational efficiency of both the numerical solution and the gradient approximation for solving elliptic PDEs in curved domains.</description>

      <title>H2-MG: A multigrid method for hierarchical rank structured matrices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17656v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a new fast iterative solver for large systems involving kernel matrices. Advantageous aspects of H2 matrix approximations and the multigrid method are hybridized to create the H2-MG algorithm. This combination provides the time and memory efficiency of H2 operator representation along with the rapid convergence of a multilevel method. We describe how H2-MG works, show its linear complexity, and demonstrate its effectiveness on two standard kernels and on a single-layer potential boundary element discretization with complex geometry. The current zoo of H2 solvers, which includes a wide variety of iterative and direct solvers, so far lacks a method that exploits multiple levels of resolution, commonly referred to in the iterative methods literature as ``multigrid'' from its origins in a hierarchy of grids used to discretize differential equations. This makes H2-MG a valuable addition to the collection of H2 solvers. The algorithm has potential for advancing various fields that require the solution of large, dense, symmetric positive definite matrices.</description>

      <title>A symmetric boundary integral formulation for time-domain acoustic-elastic scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04767v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A symmetric boundary integral formulation for the transient scattering of acoustic waves off homogeneous and isotropic elastic obstacles is analyzed. Both the acoustic scattered field and the elastodynamic excited field are represented through a direct integral representation, resulting in a coupled system of interior/exterior integral equations that is symmetrized through the introduction of an auxiliary mortar variable. The analysis of each system and of its Galerkin discretization is done through the passage to the Laplace domain, which allows for the use of convolution quadrature for time discretization. Since the operators of the acustic and elastic Calder\'on calculus appear independently of each other, the formulation is well suited for non-intrusive numerical impementations (i.e. existing codes for acoustic and elastic problems can be used without any modification).</description>

      <title>Improvement of Sinc-collocation methods for Volterra-Fredholm integral equations of the second kind and their theoretical analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11569v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sinc-collocation methods for Volterra-Fredholm integral equations of the second kind were proposed independently by multiple authors: by Shamloo et al. in 2012 and by Mesgarani and Mollapourasl in 2013. Their theoretical analyses and numerical experiments suggest that the presented methods can attain root-exponential convergence. However, their convergence has not been strictly proved. This study improves these methods to facilitate implementation, and provides a convergence theorem for the improved method. For the same equations, another Sinc-collocation method was proposed in 2016 by John and Ogbonna, which is regarded as an improvement to the variable transformation employed by Shamloo et al. It may attain a higher rate than the previous methods, but its convergence has not yet been proved. Therefore, this study improves it to facilitate implementation, and provides a convergence theorem for the improved method.</description>

      <title>Asymptotically accurate and geometric locking-free finite element implementation of a refined shell theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23369v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate finite element analysis of refined shell theories is crucial but often hindered by membrane and shear locking effects. While various element-based locking-free techniques exist, this work addresses the problem at the theoretical level by utilizing results from asymptotic analysis. A formulation of a 2D refined shell theory incorporating transverse shear is developed using rescaled coordinates and angles of rotation, ensuring equal asymptotic orders of magnitude for extension, bending, and rotation measures and their respective stiffnesses. This novel approach, implemented via isogeometric analysis, is shown to be both asymptotically accurate relative to the underlying refined shell theory and inherently free from membrane and shear locking. Numerical simulations of semi-cylindrical shells show excellent agreement between the analytical solutions, 2D refined shell theory predictions, and 3D elasticity theory, validating the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed formulation.</description>

      <title>Hybrid CG-Tikhonov is a filtration of the CG Lanczos vectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24056v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider iterative methods for solving linear ill-posed problems with compact operator and right-hand side only available via noise-polluted measurements. Conjugate gradients (\cg) applied to the normal equations with an appropriate stopping rule and \cg applied to the system solving for a Tikhonov-regularized solution (\cgt) $(A^\ast A + c I_{\mathcal{X}}) x^{(\delta,c)} = A^\ast y^\delta$ are closely related regularization methods that build iterates from the same family of Krylov subspaces.
  In this work, we show that the \cgt iterate can be expressed as $x^{(\delta,c)}_m = \sum_{i=1}^{m} \gamma^{(m)}_i(c) z_i^{(m)}v_i$, where $\braces{\gamma_i^{(m)}(c)}_{i=1}^m$ are functions of the Tikhonov parameter and $x^{(\delta)}_m = \sum_{i=1}^{m} z_i^{(m)}v_i$ is the $m$-th \cg iterate. We call these functions \emph{Lanczos filters}, and they can be shown to have decay properties as $c\rightarrow\infty$ with the speed of decay increasing with $i$. This has the effect of filtering out the contribution of the later terms of the \cg iterate. The filters can be constructed using quantities defined via recursions at each iteration.
  We demonstrate with numerical experiments that good parameter choices correspond to appropriate damping of the Lanczos vectors. The filtration approach also provides a platform for further development of parameter choice rules, and similar representations may hold for other hybrid iterative schemes.</description>

      <title>Subspace-constrained randomized coordinate descent for linear systems with good low-rank matrix approximations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09394v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The randomized coordinate descent (RCD) method is a classical algorithm with simple, lightweight iterations that is widely used for various optimization problems, including the solution of positive semidefinite linear systems. As a linear solver, RCD is particularly effective when the matrix is well-conditioned; however, its convergence rate deteriorates rapidly in the presence of large spectral outliers. In this paper, we introduce the subspace-constrained randomized coordinate descent (SC-RCD) method, in which the dynamics of RCD are restricted to an affine subspace corresponding to a column Nystr\"{o}m approximation, efficiently computed using the recently analyzed RPCholesky algorithm. We prove that SC-RCD converges at a rate that is unaffected by large spectral outliers, making it an effective and memory-efficient solver for large-scale, dense linear systems with rapidly decaying spectra, such as those encountered in kernel ridge regression. Experimental validation and comparisons with related solvers based on coordinate descent and the conjugate gradient method demonstrate the efficiency of SC-RCD. Our theoretical results are derived by developing a more general subspace-constrained framework for the sketch-and-project method. This framework generalizes popular algorithms such as randomized Kaczmarz and coordinate descent, and provides a flexible, implicit preconditioning strategy for a variety of iterative solvers, which may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Quasi-Monte Carlo hyperinterpolation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.11622v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies a generalization of hyperinterpolation over the high-dimensional unit cube. Hyperinterpolation of degree \( m \) serves as a discrete approximation of the \( L_2 \)-orthogonal projection of the same degree, using Fourier coefficients evaluated by a positive-weight quadrature rule that exactly integrates all polynomials of degree up to \( 2m \). Traditional hyperinterpolation methods often depend on exact quadrature assumptions, which can be impractical in high-dimensional contexts. We address the challenges and advancements in hyperinterpolation, bypassing the assumption of exactness for quadrature rules by replacing it with quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) rules and propose a novel approximation scheme with an index set \( I \), which is referred to as QMC hyperinterpolation of range \( I \). In particular, we provide concrete construction algorithms for QMC hyperinterpolation with certain lattice rules. Consequently, we show that QMC hyperinterpolation achieves accuracy comparable to traditional hyperinterpolation while avoiding its higher computational costs.
  Furthermore, we introduce a Lasso-based approach to improve the robustness of QMC hyperinterpolation against noise from sampling processes. Numerical experiments validate the efficacy of our proposed methods.</description>

Abstract: We propose a fast and stable method for constructing matrix approximations to fractional integral operators applied to series in the Chebyshev fractional polynomials. This method utilizes a recurrence relation satisfied by the fractional integrals of mapped Chebyshev polynomials and significantly outperforms existing methods. Through numerical examples, we highlight the broad applicability of these matrix approximations, including the solution of boundary value problems for fractional integral and differential equations. Additional applications include fractional differential equation initial value problems and fractional eigenvalue problems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.22576v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces a new method for solving the planar heat equation based on the Lightning Method. The lightning method is a recent development in the numerical solution of linear PDEs which expresses solutions using sums of polynomials and rational functions, or more generally as sums of fundamental solutions. The method is particularly well suited to handle domains with sharp corners where solution singularities are present. Boundary conditions are formed on a set of collocation points which is then solved as an overdetermined linear system. The approach of the present work is to utilize the Laplace transform to obtain a modified Helmholtz equation which is solved by an application of the lightning method. The numerical inversion of the Laplace transform is then performed by means of Talbot integration. Our validation of the method against existing results and multiple challenging test problems shows the method attains spectral accuracy with root-exponential convergence while being robust across a wide range of time intervals and adaptable to a variety of geometric scenarios.</description>

      <title>GPU-based complete search for nonlinear minimization subject to bounds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.01770v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces a GPU-based complete search method to enclose the global minimum of a nonlinear function subject to simple bounds on the variables. Using interval analysis, coupled with the computational power and architecture of GPU, the method iteratively rules out the regions in the search domain where the global minimum cannot exist and leaves a finite set of regions where the global minimum must exist. For effectiveness, because of the rigor of interval analysis, the method is guaranteed to enclose the global minimum of the nonlinear function even in the presence of rounding errors. For efficiency, the method employs a novel GPU-based single program, single data parallel programming style to circumvent major GPU performance bottlenecks, and a variable cycling technique is also integrated into the method to reduce computational cost when minimizing large-scale nonlinear functions. The method is validated by minimizing 10 multimodal benchmark test functions with scalable dimensions, including the well-known Ackley function, Griewank function, Levy function, and Rastrigin function. These benchmark test functions represent grand challenges of global optimization, and enclosing the guaranteed global minimum of these benchmark test functions with more than 80 dimensions has not been reported in the literature. Our method completely searches the feasible domain and successfully encloses the guaranteed global minimum of these 10 benchmark test functions with up to 10,000 dimensions using only one GPU in a reasonable computation time, far exceeding the reported results in the literature due to the unique method design and implementation based on GPU architecture.</description>

      <title>Transformers Can Solve Non-Linear and Non-Markovian Filtering Problems in Continuous Time For Conditionally Gaussian Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.19603v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The use of attention-based deep learning models in stochastic filtering, e.g.\ transformers and deep Kalman filters, has recently come into focus; however, the potential for these models to solve stochastic filtering problems remains largely unknown. The paper provides an affirmative answer to this open problem in the theoretical foundations of machine learning by showing that a class of continuous-time transformer models, called \textit{filterformers}, can approximately implement the conditional law of a broad class of non-Markovian and conditionally Gaussian signal processes given noisy continuous-time (possibly non-Gaussian) measurements. Our approximation guarantees hold uniformly over sufficiently regular compact subsets of continuous-time paths, where the worst-case 2-Wasserstein distance between the true optimal filter and our deep learning model quantifies the approximation error. Our construction relies on two new customizations of the standard attention mechanism: The first can losslessly adapt to the characteristics of a broad range of paths since we show that the attention mechanism implements bi-Lipschitz embeddings of sufficiently regular sets of paths into low-dimensional Euclidean spaces; thus, it incurs no ``dimension reduction error''. The latter attention mechanism is tailored to the geometry of Gaussian measures in the $2$-Wasserstein space. Our analysis relies on new stability estimates of robust optimal filters in the conditionally Gaussian setting.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19512v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a quantum algorithm for the solution of prototypical second-order linear elliptic partial differential equations discretized by $d$-linear finite elements on Cartesian grids of a bounded $d$-dimensional domain. An essential step in the construction is a BPX preconditioner, which transforms the linear system into a sufficiently well-conditioned one, making it amenable to quantum computation. We provide a constructive proof demonstrating that, for any fixed dimension, our quantum algorithm can compute suitable functionals of the solution to a given tolerance $\mathtt{tol}$ with an optimal complexity of order $\mathtt{tol}^{-1}$ up to logarithmic terms, significantly improving over existing approaches. Notably, this approach does not rely on regularity of the solution and achieves quantum advantage over classical solvers in two dimensions, whereas prior quantum methods required at least four dimensions for asymptotic benefits. We further detail the design and implementation of a quantum circuit capable of executing our algorithm, present simulator results, and report numerical experiments on current quantum hardware, confirming the feasibility of preconditioned finite element methods for near-term quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Skew-symmetric schemes for stochastic differential equations with non-Lipschitz drift: an unadjusted Barker algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14373v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a new simple and explicit numerical scheme for time-homogeneous stochastic differential equations. The scheme is based on sampling increments at each time step from a skew-symmetric probability distribution, with the level of skewness determined by the drift and volatility of the underlying process. We show that as the step-size decreases the scheme converges weakly to the diffusion of interest. We then consider the problem of simulating from the limiting distribution of an ergodic diffusion process using the numerical scheme with a fixed step-size. We establish conditions under which the numerical scheme converges to equilibrium at a geometric rate, and quantify the bias between the equilibrium distributions of the scheme and of the true diffusion process. Notably, our results do not require a global Lipschitz assumption on the drift, in contrast to those required for the Euler--Maruyama scheme for long-time simulation at fixed step-sizes. Our weak convergence result relies on an extension of the theory of Milstein \&amp; Tretyakov to stochastic differential equations with non-Lipschitz drift, which could also be of independent interest. We support our theoretical results with numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>An ADMM-Based Approach to Quadratically-Regularized Distributed Optimal Transport on Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05509v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Optimal transport on a graph focuses on finding the most efficient way to transfer resources from one distribution to another while considering the graph's structure. This paper introduces a new distributed algorithm that solves the optimal transport problem on directed, strongly connected graphs, unlike previous approaches which were limited to bipartite graphs. Our algorithm incorporates quadratic regularization and guarantees convergence using the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM). Notably, it proves convergence not only with quadratic regularization but also in cases without it, whereas earlier works required strictly convex objective functions.
  In this approach, nodes are treated as agents that collaborate through local interactions to optimize the total transportation cost, relying only on information from their neighbors. Through numerical experiments, we show how quadratic regularization affects both convergence behavior and solution sparsity under different graph structures. Additionally, we provide a practical example that highlights the algorithm's robustness through its ability to adjust to topological changes in the graph.</description>

      <title>Enforcing asymptotic behavior with DNNs for approximation and regression in finance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05257v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a simple methodology to approximate functions with given asymptotic behavior by specifically constructed terms and an unconstrained deep neural network (DNN).
  The methodology we describe extends to various asymptotic behaviors and multiple dimensions and is easy to implement. In this work we demonstrate it for linear asymptotic behavior in one-dimensional examples. We apply it to function approximation and regression problems where we measure approximation of only function values (``Vanilla Machine Learning''-VML) or also approximation of function and derivative values (``Differential Machine Learning''-DML) on several examples. We see that enforcing given asymptotic behavior leads to better approximation and faster convergence.</description>

      <title>Random weights of DNNs and emergence of fixed points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04182v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with a special class of deep neural networks (DNNs) where the input and the output vectors have the same dimension. Such DNNs are widely used in applications, e.g., autoencoders. The training of such networks can be characterized by their fixed points (FPs). We are concerned with the dependence of the FPs number and their stability on the distribution of randomly initialized DNNs' weight matrices. Specifically, we consider the i.i.d. random weights with heavy and light-tail distributions. Our objectives are twofold. First, the dependence of FPs number and stability of FPs on the type of the distribution tail. Second, the dependence of the number of FPs on the DNNs' architecture. We perform extensive simulations and show that for light tails (e.g., Gaussian), which are typically used for initialization, a single stable FP exists for broad types of architectures. In contrast, for heavy tail distributions (e.g., Cauchy), which typically appear in trained DNNs, a number of FPs emerge. We further observe that these FPs are stable attractors and their basins of attraction partition the domain of input vectors. Finally, we observe an intriguing non-monotone dependence of the number of fixed points $Q(L)$ on the DNNs' depth $L$. The above results were first obtained for untrained DNNs with two types of distributions at initialization and then verified by considering DNNs in which the heavy tail distributions arise in training.</description>

      <title>CIR bridge for modeling of fish migration on sub-hourly scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07094v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bridges, which are stochastic processes with pinned initial and terminal conditions, have recently been applied to various problems. We show that a bridge based on the Cox-Ingersoll-Ross process, called a CIR bridge in this paper, reasonably models the intraday number of migrating fish at an observation point in a river. The studied fish migrates between sunrise and sunset each day, which are considered the initial and terminal times, respectively. The CIR bridge is well-defined as a unique pathwise continuous solution to a stochastic differential equation with unbounded drift and diffusion coefficients and potentially represents the on-off intermittency of the fish count data. Our bridge is theoretically novel in that it admits closed-form time-dependent averages and variances, with which the model parameters can be identified efficiently, and is computable by a recently-developed one-step numerical method. The CIR bridge is applied to the sub-hourly migration data of the diadromous fish Plecoglossus altivelis altivelis in the Nagara River, Japan, from February to June.</description>

      <title>On a mean-field Pontryagin minimum principle for stochastic optimal control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10506v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This papers outlines a novel extension of the classical Pontryagin minimum (maximum) principle to stochastic optimal control problems. Contrary to the well-known stochastic Pontryagin minimum principle involving forward-backward stochastic differential equations, the proposed formulation is deterministic and of mean-field type. We denote it the McKean-Pontryagin minimum principle. The Hamiltonian structure of the proposed McKean-Pontryagin minimum principle is achieved via the introduction of an appropriate gauge variable. The gauge freedom can be used to decouple the forward and reverse time equations; hence simplifying the solution of the underlying boundary value problem. We also consider infinite horizon discounted cost optimal control problems. In this case, the mean-field formulation allows converting the computation of the desired optimal control law into solving a pair of forward mean-field ordinary differential equations. The McKean-Pontryagin minimum principle is tested numerically for a controlled inverted pendulum and a controlled Lorenz-63 system.</description>
