      <title>A Finite Element Analysis Model for Magnetomotive Ultrasound Elastometry Magnet Design with Experimental Validation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07737v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Objective. Magnetomotive ultrasound (MMUS) using magnetic nanoparticle contrast agents has shown promise for thrombosis imaging and quantitative elastometry via magnetomotive resonant acoustic spectroscopy (MRAS). Young's modulus measurements of smaller, stiffer thrombi require an MRAS system capable of generating forces at higher temporal frequencies. Solenoids with fewer turns, and thus less inductance, could improve high frequency performance, but the reduced force may compromise results. In this work, a computational model capable of predicting improved MRAS magnet configurations optimized for elastometry is presented and validated.
  Approach. Finite element analysis (FEA) was used to model the force and inductance of MRAS systems. The simulations incorporated both solenoid electromagnets and permanent magnets in three-dimensional steady-state, frequency domain, and time domain studies.
  Main results. The model successfully predicted a configuration in which permanent magnets could be used to increase the force supplied by an existing MRAS system. Accordingly, the displacement measured in a magnetically labeled validation phantom increased by a factor of $2.2 \pm 0.3$ when the force was predicted to increase by a factor of $2.2 \pm 0.2$. The model additionally identified a new solenoid configuration consisting of four smaller coils capable of providing sufficient force at higher driving frequencies.
  Significance. These results indicate two methods by which MRAS systems could be designed to deliver higher frequency magnetic forces without the need for experimental trial and error. Either the number of turns within each solenoid could be reduced while permanent magnets are added at precise locations, or a larger number of smaller solenoids could be used. These findings overcome a key challenge toward the goal of thrombosis elastometry via MMUS.</description>

      <title>Applications of aligned nanofiber for tissue engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In tissue engineering, we seek to address comprehensive tissue repair and regeneration needs. Aligned nanofibers have emerged as powerful and versatile tools, attributable to their structural and biochemical congruence with the natural extracellular matrix (ECM). This review delineates the contemporary applications of aligned nanofibers in tissue engineering, spotlighting their implementation across musculoskeletal, neural, and cardiovascular tissue domains. The influence of fiber alignment on critical cellular behaviors - cell adhesion, migration, orientation, and differentiation - is reviewed. We also discuss how nanofibers are improved by adding growth factors, peptides, and drugs to help tissues regenerate better. Comprehensive analyses of in vivo trials and clinical studies corroborate the efficacy and safety of these fibers in tissue engineering applications. The review culminates with exploring extant challenges, concurrently charting prospective avenues in aligned nanofiber-centric tissue engineering.</description>

      <title>Ankle Exoskeletons May Hinder Standing Balance in Simple Models of Older and Younger Adults</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05418v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Humans rely on ankle torque to maintain standing balance, particularly in the presence of small to moderate perturbations. Reductions in maximum torque (MT) production and maximum rate of torque development (MRTD) occur at the ankle with age, diminishing stability. Ankle exoskeletons are powered orthotic devices that may assist older adults by compensating for reduced muscle force and power production capabilities. They may also be able to assist with ankle strategies used for balance. However, no studies have investigated the effect of such devices on balance in older adults. Here, we model the effect ankle exoskeletons have on stability in physics-based models of healthy young and old adults, focusing on the mitigation of age-related deficits such as reduced MT and MRTD. We show that an ankle exoskeleton moderately reduces feasible stability boundaries in users who have full ankle strength. For individuals with age-related deficits, there is a trade-off. While exoskeletons augment stability in low velocity conditions, they reduce stability in some high velocity conditions. Our results suggest that well-established control strategies must still be experimentally validated in older adults.</description>
