      <title>Self-Organized Bioelectricity via Collective Pump Alignment: Physical Origin of Chemiosmosis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16171v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chemiosmosis maintains life in nonequilibrium through ion transport across membranes, yet the origin of this order remains unclear. We develop a minimal model in which ion pump orientation and the intracellular electrochemical potential mutually reinforce each other. This model shows that fluctuations can induce collective pump alignment and the formation of a membrane potential. The alignment undergoes a phase transition from disordered to ordered, analogous to the Ising model. Our results provide a self-organizing mechanism for the emergence of bioelectricity, with implications for the origin of life.</description>

      <title>The Beauty of Mathematics in Helfrich's Biomembrane Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16002v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is with great regret that Prof. Wolfgang Helfrich passed away on 28 September 2025 in Berlin. As the founder of the membrane liquid crystal model, Prof. Helfrich made outstanding contributions to membrane physics and liquid crystal display technology. This review article is written in his memory. Biomembranes, primarily composed of lipid bilayers, are not merely passive barriers but dynamic and complex materials whose shapes are governed by the principles of soft matter physics. This review explores the shape problem in biomembranes through the lens of material science and liquid crystal theory. Beginning with classical analogies to crystals and soap bubbles, it details the application of the Helfrich elastic model to explain the biconcave shape of red blood cells. The discussion extends to multi-layer systems, drawing parallels between the focal conic structures of smectic liquid crystals, the geometries of fullerenes and carbon nanotubes, and the reversible transitions in peptide assemblies. Furthermore, it examines icosahedral self-assemblies and shape formation in two-dimensional lipid monolayers at air/water interfaces. At the end of the paper, we find that the shapes such as cylinders, spheres, tori, bicocave discoids and Delaunay surfaces form a group. This result is merely an intrinsic geometric feature of these shapes and is independent of the biomembrane equation. When the pressure on the membrane, surface tension, and bending modules meet certain conditions, the biomembrane will take on these shapes. The review concludes by highlighting the unifying power of continuum elastic theories in describing a vast array of membrane morphologies across biological and synthetic systems.</description>

      <title>Evaporation-Induced Pattern Formation and Wetting in Active Microtubule-Kinesin Droplets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16084v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Active networks composed of biopolymers and motor proteins provide versatile biomimetic systems that have advanced active matter physics and deepened our understanding of cytoskeletal dynamics and self-organization under diverse stimuli. In these systems, activity arises in aqueous solutions where motor proteins cross-link biopolymers and generate active stress driving the emergent network behavior. Here, we establish the active network in the form of a sessile, multi-component droplet on a substrate and investigate how evaporation influences its dynamics. We focus on how mass loss and compositional changes in the droplet reshape the behavior of the active suspension. We show that capillary and Marangoni flows drive the self-organization of microtubules into a distinctive radial arrangement within the droplet. The cross-linking ability of motor proteins gives rise to a striking non-monotonic wetting behavior, where the extensile stresses generated by the motor proteins strongly affect the characteristic timescale of the contact-line retracting and subsequent expansion. Using a combined experimental and theoretical approach, we demonstrate the crucial role of crosslinking in evaporating microtubule networks, and explain how active stresses together with evaporation-induced flows govern the dynamics of reconstituted microtubule systems and their wetting behavior. Evaporating droplets have recently attracted significant attention in the scientific community, and the findings of the setup presented in this study can have broad implications, ranging from self-organization and mechanical pattern formation in biological systems to questions about the origin of life.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Diffusion Sampling: Efficient Rare Event Sampling and Free Energy Calculation with Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16634v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rare-event sampling problem has long been the central limiting factor in molecular dynamics (MD), especially in biomolecular simulation. Recently, diffusion models such as BioEmu have emerged as powerful equilibrium samplers that generate independent samples from complex molecular distributions, eliminating the cost of sampling rare transition events. However, a sampling problem remains when computing observables that rely on states which are rare in equilibrium, for example folding free energies. Here, we introduce enhanced diffusion sampling, enabling efficient exploration of rare-event regions while preserving unbiased thermodynamic estimators. The key idea is to perform quantitatively accurate steering protocols to generate biased ensembles and subsequently recover equilibrium statistics via exact reweighting. We instantiate our framework in three algorithms: UmbrellaDiff (umbrella sampling with diffusion models), $\Delta$G-Diff (free-energy differences via tilted ensembles), and MetaDiff (a batchwise analogue for metadynamics). Across toy systems, protein folding landscapes and folding free energies, our methods achieve fast, accurate, and scalable estimation of equilibrium properties within GPU-minutes to hours per system -- closing the rare-event sampling gap that remained after the advent of diffusion-model equilibrium samplers.</description>

      <title>Threshold sensing yields optimal path formation in Physarum polycephalum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12347v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The model organism Physarum polycephalum is known to perform decentralised problem solving despite absence of nervous system. Experimental evidence and modelling studies have linked these abilities, and in particular maze-solving, to some sort of memory and adaptation. However, despite compelling hypotheses, it is still not clear whether the tasks are solved optimally, and which key dynamical mechanisms enable Physarum's impressive abilities. Here, we employ a circuital network model for the foraging behaviour of Physarum polycephalum to prove that threshold sensing yields the emergence of unique and optimal paths that connect food sources and solve mazes. We also prove which conditions lead to alternative paths, thus elucidating how the organism achieves flexibility and adaptation in a self-organised manner. These findings are aligned with experimental evidences and provide insight into the evolution of primitive intelligence. Our results can also inspire the development of threshold-based algorithms for computing applications.</description>

      <title>Low Photon Number Non-Invasive Imaging Through Time-Varying Diffusers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18072v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Optical imaging plays a crucial role in advancing science and technology, enabling applications in fields ranging from biomedicine to astronomy. However, imaging through scattering media such as biological tissues, fog, or turbulent atmosphere remains a major challenge. Light scattering and absorption in such media make imaging challenging; in the case of time varying scatterers and low-light regime imaging has not been demonstrated so far. We present the first demonstration of non-invasive imaging of dim objects hidden behind dynamic scattering layers, obtaining robust reconstruction even at extremely low photon counts per frame. We achieve this by developing a new data-processing approach. In our experiment, we utilize a photon number resolving camera to capture a sequence of frames, containing on average, less than one photon per pixel. We validate our approach in microscopy, where we reconstruct images of biological samples stained with standard fluorescent dyes. Beyond microscopy, our approach can be applied in LIDAR systems for imaging through fog, and endoscopy using multimode and multicore fibers.</description>

      <title>Nonequilibrium Theory for Adaptive Systems in Varying Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19018v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Biological organisms are adaptive, able to function in unpredictably changing environments. Drawing on recent nonequilibrium physics, we show that in adaptation, fitness has two components parameterized by observable coordinates: a static Generalism component characterized by state distributions, and a dynamic Tracking component sustained by nonequilibrium fluxes. Our findings: (1) General Theory: We prove that tracking gain scales strictly with environmental variability and switching time-scales; near-static or fast-switching environments are not worth tracking. (2) Optimal Strategies: We explain optimal bet-hedging and phenotypic memory as the interplay between these components. (3) Control: We demonstrate, with an example, how to suppress pathogens by independently attacking their Generalism robustness (via environmental time fractions) and Tracking capabilities (via environmental switching speed). This work provides a physical framework for understanding and controlling adaptivity.</description>
