      <title>Commutators of Fractional Integrals with $\operatorname{BMO}^\beta$ Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study commutators of the Riesz potential $I_\alpha$ with functions $b$ in the capacitary space $\mathrm{BMO}^\beta(\mathbb{R}^n)$, defined through the Hausdorff content $\mathcal{H}^\beta_\infty$. We prove a Chanillo-type theorem characterising $\mathrm{BMO}^\beta(\mathbb{R}^n)$ via the boundedness of the commutator $[b,I_\alpha]$ on capacitary Lebesgue spaces. In addition, we obtain the endpoint estimate in the form of a capacitary modular weak-type inequality. These results follow from a pointwise estimate for the $\beta$-dimensional sharp maximal function of the commutator, together with a capacitary Fefferman-Stein inequality recently proved in [CC24].</description>

      <title>Exact formula on upper box dimension of generic H\"older level sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09749v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the previous decades, the size of level sets of functions have been extensively studied in various setups involving different regularity properties and size notions. In the case of H\"older functions, the authors have provided various bounds, but to date no explicit formulae have been found for any studied dimension and the results were valid only about very specific fractals. In this paper, for the first time, we have a result valid for a large class of self-similar sets, namely we prove that for these fractals Lebesgue almost every level set of the generic 1-H\"older-$\alpha$ function defined on $F\subseteq \mathbb{R}^p$ has upper box dimension $\dim_H F - \alpha$.</description>

      <title>Wiman-Valiron method for fractional derivatives and sharp growth estimates of $\alpha$-analytic solutions for linear fractional differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09990v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a fractional linear differential equation with successive derivatives given by $ \mathbb{D}_\alpha^{n}y+ p_{n-1}(x) \mathbb{D}_\alpha^{n-1}y+ \dots +p_{1}(x)\mathbb{D}_\alpha y+p_0(x)y=0$, where $\mathbb{D}_\alpha^{j}$ is the $j$th iteration of the Caputo-Djrbashian fractional derivative of order $\alpha&gt;0$, $p_j$ are $\alpha$-analytic functions for $0&lt;x^\alpha &lt;R$. Generalizing a result of Kilbas, Rivero Rodr\'iguez-Germ\'a and Trujillo, we prove the existence and uniqueness of the corresponding Cauchy problem in the class of $\alpha$-analytic functions. We establish an exact growth order for the solution when $p_j(x)=P_j(x^\alpha)$, where $P_j$ are polynomials, and $p_0$ dominates in some sense. This is the full counterpart of the classical case of ordinary differential equations. In particular, we demonstrate the sharpness of Kochubei's result and generalize it. To achieve this, we extend the Wiman-Valiron theory to analytic functions and the Djrbashian-Gelfond-Leontiev generalized fractional derivatives.</description>

      <title>Self-adjoint extensions of symmetric relations associated with systems of ordinary differential equations with distributional coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09152v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the extension theory for the two-dimensional first-order system $Ju' +qu = wf$ of differential equations on the real interval $(a,b)$ where $J$ is a constant, invertible, skew-hermitian matrix and $q$ and $w$ are matrices whose entries are real distributions of order $0$ with $q$ hermitian and $w$ non-negative. Specifically, we characterize the boundary conditions for solutions $u$ in the closure of the minimal relation, as well as describe the properties of quasi-boundary conditions which yield self-adjoint extensions. We then apply these ideas to a popular extension of non-negative minimal relations: the Krein-von Neumann extension. For more context on how the Krein-von Neumann is defined, an appendix shows a construction of the Friedrichs extension from which the Krein-von Neumann is traditionally defined.</description>

      <title>One-Sided and Parabolic BLO Spaces with Time Lag and Their Applications to Muckenhoupt $A_1$ Weights and Doubly Nonlinear Parabolic Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09741v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we first introduce the one-sided BLO space $\mathrm{BLO}^+(\mathbb{R})$ and characterize it, respectively, in terms of the one-sided Muckenhoupt class $A_1^+(\mathbb{R})$ and the one-sided John--Nirenberg inequality. Using these, we establish the Coifman--Rochberg type decomposition of $\mathrm{BLO}^+(\mathbb{R})$ functions and show that $\mathrm{BLO}^+(\mathbb{R})$ is independent of the distance between the two intervals, which further induces the characterization of this space in terms of the one-sided BMO space $\mathrm{BMO}^+(\mathbb{R})$ (the Bennett type lemma). As applications, we prove that any $\mathrm{BMO}^+(\mathbb{R})$ function can split into the sum of two $\mathrm{BLO}^+(\mathbb{R})$ functions and we provide an explicit description of the distance from $\mathrm{BLO}^+(\mathbb{R})$ functions to $L^\infty(\mathbb{R})$. Finally, as a higher-dimensional analogue we introduce the parabolic BLO space $\mathrm{PBLO}_\gamma^-(\mathbb{R}^{n+1})$ with time lag, and we extend all the above one-dimensional results to $\mathrm{PBLO}_\gamma^-(\mathbb{R}^{n+1})$; furthermore, as applications, we not only establish the relationships between $\mathrm{PBLO}_\gamma^-(\mathbb{R}^{n+1})$ and the solutions of doubly nonlinear parabolic equations, but also provide a necessary condition for the negative logarithm of the parabolic distance function to belong to $\mathrm{PBLO}_\gamma^-(\mathbb{R}^{n+1})$ in terms of the weak porosity of the set.</description>

      <title>Multiple convolutions and multilinear fractal Fourier extension estimates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08568v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The classical Stein--Tomas theorem extends the theory of linear Fourier restriction estimates from smooth manifolds to fractal measures exhibiting Fourier decay. In the multilinear setting, transversality allows for Fourier extension estimates that go beyond those implied by the linear theory to hold. We establish a multilinear Fourier extension estimate for measures whose convolution belongs to an $L^p$ space, applicable to known results by Shmerkin and Solomyak that exploit `transversality' between self-similar measures. Moreover, we generalise work by Hambrook--{\L}aba and Chen from the linear setting to obtain Knapp-type examples for multilinear estimates; we obtain two necessary conditions: one in terms of the upper box dimension of the measures' supports, and another one in terms of their Fourier decay and a ball condition. In particular, these conditions give a more restrictive range compared with previously known results whenever the convolution of the measures at play is singular.</description>

      <title>Tracking controllability for finite-dimensional linear systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18641v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a functional-analytic characterization of output tracking controllability for finite-dimensional linear systems. By formulating tracking as the surjectivity of the control-to-output map on suitable trajectory spaces, we show that exact tracking is equivalent to a nonstandard observability inequality for the adjoint dynamics. This characterization enables a Hilbert Uniqueness Method (HUM) type variational construction of minimum-norm tracking controls and makes explicit the intrinsic regularity requirements on reference trajectories induced by the system dynamics and the output operator. The same framework also yields a natural notion of approximate tracking when exact tracking fails. We provide explicit formulas in the scalar case and report numerical experiments for ODEs and semi-discretized PDEs, demonstrating the method for both smooth and non-smooth targets.</description>

      <title>Perfectly transparent boundary conditions and wave propagation in lattice Boltzmann schemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10066v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Systems of N = 1, 2, . . . first-order hyperbolic conservation laws feature N undamped waves propagating at finite speeds. On their own hand, multi-step Finite Difference and lattice Boltzmann schemes with q = N + 1, N + 2, . . . unknowns involve N ''physical'' waves, which are aimed at being as closely-looking as possible to the ones of the PDEs, and q-N ''numerical-spurious-parasitic'' waves, which are subject to their own speed of propagation, and either damped or undamped. The whole picture is even more complicated in the discrete setting-as numerical schemes act as dispersive media, thus propagate different harmonics at different phase (and group) velocities. For compelling practical reasons, simulations must always be conducted on bounded domains, even when the target problem is unbounded in space. The importance of transparent boundary conditions, preventing artificial boundaries from acting as mirrors producing polluting ricochets, naturally follows. This work presents, building on Besse, Coulombel, and Noble [ESAIM: M2AN, 55 (2021)], a systematic way of developing perfectly transparent boundary conditions for lattice Boltzmann schemes tackling linear problems in one and two space dimensions. Our boundary conditions are ''perfectly'' transparent, at least for 1D problems, as they absorb both physical and spurious waves regardless of their frequency. After presenting, in a simple framework, several approaches to handle the fact that q &gt; N , we elect the so-called ''scalar'' approach (which despite its name, also works when N &gt; 1) as method of choice for more involved problems. This method solely relies on computing the coefficients of the Laurent series at infinity of the roots of the dispersion relation of the bulk scheme. We insist on asymptotics for these coefficients in the spirit of analytic combinatorics. The reason is two-fold: asymptotics guide truncation of boundary conditions to make them depending on a fixed number of past time-steps, and make it clearduring the process of computing coefficients-whether intermediate quantities can be safely stored using floating-point arithmetic or not. Numerous numerical investigations in 1D and 2D with N = 1 and 2 are carried out, and show the effectiveness of the proposed boundary conditions.</description>
