      <title>Local Basis Transformation to Mitigate Negative Sign Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18069v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) methods for the frustrated quantum spin systems occasionally suffer from the negative sign problem, which makes simulations exponentially harder for larger systems at lower temperatures and severely limits QMC's application across a wide range of spin systems. This problem is known to depend on the choice of representation basis. We propose a systematic approach for mitigating the sign problem independent of the given Hamiltonian or lattice structure. We first introduce the concept of negativity to characterize the severity of the negative sign problem. We then demonstrate the existence of a locally defined quantity, the L1 adaptive loss function, which effectively approximates negativity, especially in frustration-free systems. Using the proposed loss function, we demonstrate that optimizing the representation basis can mitigate the negative sign. This is evidenced by several frustration-free models and other important quantum spin systems. Furthermore, we compare the effectiveness of unitary transformations against the standard orthogonal transformation and reveal that unitary transformations can effectively mitigate the sign problem in certain cases.</description>

      <title>Tensor network state methods and quantum information theory for strongly correlated molecular systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18263v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A brief pedagogical overview of recent advances in tensor network state methods are presented that have the potential to broaden their scope of application radically for strongly correlated molecular systems. These include global fermionic mode optimization, i.e., a general approach to find an optimal matrix product state (MPS) parametrization of a quantum many-body wave function with the minimum number of parameters for a given error margin, the restricted active space DMRG-RAS-X method, multi-orbital correlations and entanglement, developments on hybrid CPU-multiGPU parallelization, and an efficient treatment of non-Abelian symmetries on high-performance computing (HPC) infrastructures. Scaling analysis on NVIDIA DGX-A100 platform is also presented.</description>

      <title>Disentangling real space fluctuations: the diagnostics of metal-insulator transitions beyond single-particle spectral functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18325v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The destruction of metallicity due to the mutual Coulomb interaction of quasiparticles gives rise to fascinating phenomena of solid state physics such as the Mott metal-insulator transition and the pseudogap. A key observable characterizing their occurrences is the single-particle spectral function, determined by the fermionic self-energy. In this paper we investigate in detail how real space fluctuations are responsible for a self-energy that drives the Mott-Hubbard metal-insulator transition. To this aim we first introduce a real space fluctuation diagnostics approach to the Hedin equation, which connects the fermion-boson coupling vertex $\lambda$ to the self-energy $\Sigma$. Second, by using cellular dynamical mean-field theory calculations for $\lambda$ we identify the leading physical processes responsible for the destruction of metallicity across the transition.</description>

      <title>Interplay of $d$- and $p$-States in RbTi$_3$Bi$_5$ and CsTi$_3$Bi$_5$ Flat-Band Kagome Metals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18389v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Shifting the Fermi level of the celebrated $AM_3X_5$ (135) compounds into proximity of flat bands strongly enhances electronic correlations and severely affects the formation of density waves and superconductivity. Our broadband infrared spectroscopy measurements of RbTi$_3$Bi$_5$ and CsTi$_3$Bi$_5$ combined with density-functional band-structure calculations reveal that the correlated Ti $d$-states are intricately coupled with the Bi $p$-states that form a tilted Dirac crossing. Electron-phonon coupling manifests itself in the strong damping of itinerant carriers and in the anomalous shape of the phonon line in RbTi$_3$Bi$_5$. An anomaly in these spectral features around 150 K can be paralleled to the onset of nematicity detected by low-temperature probes. Our findings show that the materials with low band filling open unexplored directions in the physics of kagome metals and involve electronic states of different nature strongly coupled with lattice dynamics.</description>

      <title>Non-Hermitian catalysis of density-wave orders on Euclidean and hyperbolic lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18591v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Depending on the lattice geometry, the nearest-neighbor (NN) tight-binding model for free fermions gives rise to particle-hole symmetric emergent Dirac liquid, Fermi liquid, and flat bands near the half-filling or zero-energy on bipartite Euclidean and hyperbolic lattices, respectively embedded on the flat and negatively curved spaces. Such noninteracting electronic fluids are characterized by a vanishing, a finite, and a diverging density of states near half-filling, respectively. A non-Hermitian generalization of this scenario resulting from an imbalance of the hopping amplitudes in the opposite directions between any pair of NN sites continues to accommodate a real eigenvalue spectrum over an extended non-Hermitian parameter regime. Most importantly, it reduces the band width without altering the characteristic scaling of the density of states close to the zero-energy. Here, we show that on two-dimensional bipartite Euclidean and hyperbolic lattices such a non-Hermiticity catalyzes the formation of both charge-density-wave and spin-density-wave orders at weaker (in comparison to the counterparts in conventional or Hermitian systems) NN Coulomb and on-site Hubbard repulsions, respectively. These two ordered states correspond to staggered patterns of average electronic density and spin between the NN sites, respectively, and both cause insulation in half-filled systems. We arrive at these conclusions by combining biorthogonal quantum mechanics and lattice-based self-consistent numerical mean-field analysis in the Hartree channel. We discuss the scaling of the associated mass gaps near the zero-energy with the non-Hermitian parameter, and also address the finite size scaling of the order parameters specifically on hyperbolic lattices with open boundary conditions. A robust general mathematical criterion for the proposed non-Hermitian catalysis mechanism for ordered phases is showcased.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.13197v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove a conjectured relation between the energy-momentum and the displacement norm of superconformal defects. The proof completes earlier results, and shows that supersymmetry identifies two natural notions of brane tension in Anti-de Sitter gravity. As a byproduct we show that a modification of the energy-momentum tensor that removes the stress of static superconformal defects, ensures also that the radiation these emit obeys the Null Energy Condition. This sheds new light on the radiation-reaction problem for moving charges.</description>

      <title>Engineering of Anyons on M5-Probes via Flux Quantization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17927v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: These extended lecture notes survey a novel derivation of anyonic topological order (as seen in fractional quantum Hall systems) on single magnetized M5-branes probing Seifert orbi-singularities ("geometric engineering" of anyons), which we motivate from fundamental open problems in the field of quantum computing.
  The rigorous construction is non-Lagrangian and non-perturbative, based on previously neglected global completion of the M5-brane's tensor field by flux-quantization consistent with its non-linear self-duality and its twisting by the bulk C-field. This exists only in little-studied non-abelian generalized cohomology theories, notably in a twisted equivariant (and "twistorial") form of unstable Cohomotopy ("Hypothesis H").
  As a result, topological quantum observables form Pontrjagin homology algebras of mapping spaces from the orbi-fixed worldvolume into a classifying 2-sphere. Remarkably, results from algebraic topology imply from this the quantum observables and modular functor of abelian Chern-Simons theory, as well as braid group actions on defect anyons of the kind envisioned as hardware for topologically protected quantum gates.</description>

      <title>String Breaking in a $2+1$D $\mathbb{Z}_2$ Lattice Gauge Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17929v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: String breaking is an intriguing phenomenon crucial to the understanding of lattice gauge theories (LGTs), with strong relevance to both condensed matter and high-energy physics (HEP). Recent experiments investigating string breaking in $2+1$D (two spatial and one temporal dimensions) LGTs motivate a thorough analysis of its underlying mechanisms. Here, we perform matrix product state (MPS) simulations of string breaking in an experimentally relevant $2+1$D $\mathbb{Z}_2$ LGT in the presence of two external charges. We provide a detailed description of the system in the confined phase, highlight a number of mechanisms which are responsible for string breaking, and argue that magnetic fluctuations have a stabilizing effect on the strings. Moreover, we show that deep in the confined regime the problem is dual to one-dimensional free fermions hopping on an open chain. Our work elucidates the microscopic processes of string breaking in $2+1$D LGTs, and our findings can be probed on current superconducting-qubit quantum computers.</description>

      <title>On the mean-field antiferromagnetic gap for the half-filled 2D Hubbard model at zero temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18141v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the antiferromagnetic gap for the half-filled two-dimensional (2D) Hubbard model (on a square lattice) at zero temperature in Hartree-Fock theory. It was conjectured by Hirsch in 1985 that this gap, $\Delta$, vanishes like $\exp(-2\pi\sqrt{t/U})$ in the weak-coupling limit $U/t\downarrow 0$ ($U&gt;0$ and $t&gt;0$ are the usual Hubbard model parameters). We give a proof of this conjecture based on recent mathematical results about Hartree-Fock theory for the 2D Hubbard model. The key step is the exact computation of an integral involving the density of states of the 2D tight binding band relation.</description>

      <title>Competition between excitonic insulators and quantum Hall states in correlated electron-hole bilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18168v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Excitonic insulators represent a unique quantum phase of matter, providing a rich ground for studying exotic quantum bosonic states. Strongly coupled electron-hole bilayers, which host stable dipolar exciton fluids with an exciton density that can be adjusted electrostatically, offer an ideal platform to investigate correlated excitonic insulators. Based on electron-hole bilayers made of MoSe2/hBN/WSe2 heterostructures, here we study the behavior of excitonic insulators in a perpendicular magnetic field. We report the observation of excitonic quantum oscillations in both Coulomb drag signals and electrical resistance at low to medium magnetic fields. Under a strong magnetic field, we identify multiple quantum phase transitions between the excitonic insulator phase and the bilayer quantum Hall insulator phase. These findings underscore the interplay between the electron-hole interactions and Landau level quantization that opens new possibilities for exploring quantum phenomena in composite bosonic insulators.</description>

      <title>Interlayer phase coherence and composite fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18254v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The fractional quantum Hall effect (FQHE) realized in two-dimensional electron systems is explained by the emergent composite fermions (CF) out of ordinary electrons. It is possible to write down explicit wavefunctions explaining many if not all FQHE states. In bilayer systems there is a regime at integer filling of the lowest Landau level that displays a spontaneous breakdown of the U(1) relative phase between the two layers. This can be seen as interlayer phase coherence (ILC) in terms of electrons. Recent experiments in double layer samples of graphene have revealed the appearance of many FQHE states unique to the bilayer case. We discuss extensions of the CF idea in this situation as well as the possible existence of ILC of CFs.</description>

      <title>Magnetism and hidden quantum geometry in charge neutral twisted trilayer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18491v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Here we present a theory of mirror-symmetric magic angle twisted trilayer graphene. The electronic properties are described by a Hubbard model with long range tunneling matrix elements. The electronic properties are obtained by solving the mean field Hubbard model. We obtain the bandstructure with characteristic flat bands and a Dirac cone. At charge neutrality, turning on electron-electron interactions results in metallic to antiferomagnetic phase transition, for Hubbard interaction strength considerably smaller than in other graphene multilayers. We analyze the stability of the antiferromagnetic state against the symmetry breaking induced by hexagonal boron nitride encapsulation, and mirror symmetry breaking caused by the application of electric fields that mix the Dirac cone with the flat bands. Additionally, we explore the topological properties of the system, revealing a hidden quantum geometry. Despite the flat bands having zero Chern numbers, the multiband Berry curvature distribution over the moir\'e Brillouin zone exhibits a non-trivial structure. Finally, we propose a mechanism to tune this quantum geometry, providing a pathway to control the system's topological properties.</description>

Abstract: Fractons, excitations with restricted mobility, have emerged as a novel paradigm in high-energy and condensed matter physics, revealing deep connections to gauge theories and gravity. Here, we propose a tensorial generalization of electromagnetic duality using a doubled-potential framework with two symmetric tensor gauge fields. This approach symmetrically describes electric and magnetic sectors, introducing covariant magnetic fractons with reduced mobility and supporting a genuine fractonic self-duality. Notably, we find the absence of a Witten-like effect in the covariant fractonic case, precluding the emergence of fractonic dyons.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.15862v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Correlated topological materials often maintain a delicate balance among physical symmetries: many topological orders are symmetry protected, while most correlated phenomena arise from spontaneous symmetry breaking. It is rare to find cases where symmetry breaking induces a non-trivial topological phase. Here, we present the discovery of such a phase in Ta2Pd3Te5, where Coulomb interactions form excitons, which condense below 100 K, opening a topological gap and creating a topological excitonic insulator. Our spectroscopy reveals the full spectral bulk gap stemming from exciton condensation. This excitonic insulator state spontaneously breaks mirror symmetries but involves a very weak structural coupling, as indicated by photoemission spectroscopy, thermodynamic measurements, and a detailed structural analysis. Notably, scanning tunneling microscopy uncovers gapless boundary modes in the bulk insulating phase. Their magnetic field response, together with theoretical modeling, suggests a topological origin. These observations establish Ta2Pd3Te5 as the first confirmed topological excitonic insulator in a three-dimensional crystal. This allows to access the associated physics through bulk-sensitive techniques. Furthermore, we uncover another surprising aspect of the topological excitonic insulator, a secondary excitonic instability near 5 K that breaks the translational symmetry. The wavevector of this state shows an unprecedented magnetic field tunability. Thus, we unveil a unique sequence of topological exciton condensations in a bulk crystal, offering new opportunities to study critical behavior and excitations.</description>

Abstract: We provide the phase diagram of a 2-parameter spin-1 chain that has a symmetry-protected topological (SPT) Haldane phase using computational algorithms along with tensor-network tools. We improve previous results, showing the existence of a new phase and new triple points. New striking features are the triple end of the Haldane phase and the complexity of phases bordering the Haldane phase in proximity allowing moving to nearby non-SPT phases via small perturbations. These characteristics make the system, which appears in Rydberg excitons, e.g. in Cu$_2$O, a prime candidate for applications.</description>

      <title>Imaging of electrically controlled van der Waals layer stacking in 1T-TaS2</title>

Abstract: Van der Waals (vdW) materials exhibit a variety of states that can be switched with low power at low temperatures, offering a viable cryogenic "flash memory" required for the classical control electronics for solid-state quantum information processing. In 1T-TaS2, a non-volatile metallic 'hidden' state can be induced from an insulating equilibrium charge-density wave ground state using either optical or electrical pulses. Given that conventional memristors form localized, filamentary channels which support the current, a key question for design concerns the geometry of the conduction region in highly energy-efficient 1T-TaS2 devices. Here, we report in operando micro-beam X-ray diffraction, fluorescence, and concurrent transport measurements, allowing us to spatially image the non-thermal hidden state induced by electrical switching of 1T-TaS2. Our results reveal a long-range ordered, non-filamentary switched state that extends well below the electrodes, implying that the self-organized, collective growth of the hidden phase is driven by a combination of charge flow and lattice strain. Our unique combination of techniques showcases the potential of non-destructive, three-dimensional X-ray imaging to study bulk switching properties in microscopic detail, namely electrical control of the vdW layer stacking.</description>

      <title>Advancing Natural Orbital Functional Calculations Through Deep Learning-Inspired Techniques for Large-Scale Strongly Correlated Electron Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18493v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Natural orbital functional (NOF) theory offers a promising approach for studying strongly correlated systems at an affordable computational cost, with an accuracy comparable to highly demanding wavefunction-based methods. However, its widespread adoption in cases involving a large number of correlated electrons has been limited by the extensive iterations required for convergence. In this work, we present a disruptive approach that embeds the techniques used for optimization in deep learning within the NOF calculation, constituting a substantial advance in the scale of accessible systems. The revamped procedure is based on the adaptive momentum technique for orbital optimization, alternated with the optimization of the occupation numbers, significantly improving the computational feasibility of challenging calculations. This work represents a complete change in the size scale of the systems that can be reached using NOF theory. We demonstrate this with three examples that involve a large number of electrons: (i) the symmetric dissociation of a large hydrogen cluster, (ii) an analysis of occupancies distribution in fullerenes, and (iii) a study of the singlet-triplet energy gap in linear acenes. Notably, the hydrogen cluster calculation, featuring 1000 electrons, represents the largest NOF calculation performed to date and one of the largest strongly correlated electron calculations ever reported. This system, which serves as an ideal model for a strongly correlated Mott insulator, illustrates a metal-to-insulator transition where all electrons participate in the correlation phenomenon, offering insight in a unique challenge. We anticipate that this work will enable the practical application of NOFs to increasingly complex and intriguing systems, leveraging the method's inherent scalability and accuracy.</description>

      <title>Anomalous Lattice Effect Originated Metal-Insulator Transition in FeSe$_x$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12724v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive investigation of the structural, electrical transport, and magnetic properties of FeSe$_{\it{x}}$ ($\it{x}$ = 1.14, 1.18, 1.23, 1.28, and 1.32) to unravel the mechanism of the metal-insulator transition observed in these systems. For this, we systematically evaluated the structural parameters of FeSe$_{\it{x}}$ as a function of Se concentration and temperature. We observe increased lattice constants and cell volume with increased Se concentration. On the other hand, the temperature-dependent XRD studies suggest unusual lattice change around the metal-insulator (MI) transition temperature of the respective compositions. This remarkable observation suggests that the anomalous lattice effect originates the MI transition in these systems. Additionally, our density of states (DOS) calculations on FeSe$_{1.14}$ qualitatively explain the MI transition, as the low-temperature (50 K) structure DOS suggests a metallic nature and the high-temperature (300 K) structure DOS shows a gap near the Fermi level.</description>

      <title>Singularity and universality from von Neumann to R\'enyi entanglement entropy and disorder operator in Motzkin chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17368v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The R\'enyi entanglement entropy is widely used in studying quantum entanglement properties in strongly correlated systems, whose analytic continuation as $n \to 1$ is often believed to give rise to the celebrated von Neumann entanglement entropy. However, this process for the colored Motzkin spin chain exhibits a singularity that yields different scaling behaviors of $\sim \sqrt{l}$ and $\sim \log{l}$ for the von Neumann and R\'enyi entropies, respectively. It can be understood by the exponential increasing desity of states in its entanglement spectrum. We have also employed disorder operators under various symmetries to study such a system. The analytical and numerical results reveal that the scaling of disorder operators is also $\log{l}$ in the leading term, the same as the R\'enyi entanglement entropy. We propose that the coefficient of the term $\log{l}$ is a universal constant, both in R\'enyi entropies and disorder operators, which could be used to identify the constraint physics of Motzkin walks.</description>

      <title>Threefold Way for Typical Entanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11309v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A typical quantum state with no symmetry can be realized by letting a random unitary act on a fixed state, and the subsystem entanglement spectrum follows the Laguerre unitary ensemble (LUE). For integer-spin time reversal symmetry, we have an analogous scenario where we prepare a time-reversal symmetric state and let random orthogonal matrices act on it, leading to the Laguerre orthogonal ensemble (LOE). However, for half-integer-spin time reversal symmetry, a straightforward analogue leading to the Laguerre symplectic ensemble (LSE) is no longer valid due to that time reversal symmetric state is forbidden by the Kramers' theorem. We devise a system in which the global time reversal operator is fractionalized on the subsystems, and show that LSE arises in the system. Extending this idea, we incorporate general symmetry fractionalization into the system, and show that the statistics of the entanglement spectrum is decomposed into a direct sum of LOE, LUE, and/or LSE. Here, various degeneracies in the entanglement spectrum may appear, depending on the non-Abelian nature of the symmetry group and the cohomology class of the non-trivial projective representation on the subsystem. Our work establishes the entanglement counterpart of the Dyson's threefold way for Hamiltonians with symmetries.</description>

      <title>Flowery Horizons &amp; Bulk Observers: $sl^{(q)}(2,\mathbb{R})$ Drive in $2d$ Holographic CFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18536v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore and analyze bulk geometric aspects corresponding to a driven two-dimensional holographic CFT, where the drive Hamiltonian is constructed from the $sl^{(q)}(2,\mathbb{R})$ generators. In particular, we demonstrate that starting with a thermal initial state, the evolution of the event horizon is characterized by distinct geometric transformations in the bulk which are associated to the conjugacy classes of the corresponding transformations on the CFT. Namely, the bulk evolution of the horizon is geometrically classified into an oscillatory (non-heating) behaviour, an exponentially growing (heating) behaviour and a power-law growth with an angular rotation (the phase boundary), all as a function of the stroboscopic time. We also show that the explicit symmetry breaking of the drive is manifest in a flowery structure of the event horizon that displays a $U(1) \to {\mathbb Z}_q$ symmetry breaking. In the $q\to \infty$ limit, the $U(1)$ symmetry is effectively restored. Furthermore, by analyzing the integral curves generated by the asymptotic Killing vectors, we also demonstrate how the fixed points of these curves approximate a bulk Ryu-Takayanagi surface corresponding to a modular Hamiltonian for a sub-region in the CFT. Since the CFT modular Hamiltonian has an infinitely many in-equivalent extensions in the bulk, the fixed points of the integral curves can also lie outside the entanglement wedge of the CFT sub-region.</description>

      <title>Theory of Irreversibility in Quantum Many-Body Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06183v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We address the longstanding challenge in quantum many-body theory of reconciling unitary dynamics with irreversible relaxation. In classical chaos, the unitary evolution operator develops Ruelle-Pollicott (RP) resonances inside the unit circle in the continuum limit, leading to mixing. In the semiclassical limit, chaotic single-particle quantum systems relax with the same RP resonances. In contrast, the theory of quantum many-body RP resonances and their link to irreversibility remain underdeveloped. Here, we relate the spectral form factor to the sum of autocorrelation functions and, in generic many-body lattice systems without conservation laws, argue that all quantum many-body RP resonances converge inside the unit disk, highlighting the role of nonunitary and the thermodynamic limit. While we conjecture this picture to be general, we analytically prove the emergence of irreversibility in the random phase model (RPM), a paradigmatic Floquet quantum circuit model, in the limit of large local Hilbert space dimension. To this end, we couple it to local environments and compute the exact time evolution of autocorrelation functions, the dissipative form factor, and out-of-time-order correlation functions (OTOCs). Although valid for any dissipation strength, we then focus on weak dissipation to clarify the origin of irreversibility in unitary systems. When the dissipationless limit is taken after the thermodynamic limit, the unitary quantum map develops an infinite tower of decaying RP resonances -- chaotic systems display so-called anomalous relaxation. We also show that the OTOC in the RPM can undergo a two-stage relaxation and that during the second stage, the approach to the stationary value is again controlled by the leading RP resonance.
