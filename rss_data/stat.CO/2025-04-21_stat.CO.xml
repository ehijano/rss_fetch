      <title>Estimating equations for survival analysis with pooled logistic regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13291v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pooled logistic regression models are commonly applied in survival analysis. However, the standard implementation can be computationally demanding, which is further exacerbated when using the nonparametric bootstrap for inference. To ease these computational burdens, investigators often coarsen time intervals or assume a parametric models for time. These approaches impose restrictive assumptions, which may not always have a well-motivated substantive justification. Here, the pooled logistic regression model is re-framed using estimating equations to simplify computations and allow for inference via the empirical sandwich variance estimator, thus avoiding the more computationally demanding bootstrap. The proposed method is demonstrated using two examples with publicly available data. The performance of the empirical sandwich variance estimator is illustrated using a Monte Carlo simulation study. The implementation proposed here offers an improved alternative to the standard implementation of pooled logistic regression without needing to impose restrictive constraints on time.</description>

      <title>Gradient-Free Sequential Bayesian Experimental Design via Interacting Particle Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13320v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a gradient-free framework for Bayesian Optimal Experimental Design (BOED) in sequential settings, aimed at complex systems where gradient information is unavailable. Our method combines Ensemble Kalman Inversion (EKI) for design optimization with the Affine-Invariant Langevin Dynamics (ALDI) sampler for efficient posterior sampling-both of which are derivative-free and ensemble-based. To address the computational challenges posed by nested expectations in BOED, we propose variational Gaussian and parametrized Laplace approximations that provide tractable upper and lower bounds on the Expected Information Gain (EIG). These approximations enable scalable utility estimation in high-dimensional spaces and PDE-constrained inverse problems. We demonstrate the performance of our framework through numerical experiments ranging from linear Gaussian models to PDE-based inference tasks, highlighting the method's robustness, accuracy, and efficiency in information-driven experimental design.</description>

      <title>Deep literature reviews: an application of fine-tuned language models to migration research</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13685v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a hybrid framework for literature reviews that augments traditional bibliometric methods with large language models (LLMs). By fine-tuning open-source LLMs, our approach enables scalable extraction of qualitative insights from large volumes of research content, enhancing both the breadth and depth of knowledge synthesis. To improve annotation efficiency and consistency, we introduce an error-focused validation process in which LLMs generate initial labels and human reviewers correct misclassifications. Applying this framework to over 20000 scientific articles about human migration, we demonstrate that a domain-adapted LLM can serve as a "specialist" model - capable of accurately selecting relevant studies, detecting emerging trends, and identifying critical research gaps. Notably, the LLM-assisted review reveals a growing scholarly interest in climate-induced migration. However, existing literature disproportionately centers on a narrow set of environmental hazards (e.g., floods, droughts, sea-level rise, and land degradation), while overlooking others that more directly affect human health and well-being, such as air and water pollution or infectious diseases. This imbalance highlights the need for more comprehensive research that goes beyond physical environmental changes to examine their ecological and societal consequences, particularly in shaping migration as an adaptive response. Overall, our proposed framework demonstrates the potential of fine-tuned LLMs to conduct more efficient, consistent, and insightful literature reviews across disciplines, ultimately accelerating knowledge synthesis and scientific discovery.</description>

      <title>Granger Causality in High-Dimensional Networks of Time Series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02360v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A novel approach is developed for discovering directed connectivity between specified pairs of nodes in a high-dimensional network (HDN) of brain signals. To accurately identify causal connectivity for such specified objectives, it is necessary to properly address the influence of all other nodes within the network. The proposed procedure herein starts with the estimation of a low-dimensional representation of the other nodes in the network utilizing (frequency-domain-based) spectral dynamic principal component analysis (sDPCA). The resulting scores can then be removed from the nodes of interest, thus eliminating the confounding effect of other nodes within the HDN. Accordingly, causal interactions can be dissected between nodes that are isolated from the effects of the network. Extensive simulations have demonstrated the effectiveness of this approach as a tool for causality analysis in complex time series networks. The proposed methodology has also been shown to be applicable to multichannel EEG networks.</description>
