      <title>Physics-informed Neural Model Predictive Control of Interacting Active Brownian Particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18809v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Active matter systems, composed of self-propelled agents that convert energy into directed motion, exhibit a wide range of emergent behaviors, such as motility-induced phase separation, flocking, and swarming. These phenomena, observed across natural and engineered systems, hold immense potential for applications in programmable materials, directed assembly, and micro-robotics. However, precisely controlling their macroscopic continuum fields, e.g., density or flux, remains a significant challenge due to the complexity of multibody interactions and correlated particle dynamics. To address this challenge, we present a framework that combines physics-informed machine learning with Model Predictive Control. Our approach learns a closure model for complex particle interactions while incorporating known physical principles, resulting in an accurate predictive model suitable for real-time control. By integrating this model into a Model Predictive Control framework, we enable systematic optimization of control actions that can guide the system toward desired macroscopic behaviors. Through two illustrative examples, we showcase the versatility of the framework. First, we control the spatial distribution of particles by splitting them into two groups and dynamically juggling their densities. Second, we simultaneously control both the number density and the mean flux, guiding the latter to follow a prescribed sinusoidal profile. These results highlight the framework's potential to systematically control complex dynamics in active matter systems and provide a foundation for broader applications in programmable and adaptive materials.</description>

      <title>BARCODE: Biomaterial Activity Readouts to Categorize, Optimize, Design and Engineer for high throughput screening and characterization of dynamically restructuring soft materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18822v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Active, responsive, nonequilibrium materials, at the forefront of materials engineering, offer dynamical restructuring, mobility and other complex life-like properties. Yet, this enhanced functionality comes with significant amplification of the size and complexity of the datasets needed to characterize their properties, thereby challenging conventional approaches to analysis. To meet this need, we present BARCODE (Biomaterial Activity Readouts to Categorize, Optimize, Design and Engineer), an open-access software that automates high throughput screening of microscopy video data to enable nonequilibrium material optimization and discovery. BARCODE produces a unique fingerprint or barcode of performance metrics that visually and quantitatively encodes dynamic material properties with minimal file size. Using three complementary material agnostic analysis branches, BARCODE significantly reduces data dimensionality and size, while providing rich, multiparametric outputs and rapid tractable characterization of activity and structure. We analyze a series of datasets of cytoskeleton networks and cell monolayers to demonstrate the ability of BARCODE to accelerate and streamline screening and analysis, reveal unexpected correlations and emergence, and enable broad non-expert data access, comparison, and sharing.</description>

      <title>Synthesis of spherical mesoporous silica beads with tunable size, stiffness and porosity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18947v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an innovative template-free water-based sol-gel method to produce uniform mesoporous silica beads of millimeter size, which have tunable size, stiffness and porosity, and could be used for adsorption applications. Our protocol exploits an in-situ enzymatic reaction to produce spherical beads of hydrogel from a charge-stabilized suspension of silica nanoparticles confined in a millimetric drop suspended in a non-miscible oil. Once the gelation step is complete, the spherical bead of gel is cleaned from oil and deposited onto a hydrophobic surface and let dry. Separating the gelation to the drying steps ensures a spatially uniform gel and allows us to perform a solvent exchange before drying. For all beads, we observe a crack-free drying process leading to the formation of stiff quasi-spherical beads with diameter in the range 1 to 5 mm and Young modulus in the range $(0.1-2)$ GPa and narrow pore size distribution, centered around $10$ to $25$ nm depending on the experimental conditions. Finally, to demonstrate the potentiality of these materials, we graft on the bead surface aminosilane molecules, and quantify their CO$_2$ adsorption efficiency. Overall, the production method we have developed is simple, readily adaptable, and offers promising materials for adsorption, storage, catalysis and chromatography.</description>

      <title>Impact of Nanoscopic Impurity Aggregates on Cavitation in Water</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19039v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The stability of water against cavitation under negative pressures is a phenomenon known for considerable discrepancies between theoretical predictions and experimental observations. Using a combination of molecular dynamics simulations and classical nucleation theory, we explore how nanoscopic hydrocarbon droplets influence cavitation in water. Our findings reveal that while a macroscopic volume of absolutely pure water withstands up to -120 MPa of tension, introducing a single nanoscopic oil droplet, merely a few nanometers in radius, brings this cavitation threshold to around -30 MPa, closely matching the values typically observed in highly controlled experiments. The unavoidable presence of nanoscopic hydrophobic impurities, even in highly purified water used in experiments, imposes a practical limit on achieving the theoretical tensile strength in realistic settings. More broadly, our study highlights the profound impact of nonpolar residues on nucleation phenomena and enhances our understanding of metastability in real-world systems.</description>

      <title>Mechanical Properties of the Meninges: Large Language Model Assisted Systematic Review of over 25,000 Studies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19359v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate constitutive models and corresponding mechanical property values for the meninges are important for predicting mechanical damage to brain tissue due to traumatic brain injury. The meninges are often oversimplified in current finite element (FE) head models due to their complex anatomy and spatially-variant mechanical behavior. This study performed a systematic review (SR) on the mechanical properties of each individual layer of the meninges to obtain benchmark data for FE modeling and to identify gaps in the current literature. Relevant studies were filtered through three stages: a broad initial search filter, a large language model classifier, and manual verification by a human reviewer. Out of over 25,000 studies initially considered, this review ultimately included 47 studies on the dura mater, 8 on the arachnoid mater, and 7 on the pia mater, representing the largest and most comprehensive SR on the mechanical properties of the meninges. Each layer was found to exhibit nonlinear rate dependence that varies with species, age, location, and orientation. This study revealed that the elastic modulus of pia mater most often used in simplified linear elastic FE models is likely underestimated by an order of magnitude and fails to consider directional dependence. Future studies investigating the mechanical properties of the meninges should focus on a wider range of loading rates as well as age effects for the arachnoid mater and pia mater, as these features are relatively understudied and expected to affect the fidelity of FE predictions.</description>

      <title>Hydrated Cable Bacteria Exhibit Protonic Conductivity Over Long Distances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18651v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study presents the direct measurement of proton transport along filamentous Desulfobulbaceae, or cable bacteria. Cable bacteria are filamentous multicellular microorganisms that have garnered much interest due to their ability to serve as electrical conduits, transferring electrons over several millimeters. Our results indicate that cable bacteria can also function as protonic conduits because they contain proton wires that transport protons at distances greater than 100 um. We find that protonic conductivity ({\sigma}P) along cable bacteria varies between samples and is measured as high as 114 +/- 28 uS cm^-1 at 25-degrees C and 70-percent relative humidity (RH). For cable bacteria, the protonic conductance (GP) and {\sigma}P are dependent upon the RH, increasing by as much as 26-fold between 60-percent and 80-percent RH. This observation implies that proton transport occurs via the Grotthuss mechanism along water associated with cable bacteria, forming proton wires. In order to determine {\sigma}P and GP along cable bacteria, we implemented a protocol using a modified transfer-printing technique to deposit either palladium interdigitated protodes (IDP), palladium transfer length method (TLM) protodes, or gold interdigitated electrodes(IDE) on top of cable bacteria. Due to the relatively mild nature of the transfer-printing technique, this method should be applicable to a broad array of biological samples and curved materials. The observation of protonic conductivity in cable bacteria presents possibilities for investigating the importance of long-distance proton transport in microbial ecosystems and to potentially build biotic or biomimetic scaffolds to interface with materials via proton-mediated gateways or channels.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional chiral active Ornstein-Uhlenbeck model for helical motion of microorganisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18927v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Active movement is essential for the survival of microorganisms like bacteria, algae and unicellular parasites, for example the ones causing the disease malaria. In three dimensions, both swimming and gliding microorganisms often exhibit helical trajectories. Here we introduce a stochastic dynamics model for chiral self-propelled particles, for which both propulsion force and torque are internally generated, the latter stochastically by an Ornstein Uhlenbeck process. We demonstrate that a truncated version of the full model can be solved analytically, in very good agreement with computer simulations for the full model. Our main result is that this model allows for larger long-time mean squared displacements for helical compared to straight 3D movement at the same speed, suggesting an evolutionary benefit of the often observed helical movements of microorganisms, and opposite to the reduction of diffusion caused by chirality in 2D. We then provide an experimental example by analyzing imaging data for malaria parasites that glide through hydrogels on helical trajectories.</description>

      <title>Optimal constrained control for generally damped Brownian heat engines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19124v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate maximum power and efficiency protocols for cyclic heat engines based on a generally damped Brownian particle confined in a harmonic potential, subject to experimentally motivated constraints on the potential stiffness and bath temperature. These constraints render traditional geometric and mass transport methods inapplicable, as they rely on fixed control or response parameters at specific points in the cycle. Instead, we develop an iterative algorithm grounded in optimal control theory, enabling simultaneous optimization of cycle time and the time-dependent variations of stiffness and temperature. We validate the algorithm against analytical results in the deeply overdamped regime and extend its application to systems with general damping rates. As the damping rate decreases from a deeply overdamped to a deeply underdamped regime, the maximum power diminishes to zero, and the corresponding cycle time diverges. For a fixed cycle time, the maximum efficiency exhibits a comparable trend. In the generally damped regime, the stiffness and temperature protocols display intricate, non-monotonic features, in stark contrast to the simpler patterns observed in extreme damping limits. Furthermore, optimizing the temperature profile significantly enhances efficiency, particularly in intermediate damping regimes. Our findings demonstrate how experimental constraints fundamentally influence optimal control protocols.</description>

      <title>Reactive Fluid Ferroelectrics: A Gateway to the Next Generation of Ferroelectric Liquid Crystalline Polymer Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19333v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Herein we report the first examples of reactive mesogenic materials (RMs) which exhibit fluid ferroelectric order based on the recently discovered ferroelectric nematic (NF) phase. We term these materials NF RMs and they provide the first steps towards the next generation of ferroelectric liquid crystalline polymer networks. We report the chemical synthesis and characterisation of the liquid crystalline properties of these materials, demonstrating that they have the lowest longitudinal molecular dipole moments of any reported NF material of 7.39 D. We go on to demonstrate a potential use case of this new class of reactive material through the polymer stabilisation of a matrix which exhibits the NF phase, increasing the phase range of the ferroelectric phase from 75 {\deg}C to 120 {\deg}C. The NF RMs reported herein are an exciting step forward in ferroelectric liquid crystal research, demonstrating that reactive NF materials are achievable, allowing for the future development of liquid crystalline ferroelectric networks, elastomers and polymers.</description>

      <title>Topological Linking Determines Elasticity in Limited Valence Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.09689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.09689v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding the relationship between the microscopic structure and topology of a material and its macroscopic properties is a fundamental challenge across a wide range of systems. Here, we investigate the viscoelasticity of DNA nanostar hydrogels - a model system for physical networks with limited valence - by coupling rheology measurements, confocal imaging and molecular dynamics simulations. We discover that these networks display a large degree of interpenetration and that loops within the network are topologically linked, forming a percolating network-within-network structure. Below overlapping concentration, the fraction of branching points and the pore size determine the high-frequency elasticity of these physical gels. At higher concentrations, we discover that this elastic response is dictated by the abundance of topological links between looped motifs in the gel. Our findings highlight the emergence of "topological elasticity" as a previously overlooked mechanism in generic network-forming liquids and gels and inform the design of topologically-controllable material behaviours.</description>
