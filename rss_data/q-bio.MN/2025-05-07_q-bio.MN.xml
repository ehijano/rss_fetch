      <title>Modelling the effects of biological intervention in a dynamical gene network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04266v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cellular response to environmental and internal signals can be modeled by dynamical gene regulatory networks (GRN). In the literature, three main classes of gene network models can be distinguished: (i) non-quantitative (or data-based) models which do not describe the probability distribution of gene expressions; (ii) quantitative models which fully describe the probability distribution of all genes coexpression; and (iii) mechanistic models which allow for a causal interpretation of gene interactions. We propose two rigorous frameworks to model gene alteration in a dynamical GRN, depending on whether the network model is quantitative or mechanistic. We explain how these models can be used for design of experiment, or, if additional alteration data are available, for validation purposes or to improve the parameter estimation of the original model. We apply these methods to the Gaussian graphical model, which is quantitative but non-mechanistic, and to mechanistic models of Bayesian networks and penalized linear regression.</description>

      <title>A Sloppy approach to QSP: XAI enabling fit-for-purpose models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02750v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantitative Systems Pharmacology (QSP) promises to accelerate drug development, enable personalized medicine, and improve the predictability of clinical outcomes. Realizing its full potential depends on effectively managing the complexity of the underlying mathematical models and biological systems. Here, we present and validate a novel QSP workflow grounded in the principles of sloppy modeling, offering a practical and principled strategy for building and deploying models in a QSP pipeline. Our approach begins with a literature-derived model, constructed to be as comprehensive and unbiased as possible by drawing from the collective knowledge of prior research. At the core of the workflow is the Manifold Boundary Approximation Method (MBAM), which simplifies models while preserving their predictive capacity and mechanistic interpretability. Applying MBAM as a context-specific model reduction strategy, we link the simplified representation directly to the downstream predictions of interest. The resulting reduced models are computationally efficient and well-suited to key QSP tasks, including virtual population generation, experimental design, and target discovery. We demonstrate the utility of this workflow through case studies involving the coagulation cascade and SHIV infection. Our analysis suggests several promising next steps for improving the efficacy of bNAb therapies in HIV infected patients within the context of a general-purpose QSP modeling workflow.</description>
