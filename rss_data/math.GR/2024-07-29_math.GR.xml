      <title>Automorphisms of the two-sided shift and the Higman--Thompson groups III: extensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We aim to interpret important constructions in the theory of automorphisms of the shift dynamical system in terms of subgroups $\mathcal{L}_{n,r}$ of the outer-automorphism groups $\mathcal{O}_{n,r}$ of the Higman--Thompson group $G_{n,r}$, and to extend results and techniques in $\operatorname{Aut}(X_n^{\mathbb{Z}}, \sigma_{n})$ to the groups of automorphisms $\operatorname{Aut}(G_{n,r})$ and outerautomrphisms of the Higman--Thompson group $G_{n,r}$.
  Our mains results are a concrete realisation of the "inert subgroup", important subgroup in the study of automorphism groups of shift spaces, as a subgroup $\mathcal{K}_{n}$ of $\mathcal{L}_{n,n-1}$.
  Using this realisation, we show that the $\operatorname{Aut}(G_{n,r})$ contains an isomorphic copy of $\operatorname{Aut}(X_{m}^{\mathbb{Z}}, \sigma_{m})$ for all $m \ge 2$.
  A survey of the literature then yields that $\operatorname{Aut}(G_{n,r})$ contains isomorphic copies of finite groups, finitely generated abelian groups, free groups, free products of finite groups, fundamental groups of 2-manifolds, graph groups and countable locally finite residually finite groups to name a few.
  We extend a result for $\operatorname{Aut}(X_n^{\mathbb{Z}}, \sigma_{n})$ to the group $\mathcal{O}_{n,n-1}$. The homeomorphism $\overleftarrow{\phantom{a}}$ of $X_n^{\mathbb{Z}}$ which maps a sequence $(x_i)_{i \in \mathbb{Z}}$ to the sequence $(y_{i})_{i \in \mathbb{Z}}$ defined such that $y_{i} = x_{-i}$ induces an automorphism $\overleftarrow{\mathfrak{r}}$ of $\operatorname{Aut}(X_n^{\mathbb{Z}}, \sigma_{n})$, and consequently, an automorphism of $\mathcal{L}_{n}$. We extend the automorphism $\overleftarrow{{\mathfrak{r}}}$ to the group $\mathcal{O}_{n,n-1}$.
  In a forthcoming article, we demonstrate that the group $\mathcal{O}_{n}$ is isomorphic to the mapping class group of the full two-sided shift over $n$ letters.</description>

      <title>Rigidity of proper quasi-homogeneous domains in positive flag manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that, inside the Shilov boundary of any given Hermitian symmetric space of tube type, there is, up to isomorphism, only one proper domain whose action by its automorphism group is cocompact. This gives a classification of all closed proper manifolds locally modelled on such Shilov boundaries, and provides a positive answer, in the case of flag manifolds admitting a $\Theta$-positive structure, to a rigidity question of Limbeek and Zimmer.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18822v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that Plancherel convergence is strictly stronger than Benjamini-Schramm convergence. In order to do so, we introduce two criteria for Plancherel and Benjamini-Schramm convergence in terms of counting functions of the length spectrum.</description>

      <title>Sigma-compactness of Morse boundaries in Morse local-to-global groups and applications to stationary measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the Morse boundary of a Morse local-to-global group is $\sigma$-compact. Moreover, we show that the converse holds for small cancellation groups. As an application, we show that the Morse boundary of a non-hyperbolic, Morse local-to-global group that has contraction does not admit a non-trivial stationary measure. In fact, we show that any stationary measure on a geodesic boundary of such a groups needs to assign measure zero to the Morse boundary. Unlike previous results, we do not need any assumptions on the stationary measures considered.</description>

      <title>Uniqueness of an $E_8$ model of elementary particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18279v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There are many ways to embed the Lie groups of the Standard Model of Particle Physics in a Lie group of type $E_8$, but so far there is no convincing demonstration that the finite symmetries (and asymmetries) of weak hypercharge, three generations of electrons, three quarks in a proton, and photon polarisation can also be embedded correctly. I show that there is a unique way to embed these finite symmetries consistently, and that the gauge groups of the Standard Model are then uniquely determined. The model is automatically chiral, and the generation symmetry acts as a rotation in a real 2-space, so that the spinors for three generations have only twice as many degrees of freedom in total as the spinors for a single generation. In fact, two distinct generation symmetries arise from the restriction to the Standard Model, related by the CKM and/or PMNS matrices. It therefore appears that these two matrices are not independent, but at a fundamental level both contain the same underlying information.</description>

      <title>Koszul Resolutions over Free Incomplete Tambara Functors for Cyclic $p$-Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18382v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In equivariant algebra, Mackey functors replace abelian groups and incomplete Tambara functors replace commutative rings. In this context, we prove that equivariant Hochschild homology can sometimes be computed using Mackey functor-valued Tor. To compute these Tor Mackey functors for odd primes $p$, we define cyclic-$p$-group-equivariant analogues of the Koszul resolution which resolve the Burnside Mackey functor (the analogue of the integers) as a module over free incomplete Tambara functors (the analogue of polynomial rings). We apply these Koszul resolutions to compute Mackey functor-valued Hochschild homology of free incomplete Tambara functors for cyclic groups of odd prime order and for the cyclic group of order 9.</description>

      <title>Combinatorial transfer: a new method for constructing infinite families of nonabelian difference sets, partial difference sets, and relative difference sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18385v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For nearly a century, mathematicians have been developing techniques for constructing abelian automorphism groups of combinatorial objects, and, conversely, constructing combinatorial objects from abelian groups. While abelian groups are a natural place to start, recent computational evidence strongly indicates that the vast majority of transitive automorphism groups of combinatorial objects are nonabelian. This observation is the guiding motivation for this paper. We propose a new method for constructing nonabelian automorphism groups of combinatorial objects, which could be called the \textit{combinatorial transfer method}, and we demonstrate its power by finding (1) the first infinite families of nonabelian Denniston partial difference sets (including nonabelian Denniston PDSs of odd order), (2) the first infinite family of Spence difference sets in groups with a Sylow 3-subgroup that is non-normal and not elementary abelian, (3) the first infinite families of McFarland difference sets in groups with a Sylow $p$-subgroup that is non-normal and is not elementary abelian, (4) new infinite families of partial difference sets in nonabelian $p$-groups with large exponent, (5) an infinite family of semiregular relative difference sets whose forbidden subgroup is nonabelian, and (6) a converse to Dillon's Dihedral Trick in the PDS setting. We hope this paper will lead to more techniques to explore this largely unexplored topic.</description>

      <title>Proper quasi-homogeneous domains of the Einstein universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18577v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Einstein universe $\mathbf{Ein}^{p,q}$ of signature $(p,q)$ is a pseudo-Riemannian analogue of the conformal sphere; it is the conformal compactification of the pseudo-Riemannian Minkowski space. For $p,q \geq 1$, we show that, up to a conformal transformation, there is only one domain in $\mathbf{Ein}^{p,q}$ that is bounded in a suitable stereographic projection and whose action by its conformal group is cocompact. This domain, which we call a diamond, is a model for the symmetric space of $\operatorname{PO}(p,1) \times \operatorname{PO}(1,q)$. We deduce a classification of closed conformally flat manifolds with proper development.</description>

      <title>Conjugacy for certain automorphisms of the one-sided shift via transducers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.13570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.13570v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We address the following open problem, implicit in the 1990 article "Automorphisms of one-sided subshifts of finite type" of Boyle, Franks and Kitchens (BFK):
  "Does there exists an element $\psi$ in the group of automorphisms of the one-sided shift $\operatorname{Aut}(\{0,1,\ldots,n-1\}^{\mathbb{N}}, \sigma_{n})$ so that all points of $\{0,1,\ldots,n-1\}^{\mathbb{N}}$ have orbits of length $n$ under $\psi$ and $\psi$ is not conjugate to a permutation?"
  Here, by a 'permutation' we mean an automorphism of one-sided shift dynamical system induced by a permutation of the symbol set $\{0,1,\ldots,n-1\}$.
  We resolve this question by showing that any $\psi$ with properties as above must be conjugate to a permutation.
  Our techniques naturally extend those of BFK using the strongly synchronizing automata technology developed here and in several articles of the authors and collaborators (although, this article has been written to be largely self-contained).</description>

      <title>A new characterization of $E_8 (p)$ via its vanishing elements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.00767v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a finite group, and $g \in G$. Then $g$ is said to be a vanishing element of $G$, if there exists an irreducible character $\chi$ of $G$ such that $\chi (g)=0$. Denote by ${\rm Vo} (G)$ the set of the orders of vanishing elements of $G$. We say a non-abelian group $G$ is V-recognizable, if any group $N$ with ${\rm Vo} (N) = {\rm Vo} (G)$ is isomorphic to $G$. In this paper, we investigate the V-recognizability of $E_8 (p)$, where $p$ is a prime number. As an application, among the 610 primes $p$ with $p&lt;10000$ and $p \equiv 0,1,4\,(\!\!\!\mod 5)$, we obtain that the method is always valid for confirming the V-recognizability of $E_8 (p)$ for all such $p$ but $ 919,1289,1931,3911,4691,5381$ and $7589 $.</description>

      <title>The influence of weakly $S\Phi$-supplemented subgroups on fusion systems of finite groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.01072v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a finite group and $H$ be a subgroup of $G$. Then $H$ is called a weakly $S\Phi$-supplemented subgroup of $G$, if there exists a subgroup $T$ of $G$ such that $G =HT$ and $H \cap T \leq \Phi (H) H_{sG}$, where $H_{sG}$ denotes the subgroup of $H$ generated by all subgroups of $H$ which are $S$-permutable in $G$. Let $p$ be a prime, $S$ be a $p$-group and $\mathcal{F}$ be a saturated fusion system over $S$. Then $\mathcal{F}$ is said to be supersolvable, if there exists a series of $S$, namely $1 = S_0 \leq S_1 \leq \cdots \leq S_n = S$, such that $S_{i+1}/S_i$ is cyclic, $i=0,1,\cdots, n-1$, $S_i$ is strongly $\mathcal{F}$-closed, $i=0,1,\cdots,n$. In this paper, we investigate the structure of fusion system $\mathcal{F}_S (G)$ under the assumption that certain subgroups of $S$ are weakly $S\Phi$-supplemented in $G$, and obtain several new characterizations of supersolvability of $\mathcal{F}_S (G)$.</description>

      <title>2-generated axial algebras of Monster type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.10315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2101.10315v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we provide the basic setup for a project, initiated by Felix Rehren, aiming at classifying all $2$-generated primitive axial agebras of Monster type $(\alpha, \beta)$. We first revise Rehren's construction of an initial object in the cathegory of primitive $n$-generated axial algebras giving a formal one, filling some gaps and, though correcting some inaccuracies, confirm Rehren's results. Then we focus on $2$-generated algebras which naturally part into three cases: the two critical cases $\alpha=2\beta$ and $\alpha=4\beta$, and the generic case (i.e. all the rest). About these cases, which will be dealt in detail in subsequent papers, we give bounds on the dimensions (the generic case already treated by Rehen) and classify all 2-generated primitive axial algebras of Monster type $(\alpha, \beta)$ over $\mathbb Q(\alpha, \beta)$ for $\alpha$ and $\beta$ algebraically independent indeterminates over $\mathbb Q$. Finally we restrict to the $2$-generated Majorana algebras (i.e. when $\alpha=\frac{1}{4}$ and $\beta=\frac{1}{32}$), showing that these fall precisely into the nine isomorphism types of the Norton-Sakuma algebras.</description>

      <title>Consequences of the random matrix solution to the Peterson-Thom conjecture</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.14109v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we show various new structural properties of free group factors using the recent resolution (due independently to Belinschi-Capitaine and Bordenave-Collins) of the Peterson-Thom conjecture. These results include the resolution to the coarseness conjecture independently due to the first-named author and Popa, a generalization of Ozawa-Popa's celebrated strong solidity result using vastly more general versions of the normalizer (and in an ultraproduct setting), a dichotomy result for intertwining of maximal amenable subalgebras of interpolated free group factors, as well as application to ultraproduct embeddings of nonamenable subalgebras of interpolated free group factors.</description>
