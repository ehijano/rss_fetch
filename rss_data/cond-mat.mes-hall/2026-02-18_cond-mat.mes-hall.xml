      <title>Transition radiation in helical metamaterials with strong spatial dispersion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15343v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The theory of transition radiation in helical metamaterials with strong spatial dispersion is developed in the framework of an effective field theory approach. The average number of photons radiated by a charged particle passing through a plate made of this metamaterial is obtained. Given the positions of the transition radiation maxima in momentum space for different velocities of a charged particle, the method for reconstruction of the dispersion law of plasmon-polaritons in metamaterials is proposed. Applying this method conversely, one can predict the radiation spectrum and polarization properties of transition radiation by means of the dispersion law of plasmon-polaritons in the metamaterial known, for example, from the effective model. It is shown that the strong spatial dispersion alters qualitatively the properties of transition radiation from a charged particle traversing normally a plate made of the helical metamaterial along its symmetry axis in the paraxial regime, viz., there is a nonzero forward radiation in contrast to transition radiation in media without strong spatial dispersion. Vavilov-Cherenkov radiation and the anomalous Doppler effect in helical metamaterials with strong spatial dispersion are described.</description>

      <title>Optimal conditions for detecting optical dichroism at the nanoscale by electron energy-loss spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15425v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The emergence of optical circular dichroism in chiral nanoscale and molecular systems provides not only a way for analyzing the sample chirality itself but also additional degrees of freedom in manipulating light. Such manipulation can be reached even at the nanoscale level; however, probing and understanding the properties of optical fields well below the diffraction limit requires an adequate technique. Electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS) with orbital angular momentum (OAM)-based electron state sorting has been suggested as a suitable candidate, but to date, no conclusive experiments have been performed. We, therefore, theoretically explore the emergence of dichroism in EELS for a canonical single-twist helix nanostructure and present a detailed analysis of the optimal parameters to obtain a robust signal. Our work offers novel insights into the interpretation and volatility of the OAM-resolved EELS signal, which can inspire and guide future experimental efforts.</description>

      <title>Photoionization of temperature-controlled nanoparticles in a beam: Accurate and efficient determination of ionization energies and work functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15426v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A beam of free alkali metal nanoparticles is produced by a condensation source, passed through a thermalizing tube adjustable over a broad temperature range, and ionized by tunable light. High stability of the particle flux and an automated data acquisition routine allow efficient collection of photoionization yield curves. A careful fit of the data to the universal Fowler function makes it possible to obtain nanoparticle ionization energies, and from those, the metal work functions, with $\sim$0.2% precision. The experimental arrangement, nanoparticle thermalization rates, and ionization threshold analysis are described in detail. The use of ultrapure and temperature-controlled gas-phase nanoparticles facilitates the analysis of electronic properties, such as work functions, and of their interplay with thermal lattice dynamics.</description>

      <title>Temperature-dependent photoionization thresholds of alkali-metal nanoparticles reveal thermal expansion and the melting transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A precision measurement of the photoionization of pure sodium and potassium nanoparticles isolated in a beam enabled an accurate determination of their work functions as a function of temperature. In addition to resolving and quantifying the initial gradual decrease of the work function with temperature, which is associated with thermal expansion, the experiment revealed that the work function then undergoes a distinct drop both in magnitude and in slope that signifies the onset of nanoparticle melting. This establishes that a structural phase transition can be detected via a high-resolution measurement of the photoemission threshold. The melting temperature of nanoparticles with diameters of 7-9 nm is reduced by nearly 100 K relative to the bulk value. This suppression aligns with predictions from the Gibbs-Thomson equation which describes finite-size phase transitions.</description>

      <title>Isotope effect in the work function of lithium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15437v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The work functions of 7Li and 6Li metals have been measured as a function of temperature, by using photoionization of pure isolated metal nanoparticles in a beam. These data reveal a marked isotope effect in the temperature variation of these work functions. Furthermore, for both isotopes the curvature of this temperature variation is found to be significantly larger than may be ascribed purely to a change in the electron gas density. These findings enhance the characterization of lithium as a quantum material in which the interplay between electronic and ionic degrees of freedom is nontrivial, and call for a microscopic understanding beyond simple models. Additionally, the slope of the work function curves was observed to vanish in the low temperature limit, as had been predicted on the basis of the Third Law of thermodynamics.</description>

      <title>Uniform Narrow Excitonic Spectrum in Large-Area Suspended WSe2 Monolayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15482v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Uniformity in the excitonic spectrum is a key requirement for accessing intrinsic excitonic physics in two-dimensional semiconductors; however, in supported transition-metal dichalcogenide (TMD) monolayers, exciton energies and linewidths can vary spatially due to inhomogeneities created by contact with other materials or contamination left by fabrication procedures. Suspended TMD monolayers provide an effective route to minimizing substrate-induced disorder. Here we demonstrate the spatially uniform excitonic spectrum from high-quality WSe2 suspended monolayers fabricated by gold-assisted exfoliation directly onto an Au contact electrode of a gate-tunable device. The resulting membranes span narrow suspended regions up to ~80 um and show spatially uniform photoluminescence at cryogenic temperatures with neutral-exciton linewidths as low as ~4.5 meV, comparable to the narrowest values reported for high-quality monolayers. Spectral reproducibility across the suspended regions supports an intrinsic optical response, while gate-dependent measurements resolve multiple excitonic species. This approach provides a practical route to electrically tunable potential landscapes in suspended TMD monolayers with a highly uniform excitonic response.</description>

      <title>Topological Scaling of Nonlinear Injection current and the Quantized Circular Photogalvanic Effect (CPGE)in tilted multi Weyl semimetals(mWSMs)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15575v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a microscopic theory of nonlinear magneto-optical injection currents in multi-Weyl semimetals subjected to a uniform magnetic field. Using the Landau-level spectrum of a tilted multi-Weyl Hamiltonian with arbitrary monopole charge $\nu$ as a starting point, we formulate a Kubo-type nonlinear response theory in the Landau-level basis and derive the second-order conductivity tensor. We identify distinct contributions originating from chiral-chiral, chiral-bulk, and bulk-bulk optical transitions, revealing characteristic monopole-charge scaling and sharp resonant structures governed by Landau-level selection rules and tilt-induced asymmetry. In the untilted limit, closed-form analytical expressions emerge that expose universal frequency thresholds and provide clear experimental signatures of higher-order Weyl topology. Our results establish nonlinear magneto-optical injection currents as a direct transport probe of chiral Landau levels and multi-Weyl topological charge.</description>

      <title>Polarization-resolved measurement of forward volume spin waves by micro-focused Brillouin light scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15760v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show how the micro-focused BLS signal of forward volume spin waves is formed and why it remains observable despite symmetry-based "suppression" expectations. A reciprocity-theorem based model with vectorial diffraction-limited focusing identifies the nonnegligible longitudinal focal-field component as the key element responsible for BLS sensitivity in the forward volume geometry. We further demonstrate that full polarization analysis, implemented through polarizer-analyzer maps of coherently excited spin waves, provides information beyond the conventional crossed polarizer-analyzer readout. In a BiYIG thin film, the measured maps exhibit Stokes/anti-Stokes polarization asymmetries and nontrivial patterns that stem from quadratic magneto-optical coupling terms. Fitting the data with a model including Voigt and Cotton-Mouton contributions yields an effective Cotton-Mouton constant and shows that the quadratic response is comparable to the linear Voigt contribution.</description>

      <title>Diode effect in microwave irradiated Josephson junctions with Yu-Shiba-Rusinov states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15213v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the critical current in microwave-irradiated Josephson junctions hosting Yu-Shiba-Rusinov states due to magnetic impurities. Under two conditions, namely, (i) the breaking of particle-hole symmetry in the normal sense by non-zero potential scattering, and (ii) the breaking of inversion symmetry either by unequal magnitudes of potential scattering and/or magnetic moments, microwave irradiation induces an additional phase-independent contribution to the current. This leads to asymmetric critical currents for opposite current polarities, an effect absent in the same junction without microwave irradiation. The asymmetry is highly tunable via the microwave amplitude and frequency, and we may even achieve perfect asymmetry where the critical current vanishes for one polarity, akin to a perfect diode. While Yu-Shiba-Rusinov states provide the ideal platform for a pronounced asymmetry, we find that as long as the two conditions (i) and (ii) above are met, our proposal does not necessarily depend upon them.</description>

      <title>Virtual ultrasound machine operating in a GHz to MHz frequency range for particle-based biomedical simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15442v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ultrasound-matter interactions underpin numerous biomedical and soft-matter applications, yet simulating these phenomena is challenging due to the large separation of viscous and sonic time scales. Continuum methods capture large-scale wave propagation but cannot resolve microscale interactions, while particle-based approaches offer molecular resolution but struggle with efficiency and stability at larger scales. We introduce a particle-based virtual ultrasound machine that uses a novel smoothed dissipative particle dynamics variant with an implicit pressure solver and a negative-pressure stabilization scheme, required to mimic acoustic propagation across MHz-GHz frequencies. We demonstrate its capabilities by modeling the acoustophoresis of encapsulated microbubbles, a key mechanism in ultrasound-mediated drug delivery. Beyond this application, the approach establishes a generalizable platform for simulating wave-matter interactions in soft and biological materials, opening new directions for computational studies of acoustics-driven phenomena in science and engineering.</description>

      <title>Hydrostatic Pressure-enhanced correlated magnetism and Chern insulator in moir'e WSe2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15465v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Moir\'e semiconductors offer flat bands where Coulomb interactions and band topology intertwine, while interlayer coupling plays a central role in forming the moir\'e potential. However, limited interlayer coupling strength and the lack of efficient tuning methods hinder further exploration of correlated phenomena in moir\'e semiconductors. Here we introduce a cryogenic dual-gated diamond-anvil platform using helium as a pressure medium, enabling reversible hydrostatic tuning together with magneto-optical spectroscopy in twisted bilayer WSe2. Pressure enhances the moir\'e potential, redshifts excitons, and stabilizes Stoner ferromagnetism otherwise absent at a 3.1-degree twist. Simultaneously, the half-filled C = 1 Chern insulating state strengthens, exhibiting a reduced saturation field. Moreover, we observe a topological phase transition from a Chern insulator to a Mott insulator at around 2 GPa. First-principles calculations reveal that a Gamma-to-K valence-band-maximum switching drives this transition by converting an Ising-like topological K-valley miniband into a spin-degenerate trivial Gamma miniband. Our findings demonstrate hydrostatic pressure as a powerful, continuous control axis for correlated magnetism and topological band engineering in moir\'e materials.</description>

      <title>Cluster Ising quantum batteries can mimic super-extensive charging power</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15467v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum batteries, miniaturized devices able to store and release energy on demand, are promising both because their intrinsic energy and time scales can match those of other quantum technologies and due to the intriguing possibility of achieving super-extensive charging power. While this enhanced scaling is known to appear in several settings, it is generally believed to be forbidden in Wigner-Jordan integrable spin chains charged via quantum-quench protocols. Here, we show that an extended cluster-Ising model, despite belonging to the above category, exhibits super-extensive charging power over wide ranges of system sizes, reaching up to a thousand spins, in proper parameter regimes. This remarkable anomalous scaling is due to a corresponding super-extensive growth of the stored energy, implying that it occurs at large but finite size and cannot persist in the thermodynamic limit. This phenomenon appears robust against finite-temperature effects.</description>

      <title>Generalized GMP Algebra for Three-Dimensional Quantum Hall Fluids of Extended Objects</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.15664v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a geometric framework for three-dimensional quantum Hall fluids of extended objects (quasi-strings) in the presence of a strong three-form background field associated with a bundle gerbe. In the strong-field regime, fast internal dynamics is frozen and the low-energy kinematics is governed by generalized guiding-center variables consisting of vectorial and tensorial coordinates. We show that these guiding-center variables obey a noncommutative geometry giving rise to a three-dimensional generalization of the Girvin-MacDonald-Platzman (GMP) algebra for projected density operators. Moreover, we relate this algebra to the canonical quantization of a topological BF+BB theory whose level is identified with the Dixmier-Douady invariant. Our results clarify the structure of incompressible quantum Hall-type phases and their geometric and topological features in three spatial dimensions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.06997v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Moir\'e superlattices in stacked 2D crystals are powerful platforms for engineering correlated and topological quantum phases, with twisted graphene and transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) as prominent examples. Their angle-sensitive band structures enable rich tunability; however, conventional tear-and-stack methods fix the angle at assembly, limiting systematic exploration of angle-dependent phenomena. Here, we present a scanning-probe-based manipulation scheme that enables in situ, continuous post-fabrication twist control using nanostructured metal rotors. We demonstrate reproducible angle tuning and direct moir\'e imaging across three platforms: graphene, hBN, and encapsulated, air-sensitive MoTe2. Quantitative piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM) analysis confirms sub-degree precision with minimal induced heterostrain, preserving sample quality even in the marginally twisted regime. Crucially, the device architecture maintains open access to the active region, allowing optical, scanning-probe, and transport measurements. This work enables single-device mapping of the angular phase diagram of moir\'e materials, including the twisted TMD homobilayers.</description>

Abstract: Using standard tight-binding methods, we investigate a novel backscattering mechanism taking place on quantum spin Hall N'SNSN' Josephson junctions in the presence of time-reversal symmetry. This extended geometry allows for the interplay between two types of Andreev bound states (ABS): the usual phase-dependent ABS localized at the edges of the central SNS junction \emph{and} phase-independent ABS localized at the edges of the N'S regions. Crucially, the latter arise at discrete energies $E_n$ and mediate a backscattering process between opposite edges on the SNS junction, yielding gap openings when both types of ABS are coherently coupled. In this scenario, a 4$\pi$-periodic ABS decouples from the rest of the 2$\pi$-periodic spectrum, yielding several observable consequences: Firstly, we show that the $4\pi$-periodic spectrum can be probed by means of the Shapiro experiment even in the presence of dynamical transitions between the ABS and the quasicontinuum. Secondly, the presence of this backscattering mechanism distorts the superconducting quantum interference (SQI) pattern within the length scale, determined by the ratio between $4\pi$- and $2\pi$-periodic supercurrent contributions. Finally, we propose to use a magnetic flux to tune $E_n$ to zero, resulting in the selective lifting of the fractional Josephson effect.</description>

      <title>Aharanov-Bohm oscillations and perfectly transmitted mode in amorphous topological insulator nanowires</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.02568v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Crystalline topological insulator nanowires with a magnetic flux threaded through their cross section display Aharanov-Bohm conductance oscillations. A characteristic of these oscillations is the perfectly transmitted mode present at certain values of the magnetic flux, due to the appearance of an effective time-reversal symmetry combined with the topological origin of the nanowire surface states. In contrast, amorphous nanowires display a varying cross section along the wire axis that breaks the effective time-reversal symmetry. In this work, we use transport calculations to study the stability of the Aharanov-Bohm oscillations and the perfectly transmitted mode in amorphous topological nanowires. We observe that at low energies and up to moderate amorphicity the transport is dominated, as in the crystalline case, by the presence of a perfectly transmitted mode. In an amorphous nanowire the perfectly transmitted mode is protected by chiral symmetry or, in its absence, by a statistical time-reversal symmetry. At high amorphicities the Aharanov-Bohm oscillations disappear and the conductance is dominated by nonquantized resonant peaks. We identify these resonances as bound states and relate their appearance to a topological phase transition that brings the nanowires into a trivial insulating phase.</description>

Abstract: Altermagnets constitute a class of collinear magnets with momentum-dependent spin splitting and vanishing net magnetization. Direct observation of the characteristic altermagnetic spin splitting, however, remains challenging. Indirect signatures can be obtained via transport studies, which so far have only considered homogeneous driving fields. We propose to leverage nonuniform electric fields and spin density gradients to probe the shape and the spin polarization of altermagnetic Fermi surfaces via transport measurements. By using both a semiclassical Boltzmann approach and a lattice Keldysh formalism, we show that altermagnets excite swirling electric and spin currents whose profiles depend on the relative orientation of altermagnetic lobes with respect to the sample boundaries. These currents can be measured via magnetometry techniques. Unlike previous proposals considering the hydrodynamic regime of transport, swirling currents are observed even in the Ohmic regime and rely exclusively on the altermagnetic spin splitting, with no swirls observed in ferromagnets. The electric and spin current vortices predicted here provide a different altermagnetic signature in an experimentally accessible setup.</description>

Abstract: We propose a pair spin-orbit interaction (PSOI) mechanism by establishing a mesoscopic many-particle Rashba Hamiltonian. In lowest order, this Hamiltonian self-consistently describes exciton spin relaxation in monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDC) due to local electric fields caused by spatial asymmetries in the dielectric environment. For a monolayer MoSe$_2$ on a SiO$_2$ substrate above 77$\,$K showing a bright-dark splitting in the meV range, the local electric field causes fast intravalley spin relaxation on a sub-picosecond timescale, whereas it is negligible for other TMDCs with larger bright-dark splitting.</description>

      <title>N\'eel vector controlled charge and spin transport in altermagnetic junctions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.14868v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Altermagnets (AMs) - magnetic materials that have spin-split bandstructure with zero net spin polarization can be classified as weak or strong depending upon the strength of altermagnetic term in the Hamiltonian. We theoretically investigate electron transport in junctions between the two AMs in strong and weak altermagnetic phases. The charge and spin conductivities are analyzed as functions of angle $\theta$ between the N\'eel vectors of the two AMs. In the strong AM regime, the charge conductivity vanishes as $\theta \to \pi$, while in the weak AM regime it remains finite. Introducing a normal metal (NM) between two AMs leads to Fabry-P\'erot-type oscillations in charge conductivity which can be controlled by an applied gate voltage. In the strong regime, transport in AM-NM-AM junctions is dominated by up-spin electrons, whereas both spin channels contribute in the weak regime. These results highlight the potential of AM-based heterostructures for spintronic applications, such as spin filters, and quantum interference-based spintronic devices, where tunable spin-dependent transport and interference effects can be utilized in electronic devices without a need for externally applied magnetic field.</description>

Abstract: Scalable solid state single-photon sources (SPSs) with triggered single-photon emission rates exceeding a few GHz would aid in the wide technological adoption of photonic quantum technologies. We demonstrate triggering of a quantum dot (QD) single photon emission using dynamic Purcell effect induced at a frequency of several GHz by acoustic strain. To this end, InAs QDs are integrated in a hybrid photon-phonon patterned microcavity, where the density of optical states is tailored by the lateral confinement of photons in um-sized traps defined lithographically in the microcavity spacer. The single-photon character of the emission form a QD in a trap is confirmed by measuring single-photon statistics. We demonstrate modulation of the QD transition energy in a trap with a frequency up to 14 GHz by monochromatic longitudinal bulk acoustic phonons generated by piezoelectric transducers. For the modulation frequency of 5.6 GHz, corresponding to the acoustic mode of the microcavity, the QD energy is periodically shifted through a spectrally narrow confined photonic mode leading to an appreciable enhancement of the QD emission due to the dynamic Purcell effect. The platform thus enables the implementation of scalable III-V-based SPSs with on-chip tunable acoustic clocks with frequencies that can exceed several GHz under continuous wave optical excitation.</description>

Abstract: The complex valence band structure of bulk cuprous oxide necessitates going beyond the parabolic approximation to precisely estimate exciton binding energies. The same is true for excitons in cuprous oxide quantum wells, for which many effects have been obtained so far only qualitatively within a hydrogenlike two-band model. Here, we derive the complete Hamiltonian for excitons in cuprous oxide quantum wells based on the Luttinger-Kohn model, taking into account the full complex valence band structure. Symmetry properties of the system are discussed. Numerical results based on the diagonalization of the Hamiltonian using B-spline functions reveal the energy shifts and the lifting of degeneracies due to the nondiagonal coupling terms of the complex valence band. The relative oscillator strengths of the excitonic transitions induced by circularly polarized light are also calculated.</description>

      <title>Giant and Oscillatory Junction Magnetoresistance via RKKY-like Spin Coupling in Spin-Gapless Mn$_2$CoAl/SiO$_2$/p-Si Heterostructures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.05303v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Here, we report spin-selective transport and exceptionally large positive junction magnetoresistance (JMR) in sputter-deposited Mn$_2$CoAl/native-SiO$_2$/p-Si heterostructures. Highly ordered inverse-Heusler Mn$_2$CoAl thin films with near-ideal XA chemical ordering (S$\approx$0.97) and a Curie temperature of $\sim$590 K are realized using magnetron sputtering process. The spin-gapless semiconducting nature of Mn$_2$CoAl is experimentally supported by a weakly temperature-dependent resistivity with a very small negative temperature coefficient of resistance ($\mathrm{TCR} \approx -4.2 \times 10^{-9}\,\Omega \cdot \mathrm{m} \cdot \mathrm{K}^{-1}$) and a nonsaturating linear magnetoresistance over a wide range of magnetic fields and temperatures. A giant positive JMR of $\sim$825% at 10 K and $\sim$134% at room temperature is observed despite the presence of only a single ferromagnetic electrode. Systematic variation of the SiO$_2$ tunnel barrier thickness reveals a reproducible oscillatory sign reversal of the JMR accompanied by a monotonic decay in magnitude. This behavior reflects thickness-dependent modulation of spin-selective tunneling mediated by phase-coherent interfacial carriers. It can be described phenomenologically by an RKKY-like functional form without invoking conventional metallic exchange interactions. These results identify Mn$_2$CoAl/native-SiO$_2$/p-Si heterostructures as robust and scalable platforms for room-temperature spin-selective transport, with potential applications in semiconductor-compatible spin filters, magnetic field sensors, and reconfigurable spintronic logic elements.</description>

      <title>Multistability of graphene nanobubbles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.16300v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using He, Ne, Ar, Kr, and Xe atoms as a model system, it is demonstrated that graphene nanobubbles on flat substrates are multistable systems. A nanobubble can adopt multiple stable stationary states, each characterized by the number of layers $l$ within the cluster of encapsulated atoms. The layers are circular, concentrically stacked, and form an $l$-stepped pyramid with a flat top. Encapsulation of this pyramid by the graphene sheet is achieved through local stretching of the membrane: the valence bonds elongate only directly above the confined atoms. Outside this coverage zone, the sheet remains undeformed and lies flush against the substrate. The maximum number of possible layers, $l_m$, increases monotonically with the number of encapsulated atoms $N$, reaching $l_m=6$ for $N=4000$. The graphene membrane, through van der Waals interaction with the substrate, compresses the internal atomic cluster, generating pressures on the order of $P\sim 1$~GPa. Numerical simulations of thermal vibrations reveal that among all $l$-layer configurations, one ground state always exist. Upon heating, this state smoothly transitions into a layerless liquid configuration. All other stationary states transform into this ground state once a characteristic temperature $T_l$ is reached. For $N=4000$, the ground state corresponds to the four-layer packing ($l=4$). The coexistence of multiple stable states with distinct layer numbers at low temperatures leads to the absence of a universal shape for the nanobubbles. In this scenario, the height-to-radius ratio, $H/R$ is not constant and can vary from 0 to 0.28, depending on the number of layers. The commonly reported universal relation $H/R\sim 0.2$ holds only for the ground states of the system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.07779v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide a theoretical description of diffusive charge and spin transport in hybrid devices containing altermagnets. Based on recently derived drift--diffusion equations for coupled charge and spin dynamics and general boundary conditions, our approach provides a unified description of the spin-splitter effect, i.e., the conversion of charge currents into spin currents, and its inverse in terms of experimentally accessible parameters. We analyze, analytically and numerically, the spin-splitter effect, demonstrating that an injected spin accumulation generates a measurable voltage difference across the transverse direction in the altermagnet. Motivated by a recent experiment, we also analyze a nonlocal spin-valve geometry in which an altermagnetic strip injects spin into a diffusive normal metal. We derive the resulting nonlocal voltage detected by a ferromagnetic electrode as a function of the relative orientation of the N'eel vector and the ferromagnetic polarization, accounting for the main experimental findings. For this setup, we further address spin precession during diffusive transport by analyzing the spin Hanle effect. Our results provide theoretical explanations and predictions for several altermagnet hybrid structures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07781v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the role of generalized symmetries in driving non-equilibrium and non-linear phenomena, specifically focusing on turbulent systems. While conventional turbulence studies have revealed inverse cascades driven by conserved quantities integrated over the entire space, such as helicity in three spatial dimensions, the influence of higher-form symmetries, whose conserved charges are defined by integration over subspaces, remains largely unexplored. We demonstrate a novel mechanism where higher-form symmetries naturally induce a self-similar inverse cascade. Taking axion electrodynamics with non-linear topological interaction as a paradigmatic example, we show that the conserved charge associated with its 1-form symmetry drives the system toward large-scale coherent structures through a universal scaling behavior characterized by analytically determined scaling exponents. Our findings suggest that higher-form symmetries can provide a fundamental organizing principle for understanding non-equilibrium phenomena and the emergence of coherent structures in turbulent systems.</description>

      <title>Interlayer Pores Play a Limited Role in Diffusion Through Hydrated Na-MMT: Insights from a Multiscale, Experimentally Anchored Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21880v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study investigates interlayer diffusion dynamics in sodium montmorillonite (Na--MMT), a smectite clay widely used in environmental remediation, pharmaceutical formulations, and advanced materials. Understanding diffusion in Na--MMT is critical, yet current models often rely on fitted parameters rather than directly linking transport to microscopic structure; even when the structure is known, interlayer diffusion remains challenging to model. This motivates the development of a predictive, coarse-grained, geometry-based computational framework.
  Our multiscale framework couples atomistic simulations with a coarse-grained mesoscale model to quantify contributions from interlayer one-, two-, and three-water pores, as well as free pores ($&gt;3$-water diameter), across dry densities of $0.8$--$1.3~\mathrm{g\,cm^{-3}}$. Experimentally derived platelet size distributions, polydispersity, and anisotropic transport behavior are explicitly incorporated.
  Results indicate that interlayer pores contribute minimally to overall water diffusion at the studied densities, with transport dominated by free pores. Predicted diffusion scaling factors closely match tritium tracer measurements when interlayer throttling is included, and the model captures the pronounced anisotropy of Na--MMT. Validation against lattice Boltzmann simulations and experiments demonstrates reliable reproduction of geometric tortuosity and pore-size distributions. Despite limitations, including rigid platelets and omission of three-water energy minima, the coarse-grained framework provides a robust platform for understanding nanoconfined diffusion. Future work will focus on refining interlayer energy landscapes and incorporating flexible platelet mechanics.</description>

Abstract: We study the dynamical and spectral characteristics of a quantum three-level ladder system, interacting with a continuous electromagnetic field in one-dimensional open waveguide. Common realization of such systems is a waveguide QED setup - a superconducting artificial atom (transmon), coupled to an open microwave transmission line. We derive an analytical solution for spontaneous emission of initially excited atom, and use it to study the probability of state detection and spectral density of output photon states. We find that for strong coupling of transmon to a waveguide emitted photons show correlation in frequency and can have the same energies, even if the three-level system is anharmonic.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.09714v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the real-time chiral dynamics of Dirac fermions in AdS$_2$ and AdS$_2$ black hole backgrounds. The spacetime curvature generates a spin connection term, acting as an effective magnetic field and a position-dependent chiral chemical potential. This leads to strongly asymmetric wave propagation, confined within an inhomogeneous Lieb-Robinson cone. The front velocities decrease with increasing fermion mass and horizon radius. The entanglement entropy grows inside the causal cone, and it saturates due to screening/dephasing in the finite inhomogeneous chain. In dipole-dipole collision, the central bipartite entropy rises when the inward Lieb-Robinson fronts intersect, forming a bright ridge in the local entanglement profile. Charge and current correlators peak at the front arrival, providing a real-time diagnostic of chiral transport. These results establish a causality-respecting framework, linking curvature and horizons to transport and entanglement in (1+1)-dimensional fermionic matter.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we establish an explicit correspondence between continuum topological field theory and microscopic lattice constructions of three-dimensional non-Abelian topological orders. While Wilson operators defined by gauge-field holonomies represent topological excitations at long distances, we explicitly construct microscopic lattice operators that create, fuse, and shrink particle and loop excitations, derive their fusion and shrinking rules microscopically, and show how non-Abelian shrinking channels are selectively controlled through the internal degrees of freedom of loop creation operators. Crucially, we demonstrate that the lattice shrinking rules satisfy the \textit{fusion-shrinking consistency} relations previously identified at long distances, thereby establishing these relations as a general, microscopically verifiable principle. Moreover, by computing the complete excitation spectrum alongside all fusion and shrinking data microscopically, we establish a correspondence between the $\mathbb{D}_4$ quantum double lattice model and the $BF$ field theory with an $AAB$ twist and gauge group $(\mathbb{Z}_2)^3$. Through the precise microscopic construction of the $BF+AAB$ field theory, this work definitively addresses the long-standing skepticism regarding its microscopic realizability, which has persisted over the past years. Finally, our work bridges the gap between theories at long and short distances, taking a crucial step toward a more complete microscopic construction of topological data previously identified at long distances, including braiding, pentagon relations, and fusion-shrinking hexagon relations. This progress holds the potential to deepen our understanding of quantum matter across all length scales and foster collaboration between researchers from diverse fields and approaches.</description>
