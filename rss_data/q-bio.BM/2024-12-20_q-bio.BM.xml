      <title>How natural sequence variation modulates protein folding dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Natural protein sequences serve as a natural record of the evolutionary constraints that shape their functional structures. We show that it is possible to use sequence information to go beyond predicting native structures and global stability to infer the folding dynamics of globular proteins. The one- and two-body evolutionary energy fields at the amino-acid level are mapped to a coarse-grained description of folding, where proteins are divided into contiguous folding elements, commonly referred to as foldons. For 15 diverse protein families, we calculated the folding dynamics of hundreds of proteins by simulating an Ising chain of foldons, with their energetics determined by the amino acid sequences. We show that protein topology imposes limits on the variability of folding cooperativity within a family. While most beta and alpha/beta structures exhibit only a few possible mechanisms despite high sequence diversity, alpha topologies allow for diverse folding scenarios among family members. We show that both the stability and cooperativity changes induced by mutations can be computed directly using sequence-based evolutionary models.</description>

      <title>Gaussian-convolution-invariant shell approximation to spherically-symmetric functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14350v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a class of functions Omega_N(x; mu, nu) in N-dimensional space concentrated around a spherical shell of the radius mu and such that, being convoluted with an isotropic Gaussian function, these functions do not change their expression but only a value of its 'width' parameter, nu. Isotropic Gaussian functions are a particular case of Omega_N(x; mu, nu) corresponding to mu = 0. Due to their features, these functions are an efficient tool to build approximations to smooth and continuous spherically-symmetric functions including oscillating ones. Atomic images in limited-resolution maps of the electron density, electrostatic scattering potential and other scalar fields studied in physics, chemistry, biology, and other natural sciences are examples of such functions. We give simple analytic expressions of Omega_N(x; mu, nu) for N = 1, 2, 3 and analyze properties of these functions. Representation of oscillating functions by a sum of Omega_N(x; mu, nu) allows calculating distorted maps for the same cost as the respective theoretical fields. We give practical examples of such representation for the interference functions of the uniform unit spheres for N = 1, 2, 3 that define the resolution of the respective images. Using the chain rule and analytic expressions of the Omega_N(x; mu, nu) derivatives makes simple refinement of parameters of the models which describe these fields.</description>

      <title>InstructMol: Multi-Modal Integration for Building a Versatile and Reliable Molecular Assistant in Drug Discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.16208v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rapid evolution of artificial intelligence in drug discovery encounters challenges with generalization and extensive training, yet Large Language Models (LLMs) offer promise in reshaping interactions with complex molecular data. Our novel contribution, InstructMol, a multi-modal LLM, effectively aligns molecular structures with natural language via an instruction-tuning approach, utilizing a two-stage training strategy that adeptly combines limited domain-specific data with molecular and textual information. InstructMol showcases substantial performance improvements in drug discovery-related molecular tasks, surpassing leading LLMs and significantly reducing the gap with specialized models, thereby establishing a robust foundation for a versatile and dependable drug discovery assistant.</description>

      <title>NeuralPLexer3: Accurate Biomolecular Complex Structure Prediction with Flow Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10743v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Structure determination is essential to a mechanistic understanding of diseases and the development of novel therapeutics. Machine-learning-based structure prediction methods have made significant advancements by computationally predicting protein and bioassembly structures from sequences and molecular topology alone. Despite substantial progress in the field, challenges remain to deliver structure prediction models to real-world drug discovery. Here, we present NeuralPLexer3 -- a physics-inspired flow-based generative model that achieves state-of-the-art prediction accuracy on key biomolecular interaction types and improves training and sampling efficiency compared to its predecessors and alternative methodologies. Examined through newly developed benchmarking strategies, NeuralPLexer3 excels in vital areas that are crucial to structure-based drug design, such as physical validity and ligand-induced conformational changes.</description>
