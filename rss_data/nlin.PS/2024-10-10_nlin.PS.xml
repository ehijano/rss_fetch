      <title>Nonlinear Coupling between Magnetic Gears</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07198v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study investigates the complex nonlinear coupling of magnetic gears arranged in proximity on a plane. Acknowledging the rich array of geometric and electromagnetic parameters involved, we initiate our exploration with a simplified model. By nondimensionalizing the key variables, we derive a novel nonlinear dynamics framework that abstracts away electromagnetic dependencies. Our approach includes analatic results, numerical simulations and experimental validation, emphasizing two distinct operational modes: free motion and constant driving motion. The findings highlight the intricate behaviors arising from these interactions, contributing to a deeper understanding of magnetic gear dynamics.</description>

      <title>Bubble dynamics in a Hele-Shaw channel and velocity selection without surface tension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.04327</link>
      <description>arXiv:1910.04327v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inviscid bubble dynamics in a viscous fluid, moving with velocity $V$ far from the bubble, is considered. The Cauchy problem of recovering the bubble evolution from its initial shape is completely solved without surface tension. The well-posed (after a Tikhonov regularization) dynamical system provides an extensive list of unsteady closed form solutions due to integrability. A new (rational) class of solutions is obtained and added to the logarithmic class found earlier (Phys. Rev. E 89, 061003(R), 2014). The only attractor selects the observable bubble shape and velocity $U = 2V$ from the continuum of possible solutions. The attractor is asymptotically stable. Numerical results illustrate the most salient aspects of the bubble dynamics.</description>

      <title>Thouless pumping and trapping of two-component gap solitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13823v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study Thouless pumping and arresting of gap solitons in a two-component Bose gas loaded into an optical superlattice. We show that, depending on the atomic interactions and chemical potentials, the two solitons can be simultaneously pumped or trapped, but we also identify regimes where one soliton is pumped and the other arrested. These behaviors can be understood by considering an effective model of the system based on a variational approach, which reveals that the soliton width is a suitable qualifier for the observed behaviours: solitons with a larger width get transported, while solitons with a smaller width get trapped. Since these width can be controlled by tuning interactions, it should be possible to observe all behaviours experimentally.</description>

      <title>Thermal Decay of Planar Jones-Roberts Solitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06532v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Homogeneous planar superfluids exhibit a range of low-energy excitations that also appear in highly excited states like superfluid turbulence. In dilute gas Bose-Einstein condensates, the Jones- Roberts soliton family includes vortex dipoles and rarefaction pulses in the low and high velocity regimes, respectively. These excitations carry both energy and linear momentum, making their decay characteristics crucial for understanding superfluid dynamics. In this work, we develop the theory of planar soliton decay due to thermal effects, as described by the stochastic projected Gross-Pitaevskii theory of reservoir interactions. We analyze two distinct damping terms involving transfer between the condensate and the non-condensate reservoir: particle transfer that also involves energy and usually drives condensate growth, and number-conserving energy transfer. We provide analytical treatments for both the low and high velocity regimes and identify conditions under which either mechanism dominates. Our findings indicate that energy damping prevails at high phase space density. These theoretical results are supported by numerical studies covering the entire velocity range from vortex dipole to rarefaction pulse. We use interaction energy to characterize rarefaction pulses, analogous to the distance between vortices in vortex dipoles, offering an experimentally accessible test for finite temperature theory in Bose-Einstein condensates.</description>
