      <title>Towards nonlinearity. The p-regularity theory. Applications and developments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07671v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present recent advances in the analysis of nonlinear equations with singular operators and nonlinear optimization problems with constraints given by singular mappings. The results are obtained within the framework of $p$-regularity theory, which has developed successfully over the last forty years. We illustrate the theory with its applications to degenerate problems in various areas of mathematics. In particular, we address the problem of describing the tangent cone to the solution set of nonlinear equations in a singular case. The structure of p-factor operators is used to propose optimality conditions and construct numerical methods for solving degenerate nonlinear equations and optimization problems. The methods presented in the paper can be considered as the first numerical approaches targeting solutions of degenerate problems, such as the Van der Pol differential equation, boundary-value problems with a small parameter, partial differential equations where Poincar\'e's method of small parameter fails, nonlinear degenerate dynamical systems, and others. There are various practical applications for the theory of p-regularity, including structural engineering, composite materials, and material design. For instance, the theory can be applied to analyze the behavior of materials with irregular or complex properties. By considering higher-order derivatives, it becomes possible to model and predict the response of materials to external forces, such as stress or temperature variations. In geophysics, the $p$-regularity theory can be utilized to analyze and interpret complex data obtained from seismic surveys, gravity measurements, or electromagnetic surveys. The theory also finds applications in the analysis of nonlinear differential equations arising in control systems, geometric and topological analysis, biomechanics, and many other fields.</description>

      <title>Input-to-state stability in integral norms for linear infinite-dimensional systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07680v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study integral-to-integral input-to-state stability for infinite-dimensional linear systems with inputs and trajectories in $L^p$-spaces. We start by developing the corresponding admissibility theory for linear systems with unbounded input operators. While input-to-state stability is typically characterized by exponential stability and finite-time admissibility, we show that this equivalence does not extend directly to integral norms. For analytic semigroups, we establish a precise characterization using maximal regularity theory. Additionally, we provide direct Lyapunov theorems and construct Lyapunov functions for $L^p$-$L^q$-ISS and demonstrate the results with examples, including diagonal systems and diffusion equations.</description>

      <title>Existence and uniqueness of control sets with a nonempty interior for linear control systems on solvable groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we obtain weak conditions for the existence of a control set with a nonempty interior for a linear control system on a solvable Lie group. We show that the Lie algebra rank condition together with the compactness of the nilpotent part of the generalized kernel of the drift are enough to assure the existence of such a control set. Moreover, this control set is unique and contains the whole generalized kernel in its closure.</description>

      <title>Peaceman-Rachford Splitting Method Converges Ergodically for Solving Convex Optimization Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07807v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove that the ergodic sequence generated by the Peaceman-Rachford (PR) splitting method with semi-proximal terms converges for convex optimization problems (COPs). Numerical experiments on the linear programming benchmark dataset further demonstrate that, with a restart strategy, the ergodic sequence of the PR splitting method with semi-proximal terms consistently outperforms both the point-wise and ergodic sequences of the Douglas-Rachford (DR) splitting method. These findings indicate that the restarted ergodic PR splitting method is a more effective choice for tackling large-scale COPs compared to its DR counterparts.</description>

      <title>An accelerated gradient method with adaptive restart for convex multiobjective optimization problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, based on the continuous time approach, we propose an accelerated gradient method with adaptive residual restart for convex multiobjective optimization problems. For the first, we derive rigorously the continuous limit of the multiobjective accelerated proximal gradient method by Tanabe et al. [arXiv:2022.10994, 2022]. It is a second-order ordinary differential equation (ODE) that involves a special projection operator and can be viewed as an extension of the ODE by Su et al. [J. Mach. Learn. Res., 2016] for Nesterov's accelerated gradient method. Based on this, we introduce a novel accelerated multiobjective gradient (AMG) flow with tailored time scaling that adapts automatically to the convex case and the strongly convex case, and the exponential decay rate of a merit function along with the solution trajectory of AMG flow is established via the Lyapunov analysis. After that, we consider an implicit-explicit time discretization and obtain an accelerated multiobjective gradient method with a convex quadratic programming subproblem. The fast sublinear rate and linear rate are proved respectively for convex and strongly convex problems. In addition, we present an efficient residual based adaptive restart technique to overcome the oscillation issue and improve the convergence significantly. Numerical results are provided to validate the practical performance of the proposed method.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07873v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a class of matrix splitting-based fixed-point iteration (FPI) methods for solving the vertical nonlinear complementarity problem (VNCP). Under appropriate conditions, we present two convergence results obtained using different techniques and estimate the number of iterations required for the FPI method. Additionally, through numerical experiments, we demonstrated that the FPI method surpasses other methods in computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>Synchronization of Kuramoto oscillators via HEOL, and a discussion on AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07948v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial neural networks and their applications in deep learning have recently made an incursion into the field of control. Deep learning techniques in control are often related to optimal control, which relies on Pontryagin maximum principle or the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation. They imply control schemes that are tedious to implement. We show here that the new HEOL setting, resulting from the fusion of the two established approaches, namely differential flatness and model-free control, provides a solution to control problems that is more sober in terms of computational resources. This communication is devoted to the synchronization of the popular Kuramoto's coupled oscillators, which was already considered via artificial neural networks (B\"ottcher et al., Nature Communications 2022), where, contrarily to this communication, only the single control variable is examined. One establishes the flatness of Kuramoto's coupled oscillator model with multiplicative control and develops the resulting HEOL control. Unlike many exemples, this system reveals singularities that are avoided by a clever generation of phase angle trajectories. The results obtained, verified in simulation, show that it is not only possible to synchronize these oscillators in finite time, and even to follow angular frequency profiles, but also to exhibit robustness concerning model mismatches. To the best of our knowledge this has never been done before. Concluding remarks advocate a viewpoint, which might be traced back to Wiener's cybernetics: control theory belongs to AI.</description>

      <title>On Fenchel c-conjugate dual problems for DC optimization: characterizing weak, strong and stable strong duality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08061v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we present two Fenchel-type dual problems for a DC (difference of convex functions) optimization primal one. They have been built by means of the c-conjugation scheme, a pattern of conjugation which has been shown to be suitable for evenly convex functions. We study characterizations of weak, strong and stable strong duality for both pairs of primal-dual problems. We also give conditions which relate the existence of strong and stable strong duality for both pairs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.08064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies properties of a subdifferential defined using a generalized conjugation scheme. We relate this subdifferential together with the domain of an appropriate conjugate function and the {\epsilon}-directional derivative. In addition, we also present necessary conditions for {\epsilon}-optimality and global optimality in optimization problems involving the difference of two convex functions. These conditions will be written via this generalized notion of subdifferential studied in the first sections of the paper.</description>

      <title>A Time- and Space-Efficient Heuristic Approach for Late Train-Crew Rescheduling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we reschedule the duties of train drivers one day before the operation. Due to absent drivers (e.g., because of sick leave), some trains have no driver. Thus, duties need to be rescheduled for the day of operation. We start with a feasible crew schedule for each of the remaining operating drivers, a set of unassigned tasks originally assigned to the absent drivers, and a group of standby drivers with fixed start time, end time, start depot, and end depot. Our aim is to generate a crew schedule with as few canceled or changed tasks as possible. We present a tabu-search-based approach for crew rescheduling. We also adapt a column-generation approach with the same objective function and equivalent restrictions as the benchmark for comparing the results, computational time, and space usage. Our tabu-search-based approach needs both less computation time and space than the column-generation approach to compute an acceptable result. We further test the performance of our approach under different settings. The data used in the experiments originated from a regional passenger-train system around Stockholm, Sweden and was provided by M\"alart\r{a}g.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.08146v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a family of approximate multi-step proximal point methods, framed as implicit linear discretizations of gradient flow. The resulting methods are multi-step proximal point methods, with similar computational cost in each update as the proximal point method. We explore several optimization methods where applying an approximate multistep proximal points method results in improved convergence behavior. We also include convergence analysis for the proposed method in several problem settings: quadratic problems, general problems that are strongly or weakly (non)convex, and accelerated results for alternating projections.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Cruise Controllers with Bidirectional Sensing for a String of Vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a nonlinear cruise controller that is fully decentralized (by vehicle) and uses spacing and speed measurements from the preceding and following vehicles to decide on the appropriate control action (acceleration) for each vehicle. The proposed cruise controller is studied on both a ring-road and an open road and guarantees that there are no collisions between vehicles, while their speeds are always positive and never exceed the road speed limits. For both cases of the open road and the ring-road, we rigorously prove that the set of equilibrium points is globally asymptotically stable and provide KL estimates that guarantee uniform convergence to the said set. Moreover, we show that for the ring-road, and under certain conditions, there is a single equilibrium point which is exponentially attractive.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.08256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the Robbins-Monro stochastic approximation algorithm with projections on a hyperrectangle and prove its convergence. This work fills a gap in the convergence proof of the classic book by Kushner and Yin. Using the ODE method, we show that the algorithm converges to stationary points of a related projected ODE. Our results provide a better theoretical foundation for stochastic optimization techniques, including stochastic gradient descent and its proximal version. These results extend the algorithm's applicability and relax some assumptions of previous research.</description>

      <title>Finite Sample Identification of Partially Observed Bilinear Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07652v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of learning a realization of a partially observed bilinear dynamical system (BLDS) from noisy input-output data. Given a single trajectory of input-output samples, we provide a finite time analysis for learning the system's Markov-like parameters, from which a balanced realization of the bilinear system can be obtained. Our bilinear system identification algorithm learns the system's Markov-like parameters by regressing the outputs to highly correlated, nonlinear, and heavy-tailed covariates. Moreover, the stability of BLDS depends on the sequence of inputs used to excite the system. These properties, unique to partially observed bilinear dynamical systems, pose significant challenges to the analysis of our algorithm for learning the unknown dynamics. We address these challenges and provide high probability error bounds on our identification algorithm under a uniform stability assumption. Our analysis provides insights into system theoretic quantities that affect learning accuracy and sample complexity. Lastly, we perform numerical experiments with synthetic data to reinforce these insights.</description>

      <title>Dataset Distillation as Pushforward Optimal Quantization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07681v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dataset distillation aims to find a synthetic training set such that training on the synthetic data achieves similar performance to training on real data, with orders of magnitude less computational requirements. Existing methods can be broadly categorized as either bi-level optimization problems that have neural network training heuristics as the lower level problem, or disentangled methods that bypass the bi-level optimization by matching distributions of data. The latter method has the major advantages of speed and scalability in terms of size of both training and distilled datasets. We demonstrate that when equipped with an encoder-decoder structure, the empirically successful disentangled methods can be reformulated as an optimal quantization problem, where a finite set of points is found to approximate the underlying probability measure by minimizing the expected projection distance. In particular, we link existing disentangled dataset distillation methods to the classical optimal quantization and Wasserstein barycenter problems, demonstrating consistency of distilled datasets for diffusion-based generative priors. We propose a simple extension of the state-of-the-art data distillation method D4M, achieving better performance on the ImageNet-1K dataset with trivial additional computation, and state-of-the-art performance in higher image-per-class settings.</description>

      <title>Economic Model Predictive Control for Periodic Operation: A Quadratic Programming Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08181v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Periodic dynamical systems, distinguished by their repetitive behavior over time, are prevalent across various engineering disciplines. In numerous applications, particularly within industrial contexts, the implementation of model predictive control (MPC) schemes tailored to optimize specific economic criteria was shown to offer substantial advantages. However, the real-time implementation of these schemes is often infeasible due to limited computational resources. To tackle this problem, we propose a resource-efficient economic model predictive control scheme for periodic systems, leveraging existing single-layer MPC techniques. Our method relies on a single quadratic optimization problem, which ensures high computational efficiency for real-time control in dynamic settings. We prove feasibility, stability and convergence to optimum of the proposed approach, and validate the effectiveness through numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Multiplayer Federated Learning: Reaching Equilibrium with Less Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08263v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traditional Federated Learning (FL) approaches assume collaborative clients with aligned objectives working towards a shared global model. However, in many real-world scenarios, clients act as rational players with individual objectives and strategic behaviors, a concept that existing FL frameworks are not equipped to adequately address. To bridge this gap, we introduce Multiplayer Federated Learning (MpFL), a novel framework that models the clients in the FL environment as players in a game-theoretic context, aiming to reach an equilibrium. In this scenario, each player tries to optimize their own utility function, which may not align with the collective goal. Within MpFL, we propose Per-Player Local Stochastic Gradient Descent (PEARL-SGD), an algorithm in which each player/client performs local updates independently and periodically communicates with other players. We theoretically analyze PEARL-SGD and prove that it reaches a neighborhood of equilibrium with less communication in the stochastic setup compared to its non-local counterpart. Finally, we verify our theoretical findings through numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>A GPU-Accelerated Distributed Algorithm for Optimal Power Flow in Distribution Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08293v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a GPU-accelerated distributed optimization algorithm for controlling multi-phase optimal power flow in active distribution systems with dynamically changing topologies. To handle varying network configurations and enable adaptable decomposition, we advocate a componentwise decomposition strategy. However, this approach can lead to a prolonged computation time mainly due to the excessive iterations required for achieving consensus among a large number of fine-grained components. To overcome this, we introduce a technique that segregates equality constraints from inequality constraints, enabling GPU parallelism to reduce per-iteration time by orders of magnitude, thereby significantly accelerating the overall computation. Numerical experiments on IEEE test systems ranging from 13 to 8500 buses demonstrate the superior scalability of the proposed approach compared to its CPU-based counterparts.</description>

Abstract: In this note, we present a novel measure of similarity between two functions. It quantifies how the sub-optimality gaps of two functions convert to each other, and unifies several existing notions of functional similarity. We show that it has convenient operation rules, and illustrate its use in empirical risk minimization and non-stationary online optimization.</description>

      <title>Gradient Equilibrium in Online Learning: Theory and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08330v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a new perspective on online learning that we refer to as gradient equilibrium: a sequence of iterates achieves gradient equilibrium if the average of gradients of losses along the sequence converges to zero. In general, this condition is not implied by nor implies sublinear regret. It turns out that gradient equilibrium is achievable by standard online learning methods such as gradient descent and mirror descent with constant step sizes (rather than decaying step sizes, as is usually required for no regret). Further, as we show through examples, gradient equilibrium translates into an interpretable and meaningful property in online prediction problems spanning regression, classification, quantile estimation, and others. Notably, we show that the gradient equilibrium framework can be used to develop a debiasing scheme for black-box predictions under arbitrary distribution shift, based on simple post hoc online descent updates. We also show that post hoc gradient updates can be used to calibrate predicted quantiles under distribution shift, and that the framework leads to unbiased Elo scores for pairwise preference prediction.</description>

      <title>Relaxed Indexability and Index Policy for Partially Observable Restless Bandits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2107.11939v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper addresses an important class of restless multi-armed bandit (RMAB) problems that finds broad application in operations research, stochastic optimization, and reinforcement learning. There are $N$ independent Markov processes that may be operated, observed and offer rewards. Due to the resource constraint, we can only choose a subset of $M~(M&lt;N)$ processes to operate and accrue reward determined by the states of selected processes. We formulate the problem as a partially observable RMAB with an infinite state space and design an algorithm that achieves a near-optimal performance with low complexity. Our algorithm is based on a generalization of Whittle's original idea of indexability. Referred to as the relaxed indexability, the extended definition leads to the efficient online verifications and computations of the approximate Whittle index under the proposed algorithmic framework.</description>

      <title>Distributed Inexact Newton Method with Adaptive Step Sizes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.13985v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider two formulations for distributed optimization wherein $N$ agents in a generic connected network solve a problem of common interest: distributed personalized optimization and consensus optimization. A new method termed DINAS (Distributed Inexact Newton method with Adaptive Stepsize) is proposed. DINAS employs large adaptively computed step-sizes, requires a reduced global parameters knowledge with respect to existing alternatives, and can operate without any local Hessian inverse calculations nor Hessian communications. When solving personalized distributed learning formulations, DINAS achieves quadratic convergence with respect to computational cost and linear convergence with respect to communication cost, the latter rate being independent of the local functions condition numbers or of the network topology. When solving consensus optimization problems, DINAS is shown to converge to the global solution. Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate significant improvements of DINAS over existing alternatives. As a result of independent interest, we provide for the first time convergence analysis of the Newton method with the adaptive Polyak's step-size when the Newton direction is computed inexactly in centralized environment.</description>

      <title>On structural contraction of biological interaction networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.13678v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Biological networks are customarily described as structurally robust. This means that they often function extremely well under large forms of perturbations affecting both the concentrations and the kinetic parameters. In order to explain this property, various mathematical notions have been proposed in the literature. In this paper, we propose the notion of structural contractivity, building on the previous work of the authors. That previous work characterized the long-term dynamics of classes of Biological Interaction Networks (BINs), based on "rate-dependent Lyapunov functions". Here, we show that stronger notions of convergence can be established by proving structural contractivity with respect to non-standard polyhedral $\ell_\infty$-norms. In particular, we show that such networks are nonexpansive. With additional verifiable conditions, we show that they are strictly contractive over arbitrary positive compact sets. In addition, we show that such networks entrain to periodic inputs. We illustrate our theory with examples drawn from the modeling of intracellular signaling pathways.</description>

Abstract: We consider optimal control problems that have binary-valued control input functions and a perimeter regularization. We develop and analyze a trust-region algorithm that solves a sequence of subproblems in which the regularization term and the binarity constraint are relaxed by a non-convex energy functional. We show how the parameter that controls the distinctiveness of the resulting phase field can be coupled to the trust-region radius updates and be driven to zero over the course of the iterations in order to obtain convergence to stationary points of the limit problem under suitable regularity assumptions. Finally, we highlight and discuss the assumptions and restrictions of our approach and provide the first computational results for a motivating application in the field of control of acoustic waves in dissipative media.</description>

      <title>Invariance Proximity: Closed-Form Error Bounds for Finite-Dimensional Koopman-Based Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.13033v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A popular way to approximate the Koopman operator's action on a finite-dimensional subspace of functions is via orthogonal projections. The quality of the projected model directly depends on the selected subspace, specifically on how close it is to being invariant under the Koopman operator. The notion of invariance proximity provides a tight upper bound on the worst-case relative prediction error of the finite-dimensional model. However, its direct calculation is computationally challenging. This paper leverages the geometric structure behind the definition of invariance proximity to provide a closed-form expression in terms of Jordan principal angles on general inner product spaces. Unveiling this connection allows us to exploit specific isomorphisms to circumvent the computational challenges associated with spaces of functions and enables the use of existing efficient numerical routines to compute invariance proximity.</description>

      <title>Beyond discounted returns: Robust Markov decision processes with average and Blackwell optimality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.03618v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Robust Markov Decision Processes (RMDPs) are a widely used framework for sequential decision-making under parameter uncertainty. RMDPs have been extensively studied when the objective is to maximize the discounted return, but little is known for average optimality (optimizing the long-run average of the rewards obtained over time) and Blackwell optimality (remaining discount optimal for all discount factors sufficiently close to ). In this paper, we prove several foundational results for RMDPs beyond the discounted return. We show that average optimal policies can be chosen stationary and deterministic for sa-rectangular RMDPs but, perhaps surprisingly, we show that for s-rectangular RMDPs average optimal policies may not exist, and if they exist, may need to be history-dependent (Markovian). We also study Blackwell optimality for sa-rectangular RMDPs, where we show that $\epsilon$-Blackwell optimal policies always exist, although Blackwell optimal policies may not exist. We also provide a sufficient condition for their existence, which encompasses virtually any examples from the literature. We then discuss the connection between average and Blackwell optimality, and we describe several algorithms to compute the optimal average return. Interestingly, our approach leverages the connections between RMDPs and stochastic games. Overall, our paper emphasizes the superior practical properties of distance-based sa-rectangular models over s-rectangular models for average and Blackwell optimality.</description>

      <title>Parallel Inexact Levenberg-Marquardt Method for Nearly-Separable Nonlinear Least Squares</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.09064v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by localization problems such as cadastral maps refinements, we consider a generic Nonlinear Least Squares (NLS) problem of minimizing an aggregate squared fit across all nonlinear equations (measurements) with respect to the set of unknowns, e.g., coordinates of the unknown points' locations. In a number of scenarios, NLS problems exhibit a nearly-separable structure: the set of measurements can be partitioned into disjoint groups (blocks), such that the unknowns that correspond to different blocks are only loosely coupled. We propose an efficient parallel method, termed Parallel Inexact Levenberg Marquardt (PILM), to solve such generic large scale NLS problems. PILM builds upon the classical Levenberg-Marquard (LM) method, with a main novelty in that the nearly-block separable structure is leveraged in order to obtain a scalable parallel method. Therein, the problem-wide system of linear equations that needs to be solved at every LM iteration is tackled iteratively. At each (inner) iteration, the block-wise systems of linear equations are solved in parallel, while the problem-wide system is then handled via sparse, inexpensive inter-block communication. We establish strong convergence guarantees of PILM that are analogous to those of the classical LM; provide PILM implementation in a master-worker parallel compute environment; and demonstrate its efficiency on huge scale cadastral map refinement problems.</description>

Abstract: This paper introduces a learning-based, data-driven attitude estimator, called the retrospective cost attitude estimator (RCAE), for the SO(3) attitude representation. RCAE is motivated by the multiplicative extended Kalman filter (MEKF). However, unlike MEKF, which requires computing a Jacobian to compute the correction signal, RCAC uses retrospective cost optimization that depends only on the measured data. Moreover, due to the structure of the correction signal, RCAE does not require explicit estimation of gyro bias. The performance of RCAE is verified and compared with MEKF through both numerical simulations and physical experiments.</description>

Abstract: We present a new algorithm for convex separable quadratic programming (QP) called Nys-IP-PMM, a regularized interior-point solver that uses low-rank structure to accelerate solution of the Newton system. The algorithm combines the interior point proximal method of multipliers (IP-PMM) with the randomized Nystr\"om preconditioned conjugate gradient method as the inner linear system solver. Our algorithm is matrix-free: it accesses the input matrices solely through matrix-vector products, as opposed to methods involving matrix factorization. It works particularly well for separable QP instances with dense constraint matrices. We establish convergence of Nys-IP-PMM. Numerical experiments demonstrate its superior performance in terms of wallclock time compared to previous matrix-free IPM-based approaches.</description>

      <title>McCormick envelopes in mixed-integer PDE-constrained optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07891v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: McCormick envelopes are a standard tool for deriving convex relaxations of optimization problems that involve polynomial terms. Such McCormick relaxations provide lower bounds, for example, in branch-and-bound procedures for mixed-integer nonlinear programs but have not gained much attention in PDE-constrained optimization so far. This lack of attention may be due to the distributed nature of such problems, which on the one hand leads to infinitely many linear constraints (generally state constraints that may be difficult to handle) in addition to the state equation for a pointwise formulation of the McCormick envelopes and renders bound-tightening procedures that successively improve the resulting convex relaxations computationally intractable.
  We analyze McCormick envelopes for a problem class that is governed by a semilinear PDE involving a bilinearity and integrality constraints. We approximate the nonlinearity by averaging the involved terms over the cells of a partition of the computational domain on which the PDE is defined. This yields convex relaxations that underestimate the original problem up to an a priori error estimate that depends on the mesh size of the discretization. These approximate McCormick relaxations can be improved by means of an optimization-based bound-tightening procedure. We show that their minimizers converge to minimizers to a limit problem with a pointwise formulation of the McCormick envelopes when driving the mesh size to zero.
  We provide a computational example, for which we certify all of our imposed assumptions. The results point to both the potential of the methodology and the gaps in the research that need to be closed.</description>

      <title>Barrier Function for Bilevel Optimization with Coupled Lower-Level Constraints: Formulation, Approximation and Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10670v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider bilevel optimization problem where the lower-level has coupled constraints, i.e. the constraints depend both on the upper- and lower-level variables. In particular, we consider two settings for the lower-level problem. The first is when the objective is strongly convex and the constraints are convex with respect to the lower-level variable; The second is when the lower-level is a linear program. We propose to utilize a barrier function reformulation to translate the problem into an unconstrained problem. By developing a series of new techniques, we proved that both the hyperfunction value and hypergradient of the barrier reformulated problem (uniformly) converge to those of the original problem under minimal assumptions. Further, to overcome the non-Lipschitz smoothness of hyperfunction and lower-level problem for barrier reformulated problems, we design an adaptive algorithm that ensures a non-asymptotic convergence guarantee. We also design an algorithm that converges to the stationary point of the original problem asymptotically under certain assumptions. The proposed algorithms require minimal assumptions, and to our knowledge, they are the first with convergence guarantees when the lower-level problem is a linear program. Numerical experiments are conducted to show the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>On the Trade-Off Between Distributional Belief and Ambiguity: Conservatism, Finite-Sample Guarantees, and Asymptotic Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19234v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose and analyze a new data-driven trade-off (TRO) approach for modeling uncertainty that serves as a middle ground between the optimistic approach, which adopts a distributional belief, and the pessimistic distributionally robust optimization approach, which hedges against distributional ambiguity. We equip the TRO model with a TRO ambiguity set characterized by a size parameter controlling the level of optimism and a shape parameter representing distributional ambiguity. We first show that constructing the TRO ambiguity set using a general star-shaped shape parameter with the empirical distribution as its star center is necessary and sufficient to guarantee the hierarchical structure of the sequence of TRO ambiguity sets. Then, we analyze the properties of the TRO model, including quantifying conservatism, quantifying bias and generalization error, and establishing asymptotic properties. Specifically, we show that the TRO model could generate a spectrum of decisions, ranging from optimistic to conservative decisions. Additionally, we show that it could produce an unbiased estimator of the true optimal value. Furthermore, we establish the almost-sure convergence of the optimal value and the set of optimal solutions of the TRO model to their true counterparts. We exemplify our theoretical results using an inventory control problem and a portfolio optimization problem.</description>

      <title>Flow matching for stochastic linear control systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00617v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of steering an initial probability distribution to a target probability distribution through a deterministic or stochastic linear control system. Our proposed approach is inspired by the flow matching methodology, with the difference that we can only affect the flow through the given control channels. The motivation comes from applications such as robotic swarms and stochastic thermodynamics, where agents or particles can only be manipulated through control actions. The feedback control law that achieves the task is characterized as the conditional expectation of the control inputs for the stochastic bridges that respect the given control system dynamics. Explicit forms are derived for special cases, and a numerical procedure is presented to approximate the control law, illustrated with examples.</description>

      <title>Sensitivity Analysis for Binary Outcome Misclassification in Randomization Tests via Integer Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.03111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2201.03111v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Conducting a randomization test is a common method for testing causal null hypotheses in randomized experiments. The popularity of randomization tests is largely because their statistical validity only depends on the randomization design, and no distributional or modeling assumption on the outcome variable is needed. However, randomization tests may still suffer from other sources of bias, among which outcome misclassification is a significant one. We propose a model-free and finite-population sensitivity analysis approach for binary outcome misclassification in randomization tests. A central quantity in our framework is ``warning accuracy," defined as the threshold such that a randomization test result based on the measured outcomes may differ from that based on the true outcomes if the outcome measurement accuracy did not surpass that threshold. We show how learning the warning accuracy and related concepts can amplify analyses of randomization tests subject to outcome misclassification without adding additional assumptions. We show that the warning accuracy can be computed efficiently for large data sets by adaptively reformulating a large-scale integer program with respect to the randomization design. We apply the proposed approach to the Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial (PCPT). We also developed an open-source R package for implementation of our approach.</description>

      <title>Analytically Tractable Models for Decision Making under Present Bias</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.08132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.08132v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Time-inconsistency is a characteristic of human behavior in which people plan for long-term benefits but take actions that differ from the plan due to conflicts with short-term benefits. Such time-inconsistent behavior is believed to be caused by present bias, a tendency to overestimate immediate rewards and underestimate future rewards. It is essential in behavioral economics to investigate the relationship between present bias and time-inconsistency. In this paper, we propose a model for analyzing agent behavior with present bias in tasks to make progress toward a goal over a specific period. Unlike previous models, the state sequence of the agent can be described analytically in our model. Based on this property, we analyze three crucial problems related to agents under present bias: task abandonment, optimal goal setting, and optimal reward scheduling. Extensive analysis reveals how present bias affects the condition under which task abandonment occurs and optimal intervention strategies. Our findings are meaningful for preventing task abandonment and intervening through incentives in the real world.</description>

      <title>Breaking barriers in two-party quantum cryptography via stochastic semidefinite programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.13200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.13200v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the last two decades, there has been much effort in finding secure protocols for two-party cryptographic tasks. It has since been discovered that even with quantum mechanics, many such protocols are limited in their security promises. In this work, we use stochastic selection, an idea from stochastic programming, to circumvent such limitations. For example, we find a way to switch between bit commitment, weak coin flipping, and oblivious transfer protocols to improve their security. We also use stochastic selection to turn trash into treasure yielding the first quantum protocol for Rabin oblivious transfer.</description>

      <title>Partial Information in a Mean-Variance Portfolio Selection Game</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.04045v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper considers finitely many investors who perform mean-variance portfolio selection under relative performance criteria. That is, each investor is concerned about not only her terminal wealth, but how it compares to the average terminal wealth of all investors. At the inter-personal level, each investor selects a trading strategy in response to others' strategies. This selected strategy additionally needs to yield an equilibrium intra-personally, so as to resolve time inconsistency among the investor's current and future selves (triggered by the mean-variance objective). A Nash equilibrium we look for is thus a tuple of trading strategies under which every investor achieves her intra-personal equilibrium simultaneously. We derive such a Nash equilibrium explicitly in the idealized case of full information (i.e., the dynamics of the underlying stock is perfectly known) and semi-explicitly in the realistic case of partial information (i.e., the stock evolution is observed, but the expected return of the stock is not precisely known). The formula under partial information consists of the myopic trading and intertemporal hedging terms, both of which depend on an additional state process that serves to filter the true expected return and whose influence on trading is captured by a degenerate Cauchy problem. Our results identify that relative performance criteria can induce downward self-reinforcement of investors' wealth--if every investor suffers a wealth decline simultaneously, then everyone's wealth tends to decline further. This phenomenon, as numerical examples show, is negligible under full information but pronounced under partial information.</description>

Abstract: We prove the existence of an open set minimizing the first eigenvalue of the Dirichlet polylaplacian of order $m\geq1$ under volume constraint. Moreover, the corresponding eigenfunction is shown to enjoy $C^{m-1,\alpha}$ H\"older regularity. This is performed for dimension $2\leq d\leq 4m$. In particular, our analysis answers the question of the existence of an optimal shape for the clamped plate up to dimension $8$.</description>

      <title>Remove that Square Root: A New Efficient Scale-Invariant Version of AdaGrad</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02648v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Adaptive methods are extremely popular in machine learning as they make learning rate tuning less expensive. This paper introduces a novel optimization algorithm named KATE, which presents a scale-invariant adaptation of the well-known AdaGrad algorithm. We prove the scale-invariance of KATE for the case of Generalized Linear Models. Moreover, for general smooth non-convex problems, we establish a convergence rate of $O \left(\frac{\log T}{\sqrt{T}} \right)$ for KATE, matching the best-known ones for AdaGrad and Adam. We also compare KATE to other state-of-the-art adaptive algorithms Adam and AdaGrad in numerical experiments with different problems, including complex machine learning tasks like image classification and text classification on real data. The results indicate that KATE consistently outperforms AdaGrad and matches/surpasses the performance of Adam in all considered scenarios.</description>

      <title>Directional Smoothness and Gradient Methods: Convergence and Adaptivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04081v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop new sub-optimality bounds for gradient descent (GD) that depend on the conditioning of the objective along the path of optimization rather than on global, worst-case constants. Key to our proofs is directional smoothness, a measure of gradient variation that we use to develop upper-bounds on the objective. Minimizing these upper-bounds requires solving implicit equations to obtain a sequence of strongly adapted step-sizes; we show that these equations are straightforward to solve for convex quadratics and lead to new guarantees for two classical step-sizes. For general functions, we prove that the Polyak step-size and normalized GD obtain fast, path-dependent rates despite using no knowledge of the directional smoothness. Experiments on logistic regression show our convergence guarantees are tighter than the classical theory based on $L$-smoothness.</description>

      <title>Regression Equilibrium in Electricity Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17753v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In two-stage electricity markets, renewable power producers enter the day-ahead market with a forecast of future power generation and then reconcile any forecast deviation in the real-time market at a penalty. The choice of the forecast model is thus an important strategy decision for renewable power producers as it affects financial performance. In electricity markets with large shares of renewable generation, the choice of the forecast model impacts not only individual performance but also outcomes for other producers. In this paper, we argue for the existence of a competitive regression equilibrium in two-stage electricity markets in terms of the parameters of private forecast models informing the participation strategies of renewable power producers. In our model, renewables optimize the forecast against the day-ahead and real-time prices, thereby maximizing the average profits across the day-ahead and real-time markets. By doing so, they also implicitly enhance the temporal cost coordination of day-ahead and real-time markets. We base the equilibrium analysis on the theory of variational inequalities, providing results on the existence and uniqueness of regression equilibrium in energy-only markets. We also devise two methods to compute regression equilibrium: centralized optimization and a decentralized ADMM-based algorithm.</description>

      <title>Statistical inference of convex order by Wasserstein projection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02840v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ranking distributions according to a stochastic order has wide applications in diverse areas. Although stochastic dominance has received much attention, convex order, particularly in general dimensions, has yet to be investigated from a statistical point of view. This article addresses this gap by introducing a simple statistical test for convex order based on the Wasserstein projection distance. This projection distance not only encodes whether two distributions are indeed in convex order, but also quantifies the deviation from the desired convex order and produces an optimal convex order approximation. Lipschitz stability of the backward and forward Wasserstein projection distance is proved, which leads to elegant consistency and concentration results of the estimator we employ as our test statistic. Combining these with state of the art results regarding the convergence rate of empirical distributions, we also derive upper bounds for the $p$-value and type I error of our test statistic, as well as upper bounds on the type II error for an appropriate class of strict alternatives. With proper choices of families of distributions, we further attain that the power of the proposed test increases to one as the number of samples grows to infinity. Lastly, we provide an efficient numerical scheme for our test statistic, by way of an entropic Frank-Wolfe algorithm. Experiments based on synthetic data sets illuminate the success of our approach.</description>

      <title>Decoupled Functional Central Limit Theorems for Two-Time-Scale Stochastic Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17070v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In two-time-scale stochastic approximation (SA), two iterates are updated at different rates, governed by distinct step sizes, with each update influencing the other. Previous studies have demonstrated that the convergence rates of the error terms for these updates depend solely on their respective step sizes, a property known as decoupled convergence. However, a functional version of this decoupled convergence has not been explored. Our work fills this gap by establishing decoupled functional central limit theorems for two-time-scale SA, offering a more precise characterization of its asymptotic behavior. To achieve these results, we leverage the martingale problem approach and establish tightness as a crucial intermediate step. Furthermore, to address the interdependence between different time scales, we introduce an innovative auxiliary sequence to eliminate the primary influence of the fast-time-scale update on the slow-time-scale update.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.05320v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we investigate some isoperimetric-type inequalities related to the first eigenvalue of the fractional composite membrane problem. First, we establish an analogue of the renowned Faber-Krahn inequality for the fractional composite membrane problem. Next, we investigate an isoperimetric inequality for the first eigenvalue of the fractional composite membrane problem on the intersection of two domains-a problem that was first studied by Lieb [23] for the Laplacian. Similar results in the local case were previously obtained by Cupini-Vecchi [9] for the composite membrane problem. Our findings provide further insights into the fractional setting, offering a new perspective on these classical inequalities.</description>
