      <title>Diffusion-Reinforcement Learning Hierarchical Motion Planning in Adversarial Multi-agent Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10794v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement Learning- (RL-)based motion planning has recently shown the potential to outperform traditional approaches from autonomous navigation to robot manipulation. In this work, we focus on a motion planning task for an evasive target in a partially observable multi-agent adversarial pursuit-evasion games (PEG). These pursuit-evasion problems are relevant to various applications, such as search and rescue operations and surveillance robots, where robots must effectively plan their actions to gather intelligence or accomplish mission tasks while avoiding detection or capture themselves. We propose a hierarchical architecture that integrates a high-level diffusion model to plan global paths responsive to environment data while a low-level RL algorithm reasons about evasive versus global path-following behavior. Our approach outperforms baselines by 51.2% by leveraging the diffusion model to guide the RL algorithm for more efficient exploration and improves the explanability and predictability.</description>

      <title>A Scalable and Parallelizable Digital Twin Framework for Sustainable Sim2Real Transition of Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10996v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work presents a sustainable multi-agent deep reinforcement learning framework capable of selectively scaling parallelized training workloads on-demand, and transferring the trained policies from simulation to reality using minimal hardware resources. We introduce AutoDRIVE Ecosystem as an enabling digital twin framework to train, deploy, and transfer cooperative as well as competitive multi-agent reinforcement learning policies from simulation to reality. Particularly, we first investigate an intersection traversal problem of 4 cooperative vehicles (Nigel) that share limited state information in single as well as multi-agent learning settings using a common policy approach. We then investigate an adversarial autonomous racing problem of 2 vehicles (F1TENTH) using an individual policy approach. In either set of experiments, a decentralized learning architecture was adopted, which allowed robust training and testing of the policies in stochastic environments. The agents were provided with realistically sparse observation spaces, and were restricted to sample control actions that implicitly satisfied the imposed kinodynamic and safety constraints. The experimental results for both problem statements are reported in terms of quantitative metrics and qualitative remarks for training as well as deployment phases. We also discuss agent and environment parallelization techniques adopted to efficiently accelerate MARL training, while analyzing their computational performance. Finally, we demonstrate a resource-aware transition of the trained policies from simulation to reality using the proposed digital twin framework.</description>

      <title>Resilient Fleet Management for Energy-Aware Intra-Factory Logistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11034v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel fleet management strategy for battery-powered robot fleets tasked with intra-factory logistics in an autonomous manufacturing facility. In this environment, repetitive material handling operations are subject to real-world uncertainties such as blocked passages, and equipment or robot malfunctions. In such cases, centralized approaches enhance resilience by immediately adjusting the task allocation between the robots. To overcome the computational expense, a two-step methodology is proposed where the nominal problem is solved a priori using a Monte Carlo Tree Search algorithm for task allocation, resulting in a nominal search tree. When a disruption occurs, the nominal search tree is rapidly updated a posteriori with costs to the new problem while simultaneously generating feasible solutions. Computational experiments prove the real-time capability of the proposed algorithm for various scenarios and compare it with the case where the search tree is not used and the decentralized approach that does not attempt task reassignment.</description>

      <title>GOMA: Proactive Embodied Cooperative Communication via Goal-Oriented Mental Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11075v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Verbal communication plays a crucial role in human cooperation, particularly when the partners only have incomplete information about the task, environment, and each other's mental state. In this paper, we propose a novel cooperative communication framework, Goal-Oriented Mental Alignment (GOMA). GOMA formulates verbal communication as a planning problem that minimizes the misalignment between the parts of agents' mental states that are relevant to the goals. This approach enables an embodied assistant to reason about when and how to proactively initialize communication with humans verbally using natural language to help achieve better cooperation. We evaluate our approach against strong baselines in two challenging environments, Overcooked (a multiplayer game) and VirtualHome (a household simulator). Our experimental results demonstrate that large language models struggle with generating meaningful communication that is grounded in the social and physical context. In contrast, our approach can successfully generate concise verbal communication for the embodied assistant to effectively boost the performance of the cooperation as well as human users' perception of the assistant.</description>

      <title>Pioneering SE(2)-Equivariant Trajectory Planning for Automated Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11304v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Planning the trajectory of the controlled ego vehicle is a key challenge in automated driving. As for human drivers, predicting the motions of surrounding vehicles is important to plan the own actions. Recent motion prediction methods utilize equivariant neural networks to exploit geometric symmetries in the scene. However, no existing method combines motion prediction and trajectory planning in a joint step while guaranteeing equivariance under roto-translations of the input space. We address this gap by proposing a lightweight equivariant planning model that generates multi-modal joint predictions for all vehicles and selects one mode as the ego plan. The equivariant network design improves sample efficiency, guarantees output stability, and reduces model parameters. We further propose equivariant route attraction to guide the ego vehicle along a high-level route provided by an off-the-shelf GPS navigation system. This module creates a momentum from embedded vehicle positions toward the route in latent space while keeping the equivariance property. Route attraction enables goal-oriented behavior without forcing the vehicle to stick to the exact route. We conduct experiments on the challenging nuScenes dataset to investigate the capability of our planner. The results show that the planned trajectory is stable under roto-translations of the input scene which demonstrates the equivariance of our model. Despite using only a small split of the dataset for training, our method improves L2 distance at 3 s by 20.6 % and surpasses the state of the art.</description>

      <title>Independent RL for Cooperative-Competitive Agents: A Mean-Field Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11345v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We address in this paper Reinforcement Learning (RL) among agents that are grouped into teams such that there is cooperation within each team but general-sum (non-zero sum) competition across different teams. To develop an RL method that provably achieves a Nash equilibrium, we focus on a linear-quadratic structure. Moreover, to tackle the non-stationarity induced by multi-agent interactions in the finite population setting, we consider the case where the number of agents within each team is infinite, i.e., the mean-field setting. This results in a General-Sum LQ Mean-Field Type Game (GS-MFTGs). We characterize the Nash equilibrium (NE) of the GS-MFTG, under a standard invertibility condition. This MFTG NE is then shown to be $\mathcal{O}(1/M)$-NE for the finite population game where $M$ is a lower bound on the number of agents in each team. These structural results motivate an algorithm called Multi-player Receding-horizon Natural Policy Gradient (MRPG), where each team minimizes its cumulative cost independently in a receding-horizon manner. Despite the non-convexity of the problem, we establish that the resulting algorithm converges to a global NE through a novel problem decomposition into sub-problems using backward recursive discrete-time Hamilton-Jacobi-Isaacs (HJI) equations, in which independent natural policy gradient is shown to exhibit linear convergence under time-independent diagonal dominance. Experiments illuminate the merits of this approach in practice.</description>

      <title>Exploiting Agent Symmetries for Performance Analysis of Distributed Optimization Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11724v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that, in many settings, the worst-case performance of a distributed optimization algorithm is independent of the number of agents in the system, and can thus be computed in the fundamental case with just two agents. This result relies on a novel approach that systematically exploits symmetries in worst-case performance computation, framed as Semidefinite Programming (SDP) via the Performance Estimation Problem (PEP) framework. Harnessing agent symmetries in the PEP yields compact problems whose size is independent of the number of agents in the system. When all agents are equivalent in the problem, we establish the explicit conditions under which the resulting worst-case performance is independent of the number of agents and is therefore equivalent to the basic case with two agents. Our compact PEP formulation also allows the consideration of multiple equivalence classes of agents, and its size only depends on the number of equivalence classes. This enables practical and automated performance analysis of distributed algorithms in numerous complex and realistic settings, such as the analysis of the worst agent performance. We leverage this new tool to analyze the performance of the EXTRA algorithm in advanced settings and its scalability with the number of agents, providing a tighter analysis and deeper understanding of the algorithm performance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11958v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Computational modeling plays an essential role in the study of language emergence. It aims to simulate the conditions and learning processes that could trigger the emergence of a structured language within a simulated controlled environment. Several methods have been used to investigate the origin of our language, including agent-based systems, Bayesian agents, genetic algorithms, and rule-based systems. This chapter explores another class of computational models that have recently revolutionized the field of machine learning: deep learning models. The chapter introduces the basic concepts of deep and reinforcement learning methods and summarizes their helpfulness for simulating language emergence. It also discusses the key findings, limitations, and recent attempts to build realistic simulations. This chapter targets linguists and cognitive scientists seeking an introduction to deep learning as a tool to investigate language evolution.</description>

      <title>Where to Decide? Centralized vs. Distributed Vehicle Assignment for Platoon Formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.09580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.09580v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Platooning is a promising cooperative driving application for future intelligent transportation systems. In order to assign vehicles to platoons, some algorithm for platoon formation is required. Such vehicle-to-platoon assignments have to be computed on-demand, e.g., when vehicles join or leave the freeways. In order to get best results from platooning, individual properties of involved vehicles have to be considered during the assignment computation. In this paper, we explore the computation of vehicle-to-platoon assignments as an optimization problem based on similarity between vehicles. We define the similarity and, vice versa, the deviation among vehicles based on the desired driving speed of vehicles and their position on the road. We create three approaches to solve this assignment problem: centralized solver, centralized greedy, and distributed greedy, using a Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) solver and greedy heuristics, respectively.Conceptually, the approaches differ in both knowledge about vehicles as well as methodology. We perform a large-scale simulation study using PlaFoSim to compare all approaches. While the distributed greedy approach seems to have disadvantages due to the limited local knowledge, it performs as good as the centralized solver approach across most metrics. Both outperform the centralized greedy approach, which suffers from synchronization and greedy selection effects. The centralized solver approach however assumes global knowledge and requires a complex MIP solver to compute vehicle-to-platoon assignments. Overall, the distributed greedy approach achieves close to optimal results but requires the least assumptions and complexity.Therefore, we consider the distributed greedy approach the best approach among all presented approaches.</description>

      <title>MARVEL: Multi-Agent Reinforcement-Learning for Large-Scale Variable Speed Limits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.12359v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Variable Speed Limit (VSL) control acts as a promising highway traffic management strategy with worldwide deployment, which can enhance traffic safety by dynamically adjusting speed limits according to real-time traffic conditions. Most of the deployed VSL control algorithms so far are rule-based, lacking generalizability under varying and complex traffic scenarios. In this work, we propose MARVEL (Multi-Agent Reinforcement-learning for large-scale Variable spEed Limits), a novel framework for large-scale VSL control on highway corridors with real-world deployment settings. MARVEL utilizes only sensing information observable in the real world as state input and learns through a reward structure that incorporates adaptability to traffic conditions, safety, and mobility, thereby enabling multi-agent coordination. With parameter sharing among all VSL agents, the proposed framework scales to cover corridors with many agents. The policies are trained in a microscopic traffic simulation environment, focusing on a short freeway stretch with 8 VSL agents spanning 7 miles. For testing, these policies are applied to a more extensive network with 34 VSL agents spanning 17 miles of I-24 near Nashville, TN, USA. MARVEL-based method improves traffic safety by 63.4% compared to the no control scenario and enhances traffic mobility by 58.6% compared to a state-of-the-practice algorithm that has been deployed on I-24. Besides, we conduct an explainability analysis to examine the decision-making process of the agents and explore the learned policy under different traffic conditions. Finally, we test the response of the policy learned from the simulation-based experiments with real-world data collected from I-24 and illustrate its deployment capability.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Decision-Making for Autonomous Vehicles: A Learning-Enhanced Game-Theoretic Approach in Interactive Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.11467v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes an adaptive behavioral decision-making method for autonomous vehicles (AVs) focusing on complex merging scenarios. Leveraging principles from non-cooperative game theory, we develop a vehicle interaction behavior model that defines key traffic elements and integrates a multifactorial reward function. Maximum entropy inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) is employed for behavior model parameter optimization. Optimal matching parameters can be obtained using the interaction behavior feature vector and the behavior probabilities output by the vehicle interaction model. Further, a behavioral decision-making method adapted to dynamic environments is proposed. By establishing a mapping model between multiple environmental variables and model parameters, it enables parameters online learning and recognition, and achieves to output interactive behavior probabilities of AVs. Quantitative analysis employing naturalistic driving datasets (highD and exiD) and real-vehicle test data validates the model's high consistency with human decision-making. In 188 tested interaction scenarios, the average human-like similarity rate is 81.73%, with a notable 83.12% in the highD dataset. Furthermore, in 145 dynamic interactions, the method matches human decisions at 77.12%, with 6913 consistence instances. Moreover, in real-vehicle tests, a 72.73% similarity with 0% safety violations are obtained. Results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method in enabling AVs to make informed adaptive behavior decisions in interactive environments.</description>

      <title>Studying speed-accuracy trade-offs in best-of-n collective decision-making through heterogeneous mean-field modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.13694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.13694v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To succeed in their objectives, groups of individuals must be able to make quick and accurate collective decisions on the best option among a set of alternatives with different qualities. Group-living animals aim to do that all the time. Plants and fungi are thought to do so too. Swarms of autonomous robots can also be programmed to make best-of-n decisions for solving tasks collaboratively. Ultimately, humans critically need it and so many times they should be better at it. Thanks to their mathematical tractability, simple models like the voter model and the local majority rule model have proven useful to describe the dynamics of such collective decision-making processes. To reach a consensus, individuals change their opinion by interacting with neighbors in their social network. At least among animals and robots, options with a better quality are exchanged more often and therefore spread faster than lower-quality options, leading to the collective selection of the best option. With our work, we study the impact of individuals making errors in pooling others' opinions caused, for example, by the need to reduce the cognitive load. Our analysis is grounded on the introduction of a model that generalizes the two existing models (local majority rule and voter model), showing a speed-accuracy trade-off regulated by the cognitive effort of individuals. We also investigate the impact of the interaction network topology on the collective dynamics. To do so, we extend our model and, by using the heterogeneous mean-field approach, we show the presence of another speed-accuracy trade-off regulated by network connectivity. An interesting result is that reduced network connectivity corresponds to an increase in collective decision accuracy.</description>

      <title>Cooperative Multi-Agent Graph Bandits: UCB Algorithm and Regret Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.10383v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we formulate the multi-agent graph bandit problem as a multi-agent extension of the graph bandit problem introduced by Zhang, Johansson, and Li [CISS 57, 1-6 (2023)]. In our formulation, $N$ cooperative agents travel on a connected graph $G$ with $K$ nodes. Upon arrival at each node, agents observe a random reward drawn from a node-dependent probability distribution. The reward of the system is modeled as a weighted sum of the rewards the agents observe, where the weights capture some transformation of the reward associated with multiple agents sampling the same node at the same time. We propose an Upper Confidence Bound (UCB)-based learning algorithm, Multi-G-UCB, and prove that its expected regret over $T$ steps is bounded by $O(\gamma N\log(T)[\sqrt{KT} + DK])$, where $D$ is the diameter of graph $G$ and $\gamma$ a boundedness parameter associated with the weight functions. Lastly, we numerically test our algorithm by comparing it to alternative methods.</description>

      <title>S-Agents: Self-organizing Agents in Open-ended Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.04578v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Leveraging large language models (LLMs), autonomous agents have significantly improved, gaining the ability to handle a variety of tasks. In open-ended settings, optimizing collaboration for efficiency and effectiveness demands flexible adjustments. Despite this, current research mainly emphasizes fixed, task-oriented workflows and overlooks agent-centric organizational structures. Drawing inspiration from human organizational behavior, we introduce a self-organizing agent system (S-Agents) with a "tree of agents" structure for dynamic workflow, an "hourglass agent architecture" for balancing information priorities, and a "non-obstructive collaboration" method to allow asynchronous task execution among agents. This structure can autonomously coordinate a group of agents, efficiently addressing the challenges of open and dynamic environments without human intervention. Our experiments demonstrate that S-Agents proficiently execute collaborative building tasks and resource collection in the Minecraft environment, validating their effectiveness.</description>
