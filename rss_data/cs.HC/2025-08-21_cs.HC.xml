      <title>Using Real Names of Disabled Participant-Contributors to Practice Citational Justice in Accessibility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14257v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In accessibility research involving human subjects, researchers conventionally anonymize their research participants to protect privacy. However, a lack of intentionality about who to publicly acknowledge for intellectual contributions to research can lead to the erasure of disabled individuals' work and knowledge. In this paper, I propose identifying disabled research participants by name (with consent) as a practice of citational justice. I share observations from examples of this practice in accessible visualization research, and offer considerations for when it may be appropriate to de-anonymize. Intentional practices of citation offer researchers an opportunity to acknowledge the expertise and intellectual contributions of disabled people in our communities.</description>

      <title>"They Aren't Built For Me": An Exploratory Study of Strategies for Measurement of Graphical Primitives in Tactile Graphics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14289v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advancements in accessibility technologies such as low-cost swell form printers or refreshable tactile displays promise to allow blind or low-vision (BLV) people to analyze data by transforming visual representations directly to tactile representations. However, it is possible that design guidelines derived from experiments on the visual perception system may not be suited for the tactile perception system. We investigate the potential mismatch between familiar visual encodings and tactile perception in an exploratory study into the strategies employed by BLV people to measure common graphical primitives converted to tactile representations. First, we replicate the Cleveland and McGill study on graphical perception using swell form printing with eleven BLV subjects. Then, we present results from a group interview in which we describe the strategies used by our subjects to read four common chart types. While our results suggest that familiar encodings based on visual perception studies can be useful in tactile graphics, our subjects also expressed a desire to use encodings designed explicitly for BLV people. Based on this study, we identify gaps between the perceptual expectations of common charts and the perceptual tools available in tactile perception. Then, we present a set of guidelines for the design of tactile graphics that accounts for these gaps.

      <title>Exploring Organizational Strategies in Immersive Computational Notebooks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Computational notebooks, which integrate code, documentation, tags, and visualizations into a single document, have become increasingly popular for data analysis tasks. With the advent of immersive technologies, these notebooks have evolved into a new paradigm, enabling more interactive and intuitive ways to perform data analysis. An immersive computational notebook, which integrates computational notebooks within an immersive environment, significantly enhances navigation performance with embodied interactions. However, despite recognizing the significance of organizational strategies in the immersive data science process, the organizational strategies for using immersive notebooks remain largely unexplored. In response, our research aims to deepen our understanding of organizations, especially focusing on spatial structures for computational notebooks, and to examine how various execution orders can be visualized in an immersive context. Through an exploratory user study, we found participants preferred organizing notebooks in half-cylindrical structures and engaged significantly more in non-linear analysis. Notably, as the scale of the notebooks increased (i.e., more code cells), users increasingly adopted multiple, concurrent non-linear analytical approaches.</description>

      <title>NoteIt: A System Converting Instructional Videos to Interactable Notes Through Multimodal Video Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14395v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Users often take notes for instructional videos to access key knowledge later without revisiting long videos. Automated note generation tools enable users to obtain informative notes efficiently. However, notes generated by existing research or off-the-shelf tools fail to preserve the information conveyed in the original videos comprehensively, nor can they satisfy users' expectations for diverse presentation formats and interactive features when using notes digitally. In this work, we present NoteIt, a system, which automatically converts instructional videos to interactable notes using a novel pipeline that faithfully extracts hierarchical structure and multimodal key information from videos. With NoteIt's interface, users can interact with the system to further customize the content and presentation formats of the notes according to their preferences. We conducted both a technical evaluation and a comparison user study (N=36). The solid performance in objective metrics and the positive user feedback demonstrated the effectiveness of the pipeline and the overall usability of NoteIt.

      <title>Detecting Reading-Induced Confusion Using EEG and Eye Tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14442v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Humans regularly navigate an overwhelming amount of information via text media, whether reading articles, browsing social media, or interacting with chatbots. Confusion naturally arises when new information conflicts with or exceeds a reader's comprehension or prior knowledge, posing a challenge for learning. In this study, we present a multimodal investigation of reading-induced confusion using EEG and eye tracking. We collected neural and gaze data from 11 adult participants as they read short paragraphs sampled from diverse, real-world sources. By isolating the N400 event-related potential (ERP), a well-established neural marker of semantic incongruence, and integrating behavioral markers from eye tracking, we provide a detailed analysis of the neural and behavioral correlates of confusion during naturalistic reading. Using machine learning, we show that multimodal (EEG + eye tracking) models improve classification accuracy by 4-22% over unimodal baselines, reaching an average weighted participant accuracy of 77.3% and a best accuracy of 89.6%. Our results highlight the dominance of the brain's temporal regions in these neural signatures of confusion, suggesting avenues for wearable, low-electrode brain-computer interfaces (BCI) for real-time monitoring. These findings lay the foundation for developing adaptive systems that dynamically detect and respond to user confusion, with potential applications in personalized learning, human-computer interaction, and accessibility.</description>

      <title>Towards AI-based Sustainable and XR-based human-centric manufacturing: Implementation of ISO 23247 for digital twins of production systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14580v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since the introduction of Industry 4.0, digital twin technology has significantly evolved, laying the groundwork for a transition toward Industry 5.0 principles centered on human-centricity, sustainability, and resilience. Through digital twins, real-time connected production systems are anticipated to be more efficient, resilient, and sustainable, facilitating communication and connectivity between digital and physical systems. However, environmental performance and integration with virtual reality (VR) and artificial intelligence (AI) of such systems remain challenging. Further exploration of digital twin technologies is needed to validate the real-world impact and benefits. This paper investigates these challenges by implementing a real-time digital twin based on the ISO 23247 standard, connecting the physical factory and simulation software with VR capabilities. This digital twin system provides cognitive assistance and a user-friendly interface for operators, thereby improving cognitive ergonomics. The connection of the Internet of Things (IoT) platform allows the digital twin to have real-time bidirectional communication, collaboration, monitoring, and assistance. A lab-scale drone factory was used as the digital twin application to test and evaluate the ISO 23247 standard and its potential benefits. Additionally, AI integration and environmental performance Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) have been considered as the next stages in improving VR-integrated digital twins. With a solid theoretical foundation and a demonstration of the VR-integrated digital twins, this paper addresses integration issues between various technologies and advances the framework of digital twins based on ISO 23247.</description>

      <title>Topology-Aware Volume Fusion for Spectral Computed Tomography via Histograms and Extremum Graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14719v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photon-Counting Computed Tomography (PCCT) is a novel imaging modality that simultaneously acquires volumetric data at multiple X-ray energy levels, generating separate volumes that capture energy-dependent attenuation properties. Attenuation refers to the reduction in X-ray intensity as it passes through different tissues or materials. This spectral information enhances tissue and material differentiation, enabling more accurate diagnosis and analysis. However, the resulting multivolume datasets are often complex and redundant, making visualization and interpretation challenging. To address these challenges, we propose a method for fusing spectral PCCT data into a single representative volume that enables direct volume rendering and segmentation by leveraging both shared and complementary information across different channels. Our approach starts by computing 2D histograms between pairs of volumes to identify those that exhibit prominent structural features. These histograms reveal relationships and variations that may be difficult to discern from individual volumes alone. Next, we construct an extremum graph from the 2D histogram of two minimally correlated yet complementary volumes-selected to capture both shared and distinct features-thereby maximizing the information content. The graph captures the topological distribution of histogram extrema. By extracting prominent structure within this graph and projecting each grid point in histogram space onto it, we reduce the dimensionality to one, producing a unified volume. This representative volume retains key structural and material characteristics from the original spectral data while significantly reducing the analysis scope from multiple volumes to one. The result is a topology-aware, information-rich fusion of multi-energy CT datasets that facilitates more effective visualization and segmentation.</description>

      <title>From Passive Tool to Socio-cognitive Teammate: A Conceptual Framework for Agentic AI in Human-AI Collaborative Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The role of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in education is undergoing a rapid transformation, moving beyond its historical function as an instructional tool towards a new potential as an active participant in the learning process. This shift is driven by the emergence of agentic AI, autonomous systems capable of proactive, goal-directed action. However, the field lacks a robust conceptual framework to understand, design, and evaluate this new paradigm of human-AI interaction in learning. This paper addresses this gap by proposing a novel conceptual framework (the APCP framework) that charts the transition from AI as a tool to AI as a collaborative partner. We present a four-level model of escalating AI agency within human-AI collaborative learning: (1) the AI as an Adaptive Instrument, (2) the AI as a Proactive Assistant, (3) the AI as a Co-Learner, and (4) the AI as a Peer Collaborator. Grounded in sociocultural theories of learning and Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning (CSCL), this framework provides a structured vocabulary for analysing the shifting roles and responsibilities between human and AI agents. The paper further engages in a critical discussion of the philosophical underpinnings of collaboration, examining whether an AI, lacking genuine consciousness or shared intentionality, can be considered a true collaborator. We conclude that while AI may not achieve authentic phenomenological partnership, it can be designed as a highly effective functional collaborator. This distinction has significant implications for pedagogy, instructional design, and the future research agenda for AI in education, urging a shift in focus towards creating learning environments that harness the complementary strengths of both human and AI.</description>

      <title>Activity Coefficient-based Channel Selection for Electroencephalogram: A Task-Independent Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14060v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals have gained widespread adoption in brain-computer interface (BCI) applications due to their non-invasive, low-cost, and relatively simple acquisition process. The demand for higher spatial resolution, particularly in clinical settings, has led to the development of high-density electrode arrays. However, increasing the number of channels introduces challenges such as cross-channel interference and computational overhead. To address these issues, modern BCI systems often employ channel selection algorithms. Existing methods, however, are typically task-specific and require re-optimization for each new application. This work proposes a task-agnostic channel selection method, Activity Coefficient-based Channel Selection (ACCS), which uses a novel metric called the Channel Activity Coefficient (CAC) to quantify channel utility based on activity levels. By selecting the top 16 channels ranked by CAC, ACCS achieves up to 34.97% improvement in multi-class classification accuracy. Unlike traditional approaches, ACCS identifies a reusable set of informative channels independent of the downstream task or model, making it highly adaptable for diverse EEG-based applications.</description>

      <title>Federated Action Recognition for Smart Worker Assistance Using FastPose</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14113v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In smart manufacturing environments, accurate and real-time recognition of worker actions is essential for productivity, safety, and human-machine collaboration. While skeleton-based human activity recognition (HAR) offers robustness to lighting, viewpoint, and background variations, most existing approaches rely on centralized datasets, which are impractical in privacy-sensitive industrial scenarios. This paper presents a federated learning (FL) framework for pose-based HAR using a custom skeletal dataset of eight industrially relevant upper-body gestures, captured from five participants and processed using a modified FastPose model. Two temporal backbones, an LSTM and a Transformer encoder, are trained and evaluated under four paradigms: centralized, local (per-client), FL with weighted federated averaging (FedAvg), and federated ensemble learning (FedEnsemble). On the global test set, the FL Transformer improves over centralized training by +12.4 percentage points, with FedEnsemble delivering a +16.3 percentage points gain. On an unseen external client, FL and FedEnsemble exceed centralized accuracy by +52.6 and +58.3 percentage points, respectively. These results demonstrate that FL not only preserves privacy but also substantially enhances cross-user generalization, establishing it as a practical solution for scalable, privacy-aware HAR in heterogeneous industrial settings.</description>

      <title>Documenting Deployment with Fabric: A Repository of Real-World AI Governance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14119v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly integrated into society, from financial services and traffic management to creative writing. Academic literature on the deployment of AI has mostly focused on the risks and harms that result from the use of AI. We introduce Fabric, a publicly available repository of deployed AI use cases to outline their governance mechanisms. Through semi-structured interviews with practitioners, we collect an initial set of 20 AI use cases. In addition, we co-design diagrams of the AI workflow with the practitioners. We discuss the oversight mechanisms and guardrails used in practice to safeguard AI use. The Fabric repository includes visual diagrams of AI use cases and descriptions of the deployed systems. Using the repository, we surface gaps in governance and find common patterns in human oversight of deployed AI systems. We intend for Fabric to serve as an extendable, evolving tool for researchers to study the effectiveness of AI governance.</description>

      <title>Who Sees What? Structured Thought-Action Sequences for Epistemic Reasoning in LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14564v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and reasoning frameworks have opened new possibilities for improving the perspective -taking capabilities of autonomous agents. However, tasks that involve active perception, collaborative reasoning, and perspective taking (understanding what another agent can see or knows) pose persistent challenges for current LLM-based systems. This study investigates the potential of structured examples derived from transformed solution graphs generated by the Fast Downward planner to improve the performance of LLM-based agents within a ReAct framework. We propose a structured solution-processing pipeline that generates three distinct categories of examples: optimal goal paths (G-type), informative node paths (E-type), and step-by-step optimal decision sequences contrasting alternative actions (L-type). These solutions are further converted into ``thought-action'' examples by prompting an LLM to explicitly articulate the reasoning behind each decision. While L-type examples slightly reduce clarification requests and overall action steps, they do not yield consistent improvements. Agents are successful in tasks requiring basic attentional filtering but struggle in scenarios that required mentalising about occluded spaces or weighing the costs of epistemic actions. These findings suggest that structured examples alone are insufficient for robust perspective-taking, underscoring the need for explicit belief tracking, cost modelling, and richer environments to enable socially grounded collaboration in LLM-based agents.</description>

      <title>BioSonix: Can Physics-Based Sonification Perceptualize Tissue Deformations From Tool Interactions?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14688v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Perceptualizing tool interactions with deformable structures in surgical procedures remains challenging, as unimodal visualization techniques often fail to capture the complexity of these interactions due to constraints such as occlusion and limited depth perception. This paper presents a novel approach to augment tool navigation in mixed reality environments by providing auditory representations of tool-tissue dynamics, particularly for interactions with soft tissue. BioSonix, a physics-informed design framework, utilizes tissue displacements in 3D space to compute excitation forces for a sound model encoding tissue properties such as stiffness and density. Biomechanical simulations were employed to model particle displacements resulting from tool-tissue interactions, establishing a robust foundation for the method. An optimization approach was used to define configurations for capturing diverse interaction scenarios with varying tool trajectories. Experiments were conducted to validate the accuracy of the sound-displacement mappings. Additionally, two user studies were performed: the first involved two clinical professionals (a neuroradiologist and a cardiologist), who confirmed the method's impact and achieved high task accuracy; the second included 22 biomedical experts, who demonstrated high discrimination accuracy in tissue differentiation and targeting tasks. The results revealed a strong correlation between tool-tissue dynamics and their corresponding auditory profiles, highlighting the potential of these sound representations to enhance the intuitive understanding of complex interactions.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Depression-Diagnosis-Oriented Chat with Psychological State Tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09717v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Depression-diagnosis-oriented chat aims to guide patients in self-expression to collect key symptoms for depression detection. Recent work focuses on combining task-oriented dialogue and chitchat to simulate the interview-based depression diagnosis. Whereas, these methods can not well capture the changing information, feelings, or symptoms of the patient during dialogues. Moreover, no explicit framework has been explored to guide the dialogue, which results in some useless communications that affect the experience. In this paper, we propose to integrate Psychological State Tracking (POST) within the large language model (LLM) to explicitly guide depression-diagnosis-oriented chat. Specifically, the state is adapted from a psychological theoretical model, which consists of four components, namely Stage, Information, Summary and Next. We fine-tune an LLM model to generate the dynamic psychological state, which is further used to assist response generation at each turn to simulate the psychiatrist. Experimental results on the existing benchmark show that our proposed method boosts the performance of all subtasks in depression-diagnosis-oriented chat.</description>

      <title>Management and Visualization Tools for Emergency Medical Services</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09154v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper describes an online tool for the visualization of medical emergency locations, randomly generated sample paths of medical emergencies, and the animation of ambulance movements under the control of various dispatch methods in response to these emergencies. The tool incorporates statistical models for forecasting emergency locations and call arrival times, the simulation of emergency arrivals and ambulance movement trajectories, and the computation and visualization of performance metrics such as ambulance response time distributions. Data for the Rio de Janeiro Emergency Medical Service are available on the website. A user can upload emergency data for any Emergency Medical Service, and can then use the visualization tool to explore the uploaded data. A user can also use the statistical tools and/or the simulation tool with any of the dispatch methods provided, and can then use the visualization tool to explore the computational output. Future enhancements include the ability of a user to embed additional dispatch algorithms into the simulation; the tool can then be used to visualize the simulation results obtained with the newly embedded algorithms.</description>

      <title>Collective Creation of Intimacy: Exploring the Cosplay Commission Practice within the Otome Game Community in China</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00630v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cosplay commission (cos-commission) is a new form of commodified intimate relationship within the Otome game community in China. To explore the motivations, practices, experiences, and challenges, we conducted semi-structured interviews with 15 participants in different roles. Our findings reveal that cos-commission, as a hybrid activity, provides participants with a chance to collaboratively build meaningful connections. It also offers a pathway for personal exploration and emotional recovery. However, the vague boundary between performative roles and intimate interactions can give rise to unexpected negative outcomes, such as attachment-driven entanglements and post-commission ``withdrawal symptoms.'' While digital platforms facilitate communication in cos-commissions, they often lack sufficient safeguards. This preliminary work provides insights into the formation process of hybrid intimate relationship and its potential to foster personalized, long-term support for mental well-being, and reveals potential privacy and safety challenges.</description>

      <title>ReSpark: Leveraging Previous Data Reports as References to Generate New Reports with LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02329v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Creating data reports is a labor-intensive task involving iterative data exploration, insight extraction, and narrative construction. A key challenge lies in composing the analysis logic-from defining objectives and transforming data to identifying and communicating insights. Manually crafting this logic can be cognitively demanding. While experienced analysts often reuse scripts from past projects, finding a perfect match for a new dataset is rare. Even when similar analyses are available online, they usually share only results or visualizations, not the underlying code, making reuse difficult. To address this, we present ReSpark, a system that leverages large language models (LLMs) to reverse-engineer analysis logic from existing reports and adapt it to new datasets. By generating draft analysis steps, ReSpark provides a warm start for users. It also supports interactive refinement, allowing users to inspect intermediate outputs, insert objectives, and revise content. We evaluate ReSpark through comparative and user studies, demonstrating its effectiveness in lowering the barrier to generating data reports without relying on existing analysis code.</description>

      <title>"When I lost it, they dragged me out": How Care Encounters Empower Marginalized Young Adults' Aspiration and Mental Health Care-Seeking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11277v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mental health care-seeking among marginalized young adults has received limited attention in CSCW research. Through in-depth interviews and visual elicitation methods with 18 diverse U.S. participants, our study reveals how marginalized identities shape mental health care-seeking journeys, often characterized by low aspirations and passive care-seeking influenced by lived experiences of marginalization. However, we found the transformative function of "care encounters" - serendipitous interactions with mental health resources that occur when individuals are not actively seeking support. These encounters serve as critical turning points, catalyzing shifts in aspiration and enabling more proactive care-seeking behaviors. Our analysis identifies both the infrastructural conditions that enable transformative care encounters and the aspiration breakdowns that impede care-seeking processes. This work makes conceptual contributions by supplementing traditional motivation-based care-seeking models with a reconceptualization of "care encounters" that accounts for the infrastructural and serendipitous nature of mental health access. We advance understanding of how marginalized identity uniquely influences care-seeking behaviors while providing actionable design implications for embedding technology-mediated "care encounters" into socio-technical interventions that can better support mental health care access for vulnerable populations.</description>

      <title>Hypergraph Multi-Modal Learning for EEG-based Emotion Recognition in Conversation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.21154v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Emotional Recognition in Conversation (ERC) is valuable for diagnosing health conditions such as autism and depression, and for understanding the emotions of individuals who struggle to express their feelings. Current ERC methods primarily rely on semantic, audio and visual data but face significant challenges in integrating physiological signals such as Electroencephalography (EEG). This research proposes Hypergraph Multi-Modal Learning (Hyper-MML), a novel framework for identifying emotions in conversation. Hyper-MML effectively integrates EEG with audio and video information to capture complex emotional dynamics. Firstly, we introduce an Adaptive Brain Encoder with Mutual-cross Attention (ABEMA) module for processing EEG signals. This module captures emotion-relevant features across different frequency bands and adapts to subject-specific variations through hierarchical mutual-cross attention mechanisms. Secondly, we propose an Adaptive Hypergraph Fusion Module (AHFM) to actively model the higher-order relationships among multi-modal signals in ERC. Experimental results on the EAV and AFFEC datasets demonstrate that our Hyper-MML model significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art methods. The proposed Hyper-MML can serve as an effective communication tool for healthcare professionals, enabling better engagement with patients who have difficulty expressing their emotions. The official implementation codes are available at https://github.com/NZWANG/Hyper-MML.</description>

      <title>Biased AI improves human decision-making but reduces trust</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09297v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Current AI systems minimize risk by enforcing ideological neutrality, yet this may introduce automation bias by suppressing cognitive engagement in human decision-making. We conducted randomized trials with 2,500 participants to test whether culturally biased AI enhances human decision-making. Participants interacted with politically diverse GPT-4o variants on information evaluation tasks. Partisan AI assistants enhanced human performance, increased engagement, and reduced evaluative bias compared to non-biased counterparts, with amplified benefits when participants encountered opposing views. These gains carried a trust penalty: participants underappreciated biased AI and overcredited neutral systems. Exposing participants to two AIs whose biases flanked human perspectives closed the perception-performance gap. These findings complicate conventional wisdom about AI neutrality, suggesting that strategic integration of diverse cultural biases may foster improved and resilient human decision-making.</description>

Abstract: We propose a base-shaped robot named "koboshi" that moves everyday objects. This koboshi has a spherical surface in contact with the floor, and by moving a weight inside using built-in motors, it can rock up and down, and side to side. By placing everyday items on this koboshi, users can impart new movement to otherwise static objects. The koboshi is equipped with sensors to measure its posture, enabling interaction with users. Additionally, it has communication capabilities, allowing multiple units to communicate with each other.</description>

      <title>Towards the Use of Saliency Maps for Explaining Low-Quality Electrocardiograms to End Users</title>

      <description>arXiv:2207.02726v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When using medical images for diagnosis, either by clinicians or artificial intelligence (AI) systems, it is important that the images are of high quality. When an image is of low quality, the medical exam that produced the image often needs to be redone. In telemedicine, a common problem is that the quality issue is only flagged once the patient has left the clinic, meaning they must return in order to have the exam redone. This can be especially difficult for people living in remote regions, who make up a substantial portion of the patients at Portal Telemedicina, a digital healthcare organization based in Brazil. In this paper, we report on ongoing work regarding (i) the development of an AI system for flagging and explaining low-quality medical images in real-time, (ii) an interview study to understand the explanation needs of stakeholders using the AI system at OurCompany, and, (iii) a longitudinal user study design to examine the effect of including explanations on the workflow of the technicians in our clinics. To the best of our knowledge, this would be the first longitudinal study on evaluating the effects of XAI methods on end-users -- stakeholders that use AI systems but do not have AI-specific expertise. We welcome feedback and suggestions on our experimental setup.</description>

      <title>Generative AI in K-12 Education: The CyberScholar Initiative</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.19422v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper focuses on the piloting of CyberScholar, a Generative AI assistant tool that aims to provide formative feedback on writing in K-12 contexts. Specifically, this study explores how students worked with CyberScholar in diverse subject areas, including English Language Arts, Social Studies, and Modern World History classes in Grades 7, 8, 10, and 11 in three schools in the Midwest and one in the Northwest of the United States. This paper focuses on CyberScholar's potential to support K-12 students' writing in diverse subject areas requiring written assignments. Data were collected through implementation observations, surveys, and interviews by participating 121 students and 4 teachers. Thematic qualitative analysis revealed that the feedback tool was perceived as a valuable tool for supporting student writing through detailed feedback, enhanced interactivity, and alignment with rubric criteria. Students appreciated the tool's guidance in refining their writing. For the students, the assistant tool suggests restructuring feedback as a dynamic, dialogic process rather than a static evaluation, a shift that aligns with the cyber-social learning idea, self-regulation, and metacognition. For the teaching side, the findings indicate a shift in teachers' roles, from serving primarily as evaluators to guiding AI feedback processes that foster better student writing and critical thinking.</description>

      <title>Hallucinations and Key Information Extraction in Medical Texts: A Comprehensive Assessment of Open-Source Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19061v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Clinical summarization is crucial in healthcare as it distills complex medical data into digestible information, enhancing patient understanding and care management. Large language models (LLMs) have shown significant potential in automating and improving the accuracy of such summarizations due to their advanced natural language understanding capabilities. These models are particularly applicable in the context of summarizing medical/clinical texts, where precise and concise information transfer is essential. In this paper, we investigate the effectiveness of open-source LLMs in extracting key events from discharge reports, including admission reasons, major in-hospital events, and critical follow-up actions. In addition, we also assess the prevalence of various types of hallucinations in the summaries produced by these models. Detecting hallucinations is vital as it directly influences the reliability of the information, potentially affecting patient care and treatment outcomes. We conduct comprehensive simulations to rigorously evaluate the performance of these models, further probing the accuracy and fidelity of the extracted content in clinical summarization. Our results reveal that while the LLMs (e.g., Qwen2.5 and DeepSeek-v2) perform quite well in capturing admission reasons and hospitalization events, they are generally less consistent when it comes to identifying follow-up recommendations, highlighting broader challenges in leveraging LLMs for comprehensive summarization.</description>

      <title>Spore in the Wild: A Case Study of Spore.fun as an Open-Environment Evolution Experiment with Sovereign AI Agents on TEE-Secured Blockchains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04236v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In Artificial Life (ALife) research, replicating Open-Ended Evolution (OEE)-the continuous emergence of novelty observed in biological life-has usually been pursued within isolated, closed system simulations, such as Tierra and Avida, which have typically plateaued after an initial burst of novelty, failing to achieve sustained OEE. Scholars suggest that OEE requires an open-environment system that continually exchanges information or energy with its environment. A recent technological innovation in Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Network (DePIN), which provides permissionless computational substrates, enables the deployment of Large Language Model-based AI agents on blockchains integrated with Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs). This enables on-chain agents to operate autonomously "in the wild," achieving self-sovereignty without human oversight. These agents can control their own social media accounts and cryptocurrency wallets, allowing them to interact directly with blockchain-based financial networks and broader human social media. Building on this new paradigm of on-chain agents, Spore.fun is a recent real-world AI evolution experiment that enables autonomous breeding and evolution of new on-chain agents. This paper presents a detailed case study of Spore.fun, examining agent behaviors and their evolutionary trajectories through digital ethology. We aim to spark discussion about whether open-environment ALife systems "in the wild," based on permissionless computational substrates and driven by economic incentives to interact with their environment, could finally achieve the long-sought goal of OEE.</description>

      <title>From Autonomy to Agency: Agentic Vehicles for Human-Centered Mobility Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04996v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Autonomy, from the Greek autos (self) and nomos (law), refers to the capacity to operate according to internal rules without external control. Accordingly, autonomous vehicles (AuVs) are viewed as vehicular systems capable of perceiving their environment and executing pre-programmed tasks independently of external input. However, both research and real-world deployments increasingly showcase vehicles that demonstrate behaviors beyond this definition (including the SAE levels 0 to 5); Examples of this outpace include the interaction with humans with natural language, goal adaptation, contextual reasoning, external tool use, and unseen ethical dilemma handling, largely empowered by multi-modal large language models (LLMs). These developments reveal a conceptual gap between technical autonomy and the broader cognitive and social capabilities needed for future human-centered mobility systems. To address this gap, this paper introduces the concept of agentic vehicles (AgVs), referring to vehicles that integrate agentic AI systems to reason, adapt, and interact within complex environments. This paper proposes the term AgVs and their distinguishing characteristics from conventional AuVs. It synthesizes relevant advances in integrating LLMs and AuVs and highlights how AgVs might transform future mobility systems and ensure the systems are human-centered. The paper concludes by identifying key challenges in the development and governance of AgVs, and how they can play a significant role in future agentic transportation systems.</description>

Abstract: Social robots are increasingly being deployed in public spaces, where they face not only technological difficulties and unexpected user utterances, but also objections from stakeholders who may not be comfortable with introducing a robot into those spaces. We describe our difficulties with deploying a social robot in two different public settings: 1) Student services center; 2) Refugees and asylum seekers drop-in service. Although this is a failure report, in each use case we eventually managed to earn the trust of the staff and form a relationship with them, allowing us to deploy our robot and conduct our studies.</description>
