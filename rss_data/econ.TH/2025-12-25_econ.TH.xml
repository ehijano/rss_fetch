      <title>Pandora's Box Reopened: Robust Search and Choice Overload</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21192v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper revisits the classic Pandora's box problem, studying a decision-maker (DM) who seeks to minimize her maximal ex-post regret. The DM decides how many options to explore and in what order, before choosing one or taking an outside option. We characterize the regret-minimizing search rule and show that the likelihood of opting out often increases as more options become available for exploration. We show that this ``choice overload" is driven by the DM's fear of ``selection error" -- the regret from searching the wrong options -- suggesting that steering choice via recommendations or cost heterogeneity can mitigate regret and encourage search.</description>

      <title>Welfare at Risk: Distributional impact of policy interventions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20918v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a framewrok for analyzing how the welfare effects of policy interventions are distributed across individuals when those effects are unobserved. Rather than focusing solely on average outcomes, the approach uses readily available information on average welfare responses to uncover meaningful patterns in how gains and losses are distributed across different populations. The framework is built around the concept of superquantile and applies to a broad class of models with unobserved individual heterogeneity. It enables policymakers to identify which groups are most adversely affected by a policy and to evaluate trade-offs between efficiency and equity. We illustrate the approach in three widely studied economic settings: price changes and compensated variation, treatment allocation with self-selection, and the cost-benefit analysis of social programs. In this latter application, we show how standard tools from the marginal treatment effect and generalized Roy model literature are useful for implementing our bounds for both the overall population and for individuals who participate in the program.</description>

      <title>City formation by dual migration of firms and workers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.05292v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies a mathematical model of city formation by migration of firms and workers. The Core-Periphery model in the new economic geography, which considers the single migration of workers driven by real wage inequality among regions, is extended to incorporate the migration of firms driven by real profit inequality among regions. In this dual migration model, it is found that the behavior of the solutions is qualitatively similar to that of solutions of the single migration model, which is frequently used in the new economic geography (NEG). That is, 1) spatially homogeneous distributions of firms and workers become destabilized and eventually form several cities where both firms and workers agglomerate; 2) The number of cities decreases as transport costs decrease. The results have provided a more general theoretical justification for the use of the single migration models in NEG.</description>

      <title>Consistent Opponent Modeling in Imperfect-Information Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17671v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The goal of agents in multi-agent environments is to maximize total reward against the opposing agents that are encountered. Following a game-theoretic solution concept, such as Nash equilibrium, may obtain a strong performance in some settings; however, such approaches fail to capitalize on historical and observed data from repeated interactions against our opponents. Opponent modeling algorithms integrate machine learning techniques to exploit suboptimal opponents utilizing available data; however, the effectiveness of such approaches in imperfect-information games to date is quite limited. We show that existing opponent modeling approaches fail to satisfy a simple desirable property even against static opponents drawn from a known prior distribution; namely, they do not guarantee that the model approaches the opponent's true strategy even in the limit as the number of game iterations approaches infinity. We develop a new algorithm that is able to achieve this property and runs efficiently by solving a convex minimization problem based on the sequence-form game representation using projected gradient descent. The algorithm is guaranteed to efficiently converge to the opponent's true strategy under standard Bayesian identifiability and visitation assumptions, given observations from gameplay and possibly additional historical data if it is available.</description>
