      <title>Anti-concentration applied to roots of randomized derivatives of polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12472v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $(Z^{(n)}_k)_{1 \leq k \leq n}$ be a random set of points and let $\mu_n$ be its \emph{empirical measure}:
  $$\mu_n = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{k=1}^n \delta_{Z^{(n)}_k}. $$
  Let $$P_n(z) := (z - Z^{(n)}_1)\cdots (z - Z^{(n)}_n)\quad \text{and}\quad Q_n (z) := \sum_{k=1}^n \gamma^{(n)}_k \prod_{1 \leq j \leq n, j \neq k} (z- Z^{(n)}_j), $$ where $(\gamma^{(n)}_k)_{1 \leq k \leq n}$ are independent, i.i.d. random variables with Gamma distribution of parameter $\beta/2$, for some fixed $\beta &gt; 0$. We prove that in the case where $\mu_n$ almost surely tends to $\mu$ when $n \rightarrow \infty$, the empirical measure of the complex zeros of the \emph{randomized derivative} $Q_n$ also converges almost surely to $\mu$ when $n$ tends to infinity. Furthermore, for $k = o(n / \log n)$, we obtain that the zeros of the $k-$th \emph{randomized derivative} of $P_n$ converge to the limiting measure $\mu$ in the same sense. We also derive the same conclusion for a variant of the randomized derivative related to the unit circle.</description>

      <title>The SIR epidemic on a dynamic Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12566v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the SIR epidemic on a dynamic inhomogeneous Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random graph, in which vertices are of one of $k$ types and in which edges appear and disappear independently of each other. We establish a functional law of large numbers for the susceptible, infected, and recovered ratio curves after a random time shift, and demonstrate that, under a variety of possible scaling limits of the model parameters, the epidemic curves are solutions to a system of ordinary differential equations. In most scaling regimes, these equations coincide with the classical SIR epidemic equations. In the regime where the average degree of the network remains constant and the edge-flipping dynamics remain on the same time scale as the infectious contact process, however, a novel set of differential equations emerges. This system contains additional quantities related to the infectious edges, but somewhat surprisingly, contains no quantities related to higher-order local network configurations. To the best of our knowledge, this study represents the first thorough and rigorous analysis of large population epidemic processes on dynamic random graphs, although our findings are contingent upon conditioning on a (possibly strict) subset of the event of an epidemic outbreak.</description>

      <title>A rate-distortion framework for MCMC algorithms: geometry and factorization of multivariate Markov chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12589v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a framework rooted in a rate distortion problem for Markov chains, and show how a suite of commonly used Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms are specific instances within it, where the target stationary distribution is controlled by the distortion function. Our approach offers a unified variational view on the optimality of algorithms such as Metropolis-Hastings, Glauber dynamics, the swapping algorithm and Feynman-Kac path models. Along the way, we analyze factorizability and geometry of multivariate Markov chains. Specifically, we demonstrate that induced chains on factors of a product space can be regarded as information projections with respect to a particular divergence. This perspective yields Han--Shearer type inequalities for Markov chains as well as applications in the context of large deviations and mixing time comparison.</description>

      <title>A Central Limit Theorem for Functions on Weighted Sparse Inhomogeneous Random Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12740v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove a central limit theorem for a certain class of functions on sparse rank-one inhomogeneous random graphs endowed with additional i.i.d. edge and vertex weights. Our proof of the central limit theorem uses a perturbative form of Stein's method and relies on a careful analysis of the local structure of the underlying sparse inhomogeneous random graphs (as the number of vertices in the graph tends to infinity), which may be of independent interest, as well as a local approximation property of the function, which is satisfied for a number of combinatorial optimisation problems. These results extend recent work by Cao (2021) for Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random graphs and additional i.i.d. weights only on the edges.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12764v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, for a class of $ d $-dimensional $ G $-Brownian motions, we introduce $ G $-Bessel processes. Under the condition of dimensionality $ d $, we obtain that the $ G $-Bessel process is the solution of a stochastic differential equation. Moreover, under the more strict condition of dimensionality $ d $, we get the uniqueness of the solution of stochastic differential equations governing $ G $-Bessel processes and the nonattainability of the origin of $ G $-Brownian motion.</description>

      <title>Optimal single threshold stopping rules and sharp prophet inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12949v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper considers a finite horizon optimal stopping problem for a sequence of independent and identically distributed random variables. The objective is to design stopping rules that attempt to select the random variable with the highest value in the sequence. The performance of any stopping rule may be benchmarked relative to the selection of a "prophet" that has perfect foreknowledge of the largest value. Such comparisons are typically stated in the form of "prophet inequalities." In this paper we characterize sharp prophet inequalities for single threshold stopping rules as solutions to infinite two person zero sum games on the unit square with special payoff kernels. The proposed game theoretic characterization allows one to derive sharp non-asymptotic prophet inequalities for different classes of distributions. This, in turn, gives rise to a simple and computationally tractable algorithmic paradigm for deriving optimal single threshold stopping rules. Our results also indicate that several classical observations in the literature are either incorrect or incomplete in treating this problem.</description>

      <title>On the McKean-Vlasov SDE with branching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12964v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a nonlinear branching diffusion process in the sense of McKean, i.e., where particles are subjected to a mean-field interaction. We consider first a strong formulation of the problem and we provide an existence and uniqueness result by using contraction arguments. Then we consider the notion of weak solution and its equivalent martingale problem formulation. In this setting, we provide a general weak existence result, as well as a propagation of chaos property, i.e., the McKean-Vlasov branching diffusion is the limit of a large population branching process with mean-field interaction when the population size grows to infinity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12985v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish a result for existence and uniqueness of stochastic differential equations on Riemannian manifolds, for regular inhomogeneous tensor coefficients with stochastic drift, under geometrical-only hypothesis on the manifold, so-called manifolds of bounded geometry, this hypothesis is consistent with the maximal regularity result for parabolic equations obtained by Herbert Amann. Furthermore, we provide a stochastic flow estimate for the solutions.</description>

      <title>Mean-field Potts and random-cluster dynamics from high-entropy initializations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13014v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A common obstruction to efficient sampling from high-dimensional distributions is the multimodality of the target distribution because Markov chains may get trapped far from stationarity. Still, one hopes that this is only a barrier to the mixing of Markov chains from worst-case initializations and can be overcome by choosing high-entropy initializations, e.g., a product or weakly correlated distribution. Ideally, from such initializations, the dynamics would escape from the saddle points separating modes quickly and spread its mass between the dominant modes.
  In this paper, we study convergence from high-entropy initializations for the random-cluster and Potts models on the complete graph -- two extensively studied high-dimensional landscapes that pose many complexities like discontinuous phase transitions and asymmetric metastable modes. We study the Chayes--Machta and Swendsen--Wang dynamics for the mean-field random-cluster model and the Glauber dynamics for the Potts model. We sharply characterize the set of product measure initializations from which these Markov chains mix rapidly, even though their mixing times from worst-case initializations are exponentially slow. Our proofs require careful approximations of projections of high-dimensional Markov chains (which are not themselves Markovian) by tractable 1-dimensional random processes, followed by analysis of the latter's escape from saddle points separating stable modes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12418v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This thesis studies the graph alignment problem, the noisy version of the graph isomorphism problem, which aims to find a matching between the nodes of two graphs which preserves most of the edges. Focusing on the planted version where the graphs are random, we are interested in understanding the fundamental information-theoretical limits for this problem, as well as designing and analyzing algorithms that are able to recover the underlying alignment in the data. For these algorithms, we give some high probability guarantees on the regime in which they succeed or fail.</description>

      <title>The Positivity of the Neural Tangent Kernel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12928v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) has emerged as a fundamental concept in the study of wide Neural Networks. In particular, it is known that the positivity of the NTK is directly related to the memorization capacity of sufficiently wide networks, i.e., to the possibility of reaching zero loss in training, via gradient descent. Here we will improve on previous works and obtain a sharp result concerning the positivity of the NTK of feedforward networks of any depth. More precisely, we will show that, for any non-polynomial activation function, the NTK is strictly positive definite. Our results are based on a novel characterization of polynomial functions which is of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Exponential convergence in Wasserstein Distance for Diffusion Semigroups with Irregular Drifts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.10190</link>
      <description>arXiv:1812.10190v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The exponential contraction in $L^1$-Wasserstein distance and exponential convergence in $L^q$-Wasserstein distance ($q\geq 1$) are considered for stochastic differential equations with irregular drift. When the irregular drift drift is locally bounded, the exponential convergence are derived by using the reflection coupling with a new auxiliary function for stochastic differential equations driven by multiplicative noise. Explicit convergence rate is obtained. When the irregular drift is not locally bounded, a new Zvonkin's transformation is given by an ultracontractive reference diffusion, and the exponential convergence is derived by combining the Zvonkin's transformation and related results for stochastic differential equations with locally bounded irregular drift.</description>

      <title>Almost sure central limit theorem for the hyperbolic Anderson model with L\'evy white noise</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.10784v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we present an almost sure central limit theorem (ASCLT) for the hyperbolic Anderson model (HAM) with a L\'evy white noise in a finite-variance setting, complementing a recent work by Balan and Zheng (\emph{Trans.~Amer.~Math.~Soc.}, 2024) on the (quantitative) central limit theorems for the solution to the HAM. We provide two different proofs: one uses the Clark-Ocone formula and takes advantage of the martingale structure of the white-in-time noise, while the other is obtained by combining the second-order Gaussian Poincar\'e inequality with Ibragimov and Lifshits' method of characteristic functions. Both approaches are different from the one developed in the PhD thesis of C. Zheng (2011), allowing us to establish the ASCLT without lengthy computations of star contractions. Moreover, the second approach is expected to be useful for similar studies on SPDEs with colored-in-time noises, whereas the former, based on It\^o calculus, is not applicable.</description>

      <title>Maximal Inequalities for Empirical Processes under General Mixing Conditions with an Application to Strong Approximations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.11394v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper provides a bound for the supremum of sample averages over a class of functions for a general class of mixing stochastic processes with arbitrary mixing rates. Regardless of the speed of mixing, the bound is comprised of a concentration rate and a novel measure of complexity. The speed of mixing, however, affects the former quantity implying a phase transition. Fast mixing leads to the standard root-n concentration rate, while slow mixing leads to a slower concentration rate, its speed depends on the mixing structure. Our findings are applied to derive strong approximation results for a general class of mixing processes with arbitrary mixing rates.</description>

      <title>Least Non-Zero Singular Value and the Distribution of Eigenvectors of non-Hermitian Random Matrices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.01149v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We obtain a tail bound for the least non-zero singular value of $A-z$ when $A$ is a random matrix and $z$ is an eigenvalue of $A$ in a neighbourhood of a given point $z_0$ in the bulk of the spectrum. The argument relies on a resolvent comparison and a tail bound for Gauss-divisible matrices. The latter can be obtained by the method of partial Schur decomposition. Using this bound we prove that any finite collection of components of a right eigenvector corresponding to an eigenvalue uniformly sampled from a neighbourhood of a point in the bulk is Gaussian. A byproduct of the calculation is an asymptotic formula for the odd moments of the absolute value of the characteristic polynomial of real Gauss-divisible matrices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12279v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two conjectures are presented. The first, Conjecture 1, is that the pushforward of a geometric distribution on the integers under $n$ Collatz iterates, modulo $2^p$, is usefully close to uniform distribution on the integers modulo $2^p$, if $p/n$ is small enough. Conjecture 2 is that the density is bounded from zero for the incidence of both $0$ and $1$ for the coefficients in the dyadic expansions of $-3^{-\ell }$ on all but an exponentially small set of paths of a geometrically distributed random walk on the two-dimensional array of these coefficients. It is shown that Conjecture 2 implies Conjecture 1. At present, Conjecture 2 is unresolved.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a new variant of the weak optimal transport problem where mass is distributed from one space to the other through unnormalized kernels. We give sufficient conditions for primal attainment and prove a dual formula for this transport problem. We also obtain dual attainment conditions for some specific cost functions. As a byproduct we obtain a transport characterization of the stochastic order defined by convex positively 1-homogenous functions, in the spirit of Strassen theorem for convex domination.</description>

      <title>Limit shape for regularisation of large partitions under the Plancherel measure</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.07115v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A celebrated result of Kerov-Vershik and Logan-Shepp gives an asymptotic shape for large partitions under the Plancherel measure. We prove that when we consider $e$-regularisations of such partitions we still have a convex limit shape, which is given by a shaking of the Kerov-Vershik-Logan-Shepp curve. We deduce an explicit form for the first asymptotics of the length of the first rows and the first columns for the $e$-regularisation.</description>

Abstract: In recent years, many Machine Learning (ML) explanation techniques have been designed using ideas from cooperative game theory. These game-theoretic explainers suffer from high complexity, hindering their exact computation in practical settings. In our work, we focus on a wide class of linear game values, as well as coalitional values, for the marginal game based on a given ML model and predictor vector. By viewing these explainers as expectations over appropriate sample spaces, we design a novel Monte Carlo sampling algorithm that estimates them at a reduced complexity that depends linearly on the size of the background dataset. We set up a rigorous framework for the statistical analysis and obtain error bounds for our sampling methods. The advantage of this approach is that it is fast, easily implementable, and model-agnostic. Furthermore, it has similar statistical accuracy as other known estimation techniques that are more complex and model-specific. We provide rigorous proofs of statistical convergence, as well as numerical experiments whose results agree with our theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Equalised Odds is not Equal Individual Odds: Post-processing for Group and Individual Fairness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.09779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.09779v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Group fairness is achieved by equalising prediction distributions between protected sub-populations; individual fairness requires treating similar individuals alike. These two objectives, however, are incompatible when a scoring model is calibrated through discontinuous probability functions, where individuals can be randomly assigned an outcome determined by a fixed probability. This procedure may provide two similar individuals from the same protected group with classification odds that are disparately different -- a clear violation of individual fairness. Assigning unique odds to each protected sub-population may also prevent members of one sub-population from ever receiving equal chances of a positive outcome to another, which we argue is another type of unfairness called individual odds. We reconcile all this by constructing continuous probability functions between group thresholds that are constrained by their Lipschitz constant. Our solution preserves the model's predictive power, individual fairness and robustness while ensuring group fairness.</description>

      <title>Geodesic slice sampling on Riemannian manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.00417v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a theoretically justified and practically applicable slice sampling based Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method for approximate sampling from probability measures on Riemannian manifolds. The latter naturally arise as posterior distributions in Bayesian inference of matrix-valued parameters, for example belonging to either the Stiefel or the Grassmann manifold. Our method, called geodesic slice sampling, is reversible with respect to the distribution of interest, and generalizes Hit-and-run slice sampling on $\mathbb{R}^{d}$ to Riemannian manifolds by using geodesics instead of straight lines. We demonstrate the robustness of our sampler's performance compared to other MCMC methods dealing with manifold valued distributions through extensive numerical experiments, on both synthetic and real data. In particular, we illustrate its remarkable ability to cope with anisotropic target densities, without using gradient information and preconditioning.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic estimates of the diameters of the Rubik's Cube groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07337v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The diameter of the Cayley graph of the Rubik's Cube group is the fewest number of turns needed to solve the Cube from any initial configurations. For the 2$\times$2$\times$2 Cube, the diameter is 11 in the half-turn metric, 14 in the quarter-turn metric, 19 in the semi-quarter-turn metric, and 10 in the bi-quarter-turn metric. For the 3$\times$3$\times$3 Cube, the diameter was determined by Rokicki et al. to be 20 in the half-turn metric and 26 in the quarter-turn metric. This study shows that a modified version of the coupon collector's problem in probabilistic theory can predict the diameters correctly for both 2$\times$2$\times$2 and 3$\times$3$\times$3 Cubes insofar as the quarter-turn metric is adopted. In the half-turn metric, the diameters are overestimated by one and two, respectively, for the 2$\times$2$\times$2 and 3$\times$3$\times$3 Cubes, whereas for the 2$\times$2$\times$2 Cube in the semi-quarter-turn and bi-quarter-turn metrics, they are overestimated by two and underestimated by one, respectively. Invoking the same probabilistic logic, the diameters of the 4$\times$4$\times$4 and 5$\times$5$\times$5 Cubes are predicted to be 48 (41) and 68 (58) in the quarter-turn (half-turn) metric, whose precise determinations are far beyond reach of classical supercomputing. It is shown that the probabilistically estimated diameter is approximated by $\ln N / \ln r + \ln N / r$, where $N$ is the number of configurations and $r$ is the branching ratio.</description>
