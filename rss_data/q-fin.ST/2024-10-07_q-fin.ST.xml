      <title>Joint multifractality in the cross-correlations between grains \&amp; oilseeds indices and external uncertainties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02798v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the relationships between agricultural spot markets and external uncertainties via the multifractal detrending moving-average cross-correlation analysis (MF-X-DMA). The dataset contains the Grains \&amp; Oilseeds Index (GOI) and its five sub-indices of wheat, maize, soyabeans, rice, and barley. Moreover, we use three uncertainty proxies, namely, economic policy uncertainty (EPU), geopolitical risk (GPR), and volatility Index (VIX). We observe the presence of multifractal cross-correlations between agricultural markets and uncertainties. Further, statistical tests show that maize has intrinsic joint multifractality with all the uncertainty proxies, exhibiting a high degree of sensitivity. Additionally, intrinsic multifractality among GOI-GPR, wheat-GPR and soyabeans-VIX is illustrated. However, other series have apparent multifractal cross-correlations with high possibilities. Moreover, our analysis suggests that among the three kinds of external uncertainties, geopolitical risk has a relatively stronger association with grain prices.</description>

      <title>A Spatio-Temporal Machine Learning Model for Mortgage Credit Risk: Default Probabilities and Loan Portfolios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02846v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel machine learning model for credit risk by combining tree-boosting with a latent spatio-temporal Gaussian process model accounting for frailty correlation. This allows for modeling non-linearities and interactions among predictor variables in a flexible data-driven manner and for accounting for spatio-temporal variation that is not explained by observable predictor variables. We also show how estimation and prediction can be done in a computationally efficient manner. In an application to a large U.S. mortgage credit risk data set, we find that both predictive default probabilities for individual loans and predictive loan portfolio loss distributions obtained with our novel approach are more accurate compared to conventional independent linear hazard models and also linear spatio-temporal models. Using interpretability tools for machine learning models, we find that the likely reasons for this outperformance are strong interaction and non-linear effects in the predictor variables and the presence of large spatio-temporal frailty effects.</description>
