      <title>Evolution of time-fractional stochastic hyperbolic diffusion equations on the unit sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05817v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper examines the temporal evolution of a two-stage stochastic model for spherical random fields. The model uses a time-fractional stochastic hyperbolic diffusion equation, which describes the evolution of spherical random fields on $\bS^2$ in time. The diffusion operator incorporates a time-fractional derivative in the Caputo sense. In the first stage of the model, a homogeneous problem is considered, with an isotropic Gaussian random field on $\bS^2$ serving as the initial condition. In the second stage, the model transitions to an inhomogeneous problem driven by a time-delayed Brownian motion on $\bS^2$. The solution to the model is expressed through a series of real spherical harmonics. To obtain an approximation, the expansion of the solution is truncated at a certain degree $L\geq1$. The analysis of truncation errors reveals their convergence behavior, showing that convergence rates are affected by the decay of the angular power spectra of the driving noise and the initial condition. In addition, we investigate the sample properties of the stochastic solution, demonstrating that, under some conditions, there exists a local H\"{o}lder continuous modification of the solution. To illustrate the theoretical findings, numerical examples and simulations inspired by the cosmic microwave background (CMB) are presented.</description>

      <title>The buckling and clamped plate problems on differential forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05612v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend the buckling and clamped-plate problems to the context of differential forms on compact Riemannian manifolds with smooth boundary. We characterize their smallest eigenvalues and prove that, in the case of Euclidean domains, their spectra on forms coincide with the spectra of the corresponding problems. We obtain various estimates involving the first eigenvalues of the mentioned problems and the ones of the Hodge Laplacian with respect to Dirichlet and absolute boundary conditions on forms. These estimates generalize previous ones in the case of functions.</description>

      <title>Convex sets can have interior hot spots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06344v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The hot spots conjecture asserts that for any convex bounded domain $\Omega$ in $\mathbb R^d$, the first non-trivial Neumann eigenfunction of the Laplace operator in $\Omega$ attains its maximum at the boundary. We construct counterexamples to the conjecture for all sufficiently large values of $d$. The construction is based on an extension of the conjecture from convex sets to log-concave measures.</description>

      <title>Minimization of the first eigenvalue for the Lam\'e system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06437v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we address the problem of determining a domain in $\mathbb{R}^N$ that minimizes the first eigenvalue of the Lam\'e system under a volume constraint. We begin by establishing the existence of such an optimal domain within the class of quasi-open sets, showing that in the physically relevant dimensions $N = 2$ and $3$, the optimal domain is indeed an open set. Additionally, we derive both first and second-order optimality conditions. Leveraging these conditions, we demonstrate that in two dimensions, the disk cannot be the optimal shape when the Poisson ratio is below a specific threshold, whereas above this value, it serves as a local minimizer. We also extend our analysis to show that the disk is nonoptimal for Poisson ratios $\nu$ satisfying $\nu \leq 0.4$.</description>

      <title>Numerical Optimization of Eigenvalues of the magnetic Dirichlet Laplacian with constant magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06533v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present numerical minimizers for the first seven eigenvalues of the magnetic Dirichlet Laplacian with constant magnetic field in a wide range of field strengths. Adapting an approach by Antunes and Freitas, we use gradient descent for the minimization procedure together with the Method of Fundamental solutions for eigenvalue computation. Remarkably, we observe that when the magnetic flux exceeds the index of the target eigenvalue, the minimizer is always a disk.</description>

      <title>Spectral characterization of quaternionic positive definite functions on the real line</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.08949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2010.08949v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with the spectral characteristics of quaternionic positive definite functions on the real line. We generalize the Stone's theorem to the case of a right quaternionic linear one-parameter unitary group via two different types of functional calculus. From the generalized Stone's theorems we obtain a correspondence between continuous quaternionic positive definite functions and spectral systems, i.e., unions of a spectral measure and a unitary anti-self-adjoint operator that commute with each other; and then deduce that the Fourier transform of a continuous quaternionic positive definite function is an unusual type of quaternion-valued measure which can be described equivalently in two different ways. One is related to spectral systems (induced by the first generalized Stone's theorem), the other is related to non-negative finite Borel measures (induced by the second generalized Stone's theorem). An application to weakly stationary quaternionic random processes is also presented.</description>

      <title>Joins of normal matrices, their spectrum, and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.04181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.04181v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by studies of oscillator networks, we study the spectrum of the join of several normal matrices with constant row sums. We apply our results to compute the characteristic polynomial of the join of several regular graphs. We then use this theorem to study several problems in spectral graph theory. In particular, we provide some simple constructions of Ramanujan graphs and give new proofs for some theorems in the classical book of Cvetkovi\'{c}, Rowlinson, and Slobodan.</description>

      <title>Hallucination Detox: Sensitive Neuron Dropout (SeND) for Large Language Model Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15460v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed across various industries, concerns regarding their reliability, particularly due to hallucinations - outputs that are factually inaccurate or irrelevant to user input - have grown. Our research investigates the relationship between the training process and the emergence of hallucinations to address a key gap in existing research that focuses primarily on post hoc detection and mitigation strategies. Using models from the Pythia suite (70M - 12B parameters) and several hallucination detection metrics, we analyze hallucination trends throughout training and explore LLM internal dynamics. We introduce Sensitivity Dropout (SenD), a novel training protocol designed to mitigate hallucinations by reducing variance during training. SenD achieves this by deterministically dropping embedding indices with significant variability, referred to as Sensitive Embedding Indices. In addition, we develop an unsupervised hallucination detection metric, Efficient EigenScore (EES), which approximates the traditional EigenScore at 2x speed. This efficient metric is integrated into our protocol, allowing SenD to be both computationally scalable and effective at reducing hallucinations. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates that our approach improves LLM reliability at test time by up to 40% compared to normal training while also providing an efficient method to improve factual accuracy when adapting LLMs to Wikipedia, Medical, and LegalBench domains.</description>
