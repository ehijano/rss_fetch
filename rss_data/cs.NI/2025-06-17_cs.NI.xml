      <title>Multi-domain anomaly detection in a 5G network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the advent of 5G, mobile networks are becoming more dynamic and will therefore present a wider attack surface. To secure these new systems, we propose a multi-domain anomaly detection method that is distinguished by the study of traffic correlation on three dimensions: temporal by analyzing message sequences, semantic by abstracting the parameters these messages contain, and topological by linking them in the form of a graph. Unlike traditional approaches, which are limited to considering these domains independently, our method studies their correlations to obtain a global, coherent and explainable view of anomalies.</description>

      <title>Mobile Traffic Prediction using LLMs with Efficient In-context Demonstration Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12074v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mobile traffic prediction is an important enabler for optimizing resource allocation and improving energy efficiency in mobile wireless networks. Building on the advanced contextual understanding and generative capabilities of large language models (LLMs), this work introduces a context-aware wireless traffic prediction framework powered by LLMs. To further enhance prediction accuracy, we leverage in-context learning (ICL) and develop a novel two-step demonstration selection strategy, optimizing the performance of LLM-based predictions. The initial step involves selecting ICL demonstrations using the effectiveness rule, followed by a second step that determines whether the chosen demonstrations should be utilized, based on the informativeness rule. We also provide an analytical framework for both informativeness and effectiveness rules. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is demonstrated with a real-world fifth-generation (5G) dataset with different application scenarios. According to the numerical results, the proposed framework shows lower mean squared error and higher R2-Scores compared to the zero-shot prediction method and other demonstration selection methods, such as constant ICL demonstration selection and distance-only-based ICL demonstration selection.</description>

      <title>Latency Optimization for Wireless Federated Learning in Multihop Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12081v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a novel latency minimization problem in wireless federated learning (FL) across multi-hop networks. The system comprises multiple routes, each integrating leaf and relay nodes for FL model training. We explore a personalized learning and adaptive aggregation-aware FL (PAFL) framework that effectively addresses data heterogeneity across participating nodes by harmonizing individual and collective learning objectives. We formulate an optimization problem aimed at minimizing system latency through the joint optimization of leaf and relay nodes, as well as relay routing indicator. We also incorporate an additional energy harvesting scheme for the relay nodes to help with their relay tasks. This formulation presents a computationally demanding challenge, and thus we develop a simple yet efficient algorithm based on block coordinate descent and successive convex approximation (SCA) techniques. Simulation results illustrate the efficacy of our proposed joint optimization approach for leaf and relay nodes with relay routing indicator. We observe significant latency savings in the wireless multi-hop PAFL system, with reductions of up to 69.37% compared to schemes optimizing only one node type, traditional greedy algorithm, and scheme without relay routing indicator.</description>

      <title>Real-Time Capable, Low-latency Upstream Scheduling in Multi-Tenant, SLA Compliant TWDM PON</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Virtualized Passive Optical Networks (vPONs) offer a promising solution for modern access networks, bringing enhanced flexibility, reduced capital expenditures (CapEx), and support for multi-tenancy. By decoupling network functions from physical infrastructure, vPONs enable service providers to efficiently share network resources among multiple tenants. In this paper, we propose a novel merging DBA algorithm, called the Dynamic Time and Wavelength Allocation (DTWA) algorithm, for a virtualized DBA (vDBA) architecture in multi-tenant PON environments. The Algorithm, which enables the merging of multiple virtual DBAs into a physical bandwidth map, introduces multi-channel support, allowing each Optical Network Unit (ONU) to dynamically change, taking into consideration different switching times, transmission wavelength. Leveraging the Numba APIs for high-performance optimization, the algorithm achieves real-time performance with minimal additional latency, meeting the stringent requirements of SLA-compliant, latency-critical 6G applications and services. Our analysis highlights an important trade-off in terms of throughput in multi-tenant conditions, between single-channel vs. multi-channel PONs, as a function of ONUs tuning time. We also compare the performance of our algorithm for different traffic distributions. Finally, in order to assess the time computing penalty of dynamic wavelength optimisation in the merging DBA algorithm, we compare it against a baseline Static Wavelength Allocation (SWA) algorithm, where ONUs are designated a fixed wavelength for transmission.</description>

      <title>Surfing the SWAVES: Lifecycle-aware Service Placement in MEC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC) networks, users covered by a mobile network can exploit edge clouds (ECs), computational resources located at the network's edge, to execute virtual network functions (VNFs). ECs are particularly useful when deploying VNFs with strict delay and availability requirements. As users roam in the network and get handed over between cells, deployed VNFs must follow users to retain the benefits of edge computing. Yet, having VNFs ready at the closest EC can be challenging: (i) ECs are not usually powerful enough to store and run any combination of VNFs simultaneously; (ii) if a VNF is not available at the needed EC, a series of time-consuming operations has to be performed before the VNF becomes operational. These limitations can be addressed by proactively starting VNFs instances at (likely) future locations, balancing better latency properties against higher resource usage. Such proactive deployment does need forecasting of user movements, but these will be imperfect, creating yet another tradeoff. We present our approach to this service provisioning problem, SWAVES. When compared on the ratio of users' unsuccessful packets, SWAVES improves such metric by orders of magnitude with respect to other proposed heuristic.</description>

      <title>NR Cell Identity-based Handover Decision-making Algorithm for High-speed Scenario within Dual Connectivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12461v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dense deployment of 5G heterogeneous networks (HetNets) has improved network capacity. However, it also brings frequent and unnecessary handover challenges to high-speed mobile user equipment (UE), resulting in unstable communication and degraded quality of service. Traditional handovers ignore the type of target next-generation Node B (gNB), resulting in high-speed UEs being able to be handed over to any gNB. This paper proposes a NR cell identity (NCI)-based handover decision-making algorithm (HDMA) to address this issue. The proposed HDMA identifies the type of the target gNB (macro/small/mmWave gNB) using the gNB identity (ID) within the NCI to improve the handover decision-making strategy. The proposed HDMA aims to improve the communication stability of high-speed mobile UE by enabling high-speed UEs to identify the target gNB type during the HDMA using the gNB ID. Simulation results show that the proposed HDMA outperforms other HDMAs in enhanced connection stability.</description>

      <title>Learning Best Paths in Quantum Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12462v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum networks (QNs) transmit delicate quantum information across noisy quantum channels. Crucial applications, like quantum key distribution (QKD) and distributed quantum computation (DQC), rely on efficient quantum information transmission. Learning the best path between a pair of end nodes in a QN is key to enhancing such applications. This paper addresses learning the best path in a QN in the online learning setting. We explore two types of feedback: "link-level" and "path-level". Link-level feedback pertains to QNs with advanced quantum switches that enable link-level benchmarking. Path-level feedback, on the other hand, is associated with basic quantum switches that permit only path-level benchmarking. We introduce two online learning algorithms, BeQuP-Link and BeQuP-Path, to identify the best path using link-level and path-level feedback, respectively. To learn the best path, BeQuP-Link benchmarks the critical links dynamically, while BeQuP-Path relies on a subroutine, transferring path-level observations to estimate link-level parameters in a batch manner. We analyze the quantum resource complexity of these algorithms and demonstrate that both can efficiently and, with high probability, determine the best path. Finally, we perform NetSquid-based simulations and validate that both algorithms accurately and efficiently identify the best path.</description>

      <title>Cost-Efficient Design for 5G-Enabled MEC Servers under Uncertain User Demands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13003v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mobile edge computing (MEC) enhances the performance of 5G networks by enabling low-latency, high-speed services through deploying data units of the base station on edge servers located near mobile users. However, determining the optimal capacity of these servers while dynamically offloading tasks and allocating computing resources to meet uncertain user demands presents significant challenges. This paper focuses on the design and planning of edge servers with the dual objectives of minimizing capacity requirements and reducing service latency for 5G services. To handle the complexity of uncertain user demands, we formulate the problem as a two-stage stochastic model, which can be linearized into a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) problem. We propose a novel approach called accelerated Benders decomposition (ABD) to solve the problem at a large network scale. Numerical experiments demonstrate that ABD achieves the optimal solution of MILP while significantly reducing computation time.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Preference Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning for Internet Network Management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An internet network service provider manages its network with multiple objectives, such as high quality of service (QoS) and minimum computing resource usage. To achieve these objectives, a reinforcement learning-based (RL) algorithm has been proposed to train its network management agent. Usually, their algorithms optimize their agents with respect to a single static reward formulation consisting of multiple objectives with fixed importance factors, which we call preferences. However, in practice, the preference could vary according to network status, external concerns and so on. For example, when a server shuts down and it can cause other servers' traffic overloads leading to additional shutdowns, it is plausible to reduce the preference of QoS while increasing the preference of minimum computing resource usages. In this paper, we propose new RL-based network management agents that can select actions based on both states and preferences. With our proposed approach, we expect a single agent to generalize on various states and preferences. Furthermore, we propose a numerical method that can estimate the distribution of preference that is advantageous for unbiased training. Our experiment results show that the RL agents trained based on our proposed approach significantly generalize better with various preferences than the previous RL approaches, which assume static preference during training. Moreover, we demonstrate several analyses that show the advantages of our numerical estimation method.</description>

      <title>Joint Optimization of Multi-UAV Deployment and 3D Positioning in Traffic-Aware Aerial Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13287v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have emerged as a key enabler for next-generation wireless networks due to their on-demand deployment, high mobility, and ability to provide Line-of-Sight (LoS) connectivity. These features make UAVs particularly well-suited for dynamic and mission-critical applications such as intelligent transportation systems and emergency communications. However, effectively positioning multiple UAVs in real-time to meet non-uniform, time-varying traffic demands remains a significant challenge, especially when aiming to optimize network throughput and resource utilization. In this paper, we propose an Efficient Multi-UAV Traffic-Aware Deployment (EMTAD) Algorithm, a scalable and adaptive framework that dynamically adjusts UAV placements based on real-time user locations and spatial traffic distribution. In contrast to existing methods, EMTAD jointly optimizes UAV positioning and minimizes the number of deployed UAVs, ensuring efficient UE-UAV association while satisfying the traffic demand of users. Simulation results demonstrate that EMTAD significantly improves network performance while reducing deployment overhead by minimizing the number of UAVs required in dynamic and traffic-aware environments.</description>

      <title>Delay-optimal Congestion-aware Routing and Computation Offloading in Arbitrary Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Emerging edge computing paradigms enable heterogeneous devices to collaborate on complex computation applications. However, for arbitrary heterogeneous edge networks, delay-optimal forwarding and computation offloading remains an open problem. In this paper, we jointly optimize data/result routing and computation placement in arbitrary networks with heterogeneous node capabilities, and congestion-dependent nonlinear transmission and processing delay. Despite the non-convexity of the formulated problem, based on analyzing the KKT condition, we provide a set of sufficient optimality conditions that solve the problem globally. To provide the insights for such global optimality, we show that the proposed non-convex problem is geodesic-convex with mild assumptions. We also show that the proposed sufficient optimality condition leads to a lower hemicontinuous solution set, providing stability against user-input perturbation. We then extend the framework to incorporate utility-based congestion control and fairness. A fully distributed algorithm is developed to converge to the global optimum. Numerical results demonstrate significant improvements over multiple baselines algorithms.</description>

      <title>C2PO: Coherent Co-packaged Optics using offset-QAM-16 for Beyond PAM-4 Optical I/O</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12160v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Co-packaged optics (CPO) has emerged as a promising solution for achieving the ultra-high bandwidths, shoreline densities, and energy efficiencies required by future GPUs and network switches for AI. Microring modulators (MRMs) are well suited for transmitters due to their compact size, high energy efficiency, and natural compatibility with dense wavelength-division multiplexing (DWDM). However, extending beyond the recently demonstrated 200 Gb/s will require more advanced modulation formats, such as higher-order coherent modulation (e.g., QAM-16).
  In this work, we show how microring resonators (MRMs) can be efficiently used to implement phase-constant amplitude modulators and form the building blocks of a transmitter for offset QAM-16, which has been shown to simplify carrier-phase recovery relative to conventional QAM. We simulate and evaluate the performance of our proposed MRM-based coherent CPO (C2PO) transmitters using a foundry-provided commercial silicon photonics process, demonstrating an input-normalized electric field amplitude contrast of 0.64 per dimension. Through full link-level bit error rate modeling, we show that our design achieves 400 Gb/s using offset QAM-16 at a total optical laser power of 9.65 dBm-comparable to that required by conventional QAM-16 MZI-based links, despite using 10-100x less area. We further conduct a thermal simulation to assess the transmitter's thermal stability at the MRM input optical power required to meet a target BER at the desired data rates. Finally, as a proof of concept, we demonstrate 25 Gb/s MRM-based offset QAM-4 modulation with a chip fabricated in the GlobalFoundries 45 nm monolithic silicon photonics process.</description>

      <title>OSI Stack Redesign for Quantum Networks: Requirements, Technologies, Challenges, and Future Directions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12195v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum communication is poised to become a foundational element of next-generation networking, offering transformative capabilities in security, entanglement-based connectivity, and computational offloading. However, the classical OSI model-designed for deterministic and error-tolerant systems-cannot support quantum-specific phenomena such as coherence fragility, probabilistic entanglement, and the no-cloning theorem. This paper provides a comprehensive survey and proposes an architectural redesign of the OSI model for quantum networks in the context of 7G. We introduce a Quantum-Converged OSI stack by extending the classical model with Layer 0 (Quantum Substrate) and Layer 8 (Cognitive Intent), supporting entanglement, teleportation, and semantic orchestration via LLMs and QML. Each layer is redefined to incorporate quantum mechanisms such as enhanced MAC protocols, fidelity-aware routing, and twin-based applications. This survey consolidates over 150 research works from IEEE, ACM, MDPI, arXiv, and Web of Science (2018-2025), classifying them by OSI layer, enabling technologies such as QKD, QEC, PQC, and RIS, and use cases such as satellite QKD, UAV swarms, and quantum IoT. A taxonomy of cross-layer enablers-such as hybrid quantum-classical control, metadata-driven orchestration, and blockchain-integrated quantum trust-is provided, along with simulation tools including NetSquid, QuNetSim, and QuISP. We present several domain-specific applications, including quantum healthcare telemetry, entangled vehicular networks, and satellite mesh overlays. An evaluation framework is proposed based on entropy throughput, coherence latency, and entanglement fidelity. Key future directions include programmable quantum stacks, digital twins, and AI-defined QNet agents, laying the groundwork for a scalable, intelligent, and quantum-compliant OSI framework for 7G and beyond.</description>

      <title>Building Automotive Security on Internet Standards: An Integration of DNSSEC, DANE, and DANCE to Authenticate and Authorize In-Car Services</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13261v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The automotive industry is undergoing a software-as-a-service transformation that enables software-defined functions and post-sale updates via cloud and vehicle-to-everything communication. Connectivity in cars introduces significant security challenges, as remote attacks on vehicles have become increasingly prevalent. Current automotive designs call for security solutions that address the entire lifetime of a vehicle. In this paper, we propose to authenticate and authorize in-vehicle services by integrating DNSSEC, DANE, and DANCE with automotive middleware. Our approach decouples the cryptographic authentication of the service from that of the service deployment with the help of DNSSEC and thereby largely simplifies key management. We propose to authenticate in-vehicle services by certificates that are solely generated by the service suppliers but published on deployment via DNSSEC TLSA records solely signed by the OEM. Building on well-established Internet standards ensures interoperability with various current and future protocols, scalable management of credentials for millions of connected vehicles at well-established security levels. We back our design proposal by a security analysis using the STRIDE threat model and by evaluations in a realistic in-vehicle setup that demonstrate its effectiveness.</description>

      <title>HELENA: High-Efficiency Learning-based channel Estimation using dual Neural Attention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13408v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate channel estimation is critical for high-performance Orthogonal Frequency-Division Multiplexing systems such as 5G New Radio, particularly under low signal-to-noise ratio and stringent latency constraints. This letter presents HELENA, a compact deep learning model that combines a lightweight convolutional backbone with two efficient attention mechanisms: patch-wise multi-head self-attention for capturing global dependencies and a squeeze-and-excitation block for local feature refinement. Compared to CEViT, a state-of-the-art vision transformer-based estimator, HELENA reduces inference time by 45.0\% (0.175\,ms vs.\ 0.318\,ms), achieves comparable accuracy ($-16.78$\,dB vs.\ $-17.30$\,dB), and requires $8\times$ fewer parameters (0.11M vs.\ 0.88M), demonstrating its suitability for low-latency, real-time deployment.</description>

      <title>The User Perspective on Island-Ready 6G Communication: A Survey of Future Smartphone Usage in Crisis-Struck Areas with Local Cellular Connectivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13466v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using smartphone apps during crises is well-established, proving critical for efficient crisis response. However, such apps become futile without an Internet connection, which is a common issue during crises. The ongoing 6G standardization explores the capability to provide local cellular connectivity for areas cut off from the Internet in crises. This paper introduces to the HCI community the concept of cellular island connectivity in isolated areas, promising a seamless transition from normal operation to island operation with local-only cellular connectivity. It presents findings from a survey (N = 857) among adult smartphone users from major German cities regarding their smartphone usage preferences in this model. Results show a shift in app demand, with users favoring general-purpose apps over dedicated crisis apps in specific scenarios. We prioritize smartphone services based on their criticality, distinguishing between apps essential for crisis response and those supporting routines. Our findings provide operators, developers, and authorities insights into making user-centric design decisions for implementing island-ready 6G communication.</description>

      <title>Unlearning-Enhanced Website Fingerprinting Attack: Against Backdoor Poisoning in Anonymous Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13563v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Website Fingerprinting (WF) is an effective tool for regulating and governing the dark web. However, its performance can be significantly degraded by backdoor poisoning attacks in practical deployments. This paper aims to address the problem of hidden backdoor poisoning attacks faced by Website Fingerprinting attack, and designs a feasible mothed that integrates unlearning technology to realize detection of automatic poisoned points and complete removal of its destructive effects, requiring only a small number of known poisoned test points. Taking Tor onion routing as an example, our method evaluates the influence value of each training sample on these known poisoned test points as the basis for judgment. We optimize the use of influence scores to identify poisoned samples within the training dataset. Furthermore, by quantifying the difference between the contribution of model parameters on the taining data and the clean data, the target parameters are dynamically adjusted to eliminate the impact of the backdoor attacks. Experiments on public datasets under the assumptions of closed-world (CW) and open-world (OW) verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. In complex scenes containing both clean website fingerprinting features and backdoor triggers, the accuracy of the model on the poisoned dataset and the test dataset is stable at about 80%, significantly outperforming the traditional WF attack models. In addition, the proposed method achieves a 2-3 times speedup in runtime efficiency compared to baseline methods. By incorporating machine unlearning, we realize a WF attack model that exhibits enhanced resistance to backdoor poisoning and faster execution speeds in adversarial settings.</description>

      <title>EvalNet: A Practical Toolchain for Generation and Analysis of Extreme-Scale Interconnects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.12663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2105.12663v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The diversity of communication paths in a network - especially non-minimal paths - is a key enabler of performance at extreme scales. We present EvalNet, a toolchain for scalable generation and analysis over 25 important network topologies, such as Slim Fly, PolarFly, and Orthogonal Fat Trees, with a strong focus on path diversity metrics. EvalNet provides an extensive and fine-grained analysis of shortest and non-shortest paths, including their multiplicities, lengths, and interference. It supports exact measurement and visualization of bandwidth and throughput between every router pair, enabling unprecedented insight into routing potential. EvalNet also includes detailed models for construction cost and power consumption, and interfaces seamlessly with established simulators, which we tune to support large-scale evaluations on low-cost hardware. Using EvalNet, we deliver the widest and most comprehensive path diversity study to date, demonstrating how path diversity underpins throughput and scalability, and facilitating progress towards new frontiers in extreme-scale network design.</description>

      <title>X5G: An Open, Programmable, Multi-vendor, End-to-end, Private 5G O-RAN Testbed with NVIDIA ARC and OpenAirInterface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15935v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As Fifth generation (5G) cellular systems transition to softwarized, programmable, and intelligent networks, it becomes fundamental to enable public and private 5G deployments that are (i) primarily based on software components while (ii) maintaining or exceeding the performance of traditional monolithic systems and (iii) enabling programmability through bespoke configurations and optimized deployments. This requires hardware acceleration to scale the Physical (PHY) layer performance, programmable elements in the Radio Access Network (RAN) and intelligent controllers at the edge, careful planning of the Radio Frequency (RF) environment, as well as end-to-end integration and testing. In this paper, we describe how we developed the programmable X5G testbed, addressing these challenges through the deployment of the first 8-node network based on the integration of NVIDIA Aerial RAN CoLab Over-the-Air (ARC-OTA), OpenAirInterface (OAI), and a near-real-time RAN Intelligent Controller (RIC). The Aerial Software Development Kit (SDK) provides the PHY layer, accelerated on Graphics Processing Unit (GPU), with the higher layers from the OAI open-source project interfaced with the PHY through the Small Cell Forum (SCF) Functional Application Platform Interface (FAPI). An E2 agent provides connectivity to the O-RAN Software Community (OSC) near-real-time RIC. We discuss software integration, network infrastructure, and a digital twin framework for RF planning. We then profile the performance with up to 4 Commercial Off-the-Shelf (COTS) smartphones for each base station with iPerf and video streaming applications, as well as up to 25 emulated User Equipments (UEs), measuring a cell rate higher than 1.65 Gbps in downlink and 143 Mbps in uplink.</description>

      <title>Optimizing RPL Routing Using Tabu Search to Improve Link Stability and Energy Consumption in IoT Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06702v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the Internet of Things (IoT) networks, the Routing Protocol for Low-power and Lossy Networks (RPL) is a widely adopted standard due to its efficiency in managing resource-constrained and energy-limited nodes. However, persistent challenges such as high energy consumption, unstable links, and suboptimal routing continue to hinder network performance, affecting both the longevity of the network and the reliability of data transmission. This paper proposes an enhanced RPL routing mechanism by integrating the Tabu Search (TS) optimization algorithm to address these issues. The proposed approach focuses on optimizing the parent and child selection process in the RPL protocol, leveraging a composite cost function that incorporates critical parameters, including Residual Energy, Transmission Energy, Distance to Sink, Hop Count(HC), Expected Transmission Count (ETX), and Link Stability Rate(LSR). Through extensive simulations, we demonstrate that our method significantly improves link stability, reduces energy consumption, and enhances the packet delivery ratio, leading to a more efficient and longer-lasting IoT network. The findings suggest that TS can effectively balance the trade-offs inherent in IoT routing, providing a practical solution for improving the overall performance of RPL-based networks.</description>

      <title>FastRAG: Retrieval Augmented Generation for Semi-structured Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.13773v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Efficiently processing and interpreting network data is critical for the operation of increasingly complex networks. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLM) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques have improved data processing in network management. However, existing RAG methods like VectorRAG and GraphRAG struggle with the complexity and implicit nature of semi-structured technical data, leading to inefficiencies in time, cost, and retrieval. This paper introduces FastRAG, a novel RAG approach designed for semi-structured data. FastRAG employs schema learning and script learning to extract and structure data without needing to submit entire data sources to an LLM. It integrates text search with knowledge graph (KG) querying to improve accuracy in retrieving context-rich information. Evaluation results demonstrate that FastRAG provides accurate question answering, while improving up to 90% in time and 85% in cost compared to GraphRAG.</description>

      <title>PPO-Based Vehicle Control for Ramp Merging Scheme Assisted by Enhanced C-V2X</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.12656v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: On-ramp merging presents a critical challenge in autonomous driving, as vehicles from merging lanes need to dynamically adjust their positions and speeds while monitoring traffic on the main road to prevent collisions. To address this challenge, we propose a novel merging control scheme based on reinforcement learning, which integrates lateral control mechanisms. This approach ensures the smooth integration of vehicles from the merging lane onto the main road, optimizing both fuel efficiency and passenger comfort. Furthermore, we recognize the impact of vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication on control strategies and introduce an enhanced protocol leveraging Cellular Vehicle-to-Everything (C-V2X) Mode 4. This protocol aims to reduce the Age of Information (AoI) and improve communication reliability. In our simulations, we employ two AoI-based metrics to rigorously assess the protocol's effectiveness in autonomous driving scenarios. By combining the NS3 network simulator with Python, we simulate V2V communication and vehicle control simultaneously. The results demonstrate that the enhanced C-V2X Mode 4 outperforms the standard version, while the proposed control scheme ensures safe and reliable vehicle operation during on-ramp merging.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.08787v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) increasingly enhance the Quality of Service (QoS) in wireless networks due to their flexibility and cost-effectiveness. However, optimizing UAV placement in dynamic, obstacle-prone environments remains a significant research challenge due to their complexity. Reinforcement Learning (RL) offers adaptability and robustness in such environments, proving effective for UAV optimization.
  This paper introduces RLpos-3, a novel framework that integrates standard RL techniques and simulation libraries with Network Simulator 3 (ns-3) to facilitate the development and evaluation of UAV positioning algorithms. RLpos-3 serves as a supplementary tool for researchers, enabling the implementation, analysis, and benchmarking of UAV positioning strategies across diverse environmental conditions while meeting user traffic demands. To validate its effectiveness, we present use cases demonstrating RLpos-3's performance in optimizing UAV placement under realistic conditions, such as urban and obstacle-rich environments.</description>

Abstract: Edge caching is an emerging technology that empowers caching units at edge nodes, allowing users to fetch contents of interest that have been pre-cached at the edge nodes. The key to pre-caching is to maximize the cache hit percentage for cached content without compromising users' privacy. In this letter, we propose a federated learning (FL) assisted edge caching scheme based on lightweight architecture denoising diffusion probabilistic model (LDPM). Our simulation results verify that our proposed scheme achieves a higher cache hit percentage compared to existing FL-based methods and baseline methods.</description>

      <title>Static and Dynamic Jamming Games Over Wireless Channels With Mobile Strategic Players</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.10956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.10956v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a wireless jamming problem consisting of the competition between a legitimate receiver and a jammer, as a zero-sum game where the value to maximize/minimize is the channel capacity at the receiver's side. Most of the approaches found in the literature consider the two players to be stationary nodes. Instead, we investigate what happens when they can change location, specifically moving along a linear geometry. We frame this at first as a static game, which can be solved in closed form, and subsequently we extend it to a dynamic game under three different versions for what concerns completeness/perfection of mutual information about the adversary's position, corresponding to different assumptions of concealment/sequentiality of the moves, respectively. We first provide some theoretical conditions that hold for the static game and also help identify good strategies valid under any setup, including dynamic games. Since dynamic games, although more realistic, are characterized by a significantly expanded strategy space, we exploit reinforcement learning to obtain efficient strategies that lead to equilibrium outcomes. We show how theoretical findings can be used to train smart agents to play the game and validate our approach in practical settings.</description>

      <title>Generalized Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning with Envelope Updates in URLLC-enabled Vehicular Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.11331v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a novel multi-objective reinforcement learning (MORL) framework to jointly optimize wireless network selection and autonomous driving policies in a multi-band vehicular network operating on conventional sub-6GHz spectrum and Terahertz frequencies. The proposed framework is designed to 1. maximize the traffic flow and minimize collisions by controlling the vehicle's motion dynamics (i.e., speed and acceleration), and 2. enhance the ultra-reliable low-latency communication (URLLC) while minimizing handoffs (HOs). We cast this problem as a multi-objective Markov Decision Process (MOMDP) and develop solutions for both predefined and unknown preferences of the conflicting objectives. Specifically, we develop a novel envelope MORL solution which develops policies that address multiple objectives with unknown preferences to the agent. While this approach reduces reliance on scalar rewards, policy effectiveness varying with different preferences is a challenge. To address this, we apply a generalized version of the Bellman equation and optimize the convex envelope of multi-objective Q values to learn a unified parametric representation capable of generating optimal policies across all possible preference configurations. Following an initial learning phase, our agent can execute optimal policies under any specified preference or infer preferences from minimal data samples. Numerical results validate the efficacy of the envelope-based MORL solution and demonstrate interesting insights related to the inter-dependency of vehicle motion dynamics, HOs, and the communication data rate. The proposed policies enable autonomous vehicles (AVs) to adopt safe driving behaviors with improved connectivity.</description>

      <title>Graph Neural Networks and Deep Reinforcement Learning Based Resource Allocation for V2X Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06518v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the rapidly evolving landscape of Internet of Vehicles (IoV) technology, Cellular Vehicle-to-Everything (C-V2X) communication has attracted much attention due to its superior performance in coverage, latency, and throughput. Resource allocation within C-V2X is crucial for ensuring the transmission of safety information and meeting the stringent requirements for ultra-low latency and high reliability in Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) communication. This paper proposes a method that integrates Graph Neural Networks (GNN) with Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) to address this challenge. By constructing a dynamic graph with communication links as nodes and employing the Graph Sample and Aggregation (GraphSAGE) model to adapt to changes in graph structure, the model aims to ensure a high success rate for V2V communication while minimizing interference on Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) links, thereby ensuring the successful transmission of V2V link information and maintaining high transmission rates for V2I links. The proposed method retains the global feature learning capabilities of GNN and supports distributed network deployment, allowing vehicles to extract low-dimensional features that include structural information from the graph network based on local observations and to make independent resource allocation decisions. Simulation results indicate that the introduction of GNN, with a modest increase in computational load, effectively enhances the decision-making quality of agents, demonstrating superiority to other methods. This study not only provides a theoretically efficient resource allocation strategy for V2V and V2I communications but also paves a new technical path for resource management in practical IoV environments.</description>

      <title>Enhanced SPS Velocity-adaptive Scheme: Access Fairness in 5G NR V2I Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08037v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) technology enables information exchange between vehicles and road infrastructure. Specifically, when a vehicle approaches a roadside unit (RSU), it can exchange information with the RSU to obtain accurate data that assists in driving. With the release of the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) Release 16, which includes the 5G New Radio (NR) Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) standards, vehicles typically adopt mode-2 communication using sensing-based semi-persistent scheduling (SPS) for resource allocation. In this approach, vehicles identify candidate resources within a selection window and exclude ineligible resources based on information from a sensing window. However, vehicles often drive at different speeds, resulting in varying amounts of data transmission with RSUs as they pass by, which leads to unfair access. Therefore, it is essential to design an access scheme that accounts for different vehicle speeds to achieve fair access across the network. This paper formulates an optimization problem for vehicular networks and proposes a multi-objective optimization scheme to address it by adjusting the selection window in the SPS mechanism of 5G NR V2I mode-2. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme</description>

      <title>Prekey Pogo: Investigating Security and Privacy Issues in WhatsApp's Handshake Mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07323</link>

Abstract: WhatsApp, the world's largest messaging application, uses a version of the Signal protocol to provide end-to-end encryption (E2EE) with strong security guarantees, including Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS). To ensure PFS right from the start of a new conversation -- even when the recipient is offline -- a stash of ephemeral (one-time) prekeys must be stored on a server. While the critical role of these one-time prekeys in achieving PFS has been outlined in the Signal specification, we are the first to demonstrate a targeted depletion attack against them on individual WhatsApp user devices. Our findings not only reveal an attack that can degrade PFS for certain messages, but also expose inherent privacy risks and serious availability implications arising from the refilling and distribution procedure essential for this security mechanism.</description>

      <title>SALT: A Lightweight Model Adaptation Method for Closed Split Computing Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07355v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose SALT (Split-Adaptive Lightweight Tuning), a lightweight model adaptation framework for Split Computing under closed constraints, where the head and tail networks are proprietary and inaccessible to users. In such closed environments, conventional adaptation methods are infeasible since they require access to model parameters or architectures. SALT addresses this challenge by introducing a compact, trainable adapter on the client side to refine latent features from the head network, enabling user-specific adaptation without modifying the original models or increasing communication overhead. We evaluate SALT on user-specific classification tasks with CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, demonstrating improved accuracy with lower training latency compared to fine-tuning methods. Furthermore, SALT facilitates model adaptation for robust inference over lossy networks, a common challenge in edge-cloud environments. With minimal deployment overhead, SALT offers a practical solution for personalized inference in edge AI systems under strict system constraints.</description>
