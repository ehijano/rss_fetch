      <title>Stoichiometric ontogenetic development influences population dynamics: Stage-structured model under nutrient co-limitations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13901v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ecological processes depend on the flow and balance of essential elements such as carbon (C) and phosphorus (P), and changes in these elements can cause adverse effects to ecosystems. The theory of Ecological Stoichiometry offers a conceptual framework to investigate the impact of elemental imbalances on structured populations while simultaneously considering how ecological structures regulate nutrient cycling and ecosystem processes. While there have been significant advances in the development of stoichiometric food web models, these efforts often consider a homogeneous population and neglect stage-structure. The development of stage-structured population models has significantly contributed to understanding energy flow and population dynamics of ecological systems. However, stage structure models fail to consider food quality in addition to food quantity. We develop a stoichiometric stage-structure producer-grazer model that considers co-limitation of nutrients, and parameterize the model for an algae-Daphnia food chain. Our findings emphasize the impact of stoichiometric constraints on structured population dynamics. By incorporating both food quantity and quality into maturation rates, we demonstrate how stage-structured dynamics can influence outcomes in variable environments. Stage-specific parameters, such as juvenile growth and ingestion rates can drive shifts in equilibria, limit cycles, and bifurcation points. These effects are especially significant in high-light environments where nutrient limitations are most pronounced.</description>

      <title>Evolutionary Hysteresis: Cycling about in a Rugged Landscape</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we integrate theoretical modeling, molecular simulation, and empirical analysis to identify and characterize evolutionary hysteresis. We first show how epistatic interactions create bistable fitness landscapes and structural hysteresis in a two-locus Wright-Fisher model, revealing two distinct hysteresis regimes under cyclic and noisy selection. Notably, an epistatically constrained population achieves maximal average fitness at an intermediate level of environmental stochasticity. We then extend this framework to more complex systems, demonstrating robust hysteresis loops in both a disordered multi-locus model and in biophysically realistic simulation of protein structural flexibility. Finally, we present direct empirical evidence of evolutionary hysteresis. By analyzing two decades of metagenomic time-series data from freshwater C. Nanopelagicaceae experiencing strong seasonal temperature cycles, we find that approximately 65% of seasonally oscillating alleles exhibit statistically significant hysteresis. Together, these results establish hysteresis as a general, measurable feature of evolution and a potential probe of complex fitness landscapes.</description>

      <title>Near-Lossless Model Compression Enables Longer Context Inference in DNA Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14694v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Trained on massive cross-species DNA corpora, DNA large language models (LLMs) learn the fundamental "grammar" and evolutionary patterns of genomic sequences. This makes them powerful priors for DNA sequence modeling, particularly over long ranges. However, two major constraints hinder their use in practice: the quadratic computational cost of self-attention and the growing memory required for key-value (KV) caches during autoregressive decoding. These constraints force the use of heuristics such as fixed-window truncation or sliding windows, which compromise fidelity on ultra-long sequences by discarding distant information. We introduce FOCUS (Feature-Oriented Compression for Ultra-long Self-attention), a progressive context-compression module that can be plugged into pretrained DNA LLMs. FOCUS combines the established k-mer representation in genomics with learnable hierarchical compression: it inserts summary tokens at k-mer granularity and progressively compresses attention key and value activations across multiple Transformer layers, retaining only the summary KV states across windows while discarding ordinary-token KV. A shared-boundary windowing scheme yields a stationary cross-window interface that propagates long-range information with minimal loss. We validate FOCUS on an Evo-2-based DNA LLM fine-tuned on GRCh38 chromosome 1 with self-supervised training and randomized compression schedules to promote robustness across compression ratios. On held-out human chromosomes, FOCUS achieves near-lossless fidelity: compressing a 1 kb context into only 10 summary tokens (about 100x) shifts the average per-nucleotide probability by only about 0.0004. Compared to a baseline without compression, FOCUS reduces KV-cache memory and converts effective inference scaling from O(N^2) to near-linear O(N), enabling about 100x longer inference windows on commodity GPUs with near-lossless fidelity.</description>

      <title>A strengthened bound on the number of states required to characterize maximum parsimony distance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09888v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article we prove that the distance $d_{\mathrm{MP}}(T_1,T_2) = k$ between two unrooted binary phylogenetic trees $T_1, T_2$ on the same set of taxa can be defined by a character that is convex on one of $T_1, T_2$ and which has at most $2k$ states. This significantly improves upon the previous bound of $7k-5$ states. We also show that for every $k \geq 1$ there exist two trees $T_1, T_2$ with $d_{\mathrm{MP}}(T_1,T_2) = k$ such that at least $k+1$ states are necessary in any character that achieves this distance and which is convex on one of $T_1, T_2$. We augment these lower and upper bounds with an empirical analysis which shows that in practice significantly fewer than $k+1$ states are usually required.</description>

      <title>Two Issues in Modelling Fish Migration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00122v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fish migration is a dynamic phenomenon observed in many surface water bodies on the earth, while its understanding is still insufficient. Particularly, the biological mechanism behind fish migration is not fully understood. Moreover, its observation is often conducted visually and hence manually, raising questions of accuracy and interpretation of the data sampled. We address the two issues, mechanism and observation, of fish migration based on a recently developed mathematical model. The results obtained in this short paper show that fish migration can be characterized through a minimization principle and evaluate the error of its manual observations. The minimization principle we hypothesize is an optimal control problem where the migrating fish population dynamically changes its size and fluctuation. We numerically investigate alternating and intensive observation schemes as case studies, demonstrating that in some realistic conditions the estimate of total fish count is not reliable. We believe that this paper contributes to a deeper understanding of fish migration.</description>
