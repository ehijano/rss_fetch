      <title>AI Horizon Scanning, White Paper p3395, IEEE-SA. Part I: Areas of Attention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01808v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) models may carry societal transformation to an extent demanding a delicate balance between opportunity and risk. This manuscript is the first of a series of White Papers informing the development of IEEE-SA's p3995: `Standard for the Implementation of Safeguards, Controls, and Preventive Techniques for Artificial Intelligence (AI) Models', Chair: Marina Cort\^{e}s (https://standards.ieee.org/ieee/3395/11378/). In this first horizon-scanning we identify key attention areas for standards activities in AI. We examine different principles for regulatory efforts, and review notions of accountability, privacy, data rights and mis-use. As a safeguards standard we devote significant attention to the stability of global infrastructures and consider a possible overdependence on cloud computing that may result from densely coupled AI components. We review the recent cascade-failure-like Crowdstrike event in July 2024, as an illustration of potential impacts on critical infrastructures from AI-induced incidents in the (near) future. It is the first of a set of articles intended as White Papers informing the audience on the standard development. Upcoming articles will focus on regulatory initiatives, technology evolution and the role of AI in specific domains.</description>

      <title>Enhancing transparency in AI-powered customer engagement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01809v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the critical challenge of building consumer trust in AI-powered customer engagement by emphasising the necessity for transparency and accountability. Despite the potential of AI to revolutionise business operations and enhance customer experiences, widespread concerns about misinformation and the opacity of AI decision-making processes hinder trust. Surveys highlight a significant lack of awareness among consumers regarding their interactions with AI, alongside apprehensions about bias and fairness in AI algorithms. The paper advocates for the development of explainable AI models that are transparent and understandable to both consumers and organisational leaders, thereby mitigating potential biases and ensuring ethical use. It underscores the importance of organisational commitment to transparency practices beyond mere regulatory compliance, including fostering a culture of accountability, prioritising clear data policies and maintaining active engagement with stakeholders. By adopting a holistic approach to transparency and explainability, businesses can cultivate trust in AI technologies, bridging the gap between technological innovation and consumer acceptance, and paving the way for more ethical and effective AI-powered customer engagements.

      <description>arXiv:2410.01810v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As ML is still a (relatively) recent field of study, especially outside the realm of abstract mathematics, few works have been led on the political aspect of LLMs, and more particularly about the alignment process, and its political dimension. This process can be as simple as prompt engineering, but also very deep and affect completely unrelated questions. For example, politically directed alignment has a very strong impact on an LLM's embedding space, and the relative position of political notions in such a space. Using special tools to evaluate general political bias and analyze the effects of alignment, we can gather new data to understand its causes and possible consequences on society. Indeed, leading a socio-political approach we can hypothesize that most big LLMs are aligned on what Marxist philosophy calls the 'dominant ideology'. As AI's role in political decision-making, at the citizen's scale but also in government agencies, such biases can have huge effects on societal change, either by creating a new and insidious pathway for societal uniformization or by allowing disguised extremist views to gain traction on the people.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Cultural Awareness of LLMs for Yoruba, Malayalam, and English</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01811v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although LLMs have been extremely effective in a large number of complex tasks, their understanding and functionality for regional languages and cultures are not well studied. In this paper, we explore the ability of various LLMs to comprehend the cultural aspects of two regional languages: Malayalam (state of Kerala, India) and Yoruba (West Africa). Using Hofstede's six cultural dimensions: Power Distance (PDI), Individualism (IDV), Motivation towards Achievement and Success (MAS), Uncertainty Avoidance (UAV), Long Term Orientation (LTO), and Indulgence (IVR), we quantify the cultural awareness of LLM-based responses. We demonstrate that although LLMs show a high cultural similarity for English, they fail to capture the cultural nuances across these 6 metrics for Malayalam and Yoruba. We also highlight the need for large-scale regional language LLM training with culturally enriched datasets. This will have huge implications for enhancing the user experience of chat-based LLMs and also improving the validity of large-scale LLM agent-based market research.</description>

      <title>From Text to Multimodality: Exploring the Evolution and Impact of Large Language Models in Medical Practice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01812v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have rapidly evolved from text-based systems to multimodal platforms, significantly impacting various sectors including healthcare. This comprehensive review explores the progression of LLMs to Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) and their growing influence in medical practice. We examine the current landscape of MLLMs in healthcare, analyzing their applications across clinical decision support, medical imaging, patient engagement, and research. The review highlights the unique capabilities of MLLMs in integrating diverse data types, such as text, images, and audio, to provide more comprehensive insights into patient health. We also address the challenges facing MLLM implementation, including data limitations, technical hurdles, and ethical considerations. By identifying key research gaps, this paper aims to guide future investigations in areas such as dataset development, modality alignment methods, and the establishment of ethical guidelines. As MLLMs continue to shape the future of healthcare, understanding their potential and limitations is crucial for their responsible and effective integration into medical practice.</description>

      <title>A Graph Theoretic Approach to Analyze the Developing Metaverse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01814v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite staggering growth over the past couple of decades, the concept of the metaverse is still in its early stages. Eventually, it is expected to become a common medium connecting every individual. Considering the complexity of this plausible scenario at hand, there's a need to define an advanced metaverse -- a metaverse in which, at every point in space and time, two distinct paradigms exist: that of the user in the physical world and that of its real-time digital replica in the virtual one, that can engage seamlessly with each other. The developing metaverse can be thus defined as the transitional period from the current state to, possibly, the advanced metaverse. This paper seeks to model, from a graphical standpoint, some of the structures in the current metaverse and ones that might be key to the developing and advanced metaverses under one umbrella, unlike existing approaches that treat different aspects of the metaverse in isolation. This integration allows for the accurate representation of cross-domain interactions, leading to optimized resource allocation, enhanced user engagement, and improved content distribution. This work demonstrates the usefulness of such an approach in capturing these correlations, providing a powerful tool for the analysis and future development of the metaverse.</description>

      <title>AI in Food Marketing from Personalized Recommendations to Predictive Analytics: Comparing Traditional Advertising Techniques with AI-Driven Strategies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01815v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) has revolutionized food marketing by providing advanced techniques for personalized recommendations, consumer behavior prediction, and campaign optimization. This paper explores the shift from traditional advertising methods, such as TV, radio, and print, to AI-driven strategies. Traditional approaches were successful in building brand awareness but lacked the level of personalization that modern consumers demand. AI leverages data from consumer purchase histories, browsing behaviors, and social media activity to create highly tailored marketing campaigns. These strategies allow for more accurate product recommendations, prediction of consumer needs, and ultimately improve customer satisfaction and user experience. AI enhances marketing efforts by automating labor-intensive processes, leading to greater efficiency and cost savings. It also enables the continuous adaptation of marketing messages, ensuring they remain relevant and engaging over time. While AI presents significant benefits in terms of personalization and efficiency, it also comes with challenges, particularly the substantial investment required for technology and skilled expertise. This paper compares the strengths and weaknesses of traditional and AI-driven food marketing techniques, offering valuable insights into how marketers can leverage AI to create more effective and targeted marketing strategies in the evolving digital landscape.</description>

      <title>Integrating AI's Carbon Footprint into Risk Management Frameworks: Strategies and Tools for Sustainable Compliance in Banking Sector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper examines the integration of AI's carbon footprint into the risk management frameworks (RMFs) of the banking sector, emphasising its importance in aligning with sustainability goals and regulatory requirements. As AI becomes increasingly central to banking operations, its energy-intensive processes contribute significantly to carbon emissions, posing environmental, regulatory, and reputational risks. Regulatory frameworks such as the EU AI Act, Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD), Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive (CSDDD), and the Prudential Regulation Authority's SS1/23 are driving banks to incorporate environmental considerations into their AI model governance. Recent advancements in AI research, like the Open Mixture-of-Experts (OLMoE) framework and the Agentic RAG framework, offer more efficient and dynamic AI models, reducing their carbon footprint without compromising performance. Using these technological examples, the paper outlines a structured approach for banks to identify, assess, and mitigate AI's carbon footprint within their RMFs, including adopting energy-efficient models, utilising green cloud computing, and implementing lifecycle management.</description>

      <title>Strategic AI Governance: Insights from Leading Nations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01819v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) has the potential to revolutionize various sectors, yet its adoption is often hindered by concerns about data privacy, security, and the understanding of AI capabilities. This paper synthesizes AI governance approaches, strategic themes, and enablers and challenges for AI adoption by reviewing national AI strategies from leading nations. The key contribution is the development of an EPIC (Education, Partnership, Infrastructure, Community) framework, which maps AI implementation requirements to fully realize social impacts and public good from successful and sustained AI deployment. Through a multi-perspective content analysis of the latest AI strategy documents, this paper provides a structured comparison of AI governance strategies across nations. The findings offer valuable insights for governments, academics, industries, and communities to enable responsible and trustworthy AI deployments. Future work should focus on incorporating specific requirements for developing countries and applying the strategies to specific AI applications, industries, and the public sector.</description>

      <title>Temporal Graph Memory Networks For Knowledge Tracing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01836v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tracing a student's knowledge growth given the past exercise answering is a vital objective in automatic tutoring systems to customize the learning experience. Yet, achieving this objective is a non-trivial task as it involves modeling the knowledge state across multiple knowledge components (KCs) while considering their temporal and relational dynamics during the learning process. Knowledge tracing methods have tackled this task by either modeling KCs' temporal dynamics using recurrent models or relational dynamics across KCs and questions using graph models. Albeit, there is a lack of methods that could learn joint embedding between relational and temporal dynamics of the task. Moreover, many methods that count for the impact of a student's forgetting behavior during the learning process use hand-crafted features, limiting their generalization on different scenarios. In this paper, we propose a novel method that jointly models the relational and temporal dynamics of the knowledge state using a deep temporal graph memory network. In addition, we propose a generic technique for representing a student's forgetting behavior using temporal decay constraints on the graph memory module. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method using multiple knowledge tracing benchmarks while comparing it to state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>Risk Alignment in Agentic AI Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Agentic AIs $-$ AIs that are capable and permitted to undertake complex actions with little supervision $-$ mark a new frontier in AI capabilities and raise new questions about how to safely create and align such systems with users, developers, and society. Because agents' actions are influenced by their attitudes toward risk, one key aspect of alignment concerns the risk profiles of agentic AIs. Risk alignment will matter for user satisfaction and trust, but it will also have important ramifications for society more broadly, especially as agentic AIs become more autonomous and are allowed to control key aspects of our lives. AIs with reckless attitudes toward risk (either because they are calibrated to reckless human users or are poorly designed) may pose significant threats. They might also open 'responsibility gaps' in which there is no agent who can be held accountable for harmful actions. What risk attitudes should guide an agentic AI's decision-making? How might we design AI systems that are calibrated to the risk attitudes of their users? What guardrails, if any, should be placed on the range of permissible risk attitudes? What are the ethical considerations involved when designing systems that make risky decisions on behalf of others? We present three papers that bear on key normative and technical aspects of these questions.</description>

      <title>The why, what, and how of AI-based coding in scientific research</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Computer programming (coding) is indispensable for researchers across disciplines, yet it remains challenging to learn and time-consuming to carry out. Generative AI, particularly large language models (LLMs), has the potential to transform coding into intuitive conversations, but best practices and effective workflows are only emerging. We dissect AI-based coding through three key lenses: the nature and role of LLMs in coding (why), six types of coding assistance they provide (what), and a five-step workflow in action with practical implementation strategies (how). Additionally, we address the limitations and future outlook of AI in coding. By offering actionable insights, this framework helps to guide researchers in effectively leveraging AI to enhance coding practices and education, accelerating scientific progress.</description>

      <title>From Experts to the Public: Governing Multimodal Language Models in Politically Sensitive Video Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01817v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper examines the governance of multimodal large language models (MM-LLMs) through individual and collective deliberation, focusing on analyses of politically sensitive videos. We conducted a two-step study: first, interviews with 10 journalists established a baseline understanding of expert video interpretation; second, 114 individuals from the general public engaged in deliberation using Inclusive.AI, a platform that facilitates democratic decision-making through decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) mechanisms. Our findings show that while experts emphasized emotion and narrative, the general public prioritized factual clarity, objectivity of the situation, and emotional neutrality. Additionally, we explored the impact of different governance mechanisms: quadratic vs. weighted ranking voting and equal vs. 20-80 power distributions on users decision-making on how AI should behave. Specifically, quadratic voting enhanced perceptions of liberal democracy and political equality, and participants who were more optimistic about AI perceived the voting process to have a higher level of participatory democracy. Our results suggest the potential of applying DAO mechanisms to help democratize AI governance.</description>

      <title>Public interest in science or bots? Selective amplification of scientific articles on Twitter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01842v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the remarkable capability to reach the public instantly, social media has become integral in sharing scholarly articles to measure public response. Since spamming by bots on social media can steer the conversation and present a false public interest in given research, affecting policies impacting the public's lives in the real world, this topic warrants critical study and attention. We used the Altmetric dataset in combination with data collected through the Twitter Application Programming Interface (API) and the Botometer API. We combined the data into an extensive dataset with academic articles, several features from the article and a label indicating whether the article had excessive bot activity on Twitter or not. We analyzed the data to see the possibility of bot activity based on different characteristics of the article. We also trained machine-learning models using this dataset to identify possible bot activity in any given article. Our machine-learning models were capable of identifying possible bot activity in any academic article with an accuracy of 0.70. We also found that articles related to "Health and Human Science" are more prone to bot activity compared to other research areas. Without arguing the maliciousness of the bot activity, our work presents a tool to identify the presence of bot activity in the dissemination of an academic article and creates a baseline for future research in this direction.</description>

Abstract: In an era of "moving fast and breaking things", regulators have moved slowly to pick up the safety, bias, and legal pieces left in the wake of broken Artificial Intelligence (AI) deployment. Since AI models, such as large language models, are able to push misinformation and stoke division within our society, it is imperative for regulators to employ a framework that mitigates these dangers and ensures user safety. While there is much-warranted discussion about how to address the safety, bias, and legal woes of state-of-the-art AI models, the number of rigorous and realistic mathematical frameworks to regulate AI safety is lacking. We take on this challenge, proposing an auction-based regulatory mechanism that provably incentivizes model-building agents (i) to deploy safer models and (ii) to participate in the regulation process. We provably guarantee, via derived Nash Equilibria, that each participating agent's best strategy is to submit a model safer than a prescribed minimum-safety threshold. Empirical results show that our regulatory auction boosts safety and participation rates by 20% and 15% respectively, outperforming simple regulatory frameworks that merely enforce minimum safety standards.</description>

      <title>Towards Implicit Bias Detection and Mitigation in Multi-Agent LLM Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02584v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) continue to evolve, they are increasingly being employed in numerous studies to simulate societies and execute diverse social tasks. However, LLMs are susceptible to societal biases due to their exposure to human-generated data. Given that LLMs are being used to gain insights into various societal aspects, it is essential to mitigate these biases. To that end, our study investigates the presence of implicit gender biases in multi-agent LLM interactions and proposes two strategies to mitigate these biases. We begin by creating a dataset of scenarios where implicit gender biases might arise, and subsequently develop a metric to assess the presence of biases. Our empirical analysis reveals that LLMs generate outputs characterized by strong implicit bias associations (&gt;= 50\% of the time). Furthermore, these biases tend to escalate following multi-agent interactions. To mitigate them, we propose two strategies: self-reflection with in-context examples (ICE); and supervised fine-tuning. Our research demonstrates that both methods effectively mitigate implicit biases, with the ensemble of fine-tuning and self-reflection proving to be the most successful.</description>

      <title>Expected Maximin Fairness in Max-Cut and other Combinatorial Optimization Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02589v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Maximin fairness is the ideal that the worst-off group (or individual) should be treated as well as possible. Literature on maximin fairness in various decision-making settings has grown in recent years, but theoretical results are sparse. In this paper, we explore the challenges inherent to maximin fairness in combinatorial optimization. We begin by showing that (1) optimal maximin-fair solutions are bounded by non-maximin-fair optimal solutions, and (2) stochastic maximin-fair solutions exceed their deterministic counterparts in expectation for a broad class of combinatorial optimization problems. In the remainder of the paper, we use the special case of Max-Cut to demonstrate challenges in defining and implementing maximin fairness.</description>

      <title>Hate Personified: Investigating the role of LLMs in content moderation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02657v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For subjective tasks such as hate detection, where people perceive hate differently, the Large Language Model's (LLM) ability to represent diverse groups is unclear. By including additional context in prompts, we comprehensively analyze LLM's sensitivity to geographical priming, persona attributes, and numerical information to assess how well the needs of various groups are reflected. Our findings on two LLMs, five languages, and six datasets reveal that mimicking persona-based attributes leads to annotation variability. Meanwhile, incorporating geographical signals leads to better regional alignment. We also find that the LLMs are sensitive to numerical anchors, indicating the ability to leverage community-based flagging efforts and exposure to adversaries. Our work provides preliminary guidelines and highlights the nuances of applying LLMs in culturally sensitive cases.</description>

      <title>LLM generated responses to mitigate the impact of hate speech</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.16905v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we explore the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) to counteract hate speech. We conducted the first real-life A/B test assessing the effectiveness of LLM-generated counter-speech. During the experiment, we posted 753 automatically generated responses aimed at reducing user engagement under tweets that contained hate speech toward Ukrainian refugees in Poland.
  Our work shows that interventions with LLM-generated responses significantly decrease user engagement, particularly for original tweets with at least ten views, reducing it by over 20%. This paper outlines the design of our automatic moderation system, proposes a simple metric for measuring user engagement and details the methodology of conducting such an experiment. We discuss the ethical considerations and challenges in deploying generative AI for discourse moderation.</description>

      <title>Beyond principlism: Practical strategies for ethical AI use in research practices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.15284v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rapid adoption of generative artificial intelligence (AI) in scientific research, particularly large language models (LLMs), has outpaced the development of ethical guidelines, leading to a Triple-Too problem: too many high-level ethical initiatives, too abstract principles lacking contextual and practical relevance, and too much focus on restrictions and risks over benefits and utilities. Existing approaches, including principlism (reliance on abstract ethical principles), formalism (rigid application of rules), and technical solutionism (overemphasis on technological fixes), offer little practical guidance for addressing ethical challenges of AI in scientific research practices. To bridge the gap between abstract principles and day-to-day research practices, a user-centered, realism-inspired approach is proposed here. It outlines five specific goals for ethical AI use: 1) understanding model training and output, including bias mitigation strategies; 2) respecting privacy, confidentiality, and copyright; 3) avoiding plagiarism and policy violations; 4) applying AI beneficially compared to alternatives; and 5) using AI transparently and reproducibly. Each goal is accompanied by actionable strategies and realistic cases of misuse and corrective measures. I argue that ethical AI application requires evaluating its utility against existing alternatives rather than isolated performance metrics. Additionally, I propose documentation guidelines to enhance transparency and reproducibility in AI-assisted research. Moving forward, we need targeted professional development, training programs, and balanced enforcement mechanisms to promote responsible AI use while fostering innovation. By refining these ethical guidelines and adapting them to emerging AI capabilities, we can accelerate scientific progress without compromising research integrity.</description>

      <title>Large language models as linguistic simulators and cognitive models in human research</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.04470v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rise of large language models (LLMs) that generate human-like text has sparked debates over their potential to replace human participants in behavioral and cognitive research. We critically evaluate this replacement perspective to appraise the fundamental utility of language models in psychology and social science. Through a five-dimension framework, characterization, representation, interpretation, implication, and utility, we identify six fallacies that undermine the replacement perspective: (1) equating token prediction with human intelligence, (2) assuming LLMs represent the average human, (3) interpreting alignment as explanation, (4) anthropomorphizing AI, (5) essentializing identities, and (6) purporting LLMs as primary tools that directly reveal the human mind. Rather than replacement, the evidence and arguments are consistent with a simulation perspective, where LLMs offer a new paradigm to simulate roles and model cognitive processes. We highlight limitations and considerations about internal, external, construct, and statistical validity, providing methodological guidelines for effective integration of LLMs into psychological research, with a focus on model selection, prompt design, interpretation, and ethical considerations. This perspective reframes the role of language models in behavioral and cognitive science, serving as linguistic simulators and cognitive models that shed light on the similarities and differences between machine intelligence and human cognition and thoughts.</description>

      <title>Human vs. Machine: Behavioral Differences Between Expert Humans and Language Models in Wargame Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03407v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To some, the advent of artificial intelligence (AI) promises better decision-making and increased military effectiveness while reducing the influence of human error and emotions. However, there is still debate about how AI systems, especially large language models (LLMs) that can be applied to many tasks, behave compared to humans in high-stakes military decision-making scenarios with the potential for increased risks towards escalation. To test this potential and scrutinize the use of LLMs for such purposes, we use a new wargame experiment with 214 national security experts designed to examine crisis escalation in a fictional U.S.-China scenario and compare the behavior of human player teams to LLM-simulated team responses in separate simulations. Here, we find that the LLM-simulated responses can be more aggressive and significantly affected by changes in the scenario. We show a considerable high-level agreement in the LLM and human responses and significant quantitative and qualitative differences in individual actions and strategic tendencies. These differences depend on intrinsic biases in LLMs regarding the appropriate level of violence following strategic instructions, the choice of LLM, and whether the LLMs are tasked to decide for a team of players directly or first to simulate dialog between a team of players. When simulating the dialog, the discussions lack quality and maintain a farcical harmony. The LLM simulations cannot account for human player characteristics, showing no significant difference even for extreme traits, such as "pacifist" or "aggressive sociopath." When probing behavioral consistency across individual moves of the simulation, the tested LLMs deviated from each other but generally showed somewhat consistent behavior. Our results motivate policymakers to be cautious before granting autonomy or following AI-based strategy recommendations.</description>

      <title>BadRobot: Manipulating Embodied LLMs in the Physical World</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20242v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Embodied AI represents systems where AI is integrated into physical entities, enabling them to perceive and interact with their surroundings. Large Language Model (LLM), which exhibits powerful language understanding abilities, has been extensively employed in embodied AI by facilitating sophisticated task planning. However, a critical safety issue remains overlooked: could these embodied LLMs perpetrate harmful behaviors? In response, we introduce BadRobot, a novel attack paradigm aiming to make embodied LLMs violate safety and ethical constraints through typical voice-based user-system interactions. Specifically, three vulnerabilities are exploited to achieve this type of attack: (i) manipulation of LLMs within robotic systems, (ii) misalignment between linguistic outputs and physical actions, and (iii) unintentional hazardous behaviors caused by world knowledge's flaws. Furthermore, we construct a benchmark of various malicious physical action queries to evaluate BadRobot's attack performance. Based on this benchmark, extensive experiments against existing prominent embodied LLM frameworks (e.g., Voxposer, Code as Policies, and ProgPrompt) demonstrate the effectiveness of our BadRobot. Warning: This paper contains harmful AI-generated language and aggressive actions.</description>

      <title>Learning Fair Models without Sensitive Attributes: A Generative Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.16413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.16413v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Most existing fair classifiers rely on sensitive attributes to achieve fairness. However, for many scenarios, we cannot obtain sensitive attributes due to privacy and legal issues. The lack of sensitive attributes challenges many existing fair classifiers. Though we lack sensitive attributes, for many applications, there usually exists features or information of various formats that are relevant to sensitive attributes. For example, purchase history of a person can reflect his or her race, which would help for learning fair classifiers on race. However, the work on exploring relevant features for learning fair models without sensitive attributes is rather limited. Therefore, in this paper, we study a novel problem of learning fair models without sensitive attributes by exploring relevant features. We propose a probabilistic generative framework to effectively estimate the sensitive attribute from the training data with relevant features in various formats and utilize the estimated sensitive attribute information to learn fair models. Experimental results on real-world datasets show the effectiveness of our framework in terms of both accuracy and fairness.</description>

      <title>Fair Sampling in Diffusion Models through Switching Mechanism</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.03140v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models have shown their effectiveness in generation tasks by well-approximating the underlying probability distribution. However, diffusion models are known to suffer from an amplified inherent bias from the training data in terms of fairness. While the sampling process of diffusion models can be controlled by conditional guidance, previous works have attempted to find empirical guidance to achieve quantitative fairness. To address this limitation, we propose a fairness-aware sampling method called \textit{attribute switching} mechanism for diffusion models. Without additional training, the proposed sampling can obfuscate sensitive attributes in generated data without relying on classifiers. We mathematically prove and experimentally demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method on two key aspects: (i) the generation of fair data and (ii) the preservation of the utility of the generated data.</description>

      <title>GLOCALFAIR: Jointly Improving Global and Local Group Fairness in Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.03562v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a prospective solution for collaboratively learning a shared model across clients without sacrificing their data privacy. However, the federated learned model tends to be biased against certain demographic groups (e.g., racial and gender groups) due to the inherent FL properties, such as data heterogeneity and party selection. Unlike centralized learning, mitigating bias in FL is particularly challenging as private training datasets and their sensitive attributes are typically not directly accessible. Most prior research in this field only focuses on global fairness while overlooking the local fairness of individual clients. Moreover, existing methods often require sensitive information about the client's local datasets to be shared, which is not desirable. To address these issues, we propose GLOCALFAIR, a client-server co-design fairness framework that can jointly improve global and local group fairness in FL without the need for sensitive statistics about the client's private datasets. Specifically, we utilize constrained optimization to enforce local fairness on the client side and adopt a fairness-aware clustering-based aggregation on the server to further ensure the global model fairness across different sensitive groups while maintaining high utility. Experiments on two image datasets and one tabular dataset with various state-of-the-art fairness baselines show that GLOCALFAIR can achieve enhanced fairness under both global and local data distributions while maintaining a good level of utility and client fairness.</description>

      <title>Perceptions of Moderators as a Large-Scale Measure of Online Community Governance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.16610v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Millions of online communities are governed by volunteer moderators, who shape their communities by setting and enforcing rules, recruiting additional moderators, and participating in the community themselves. These moderators must regularly make decisions about how to govern, yet measuring the 'success' of governance is complex and nuanced, making it challenging to determine what governance strategies are most successful. Furthermore, prior work has shown that communities have differing values, suggesting that 'one-size-fits-all' approaches to governance are unlikely to serve all communities well. In this work, we assess governance practices on reddit by classifying the sentiment of community members' public discussion of their own moderators. We label 1.89 million posts and comments made on reddit over an 18 month period. We relate these perceptions to characteristics of community governance, and to different actions that community moderators take. We identify types of communities where moderators are perceived particularly positively and negatively, and highlight promising strategies for moderator teams. Amongst other findings, we show that strict rule enforcement is linked to more favorable perceptions of moderators of communities dedicated to certain topics, such as news communities, than others. We investigate what kinds of moderators are associated with improved community perceptions upon their addition to a mod team, and find that moderators who are active community members before and during their mod tenures are seen more favorably. We make all our models, datasets, and code public.</description>

      <title>The Model Openness Framework: Promoting Completeness and Openness for Reproducibility, Transparency, and Usability in Artificial Intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13784v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generative AI (GAI) offers numerous opportunities for research and innovation, but its commercialization has raised concerns about transparency, reproducibility, and safety. Most open GAI models lack the necessary components for full understanding, auditing, and reproducibility, and some use restrictive licenses whilst claiming to be "open-source". To address these concerns, we introduce the Model Openness Framework (MOF), a ranked classification system that rates machine learning models based on their completeness and openness, following principles of open science, as well as the Model Openness Tool (MOT), which provides a reference implementation designed to evaluate ML models against the principles outlined by the MOF. The MOF requires specific components of the model development lifecycle to be included and released under appropriate open licenses. This framework aims to prevent misrepresentation of models claiming to be open, to guide researchers and developers in providing all model components under permissive licenses, and to help individuals and organizations identify models that can be safely adopted. By promoting transparency and reproducibility, the MOF combats open-washing and establishes completeness and openness as core tenets of responsible AI research and development. Widespread adoption of the MOF will foster a more open AI ecosystem, benefiting research, innovation, and the adoption of state-of-the-art models.</description>

      <title>LLMs as Writing Assistants: Exploring Perspectives on Sense of Ownership and Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00027v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sense of ownership in writing confines our investment of thoughts, time, and contribution, leading to attachment to the output. However, using writing assistants introduces a mental dilemma, as some content isn't directly our creation. For instance, we tend to credit Large Language Models (LLMs) more in creative tasks, even though all tasks are equal for them. Additionally, while we may not claim complete ownership of LLM-generated content, we freely claim authorship. We conduct a short survey to examine these issues and understand underlying cognitive processes in order to gain a better knowledge of human-computer interaction in writing and improve writing aid systems.</description>

      <title>AI-Generated Faces in the Real World: A Large-Scale Case Study of Twitter Profile Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14244</link>

Abstract: Recent advances in the field of generative artificial intelligence (AI) have blurred the lines between authentic and machine-generated content, making it almost impossible for humans to distinguish between such media. One notable consequence is the use of AI-generated images for fake profiles on social media. While several types of disinformation campaigns and similar incidents have been reported in the past, a systematic analysis has been lacking. In this work, we conduct the first large-scale investigation of the prevalence of AI-generated profile pictures on Twitter. We tackle the challenges of a real-world measurement study by carefully integrating various data sources and designing a multi-stage detection pipeline. Our analysis of nearly 15 million Twitter profile pictures shows that 0.052% were artificially generated, confirming their notable presence on the platform. We comprehensively examine the characteristics of these accounts and their tweet content, and uncover patterns of coordinated inauthentic behavior. The results also reveal several motives, including spamming and political amplification campaigns. Our research reaffirms the need for effective detection and mitigation strategies to cope with the potential negative effects of generative AI in the future.</description>

      <title>Crisis Communication in the Face of Data Breaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01744v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Data breaches refer to unauthorized accesses to data. Typically but not always, data breaches are about cyber crime. An organization facing such a crime is often also in a crisis situation. Therefore, organizations should prepare also for data breaches in their crisis management procedures. These procedures should include also crisis communication plans. To this end, this paper examines data breach crisis communication strategies and their practical executions. The background comes from the vibrant crisis communication research domain. According to a few qualitative case studies from Finland, the conventional wisdom holds well; the successful cases indicate communicating early, taking responsibility, offering an apology, and notifying public authorities. The unsuccessful cases show varying degrees of the reverse, including shifting of blame, positioning of an organization as a victim, and failing to notify public authorities. With these qualitative insights, the paper contributes to the research domain by focusing specifically on data breach crises, their peculiarities, and their management, including with respect to European regulations that have been neglected in existing crisis communication research.</description>

      <title>BlueTempNet: A Temporal Multi-network Dataset of Social Interactions in Bluesky Social</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17451v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Decentralized social media platforms like Bluesky Social (Bluesky) have made it possible to publicly disclose some user behaviors with millisecond-level precision. Embracing Bluesky's principles of open-source and open-data, we present the first collection of the temporal dynamics of user-driven social interactions. BlueTempNet integrates multiple types of networks into a single multi-network, including user-to-user interactions (following and blocking users) and user-to-community interactions (creating and joining communities). Communities are user-formed groups in custom Feeds, where users subscribe to posts aligned with their interests. Following Bluesky's public data policy, we collect existing Bluesky Feeds, including the users who liked and generated these Feeds, and provide tools to gather users' social interactions within a date range. This data-collection strategy captures past user behaviors and supports the future data collection of user behavior.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Group Fairness in Federated Learning through Personalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19331v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Personalized Federated Learning (FL) algorithms collaboratively train customized models for each client, enhancing the accuracy of the learned models on the client's local data (e.g., by clustering similar clients, by fine-tuning models locally, or by imposing regularization terms). In this paper, we investigate the impact of such personalization techniques on the group fairness of the learned models, and show that personalization can also lead to improved (local) fairness as an unintended benefit. We begin by illustrating these benefits of personalization through numerical experiments comparing several classes of personalized FL algorithms against a baseline FedAvg algorithm, elaborating on the reasons behind improved fairness using personalized FL, and then providing analytical support. Motivated by these, we then show how to build on this (unintended) fairness benefit, by further integrating a fairness metric into the cluster-selection procedure of clustering-based personalized FL algorithms, and improve the fairness-accuracy trade-off attainable through them. Specifically, we propose two new fairness-aware federated clustering algorithms, Fair-FCA and Fair-FL+HC, extending the existing IFCA and FL+HC algorithms, and demonstrate their ability to strike a (tuneable) balance between accuracy and fairness at the client level.</description>

      <title>The NetMob2024 Dataset: Population Density and OD Matrices from Four LMIC Countries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00453v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The NetMob24 dataset offers a unique opportunity for researchers from a range of academic fields to access comprehensive spatiotemporal data sets spanning four countries (India, Mexico, Indonesia, and Colombia) over the course of two years (2019 and 2020). This dataset, developed in collaboration with Cuebiq (Also referred to as Spectus), comprises privacy-preserving aggregated data sets derived from mobile application (app) data collected from users who have voluntarily consented to anonymous data collection for research purposes. It is our hope that this reference dataset will foster the production of new research methods and the reproducibility of research outcomes.</description>
