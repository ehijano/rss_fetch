      <title>Quantum simulation of Hawking radiation and curved spacetime with a superconducting on-chip black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.11092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2111.11092v3 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hawking radiation is one of the quantum features of a black hole that can be understood as a quantum tunneling across the event horizon of the black hole, but it is quite difficult to directly observe the Hawking radiation of an astrophysical black hole. Here, we report a fermionic lattice-model-type realization of an analogue black hole by using a chain of 10 superconducting transmon qubits with interactions mediated by 9 transmon-type tunable couplers. The quantum walks of quasi-particle in the curved spacetime reflect the gravitational effect near the black hole, resulting in the behaviour of stimulated Hawking radiation, which is verified by the state tomography measurement of all 7 qubits outside the horizon. In addition, the dynamics of entanglement in the curved spacetime is directly measured. Our results would stimulate more interests to explore the related features of black holes using the programmable superconducting processor with tunable couplers.</description>

      <title>Exploring Hilbert-Space Fragmentation on a Superconducting Processor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09095v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Isolated interacting quantum systems generally thermalize, yet there are several counterexamples for the breakdown of ergodicity, such as many-body localization and quantum scars. Recently, ergodicity breaking has been observed in systems subjected to linear potentials, termed Stark many-body localization. This phenomenon is closely associated with Hilbert-space fragmentation, characterized by a strong dependence of dynamics on initial conditions. Here, we experimentally explore initial-state dependent dynamics using a ladder-type superconducting processor with up to 24 qubits, which enables precise control of the qubit frequency and initial state preparation. In systems with linear potentials, we observe distinct non-equilibrium dynamics for initial states with the same quantum numbers and energy, but with varying domain wall numbers. This distinction becomes increasingly pronounced as the system size grows, in contrast with disordered interacting systems. Our results provide convincing experimental evidence of the fragmentation in Stark systems, enriching our understanding of the weak breakdown of ergodicity.</description>

      <title>Reversing non-Hermitian skin accumulation with a non-local transverse switch</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02686v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Asymmetrically directed couplings in non-Hermitian systems cause directional amplification that leads to boundary skin state accumulation. However, counter-intuitively, the direction of accumulation may not follow that of the directed couplings. In this work, we demonstrate new mechanisms where this accumulation can be systematically reversed without modifying the couplings at all, just by adjusting the system size or boundary conditions in a different, transverse direction. Moreover, the reversed skin dynamics can be made very robust by suppressing the amplification in the original non-reversed direction. We motivate our approach through a series of warm-up models, culminating in a designed non-Hermitian Kagome lattice whereby wavepacket simulations demonstrate how robust reversed skin dynamics can be switched on/off in a non-local transverse manner. Our findings highlight how the non-trivial entanglement between the spectral loops of different PBC directions can be harnessed as a directional amplification switch, paving the way for new avenues of non-Hermitian sensing and lasing.</description>

      <title>Two-dimensional magnetic tunnel p-n junctions for low-power electronics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04206v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For decades, semiconductors and their heterostructures have underpinned both fundamental and applied research across all areas of electronics. Two-dimensional, 2D (atomically thin) semiconductors have now the potential to push further the miniaturization of electronic components, enabling the development of more efficient electronics. Here, we report on a giant anomalous zero-bias spin voltage in magnetic tunnel junctions based on 2D materials. The generation, manipulation and detection of electron spin across a nanometer-thick magnetic tunnel junction do not require any applied bias. It is achieved by exploiting high-quality ferromagnetic/semiconductor interfaces and the asymmetric diffusion of spin-up/spin-down electrons across a semiconductor p-n junction. The large spin-voltage signal exceeds 30,000% and is far greater than the highest magnetoresistance signals reported to date. Our findings reveal unexplored opportunities to transform and amplify spin information for low-power electronics.</description>

      <title>Emerging (2+1)D electrodynamics and topological instanton in pseudo-Hermitian two-level systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07791v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We reveal a hidden electrodynamical structure emerging from a general $2\times2$ pseudo-Hermitian system that exhibits real spectra. Even when the Hamiltonian does not explicitly depend on time, the Berry curvature can be mapped onto a $2+1$ dimensional electromagnetic field arising from an artificial spacetime instanton, in sharp contrast to the Hermitian systems where the Berry curvature is equivalent to the static magnetic field of a magnetic monopole in three spatial dimensions. The instanton appearing as a spacetime singularity carries a topological charge that quantizes the jump of magnetic flux of the Berry curvature at the time origin. Our findings are demonstrated in a simple example related to antiferromagnetic magnons.</description>
