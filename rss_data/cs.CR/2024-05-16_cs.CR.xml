      <title>Large-Scale Security Analysis of Real-World Backend Deployments Speaking IoT-Focused Protocols</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09662v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Internet-of-Things devices, ranging from smart home assistants to health devices, are pervasive: Forecasts estimate their number to reach 29 billion by 2030. Understanding the security of their machine-to-machine communication is crucial. Prior work focused on identifying devices' vulnerabilities or proposed protocol-specific solutions. Instead, in this paper, we investigate the security of backends speaking Internet-of-Things (IoT) protocols at scale, that is, the backbone of the entire IoT ecosystem.
  We focus on three real-world protocols used by IoT for our large-scale analysis: MQTT, CoAP, and XMPP. We gather a dataset of over 337,000 backends, augment it with geographical and provider data, and perform non-invasive active measurements to investigate three major security threats: information leakage, weak authentication, and denial of service. Our results provide quantitative evidence of a problematic immaturity in the IoT security ecosystem. Among other issues, we find that 9.44% backends expose information, 30.38% CoAP-speaking backends are vulnerable to denial of service attacks, and 99.84% of MQTT-speaking and XMPP-speaking backends use insecure transport protocols (only 0.16% adopt TLS, of which 70.93% adopt a vulnerable version).</description>

      <title>DP-RuL: Differentially-Private Rule Learning for Clinical Decision Support Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Serious privacy concerns arise with the use of patient data in rule-based clinical decision support systems (CDSS). The goal of a privacy-preserving CDSS is to learn a population ruleset from individual clients' local rulesets, while protecting the potentially sensitive information contained in the rulesets. We present the first work focused on this problem and develop a framework for learning population rulesets with local differential privacy (LDP), suitable for use within a distributed CDSS and other distributed settings. Our rule discovery protocol uses a Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) method integrated with LDP to search a rule grammar in a structured way and find rule structures clients are likely to have. Randomized response queries are sent to clients to determine promising paths to search within the rule grammar. In addition, we introduce an adaptive budget allocation method which dynamically determines how much privacy loss budget to use at each query, resulting in better privacy-utility trade-offs. We evaluate our approach using three clinical datasets and find that we are able to learn population rulesets with high coverage (breadth of rules) and clinical utility even at low privacy loss budgets.</description>

      <title>Give and Take: An End-To-End Investigation of Giveaway Scam Conversion Rates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scams -- fraudulent schemes designed to swindle money from victims -- have existed for as long as recorded history. However, the Internet's combination of low communication cost, global reach, and functional anonymity has allowed scam volumes to reach new heights. Designing effective interventions requires first understanding the context: how scammers reach potential victims, the earnings they make, and any potential bottlenecks for durable interventions. In this short paper, we focus on these questions in the context of cryptocurrency giveaway scams, where victims are tricked into irreversibly transferring funds to scammers under the pretense of even greater returns. Combining data from Twitter, YouTube and Twitch livestreams, landing pages, and cryptocurrency blockchains, we measure how giveaway scams operate at scale. We find that 1 in 1000 scam tweets, and 4 in 100,000 livestream views, net a victim, and that scammers managed to extract nearly \$4.62 million from just hundreds of victims during our measurement window.</description>

      <title>DIMSIM -- Device Integrity Monitoring through iSIM Applets and Distributed Ledger Technology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the context of industrial environment, devices, such as robots and drones, are vulnerable to malicious activities such device tampering (e.g., hardware and software changes). The problem becomes even worse in a multi-stakeholder environment where multiple players contribute to an ecosystem.
  In such scenarios, particularly, when devices are deployed in remote settings, ensuring device integrity so that all stakeholders can trust them is challenging. Existing methods, often depend on additional hardware like the Trusted Platform Module (TPM) which may not be universally provided by all vendors. In this study, we introduce a distributed ledger technology-oriented architecture to monitor the remote devices' integrity using eUICC technology, a feature commonly found in industrial devices for cellular connectivity. We propose that using secure applets in eUICC, devices' integrity can be monitored and managed without installing any additional hardware.
  To this end, we present an end-to-end architecture to monitor device integrity thereby enabling all the stakeholders in the system to trust the devices. Additionally, we leverage the properties of immutable databases to provide robustness and efficiently to our model. In our primary evaluations, we measure the overhead caused by hashing our proposed data packets and performance of integrating an immutable database into our system. Our results show that performing hashing on our data packets takes order of microseconds, while reading and writing to an immutable database also requires only milliseconds.</description>

      <title>MarkLLM: An Open-Source Toolkit for LLM Watermarking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: LLM watermarking, which embeds imperceptible yet algorithmically detectable signals in model outputs to identify LLM-generated text, has become crucial in mitigating the potential misuse of large language models. However, the abundance of LLM watermarking algorithms, their intricate mechanisms, and the complex evaluation procedures and perspectives pose challenges for researchers and the community to easily experiment with, understand, and assess the latest advancements. To address these issues, we introduce MarkLLM, an open-source toolkit for LLM watermarking. MarkLLM offers a unified and extensible framework for implementing LLM watermarking algorithms, while providing user-friendly interfaces to ensure ease of access. Furthermore, it enhances understanding by supporting automatic visualization of the underlying mechanisms of these algorithms. For evaluation, MarkLLM offers a comprehensive suite of 12 tools spanning three perspectives, along with two types of automated evaluation pipelines. Through MarkLLM, we aim to support researchers while improving the comprehension and involvement of the general public in LLM watermarking technology, fostering consensus and driving further advancements in research and application. Our code is available at https://github.com/THU-BPM/MarkLLM.</description>

      <title>Trusting the Cloud-Native Edge: Remotely Attested Kubernetes Workers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10131v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A Kubernetes cluster typically consists of trusted nodes, running within the confines of a physically secure datacenter. With recent advances in edge orchestration, this is no longer the case. This poses a new challenge: how can we trust a device that an attacker has physical access to? This paper presents an architecture and open-source implementation that securely enrolls edge devices as trusted Kubernetes worker nodes. By providing boot attestation rooted in a hardware Trusted Platform Module, a strong base of trust is provided. A new custom controller directs a modified version of Keylime to cross the cloud-edge gap and securely deliver unique cluster credentials required to enroll an edge worker. The controller dynamically grants and revokes these credentials based on attestation events, preventing a possibly compromised node from accessing sensitive cluster resources. We provide both a qualitative and a quantitative evaluation of the architecture. The qualitative scenarios prove its ability to attest and enroll an edge device with role-based access control (RBAC) permissions that dynamically adjust to attestation events. The quantitative evaluation reflects an average of 10.28 seconds delay incurred on the startup time of the edge node due to attestation for a total average enrollment time of 20.91 seconds. The presented architecture thus provides a strong base of trust, securing a physically exposed edge device and paving the way for a robust and resilient edge computing ecosystem.</description>

      <title>Mask-based Invisible Backdoor Attacks on Object Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09550v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep learning models have achieved unprecedented performance in the domain of object detection, resulting in breakthroughs in areas such as autonomous driving and security. However, deep learning models are vulnerable to backdoor attacks. These attacks prompt models to behave similarly to standard models without a trigger; however, they act maliciously upon detecting a predefined trigger. Despite extensive research on backdoor attacks in image classification, their application to object detection remains relatively underexplored. Given the widespread application of object detection in critical real-world scenarios, the sensitivity and potential impact of these vulnerabilities cannot be overstated. In this study, we propose an effective invisible backdoor attack on object detection utilizing a mask-based approach. Three distinct attack scenarios were explored for object detection: object disappearance, object misclassification, and object generation attack. Through extensive experiments, we comprehensively examined the effectiveness of these attacks and tested certain defense methods to determine effective countermeasures.</description>

      <title>IBD-PSC: Input-level Backdoor Detection via Parameter-oriented Scaling Consistency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09786v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) are vulnerable to backdoor attacks, where adversaries can maliciously trigger model misclassifications by implanting a hidden backdoor during model training. This paper proposes a simple yet effective input-level backdoor detection (dubbed IBD-PSC) as a 'firewall' to filter out malicious testing images. Our method is motivated by an intriguing phenomenon, i.e., parameter-oriented scaling consistency (PSC), where the prediction confidences of poisoned samples are significantly more consistent than those of benign ones when amplifying model parameters. In particular, we provide theoretical analysis to safeguard the foundations of the PSC phenomenon. We also design an adaptive method to select BN layers to scale up for effective detection. Extensive experiments are conducted on benchmark datasets, verifying the effectiveness and efficiency of our IBD-PSC method and its resistance to adaptive attacks.</description>

      <title>SecureLLM: Using Compositionality to Build Provably Secure Language Models for Private, Sensitive, and Secret Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09805v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traditional security mechanisms isolate resources from users who should not access them. We reflect the compositional nature of such security mechanisms back into the structure of LLMs to build a provably secure LLM; that we term SecureLLM. Other approaches to LLM safety attempt to protect against bad actors or bad outcomes, but can only do so to an extent making them inappropriate for sensitive data. SecureLLM blends access security with fine-tuning methods. Each data silo has associated with it a separate fine-tuning and a user has access only to the collection of fine-tunings that they have permission for. The model must then perform on compositional tasks at the intersection of those data silos with the combination of those individual fine-tunings. While applicable to any task like document QA or making API calls, in this work we concern ourselves with models that learn the layouts of new SQL databases to provide natural-language-to-SQL translation capabilities. Existing fine-tuning composition methods fail in this challenging environment, as they are not well-equipped for handling compositional tasks. Compositionality remains a challenge for LLMs. We contribute both a difficult new compositional natural-language-to-SQL translation task and a new perspective on LLM security that allows models to be deployed to secure environments today.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the Potential: Harnessing Deep Metric Learning to Circumvent Video Streaming Encryption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09902v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Encryption on the internet with the shift to HTTPS has been an important step to improve the privacy of internet users. However, there is an increasing body of work about extracting information from encrypted internet traffic without having to decrypt it. Such attacks bypass security guarantees assumed to be given by HTTPS and thus need to be understood. Prior works showed that the variable bitrates of video streams are sufficient to identify which video someone is watching. These works generally have to make trade-offs in aspects such as accuracy, scalability, robustness, etc. These trade-offs complicate the practical use of these attacks. To that end, we propose a deep metric learning framework based on the triplet loss method. Through this framework, we achieve robust, generalisable, scalable and transferable encrypted video stream detection. First, the triplet loss is better able to deal with video streams not seen during training. Second, our approach can accurately classify videos not seen during training. Third, we show that our method scales well to a dataset of over 1000 videos. Finally, we show that a model trained on video streams over Chrome can also classify streams over Firefox. Our results suggest that this side-channel attack is more broadly applicable than originally thought. We provide our code alongside a diverse and up-to-date dataset for future research.</description>

      <title>The Effect of Quantization in Federated Learning: A R\'enyi Differential Privacy Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10096v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is an emerging paradigm that holds great promise for privacy-preserving machine learning using distributed data. To enhance privacy, FL can be combined with Differential Privacy (DP), which involves adding Gaussian noise to the model weights. However, FL faces a significant challenge in terms of large communication overhead when transmitting these model weights. To address this issue, quantization is commonly employed. Nevertheless, the presence of quantized Gaussian noise introduces complexities in understanding privacy protection. This research paper investigates the impact of quantization on privacy in FL systems. We examine the privacy guarantees of quantized Gaussian mechanisms using R\'enyi Differential Privacy (RDP). By deriving the privacy budget of quantized Gaussian mechanisms, we demonstrate that lower quantization bit levels provide improved privacy protection. To validate our theoretical findings, we employ Membership Inference Attacks (MIA), which gauge the accuracy of privacy leakage. The numerical results align with our theoretical analysis, confirming that quantization can indeed enhance privacy protection. This study not only enhances our understanding of the correlation between privacy and communication in FL but also underscores the advantages of quantization in preserving privacy.</description>

      <title>SoK: Prudent Evaluation Practices for Fuzzing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10220v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fuzzing has proven to be a highly effective approach to uncover software bugs over the past decade. After AFL popularized the groundbreaking concept of lightweight coverage feedback, the field of fuzzing has seen a vast amount of scientific work proposing new techniques, improving methodological aspects of existing strategies, or porting existing methods to new domains. All such work must demonstrate its merit by showing its applicability to a problem, measuring its performance, and often showing its superiority over existing works in a thorough, empirical evaluation. Yet, fuzzing is highly sensitive to its target, environment, and circumstances, e.g., randomness in the testing process. After all, relying on randomness is one of the core principles of fuzzing, governing many aspects of a fuzzer's behavior. Combined with the often highly difficult to control environment, the reproducibility of experiments is a crucial concern and requires a prudent evaluation setup. To address these threats to validity, several works, most notably Evaluating Fuzz Testing by Klees et al., have outlined how a carefully designed evaluation setup should be implemented, but it remains unknown to what extent their recommendations have been adopted in practice. In this work, we systematically analyze the evaluation of 150 fuzzing papers published at the top venues between 2018 and 2023. We study how existing guidelines are implemented and observe potential shortcomings and pitfalls. We find a surprising disregard of the existing guidelines regarding statistical tests and systematic errors in fuzzing evaluations. For example, when investigating reported bugs, ...</description>

      <title>Simultaneous Haar Indistinguishability with Applications to Unclonable Cryptography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10274v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unclonable cryptography is concerned with leveraging the no-cloning principle to build cryptographic primitives that are otherwise impossible to achieve classically. Understanding the feasibility of unclonable encryption, one of the key unclonable primitives, satisfying indistinguishability security in the plain model has been a major open question in the area. So far, the existing constructions of unclonable encryption are either in the quantum random oracle model or are based on new conjectures.
  We present a new approach to unclonable encryption via a reduction to a novel question about nonlocal quantum state discrimination: how well can non-communicating -- but entangled -- players distinguish between different distributions over quantum states? We call this task simultaneous state indistinguishability. Our main technical result is showing that the players cannot distinguish between each player receiving independently-chosen Haar random states versus all players receiving the same Haar random state.
  We leverage this result to present the first construction of unclonable encryption satisfying indistinguishability security, with quantum decryption keys, in the plain model. We also show other implications to single-decryptor encryption and leakage-resilient secret sharing.</description>

      <title>VulLibGen: Identifying Vulnerable Third-Party Libraries via Generative Pre-Trained Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.04662v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Security practitioners maintain vulnerability reports (e.g., GitHub Advisory) to help developers mitigate security risks. An important task for these databases is automatically extracting structured information mentioned in the report, e.g., the affected software packages, to accelerate the defense of the vulnerability ecosystem.
  However, it is challenging for existing work on affected package identification to achieve a high accuracy. One reason is that all existing work focuses on relatively smaller models, thus they cannot harness the knowledge and semantic capabilities of large language models.
  To address this limitation, we propose VulLibGen, the first method to use LLM for affected package identification. In contrast to existing work, VulLibGen proposes the novel idea to directly generate the affected package. To improve the accuracy, VulLibGen employs supervised fine-tuning (SFT), retrieval augmented generation (RAG) and a local search algorithm. The local search algorithm is a novel postprocessing algorithm we introduce for reducing the hallucination of the generated packages. Our evaluation results show that VulLibGen has an average accuracy of 0.806 for identifying vulnerable packages in the four most popular ecosystems in GitHub Advisory (Java, JS, Python, Go) while the best average accuracy in previous work is 0.721. Additionally, VulLibGen has high value to security practice: we submitted 60 &lt;vulnerability, affected package&gt; pairs to GitHub Advisory (covers four ecosystems). 34 of them have been accepted and merged and 20 are pending approval. Our code and dataset can be found in the attachments.</description>

      <title>PVF (Parameter Vulnerability Factor): A Quantitative Metric Measuring AI Vulnerability Against Parameter Corruptions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01741v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reliability of AI systems is a fundamental concern for the successful deployment and widespread adoption of AI technologies. Unfortunately, the escalating complexity and heterogeneity of AI hardware systems make them increasingly susceptible to hardware faults (e.g., bit flips) that can potentially corrupt model parameters. When this occurs during AI inference/servicing, it can potentially lead to incorrect or degraded model output for users, ultimately affecting the quality and reliability of AI services. In light of the escalating threat, it is crucial to address key questions: How vulnerable are AI models to parameter corruptions, and how do different components (such as modules, layers) of the models exhibit varying vulnerabilities to parameter corruptions? To systematically address this question, we propose a novel quantitative metric, Parameter Vulnerability Factor (PVF), inspired by architectural vulnerability factor (AVF) in computer architecture community, aiming to standardize the quantification of AI model vulnerability against parameter corruptions. We define a model parameter's PVF as the probability that a corruption in that particular model parameter will result in an incorrect output. In this paper, we present several use cases on applying PVF to three types of tasks/models during inference -- recommendation (DLRM), vision classification (CNN), and text classification (BERT), while presenting an in-depth vulnerability analysis on DLRM. PVF can provide pivotal insights to AI hardware designers in balancing the tradeoff between fault protection and performance/efficiency such as mapping vulnerable AI parameter components to well-protected hardware modules. PVF metric is applicable to any AI model and has a potential to help unify and standardize AI vulnerability/resilience evaluation practice.</description>

      <title>A Privacy Preserving System for Movie Recommendations Using Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.04689</link>

Abstract: Recommender systems have become ubiquitous in the past years. They solve the tyranny of choice problem faced by many users, and are utilized by many online businesses to drive engagement and sales. Besides other criticisms, like creating filter bubbles within social networks, recommender systems are often reproved for collecting considerable amounts of personal data. However, to personalize recommendations, personal information is fundamentally required. A recent distributed learning scheme called federated learning has made it possible to learn from personal user data without its central collection. Consequently, we present a recommender system for movie recommendations, which provides privacy and thus trustworthiness on multiple levels: First and foremost, it is trained using federated learning and thus, by its very nature, privacy-preserving, while still enabling users to benefit from global insights. Furthermore, a novel federated learning scheme, called FedQ, is employed, which not only addresses the problem of non-i.i.d.-ness and small local datasets, but also prevents input data reconstruction attacks by aggregating client updates early. Finally, to reduce the communication overhead, compression is applied, which significantly compresses the exchanged neural network parametrizations to a fraction of their original size. We conjecture that this may also improve data privacy through its lossy quantization stage.</description>

Abstract: We establish dihedral quantum codes of short block length, a class of CSS codes obtained by the lifted product construction. We present the code construction and give a formula for the code dimension, depending on the two classical codes that the CSS code is based on. We also give a lower bound on the code distance and construct an example of short dihedral quantum codes.</description>

      <title>Differentially-Private Hierarchical Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.11592v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While federated learning (FL) eliminates the transmission of raw data over a network, it is still vulnerable to privacy breaches from the communicated model parameters. In this work, we propose \underline{H}ierarchical \underline{F}ederated Learning with \underline{H}ierarchical \underline{D}ifferential \underline{P}rivacy ({\tt H$^2$FDP}), a DP-enhanced FL methodology for jointly optimizing privacy and performance in hierarchical networks. Building upon recent proposals for Hierarchical Differential Privacy (HDP), one of the key concepts of {\tt H$^2$FDP} is adapting DP noise injection at different layers of an established FL hierarchy -- edge devices, edge servers, and cloud servers -- according to the trust models within particular subnetworks. We conduct a comprehensive analysis of the convergence behavior of {\tt H$^2$FDP}, revealing conditions on parameter tuning under which the training process converges sublinearly to a finite stationarity gap that depends on the network hierarchy, trust model, and target privacy level.
  Leveraging these relationships, we develop an adaptive control algorithm for {\tt H$^2$FDP} that tunes properties of local model training to minimize communication energy, latency, and the stationarity gap while striving to maintain a sub-linear convergence rate and meet desired privacy criteria.
  Subsequent numerical evaluations demonstrate that {\tt H$^2$FDP} obtains substantial improvements in these metrics over baselines for different privacy budgets, and validate the impact of different system configurations.</description>

      <title>Generalization or Memorization: Data Contamination and Trustworthy Evaluation for Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.15938v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent statements about the impressive capabilities of large language models (LLMs) are usually supported by evaluating on open-access benchmarks. Considering the vast size and wide-ranging sources of LLMs' training data, it could explicitly or implicitly include test data, leading to LLMs being more susceptible to data contamination. However, due to the opacity of training data, the black-box access of models, and the rapid growth of synthetic training data, detecting and mitigating data contamination for LLMs faces significant challenges. In this paper, we propose CDD, which stands for Contamination Detection via output Distribution for LLMs. CDD necessitates only the sampled texts to detect data contamination, by identifying the peakedness of LLM's output distribution. To mitigate the impact of data contamination in evaluation, we also present TED: Trustworthy Evaluation via output Distribution, based on the correction of LLM's output distribution. To facilitate this study, we introduce two benchmarks, i.e., DetCon and ComiEval, for data contamination detection and contamination mitigation evaluation tasks. Extensive experimental results show that CDD achieves the average relative improvements of 21.8\%-30.2\% over other contamination detection approaches in terms of Accuracy, F1 Score, and AUC metrics, and can effectively detect contamination caused by the variants of test data. TED significantly mitigates performance improvements up to 66.9\% attributed to data contamination across 24 settings and 21 contamination degrees. In real-world applications, we reveal that ChatGPT exhibits a high potential to suffer from data contamination on HumanEval benchmark.</description>

      <title>Disguised Copyright Infringement of Latent Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06737v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Copyright infringement may occur when a generative model produces samples substantially similar to some copyrighted data that it had access to during the training phase. The notion of access usually refers to including copyrighted samples directly in the training dataset, which one may inspect to identify an infringement. We argue that such visual auditing largely overlooks a concealed copyright infringement, where one constructs a disguise that looks drastically different from the copyrighted sample yet still induces the effect of training Latent Diffusion Models on it. Such disguises only require indirect access to the copyrighted material and cannot be visually distinguished, thus easily circumventing the current auditing tools. In this paper, we provide a better understanding of such disguised copyright infringement by uncovering the disguises generation algorithm, the revelation of the disguises, and importantly, how to detect them to augment the existing toolbox. Additionally, we introduce a broader notion of acknowledgment for comprehending such indirect access.</description>

      <title>Protecting Your LLMs with Information Bottleneck</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13968v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The advent of large language models (LLMs) has revolutionized the field of natural language processing, yet they might be attacked to produce harmful content. Despite efforts to ethically align LLMs, these are often fragile and can be circumvented by jailbreaking attacks through optimized or manual adversarial prompts. To address this, we introduce the Information Bottleneck Protector (IBProtector), a defense mechanism grounded in the information bottleneck principle, and we modify the objective to avoid trivial solutions. The IBProtector selectively compresses and perturbs prompts, facilitated by a lightweight and trainable extractor, preserving only essential information for the target LLMs to respond with the expected answer. Moreover, we further consider a situation where the gradient is not visible to be compatible with any LLM. Our empirical evaluations show that IBProtector outperforms current defense methods in mitigating jailbreak attempts, without overly affecting response quality or inference speed. Its effectiveness and adaptability across various attack methods and target LLMs underscore the potential of IBProtector as a novel, transferable defense that bolsters the security of LLMs without requiring modifications to the underlying models.</description>

      <title>Guardians of the Quantum GAN</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.16156v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum Generative Adversarial Networks (qGANs) are at the forefront of image-generating quantum machine learning models. To accommodate the growing demand for Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices to train and infer quantum machine learning models, the number of third-party vendors offering quantum hardware as a service is expected to rise. This expansion introduces the risk of untrusted vendors potentially stealing proprietary information from the quantum machine learning models. To address this concern we propose a novel watermarking technique that exploits the noise signature embedded during the training phase of qGANs as a non-invasive watermark. The watermark is identifiable in the images generated by the qGAN allowing us to trace the specific quantum hardware used during training hence providing strong proof of ownership. To further enhance the security robustness, we propose the training of qGANs on a sequence of multiple quantum hardware, embedding a complex watermark comprising the noise signatures of all the training hardware that is difficult for adversaries to replicate. We also develop a machine learning classifier to extract this watermark robustly, thereby identifying the training hardware (or the suite of hardware) from the images generated by the qGAN validating the authenticity of the model. We note that the watermark signature is robust against inferencing on hardware different than the hardware that was used for training. We obtain watermark extraction accuracy of 100% and ~90% for training the qGAN on individual and multiple quantum hardware setups (and inferencing on different hardware), respectively. Since parameter evolution during training is strongly modulated by quantum noise, the proposed watermark can be extended to other quantum machine learning models as well.</description>

      <title>Neural Collapse Meets Differential Privacy: Curious Behaviors of NoisyGD with Near-perfect Representation Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08920v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A recent study by De et al. (2022) has reported that large-scale representation learning through pre-training on a public dataset significantly enhances differentially private (DP) learning in downstream tasks, despite the high dimensionality of the feature space. To theoretically explain this phenomenon, we consider the setting of a layer-peeled model in representation learning, which results in interesting phenomena related to learned features in deep learning and transfer learning, known as Neural Collapse (NC).
  Within the framework of NC, we establish an error bound indicating that the misclassification error is independent of dimension when the distance between actual features and the ideal ones is smaller than a threshold. Additionally, the quality of the features in the last layer is empirically evaluated under different pre-trained models within the framework of NC, showing that a more powerful transformer leads to a better feature representation. Furthermore, we reveal that DP fine-tuning is less robust compared to fine-tuning without DP, particularly in the presence of perturbations. These observations are supported by both theoretical analyses and experimental evaluation. Moreover, to enhance the robustness of DP fine-tuning, we suggest several strategies, such as feature normalization or employing dimension reduction methods like Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Empirically, we demonstrate a significant improvement in testing accuracy by conducting PCA on the last-layer features.</description>
