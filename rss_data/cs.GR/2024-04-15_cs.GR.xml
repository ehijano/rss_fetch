      <title>InverseVis: Revealing the Hidden with Curved Sphere Tracing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09092v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exploratory analysis of scalar fields on surface meshes presents significant challenges in identifying and visualizing important regions, particularly on the surface's backside. Previous visualization methods achieved only a limited visibility of significant features, i.e., regions with high or low scalar values, during interactive exploration. In response to this, we propose a novel technique, InverseVis, which leverages curved sphere tracing and uses the otherwise unused space to enhance visibility. Our approach combines direct and indirect rendering, allowing camera rays to wrap around the surface and reveal information from the backside. To achieve this, we formulate an energy term that guides the image synthesis in previously unused space, highlighting the most important regions of the backside. By quantifying the amount of visible important features, we optimize the camera position to maximize the visibility of the scalar field on both the front and backsides. InverseVis is benchmarked against state-of-the-art methods and a derived technique, showcasing its effectiveness in revealing essential features and outperforming existing approaches.</description>

      <title>Transforming a Non-Differentiable Rasterizer into a Differentiable One with Stochastic Gradient Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09758v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show how to transform a non-differentiable rasterizer into a differentiable one with minimal engineering efforts and no external dependencies (no Pytorch/Tensorflow). We rely on Stochastic Gradient Estimation, a technique that consists of rasterizing after randomly perturbing the scene's parameters such that their gradient can be stochastically estimated and descended. This method is simple and robust but does not scale in dimensionality (number of scene parameters). Our insight is that the number of parameters contributing to a given rasterized pixel is bounded. Estimating and averaging gradients on a per-pixel basis hence bounds the dimensionality of the underlying optimization problem and makes the method scalable. Furthermore, it is simple to track per-pixel contributing parameters by rasterizing ID- and UV-buffers, which are trivial additions to a rasterization engine if not already available. With these minor modifications, we obtain an in-engine optimizer for 3D assets with millions of geometry and texture parameters.</description>

      <title>EGGS: Edge Guided Gaussian Splatting for Radiance Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09105v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Gaussian splatting methods are getting popular. However, their loss function only contains the $\ell_1$ norm and the structural similarity between the rendered and input images, without considering the edges in these images. It is well-known that the edges in an image provide important information. Therefore, in this paper, we propose an Edge Guided Gaussian Splatting (EGGS) method that leverages the edges in the input images. More specifically, we give the edge region a higher weight than the flat region. With such edge guidance, the resulting Gaussian particles focus more on the edges instead of the flat regions. Moreover, such edge guidance does not crease the computation cost during the training and rendering stage. The experiments confirm that such simple edge-weighted loss function indeed improves about $1\sim2$ dB on several difference data sets. With simply plugging in the edge guidance, the proposed method can improve all Gaussian splatting methods in different scenarios, such as human head modeling, building 3D reconstruction, etc.</description>

      <title>Learning Cross-hand Policies for High-DOF Reaching and Grasping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09150v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reaching-and-grasping is a fundamental skill for robotic manipulation, but existing methods usually train models on a specific gripper and cannot be reused on another gripper without retraining. In this paper, we propose a novel method that can learn a unified policy model that can be easily transferred to different dexterous grippers. Our method consists of two stages: a gripper-agnostic policy model that predicts the displacements of predefined key points on the gripper, and a gripper specific adaptation model that translates these displacements into adjustments for controlling the grippers' joints. The gripper state and interactions with objects are captured at the finger level using robust geometric representations, integrated with a transformer-based network to address variations in gripper morphology and geometry. In the experimental part, we evaluate our method on several dexterous grippers and objects of diverse shapes, and the result shows that our method significantly outperforms the baseline methods. Pioneering the transfer of grasp policies across different dexterous grippers, our method effectively demonstrates its potential for learning generalizable and transferable manipulation skills for various robotic hands</description>

      <title>CompGS: Efficient 3D Scene Representation via Compressed Gaussian Splatting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09458v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gaussian splatting, renowned for its exceptional rendering quality and efficiency, has emerged as a prominent technique in 3D scene representation. However, the substantial data volume of Gaussian splatting impedes its practical utility in real-world applications. Herein, we propose an efficient 3D scene representation, named Compressed Gaussian Splatting (CompGS), which harnesses compact Gaussian primitives for faithful 3D scene modeling with a remarkably reduced data size. To ensure the compactness of Gaussian primitives, we devise a hybrid primitive structure that captures predictive relationships between each other. Then, we exploit a small set of anchor primitives for prediction, allowing the majority of primitives to be encapsulated into highly compact residual forms. Moreover, we develop a rate-constrained optimization scheme to eliminate redundancies within such hybrid primitives, steering our CompGS towards an optimal trade-off between bitrate consumption and representation efficacy. Experimental results show that the proposed CompGS significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving superior compactness in 3D scene representation without compromising model accuracy and rendering quality. Our code will be released on GitHub for further research.</description>

      <title>Learning Human Motion from Monocular Videos via Cross-Modal Manifold Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09499v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Learning 3D human motion from 2D inputs is a fundamental task in the realms of computer vision and computer graphics. Many previous methods grapple with this inherently ambiguous task by introducing motion priors into the learning process. However, these approaches face difficulties in defining the complete configurations of such priors or training a robust model. In this paper, we present the Video-to-Motion Generator (VTM), which leverages motion priors through cross-modal latent feature space alignment between 3D human motion and 2D inputs, namely videos and 2D keypoints. To reduce the complexity of modeling motion priors, we model the motion data separately for the upper and lower body parts. Additionally, we align the motion data with a scale-invariant virtual skeleton to mitigate the interference of human skeleton variations to the motion priors. Evaluated on AIST++, the VTM showcases state-of-the-art performance in reconstructing 3D human motion from monocular videos. Notably, our VTM exhibits the capabilities for generalization to unseen view angles and in-the-wild videos.</description>

      <title>Oblique-MERF: Revisiting and Improving MERF for Oblique Photography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09531v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural implicit fields have established a new paradigm for scene representation, with subsequent work achieving high-quality real-time rendering. However, reconstructing 3D scenes from oblique aerial photography presents unique challenges, such as varying spatial scale distributions and a constrained range of tilt angles, often resulting in high memory consumption and reduced rendering quality at extrapolated viewpoints. In this paper, we enhance MERF to accommodate these data characteristics by introducing an innovative adaptive occupancy plane optimized during the volume rendering process and a smoothness regularization term for view-dependent color to address these issues. Our approach, termed Oblique-MERF, surpasses state-of-the-art real-time methods by approximately 0.7 dB, reduces VRAM usage by about 40%, and achieves higher rendering frame rates with more realistic rendering outcomes across most viewpoints.</description>

      <title>Reconstructing Curves from Sparse Samples on Riemannian Manifolds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09661v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reconstructing 2D curves from sample points has long been a critical challenge in computer graphics, finding essential applications in vector graphics. The design and editing of curves on surfaces has only recently begun to receive attention, primarily relying on human assistance, and where not, limited by very strict sampling conditions. In this work, we formally improve on the state-of-the-art requirements and introduce an innovative algorithm capable of reconstructing closed curves directly on surfaces from a given sparse set of sample points. We extend and adapt a state-of-the-art planar curve reconstruction method to the realm of surfaces while dealing with the challenges arising from working on non-Euclidean domains. We demonstrate the robustness of our method by reconstructing multiple curves on various surface meshes. We explore novel potential applications of our approach, allowing for automated reconstruction of curves on Riemannian manifolds.</description>

      <title>LetsGo: Large-Scale Garage Modeling and Rendering via LiDAR-Assisted Gaussian Primitives</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09748v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large garages are ubiquitous yet intricate scenes in our daily lives, posing challenges characterized by monotonous colors, repetitive patterns, reflective surfaces, and transparent vehicle glass. Conventional Structure from Motion (SfM) methods for camera pose estimation and 3D reconstruction fail in these environments due to poor correspondence construction. To address these challenges, this paper introduces LetsGo, a LiDAR-assisted Gaussian splatting approach for large-scale garage modeling and rendering. We develop a handheld scanner, Polar, equipped with IMU, LiDAR, and a fisheye camera, to facilitate accurate LiDAR and image data scanning. With this Polar device, we present a GarageWorld dataset consisting of five expansive garage scenes with diverse geometric structures and will release the dataset to the community for further research. We demonstrate that the collected LiDAR point cloud by the Polar device enhances a suite of 3D Gaussian splatting algorithms for garage scene modeling and rendering. We also propose a novel depth regularizer for 3D Gaussian splatting algorithm training, effectively eliminating floating artifacts in rendered images, and a lightweight Level of Detail (LOD) Gaussian renderer for real-time viewing on web-based devices. Additionally, we explore a hybrid representation that combines the advantages of traditional mesh in depicting simple geometry and colors (e.g., walls and the ground) with modern 3D Gaussian representations capturing complex details and high-frequency textures. This strategy achieves an optimal balance between memory performance and rendering quality. Experimental results on our dataset, along with ScanNet++ and KITTI-360, demonstrate the superiority of our method in rendering quality and resource efficiency.</description>

      <title>PhysGaussian: Physics-Integrated 3D Gaussians for Generative Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.12198v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce PhysGaussian, a new method that seamlessly integrates physically grounded Newtonian dynamics within 3D Gaussians to achieve high-quality novel motion synthesis. Employing a custom Material Point Method (MPM), our approach enriches 3D Gaussian kernels with physically meaningful kinematic deformation and mechanical stress attributes, all evolved in line with continuum mechanics principles. A defining characteristic of our method is the seamless integration between physical simulation and visual rendering: both components utilize the same 3D Gaussian kernels as their discrete representations. This negates the necessity for triangle/tetrahedron meshing, marching cubes, "cage meshes," or any other geometry embedding, highlighting the principle of "what you see is what you simulate (WS$^2$)." Our method demonstrates exceptional versatility across a wide variety of materials--including elastic entities, metals, non-Newtonian fluids, and granular materials--showcasing its strong capabilities in creating diverse visual content with novel viewpoints and movements.

      <description>arXiv:2109.14406v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Coordinate-based Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) networks, despite being capable of learning neural implicit representations, are not performant for internal image synthesis applications. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are typically used instead for a variety of internal generative tasks, at the cost of a larger model. We propose Neural Knitwork, an architecture for neural implicit representation learning of natural images that achieves image synthesis by optimizing the distribution of image patches in an adversarial manner and by enforcing consistency between the patch predictions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first implementation of a coordinate-based MLP tailored for synthesis tasks such as image inpainting, super-resolution, and denoising. We demonstrate the utility of the proposed technique by training on these three tasks. The results show that modeling natural images using patches, rather than pixels, produces results of higher fidelity. The resulting model requires 80% fewer parameters than alternative CNN-based solutions while achieving comparable performance and training time.</description>

      <title>Audio is all in one: speech-driven gesture synthetics using WavLM pre-trained model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.05995v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The generation of co-speech gestures for digital humans is an emerging area in the field of virtual human creation. Prior research has made progress by using acoustic and semantic information as input and adopting classify method to identify the person's ID and emotion for driving co-speech gesture generation. However, this endeavour still faces significant challenges. These challenges go beyond the intricate interplay between co-speech gestures, speech acoustic, and semantics; they also encompass the complexities associated with personality, emotion, and other obscure but important factors. This paper introduces "diffmotion-v2," a speech-conditional diffusion-based and non-autoregressive transformer-based generative model with WavLM pre-trained model. It can produce individual and stylized full-body co-speech gestures only using raw speech audio, eliminating the need for complex multimodal processing and manually annotated. Firstly, considering that speech audio not only contains acoustic and semantic features but also conveys personality traits, emotions, and more subtle information related to accompanying gestures, we pioneer the adaptation of WavLM, a large-scale pre-trained model, to extract low-level and high-level audio information. Secondly, we introduce an adaptive layer norm architecture in the transformer-based layer to learn the relationship between speech information and accompanying gestures. Extensive subjective evaluation experiments are conducted on the Trinity, ZEGGS, and BEAT datasets to confirm the WavLM and the model's ability to synthesize natural co-speech gestures with various styles.</description>

      <title>SyncDreamer: Generating Multiview-consistent Images from a Single-view Image</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.03453v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel diffusion model called that generates multiview-consistent images from a single-view image. Using pretrained large-scale 2D diffusion models, recent work Zero123 demonstrates the ability to generate plausible novel views from a single-view image of an object. However, maintaining consistency in geometry and colors for the generated images remains a challenge. To address this issue, we propose a synchronized multiview diffusion model that models the joint probability distribution of multiview images, enabling the generation of multiview-consistent images in a single reverse process. SyncDreamer synchronizes the intermediate states of all the generated images at every step of the reverse process through a 3D-aware feature attention mechanism that correlates the corresponding features across different views. Experiments show that SyncDreamer generates images with high consistency across different views, thus making it well-suited for various 3D generation tasks such as novel-view-synthesis, text-to-3D, and image-to-3D.</description>

      <title>OmniControl: Control Any Joint at Any Time for Human Motion Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.08580v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a novel approach named OmniControl for incorporating flexible spatial control signals into a text-conditioned human motion generation model based on the diffusion process. Unlike previous methods that can only control the pelvis trajectory, OmniControl can incorporate flexible spatial control signals over different joints at different times with only one model. Specifically, we propose analytic spatial guidance that ensures the generated motion can tightly conform to the input control signals. At the same time, realism guidance is introduced to refine all the joints to generate more coherent motion. Both the spatial and realism guidance are essential and they are highly complementary for balancing control accuracy and motion realism. By combining them, OmniControl generates motions that are realistic, coherent, and consistent with the spatial constraints. Experiments on HumanML3D and KIT-ML datasets show that OmniControl not only achieves significant improvement over state-of-the-art methods on pelvis control but also shows promising results when incorporating the constraints over other joints.</description>

Abstract: Capturing and preserving motion semantics is essential to motion retargeting between animation characters. However, most of the previous works neglect the semantic information or rely on human-designed joint-level representations. Here, we present a novel Semantics-aware Motion reTargeting (SMT) method with the advantage of vision-language models to extract and maintain meaningful motion semantics. We utilize a differentiable module to render 3D motions. Then the high-level motion semantics are incorporated into the motion retargeting process by feeding the vision-language model with the rendered images and aligning the extracted semantic embeddings. To ensure the preservation of fine-grained motion details and high-level semantics, we adopt a two-stage pipeline consisting of skeleton-aware pre-training and fine-tuning with semantics and geometry constraints. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed method in producing high-quality motion retargeting results while accurately preserving motion semantics.</description>

Abstract: 3D Gaussian splatting (GS) has recently emerged as a transformative technique in the realm of explicit radiance field and computer graphics. This innovative approach, characterized by the utilization of millions of learnable 3D Gaussians, represents a significant departure from mainstream neural radiance field approaches, which predominantly use implicit, coordinate-based models to map spatial coordinates to pixel values. 3D GS, with its explicit scene representation and differentiable rendering algorithm, not only promises real-time rendering capability but also introduces unprecedented levels of editability. This positions 3D GS as a potential game-changer for the next generation of 3D reconstruction and representation. In the present paper, we provide the first systematic overview of the recent developments and critical contributions in the domain of 3D GS. We begin with a detailed exploration of the underlying principles and the driving forces behind the emergence of 3D GS, laying the groundwork for understanding its significance. A focal point of our discussion is the practical applicability of 3D GS. By enabling unprecedented rendering speed, 3D GS opens up a plethora of applications, ranging from virtual reality to interactive media and beyond. This is complemented by a comparative analysis of leading 3D GS models, evaluated across various benchmark tasks to highlight their performance and practical utility. The survey concludes by identifying current challenges and suggesting potential avenues for future research in this domain. Through this survey, we aim to provide a valuable resource for both newcomers and seasoned researchers, fostering further exploration and advancement in applicable and explicit radiance field representation.</description>

      <title>Objects With Lighting: A Real-World Dataset for Evaluating Reconstruction and Rendering for Object Relighting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.09126v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reconstructing an object from photos and placing it virtually in a new environment goes beyond the standard novel view synthesis task as the appearance of the object has to not only adapt to the novel viewpoint but also to the new lighting conditions and yet evaluations of inverse rendering methods rely on novel view synthesis data or simplistic synthetic datasets for quantitative analysis. This work presents a real-world dataset for measuring the reconstruction and rendering of objects for relighting. To this end, we capture the environment lighting and ground truth images of the same objects in multiple environments allowing to reconstruct the objects from images taken in one environment and quantify the quality of the rendered views for the unseen lighting environments. Further, we introduce a simple baseline composed of off-the-shelf methods and test several state-of-the-art methods on the relighting task and show that novel view synthesis is not a reliable proxy to measure performance. Code and dataset are available at https://github.com/isl-org/objects-with-lighting .</description>

      <title>Recent Advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11134v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The emergence of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has greatly accelerated the rendering speed of novel view synthesis. Unlike neural implicit representations like Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) that represent a 3D scene with position and viewpoint-conditioned neural networks, 3D Gaussian Splatting utilizes a set of Gaussian ellipsoids to model the scene so that efficient rendering can be accomplished by rasterizing Gaussian ellipsoids into images. Apart from the fast rendering speed, the explicit representation of 3D Gaussian Splatting facilitates editing tasks like dynamic reconstruction, geometry editing, and physical simulation. Considering the rapid change and growing number of works in this field, we present a literature review of recent 3D Gaussian Splatting methods, which can be roughly classified into 3D reconstruction, 3D editing, and other downstream applications by functionality. Traditional point-based rendering methods and the rendering formulation of 3D Gaussian Splatting are also illustrated for a better understanding of this technique. This survey aims to help beginners get into this field quickly and provide experienced researchers with a comprehensive overview, which can stimulate the future development of the 3D Gaussian Splatting representation.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Text-to-Image Synthesis: Survey and Taxonomy of Image Quality Metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11821v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-image synthesis enabled through a combination of language and vision foundation models have led to a proliferation of the tools available and an increased attention to the field. When conducting text-to-image synthesis, a central goal is to ensure that the content between text and image is aligned. As such, there exist numerous evaluation metrics that aim to mimic human judgement. However, it is often unclear which metric to use for evaluating text-to-image synthesis systems as their evaluation is highly nuanced. In this work, we provide a comprehensive overview of existing text-to-image evaluation metrics. Based on our findings, we propose a new taxonomy for categorizing these metrics. Our taxonomy is grounded in the assumption that there are two main quality criteria, namely compositionality and generality, which ideally map to human preferences. Ultimately, we derive guidelines for practitioners conducting text-to-image evaluation, discuss open challenges of evaluation mechanisms, and surface limitations of current metrics.</description>
