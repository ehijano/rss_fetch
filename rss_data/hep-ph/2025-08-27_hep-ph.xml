      <title>Unified Gas Heating Constraints on Extended Dark Matter Compact Objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18344v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first unified constraints on a broad class of extended dark matter compact objects (EDCOs) from interstellar gas heating. These include axion stars, Q-balls, axion miniclusters, dark fermion stars and primordial black holes surrounded by dark matter halos, which arise in a wide range of theories beyond the Standard Model. As such massive objects traverse the interstellar medium, their gravitational influence generates wakes and, if sufficiently compact, drives accretion flows that heat gas in their vicinity. Our general framework extends standard dynamical friction treatments by incorporating finite-size effects, internal density profiles, gas penetration through objects, and criteria for accretion disk formation. We perform detailed numerical calculations of wake formation and gas heating and apply our results to the Leo T dwarf galaxy, establishing new constraints on the dark matter fraction in EDCOs heavier than a solar mass spanning several orders of magnitude in both mass and abundance.</description>

      <title>Spin Correlations in Dark Photon Searches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18352v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the spin correlations between production and decay in the process where dark photons $A'$ are produced in pseudoscalar meson decays, for example, $\pi^0, \eta \to \gamma A'$, and then decay to fermion pairs, $A' \to f \bar{f}$. This process is the focus of many experimental searches, but spin correlations are typically ignored. We derive analytic results that allow us to quickly scan parameter space and quantify the error made in neglecting spin correlations. In particular, we define a discrepancy parameter and find that this parameter is always less than $\frac{1}{6\sqrt{3}} \approx 9.6\%$, which provides a rough measure of the size of spin correlation effects. However, these effects may be enhanced or suppressed by cuts in realistic experimental analyses, and so we also consider two representative examples, including current FASER analyses and possible future searches at SHiP. We find that the effects of spin correlations are negligible for existing FASER analyses, but can significantly reduce event rates at upcoming SHiP searches.</description>

      <title>Reduction of Feynman Integrals in the Parametric Representation IV: Integrals with Irregular Integration Regions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18419v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Parametric Feynman integrals with the regions of integration defined by some polynomials are considered in this paper. It is shown that integrals with irregular integration regions can be converted to standard parametric integrals, for which a reduction method is known. An application of this method to the analytic calculation of three-point energy correlators is presented. In principle, this method applies to more general event shapes and even jet observables.</description>

      <title>Evaluating the ratio of the exclusive vector meson photoproduction to inclusive hadron/jet production cross section in ultraperipheral heavy ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18438v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using the QCD color dipole picture to exclusive vector meson and inclusive jet/open meson photoproduction, we calculate the ratio of the elastic meson production and inclusive hadron production cross sections for ultraperipheral heavy ion collisions. Predictions are evaluated for run 4 of the Large Hadron Collider in proton-nucleus ($pA$) and nucleus-nucleus ($AA$) collisions. The dependencies of the ratio on jet/hadron transverse momentum and atomic number are investigated. The double ratio $R_{\mathrm{UPC}}$ for $AA$ over $pA$ collisions is also computed, which has been previously proposed as a new observable probing parton saturation physics.</description>

      <title>Searching for the Leptophilic Gauge Boson Z$_{l}$ at Future $e^{+}e^{-}$ Colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18496v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the discovery prospects of the leptophilic photon Z\_l, a hypothetical gauge boson beyond the Standard Model, at future electron-positron colliders. Our analysis is based on the process e+e- -&gt; mu+mu- and consistently includes realistic effects such as initial state radiation and beamstrahlung. Using the benchmark parameters of FCC-ee, CEPC, ILC, and CLIC, we demonstrate the complementarity of circular and linear colliders: circular machines achieve excellent sensitivity to very small couplings, down to g\_l ~ 10^{-4}, while high-energy linear colliders extend the search reach into the TeV domain.</description>

      <title>Comparing Calculations of Seasonal Variations of Atmospheric Muons in Deep Underground Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cosmic rays interact with nuclei in the Earth's atmosphere to produce extensive air showers, which give rise to the atmospheric muon flux. Temperature fluctuations in the atmosphere influence the rate of muons measured in deep underground experiments. This contribution presents predictions of the daily muon flux at a depth of 2000 m.w.e., calculated using MUTE, a software tool which combines MCEq, a numerical solver of the matrix cascade equations in the atmosphere, with PROPOSAL, a propagation code for leptons in matter. The flux estimates are obtained assuming different cosmic-ray flux and hadronic interaction models. The results are compared to previous approaches, based on different methods, to calculate seasonal variations of atmospheric muons in deep underground detectors.</description>

      <title>Gravitational $ D$-Form Factor: The $\sigma$-Meson as a Dilaton confronted with Lattice Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18537v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the nucleon and pion gravitational $D$-form factors, by fitting a $\sigma/f_0(500)$-meson pole, together with a background term, to lattice data at $m_\pi \approx 170\text{MeV}$. We find that the fitted residues are compatible with predictions from dilaton effective theory. In this framework, the $\sigma$-meson takes on the role of the dilaton, the Goldstone boson of spontaneously broken scale symmetry. These results support the idea that QCD may be governed by an infrared fixed point and offer a physical interpretation of the $D$-form factor (or $D$-term) in the soft limit.</description>

      <title>One texture zero for Dirac neutrinos in a diagonal charged lepton basis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18611v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An analytic and numerical systematic study of the neutrino mass matrix $M_\nu$ with one texture zero in a basis where the charged leptons are diagonal, and under the assumption that neutrinos are Dirac particles, is carried through in detail. Our study is done without any approximation, first analytically and then numerically. Current neutrino oscillation data are used in our calculations. The analysis done constraints the parameter space in such a way that among the six possible one texture zero patterns, only four turn out to be favored by current neutrino oscillation data at the $3\sigma$ level. Phenomenological implications on the lepton CP violation phase and neutrino masses are explored.</description>

      <title>A $Z_4$ Scotogenic Model with Higgs Portal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18713v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a new Scotogenic type model based on a global $Z_4$ symmetry involving dark matter candidates. After the symmetry breaking as $Z_4$ to $Z_2$ via the singlet scalar vacuum expectation value (VEV), the lightest Majorana fermion works as a viable thermal freeze-out dark matter (DM) candidate, and the mass terms for active neutrinos are generated as a finite quantum correction at the 1-loop level. A key point of realising our Scotogenic structure is to introduce two types of Majorana fermions (heavy right-handed neutrinos) and inert Higgs doublets with opposite $Z_4$ parities. Since a large VEV for the singlet scalar is not so harmful in an appropriate realisation of the Higgs mechanism for the SM gauge symmetry, we can naturally realise a TeV-scale fermionic DM candidate, where constraints via direct detection experiments are less than those for sub-TeV DM. Our scenario involves the Higgs-portal DM interactions, which help the realisation of the correct DM relic abundance. Relying on the structure of the model, it is possible to find a natural partner for coannihilation. Our scenario can be investigated via the measurement of the Higgs trilinear self-coupling at the Large Hadron Collider. The simplest way to evade the domain-wall problem by adding a tiny soft $Z_2$ breaking term works, keeping a sufficient longevity of the decaying DM lifetime.</description>

      <title>Decays of $\Upsilon(10860)$ and $\Upsilon(10753)$ into $\omega\chi_{bJ}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we model $\Upsilon(10753)$ as a $4S$-$3D$ bottomonium mixture and $\Upsilon(10860)$ as a $5S$-$4D$ mixture, and predict the properties of a new bottomonium state, $\Upsilon(10950)$, as the mixing partner of $\Upsilon(10860)$. The mixing angles are derived from dielectron decay widths and mass shifts of these bottomonia. We consider open-bottom meson loops in the decays of the $D$-wave bottomonium components, based on a nonrelativistic effective field theory power counting. We show that the $S$-$D$ mixing scheme is consistent with the experimental data of the decays of $\Upsilon(10860)$ into $\omega\chi_{bJ}$ ($J=0,1,2$) and $\Upsilon(10753)$ into $\omega\chi_{bJ}$ ($J=1,2$). Predictions for the dielectron widths and partial decay widths into $\chi_{bJ}\omega$ for $\Upsilon(10753)$ and $\Upsilon(10950)$ are presented.</description>

      <title>Structure of leptonic Yukawa couplings in the Zee model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The radiative neutrino mass matrix $m^\nu$ in the Zee model depends on leptonic Yukawa couplings $F$ to a singlet scalar and $Y^\ell$ to a new Higgs doublet. Leveraging the skew-symmetric structure of $F$, we derive a unique identity linking $F$ and $m^\nu$ that is explicitly independent of $Y^\ell$. This relation implies that five entries of $Y^\ell$ can, in principle, be determined directly from $m^\nu$ and $F$, while the remaining four can be selected based on phenomenological assumptions. As an illustration, we apply this framework to the two-zero texture $B2$, highlighting its enhancement of the muon $g-2$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.18794v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: How are high-momentum transfer processes modified when embedded in the Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP) instead of the vacuum? How can fundamental properties of the QGP be inferred from their medium-modifications? And what can be learnt about QCD? These questions have motivated theoretical and experimental studies for more than four decades almost since the beginning of QGP research. Here we review with a historical perspective the main theoretical developments and the resulting interplay of theory and experiment at RHIC and at the LHC.</description>

      <title>$\lambda$ and $\rho$ Regge trajectories for bottom-charm tetraquarks $(bq)(\bar{c}\bar{q}')$ and $(cq)(\bar{b}\bar{q}')$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18899v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using the newly proposed tetraquark Regge trajectory relations, we investigate three series of Regge trajectories for bottom-charm tetraquarks $(bq)(\bar{c}\bar{q}')$ and $(cq)(\bar{b}\bar{q}')$ with $q,q'=u,d,s$: the $\rho_1$-, $\rho_2$-, and $\lambda$-trajectories. We provide rough estimates for the masses of the $\rho_1$-, $\rho_2$-, and $\lambda$-excited states. Except for the $\lambda$-trajectories, the complete forms of the other two series of Regge trajectories for bottom-charm tetraquarks are lengthy and cumbersome. We show that the $\rho_1$- and $\rho_2$-trajectories cannot be obtained by simply imitating meson Regge trajectories, because mesons have no substructures. To derive these trajectories, the tetraquarks' structure and substructure must be taken into consideration. Otherwise, the $\rho_1$- and $\rho_2$-trajectories would have to rely solely on fitting existing theoretical results or future experimental data. Consequently, the fundamental relationship between the slopes of the obtained trajectories and string tension would become unobvious, and the predictive power of the Regge trajectories would be compromised. Moreover, we show that the lengthy complete forms of the $\rho_1$- and $\rho_2$-trajectories can be well approximated by simple fitted formulas. For the bottom-charm tetraquarks $(bq)(\bar{c}\bar{q}')$ and $(cq)(\bar{b}\bar{q}')$, $\rho_1$- and $\rho_2$-trajectories exhibit a behavior of $M{\sim}x^{1/2}$ $(x=n_{r_1},n_{r_2},l_1,l_2)$, whereas $\lambda$-trajectories exhibit a behavior of $M{\sim}x^{2/3}$ $(x=N_{r},L)$. All three series of trajectories display concave downward behavior in the $(M^2,\,x)$ plane when the confining potential is linear. This conclusion holds irrespective of whether light-quark masses are included, owing to the large masses of the heavy quarks.</description>

      <title>$T_{bc\bar s}$ states in the process $\Upsilon \to D^{-} \bar B^{0} D_s^{+}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19007v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform a theoretical study of the decay process $\Upsilon \to D^{-} \bar{B}^{0} D_s^{+}$ in search of the doubly heavy tetraquark states $T_{bc\bar{s}}$ with quark content $bc\bar{s}\bar{d}$. These $T_{bc\bar{s}}$ states are assumed to be dynamically generated molecular states from the S-wave interactions between $\bar{B}_s^{(*)0} D^{(*)+}$ and $\bar{B}^{(*)0} D_s^{(*)+}$ meson pairs. Based on the total angular momentum and the type of the constituent mesons (pseudoscalars $P$ or vectors $V$), they are labeled as $T_{bc\bar{s}}^{0, PP}$, $T_{bc\bar{s}}^{0, VV}$, and $T_{bc\bar{s}}^{2, VV}$, respectively. The $\bar{B}^{0} D_s^{+}$ invariant mass distribution for this decay is calculated using current algebra, incorporating contributions from $T_{bc\bar{s}}$ states arising from final-state interactions. Our results reveal a clear peak structure in the $7415 - 7425$ MeV region, which is attributed to the $T_{bc\bar{s}}^{2, VV}$ state. Additionally, a distinct dip structure appears near the $\bar{B}^{*0} D_s^{*+}$ threshold, characteristic of the $T_{bc\bar{s}}^{2, VV}$ as a hadronic molecular state. A near-threshold enhancement associated with the $T_{bc\bar{s}}^{0, PP}$ state and a dip arising from the $T_{bc\bar{s}}^{0,\,VV}$ state are also identified, though the manifestation of these features depends sensitively on model parameter fine-tuning. Therefore, with increased experimental statistics, the decay channel $\Upsilon \to D^{-} \bar{B}^{0} D_s^{+}$ offers a promising avenue for discovering and characterizing the $T_{bc\bar{s}}$ states.</description>

      <title>A simple algorithm for polarized parton evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19018v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an algorithm to include the correlation between the production and decay planes of gluons in a parton-shower simulation. The technique is based on identifying the charge currents responsible for the creation and annihilation of the vector field. It is applicable in both the hard-collinear and the soft wide-angle region. As a function of the number of particles, the algorithm scales linear in computing time and memory. We demonstrate agreement with fixed-order perturbative calculations in the relevant kinematical limits, and present a new observable that can be used to probe correlations beyond current-current interactions.</description>

      <title>Triple top baryon $\Omega_{ttt}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19137v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, the toponium, a bound state of a top-antitop quark pair, was discovered by the CMS and ATLAS collaborations. This observation has sparked renewed interest in the study of heavy-quark bound states, particularly the hypothetical triple top baryon ($\Omega_{ttt}$). We present a theoretical discussion on the mass, production, and decay of this exotic particle within the Standard Model. Using a variational method with an effective potential, we estimate the mass and binding energy of the $\Omega_{ttt}$. We further analyze its production cross-section at future high-energy colliders and its dominant weak decay channels. The possibility of experimental observation is also considered, and we conclude that its observation will be extremely challenging in the near future due to an anticipated tiny production cross-section and complex final states. However, we propose that the search for this particle would represent a new frontier in probing the strong force at unprecedented mass scales.</description>

      <title>Hits to Higgs: Reconstruction-Free Higgs Classification from Raw LHC Detector Data Using Higgsformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comparative study of Higgs event classification at the Large Hadron Collider that bypasses the traditional reconstruction chain. As a benchmark, we focus on distinguishing \( t\bar{t}H \) from \( t\bar{t} \) events with \( H \to b\bar{b} \), a particularly challenging task due to their similar final-state topologies. Our pipeline begins with event generation in \texttt{Pythia8}, fast simulation with ACTS/Fatras, and classification directly from raw detector hits.
  We show for the first time that a transformer model originally developed for inner tracker hit-to-track assignment can be retrained to classify Higgs events directly from raw hits. For comparison, we reconstruct the same events with \texttt{Delphes} and train object-based classifiers, including multilayer perceptrons and the Particle Transformer. We evaluate both approaches under varying dataset sizes and pileup levels. Despite operating solely on inner tracker hits, Higgsformer achieves strong performance, reaching an AUC of 0.792.</description>

      <title>Single pion-production and pion propagation in Achilles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19213v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend the applicability of Achilles (A CHIcagoLand Lepton Event Simulator) by incorporating the single-pion production mechanism in a fully exclusive fashion. The electroweak interaction vertex is modeled by combining the state-of-the-art Dynamical Coupled-Channels approach with realistic hole spectral functions, which account for correlations in both the initial target state and the residual spectator system. Final-state interactions are treated using a semi-classical intranuclear cascade that leverages nuclear configurations to determine the correlated spatial distribution of protons and neutrons. The meson-baryon scattering amplitudes used in the cascade are computed within the Dynamical Coupled-Channels framework, consistent with the electroweak vertex. To model pion absorption, we employ the optical potential approach of Oset and Salcedo. As an alternative approach, we explicitly model the production and propagation of resonances which mediate pion-nucleon scattering and pion absorption. We validate out approach against pion-nucleon and pion-nucleus scattering data, and present comparisons with electron- and neutrino-nucleus measurements from e4$\nu$, T2K, MINER$\nu$A, and MicroBooNE.</description>

      <title>Classification of color superconductivity by one-gluon exchange helicity amplitudes and renormalization group equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quark matter at high baryon density exhibits diverse pairing patterns classified by color, flavor, and angular momentum quantum numbers. We compute one-gluon exchange (OGE) helicity amplitudes and introduce a nonrelativistic classification of the pairing channel, justified by the channel decomposition in a Lorentz-noninvariant medium and the decoupling of renormalization group flows at leading order. We find the new attractive channel in OGE; the medium effects can render the vacuum-repulsive color $\boldsymbol{6}$ channel attractive in the spin-triplet sector. For color $\boldsymbol{\bar{3}}$ with antisymmetric flavor, the dominant pairing is ${}^1S_0$, while for symmetric flavor the same-helicity $^1P_1$ prevails over $^3S_1$, revising the conventional single-flavor picture. With a mismatch of the Fermi momenta, $^1S_0$ channel, leading to color-flavor locked or two-flavor color superconductor, remains most stable when the separation is small, and the color-spin locked pairing becomes favored as the mismatch gets large. We suggest there are possible quark-hadron continuity in certain cases as expected in the literature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.19226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The precise description of jet processes requires observables capable of efficiently capturing the dynamics of the energy flow in hadronic final states. We consider a class of tranverse-momentum like resolution variables that smoothly describe the $n+1$ to $n$ jet transition in multi-jet processes. We discuss a general method for the computation of the corresponding quark jet function at next-to-next-to-leading order in perturbative QCD. Rapidity divergences are regulated by using a time-like auxiliary vector. We present explicit results for a variant of $y_{23}$ in the $E$-scheme and in the WTA scheme.</description>

      <title>Generalized Parton Distributions from Lattice QCD with Asymmetric Momentum Transfer: Unpolarized Quarks at Nonzero Skewness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17998v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend the formalism of asymmetric frames of reference for generalized parton distributions (GPDs) to the case of nonzero skewness, i.e., including longitudinal momentum transfer. The framework, based on Lorentz-invariant amplitudes and previously developed and numerically implemented for unpolarized, helicity and transversity GPDs at zero skewness, gives efficient access to a broad range of kinematics, making full mapping of GPDs from the lattice realistic. The general-skewness formalism is tested using lattice data with both transverse and longitudinal or only longitudinal momentum transfer, the latter being a special case with a reduced number of independent amplitudes. We extract the amplitudes in coordinate space and express the GPDs $H$ and $E$ in terms of these amplitudes. This is followed by reconstruction of quasi-distributions and their matching to the light cone. We further identify and discuss the principal challenges for nonzero skewness GPDs.</description>

Abstract: We calculate the $B^-$-, $\overline{B^0}$-, $D^+$-, $D^0$-, $K^-$-, and $\overline{K^0}$-$^{12}$C bound state energies by solving the Klein-Gordon (K;G.) equation in momentum space, and also obtain the corresponding coordinate space radial wave functions. The strong Lorentz scalar and vector potentials in $^{12}$C are calculated using a local density approximation, where the scalar potentials are obtained based on the mass shifts of the respective mesons in nuclear matter. The mesons' mass shifts, the $^{12}$C nuclear density distributions, the strong potentials as well as the Coulomb potentials, are calculated by the quark-meson coupling (QMC) model.</description>

      <title>Imprints of screened dark energy on non-local quantum correlations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.18448v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate how screening mechanisms, reconciling light scalar fields driving cosmic acceleration with local fifth force constraints, can be probed via their impact on non-local quantum correlations between entangled spin pairs, whose evolution on a curved background is affected by General Relativity (GR) and screened modified gravity effects. We consider a gedankenexperiment featuring a pair of massive, spin-1/2 particles orbiting the Earth, evaluating their non-local correlations through spin observables associated to the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) inequality. Using a general formalism developed earlier for curved space-time spin evolution, we compute the effects of screening on the CHSH inequality, finding its degree of violation to be suppressed relative to the flat space-time case. Applying this formalism to the chameleon, symmetron, and dilaton mechanisms, we identify currently unconstrained regions of parameter space where the screening contribution is comparable to that of GR. While detecting these effects will be challenging, our work provides a proof-of-principle for testing screened dark energy through quantum non-locality.</description>

      <title>Axions, Three-Forms, and M-Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.18451v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scalar fields with masses protected by global shift symmetries, commonly referred to as axions, are abundantly used in effective field theories in cosmology and particle physics. However, global symmetries cannot be expected to be protected at the fundamental level. Finding consistent ultra-violet completions for axions is therefore a necessity. In this work, we identify the axion with the position mode of a charged 3-brane in (4+1)-dimensions. The shift symmetry of the axion is then a residual diffeomorphism in the fifth dimension orthogonal to the brane. Meanwhile, the brane is coupled to a flux in the fifth dimension. From the (3+1)-dimensional perspective, this construction generates a mass for the axion and matches previously known proposals in the literature based on the coupling between the axion and a three-form gauge field. In a second step, we uplift this (4+1)-dimensional model to M-theory, where the same three-form is found to couple to the membrane with a (2+1)-dimensional worldvolume. In particular, our proposal also elucidates the duality between the axion and a two-form gauge field in the literature. We show that this dual two-form couples to the boundary of an open membrane in M-theory. Finally, we comment on the relations to and differences from other closed and open string axion monodromy models.</description>

      <title>Varying fundamental constants cosmography</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.18458v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cosmography is a model-independent phenomenological approach to observational cosmology, relying on Taylor series expansions of physical quantities as a function of the cosmological redshift or other analogous variables. A recent work developed the formalism for a cosmographic analysis of astrophysical and local measurements of the fine-structure constant, $\alpha$, and provided first constraints on the corresponding parameters. Here we update the earlier work, both by including more recent measurements of $\alpha$, and by extending it to other fundamental dimensionless couplings. We find no statistically significant evidence for such variations, and place stringent constraints on the first two terms of all these cosmographic series: the linear coefficient in the $\alpha$ series is constrained to parts per billion level, thanks to recently improved atomic clock constraints, while the other coefficients are constrained to parts per million level. Additionally, we use the same data to place cosmographic constraints on models from a broad class of Grand Unified Theories in which varying fundamental constants occur, and highlight how future data can provide a discriminating cosmographic test between freezing and thawing dark energy models.</description>

      <title>Impacts of axion cooling on the direct detection of supernova axions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18491v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Core-collapse supernovae provide a unique opportunity to probe axions because they can be a copious source of the particles. It has recently been proposed that axion helioscopes can be used for the direct search for supernova axions if a supernova event appears within a few hundred parsecs. However, the event number of supernova axions has been estimated only within the post-process framework. In this study, we perform long-term supernova simulations for a 9.6M_sun star coupled with the axion emission to reevaluate the event number of axions detected by the helioscopes. We find that the additional cooling induced by the axion emission can significantly decrease the temperature in the proto-neutron star. As a result, the axion luminosity and hence the axion event number are reduced, compared with the result obtained through post-processing. Our result indicates that the nonlinear feedback of the axion emission is an essential factor to predict the axion detectability, and underscores the need for systematic simulation studies across various progenitor models.</description>

      <title>Contribution of Subthreshold States to the Residual Energy Distribution of $^{159}$Dy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.18562v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the residual energy distribution in the electron capture (EC) process of $^{159}$Dy, emphasizing the role of subthreshold atomic states, which have typically been omitted in conventional spectral analyses. By incorporating these energetically forbidden hole states into the spectral function $P(E)$, we demonstrate a significant enhancement - over an order of magnitude - in the EC rate near the zero-momentum neutrino emission region. This enhancement increases further with larger $Q$ values, contrary to standard expectations. Our analysis shows that $P(E)$ can be experimentally determined, resolving ambiguities near the endpoint and enabling new approaches to 'ultra-low $Q$ value' EC reactions for neutrino mass studies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.18821v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The far-from-equilibrium dynamics driven by the scattering from next-to-leading-order (NLO) corrections in the quantum field theory has stationary solutions for the particle distribution characterized as the Kolmogorov-type non-thermal fixed points. The dynamics of the spatially homogeneous, isotropic dilute ultra-cold Fermi gas is investigated, and its kinetic equation confirms the Kolmogorov-type non-thermal fixed points in the perturbation theory by the quasi-particle assumption, in contrast to the wave turbulence of the weakly coupled ultra-cold Bose gas. In addition, other stationary states are found without the quasi-particle assumption and in a strongly coupled system. These analytical solutions provide chances for future experiments and numerical simulations in search of far-from-equilibrium stationary states of the dilute system.</description>

      <title>Baselines for Abelian Charge Fluctuations in Nuclear Collisions:Theory and Comparison with Experimental Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18879v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate fluctuations in the canonical ensemble of an Abelian charge, such as baryon number. Our focus is on cumulants and factorial cumulants of baryon and antibaryon multiplicity distributions, including their sum and difference, in both the full phase space and subsystems. In particular, we establish a correlation between net-baryon number fluctuations within a subsystem, which is pertinent for fluctuation analyses in nucleus-nucleus collisions, and fluctuations of baryon and antibaryon numbers in the total system. We derive analytical expressions for factorial cumulants of arbitrary order and present concise results in terms of the cumulants of the total baryon number. To account for dynamics beyond global conservation, we introduce local attractive and repulsive multi-particle interactions within a phenomenological framework. A comparison of calculated and generated cumulants with STAR and HADES data indicates that multiparticle interactions play a decisive role in the description of observed fluctuation patterns. At high collision energies, the data are well-reproduced by incorporating repulsive two-proton interactions, while at lower energies, attractive three-particle interactions become essential. Furthermore, our framework facilitates realistic event generation, enabling a direct comparison with experimental measurements.</description>

      <title>SN2023syz and SN2025cbj: Two Type IIn Supernovae Associated with IceCube High-energy Neutrinos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19080v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Type IIn supernovae (SNe IIn) are a subclass of core-collapse SNe in which strong interactions occur between the ejecta and dense circumstellar material, creating ideal conditions for the production of high-energy neutrinos. This makes them promising candidate sources of neutrinos. In this work, we conduct an association study between 163 SNe IIn observed by the Zwicky Transient Facility and 138 neutrino alert events detected by the IceCube neutrino observatory. After excluding alerts with poor localization, we find two SNe that are spatiotemporally coincident with neutrino events. IC231027A and IC250421A coincide with the positions of SN2023syz and SN2025cbj, respectively, within their localization uncertainties, and the neutrino arrival times are delayed by 38 days and 61 days relative to the discovery times of the corresponding SNe. Using Monte Carlo simulations, we estimate that the probability of such two coincidences occurring by chance in our sample is $p \sim 0.67\%$, suggesting a high likelihood that they arise from genuine associations, though the result is not yet statistical significant. Furthermore, model calculations show that the expected numbers of neutrino events from these SNe IIn could be consistent with the actual observations.

      <title>Quintessential dark energy crossing the phantom divide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19101v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by recent results from the DESI collaboration, we explore two classes of quintessence models that can give rise to crossing of the dark energy equation of state through the ``phantom divide'' $w=-1$. These are models with Lagrangians that involve higher powers of the kinetic energy $\dot\phi^2$, or where the dark matter (DM) mass is a function of $\phi$. Both have similar features with respect to the reconstructed redshift-dependent $w(z)$: moderate tuning of parameters is required to achieve the desired shape, and it is difficult or impossible for $w(z)$ to continue evolving smoothly as $z$ becomes large. Nevertheless, they give a strong improvement over $\Lambda$CDM in fitting the data. We point out that models of coupled dark matter and dark energy that cross the phantom divide are under pressure from constraints on long-range DM forces. They rule out the simplest renormalizable coupling of scalar DM to quintessence, but leave the fermionic case marginally allowed, while exponentially coupled models are safe from current constraints.</description>

      <title>The Magnetic Origin of Primordial Black Holes: A Viable Dark Matter Scenario</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19217v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Primordial Black Holes (PBHs) are compelling candidates for explaining the present-day relic abundance of cold dark matter (CDM), yet their formation typically requires finely tuned early-universe dynamics. In this work, we propose a novel PBH formation mechanism within a well-established magnetogenesis framework. This scenario simultaneously accounts for the large-scale magnetic fields observed today and generates an enhanced curvature power spectrum at intermediate scales, leading to PBH formation with masses that can survive until the present epoch. We identify a narrow reheating temperature range, $10^5\,\mathrm{GeV} \leq T_{re} \leq 3\times 10^5\,\mathrm{GeV}$, within which the resulting PBHs can constitute the entirety of the observed CDM abundance. Furthermore, our model predicts a stochastic gravitational wave (GW) background as a byproduct of the PBH formation process. Remarkably, the predicted GW signal lies within the sensitivity reach of upcoming space-based interferometers, such as the LISA, DECIGO, or SKA mission, offering a direct observational probe of this PBH generation mechanism.</description>

      <title>Quantifying fluctuation signatures of the QCD critical point using maximum entropy freeze-out</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19237v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A key question about the QCD phase diagram is whether there is a critical point somewhere on the boundary between the hadronic and quark-gluon plasma phases, and if so where. Heavy-ion collisions offer a unique opportunity to search for signatures of such a critical point by analyzing event-by-event fluctuations in particle multiplicities. To draw meaningful conclusions from experimental data, a theoretical framework is needed to link QCD thermodynamics with the particle spectra and correlations observed in detectors. The Equation of State (EoS) of QCD near a critical point can be related to the universal Gibbs free energy of the 3D Ising model using four currently unknown non-universal mapping parameters whose values are determined by the microscopic details of QCD. We utilize the maximum entropy approach to freeze-out the fluctuations in order to make estimates for factorial cumulants of proton multiplicities, assuming thermal equilibrium, for a family of EoS with a 3D Ising-like critical point, varying the microscopic inputs that determine the strength and structure of the critical features. We quantify the effect of the non-universal mapping parameters, and the distance between the critical point and the freeze-out curve, on the factorial cumulants of proton multiplicities.</description>

      <title>Phase Transition to RS: Cool, not Supercool</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.09633v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by the warped conifold compactification, we model the infrared (IR) dynamics of confining gauge theories in a Randall-Sundrum (RS)-like setup by modifying the stabilizing Goldberger-Wise (GW) potential so that it becomes large (in magnitude) in the IR and back-reacts on the geometry. We study the high-temperature phase by considering a black brane background in which we calculate the entropy and free energy of the strongly back-reacted solution. As with Buchel's result for the conifold (arXiv:2103.15188), we find a minimum temperature beyond which the black brane phase is thermodynamically unstable. In the context of a phase transition to the confining background, our results suggest that the amount of supercooling that the metastable black brane phase undergoes can be limited. It also suggests the first-order phase transition (and the associated gravitational waves from bubble collision) is not universal. Our results therefore have important phenomenological implications for early universe model building in these scenarios.</description>

      <title>Leptogenesis from magnetic helicity of gauged $\text{U}(1)_{B-L}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04701v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: If the $B-L$ symmetry is gauged with the addition of right-handed neutrinos, the standard model $B-L$ current is anomalous with respect to the $B-L$ gauge field itself. Then, the anomaly relation implies that the magnetic helicity of the $B-L$ gauge field is related to the standard model $B-L$ charges, although the whole universe is $B-L$ neutral with right-handed neutrinos. Based on this, we propose a new leptogenesis scenario with the gauged $B-L$ symmetry as follows. First, the magnetic helicity of the $B-L$ gauge field is generated, e.g., by the axion inflation, together with the standard model and right-handed neutrino $B-L$ charges, with the net $B-L$ charge kept zero. The $B-L$ charges in the standard model and right-handed neutrino sectors are then subject to washout effects from the interactions between them. After the washout effects decouple, the $B-L$ gauge symmetry is Higgsed and the magnetic helicity of the $B-L$ gauge field decays and generates $B-L$ charges in the both sector; thanks to the washout effects, we obtain a non-zero $B-L$ asymmetry. We show that the baryon asymmetry of the universe can be generated in this scenario, discussing the decay of the magnetic helicity of the $B-L$ gauge field and the interactions between the right-handed neutrinos and the standard model particles.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Moments of Hidden-Charm Pentaquarks in the Diquark-Diquark-Antiquark Scheme</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16486v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The magnetic moment of a hadron is an important spectroscopic parameter that encodes valuable information about its internal structure. In this work, we systematically investigate the magnetic moments of hidden-charm pentaquark states, including the experimentally observed $P_c(4457)$ and related configurations with and without strangeness. The analysis is performed within the diquark-diquark-antiquark framework for spin-parity quantum numbers $J^P = \frac{1}{2}^-$, $\frac{3}{2}^-$, and $\frac{5}{2}^-$. Magnetic moment values are computed for different spin and flavor configurations, and the results are compared with existing predictions in the literature. These predictions may offer insight into the inner structure and quantum numbers of these exotic states, and potentially help distinguish between different theoretical models.</description>

      <title>On the CP Nature of the `95 GeV' Anomalies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00474v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Under the assumption that the various evidences of a `95 GeV' excess, seen in data at the Large Electron Positron (LEP) collider as well as the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), correspond to actual signals of new physics Beyond the Standard Model (BSM), we characterise the underlying particle explaining these anomalies in terms of its Charge/Parity (CP) quantum numbers. In doing so, we use $\chi^2$ fits to test the CP-even (scalar) and CP-odd (pseudoscalar) hypotheses and superpositions of these, thus under the assumption of a spin-0 resonance. This is done through the exploitation of $\tau^+\tau^-$ decays, in both their fully hadronic and semi-leptonic modes, in a model-independent way, so that our approach enables one to test a variety of BSM hypotheses, having proven here that the High-Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC) will be in a position to disentangle the CP nature of such a new particle within $\pm(0.27-0.47)$ radians of the true hypothesis at $90\%$ Confidence Level (CL), depending on the assumed background systematics.</description>

Abstract: The aim of this chapter is to explain in clear and pedagogical terms how some particle-physics models and/or mechanisms can naturally lead to inflation and how this can provide testable predictions that can help us find new physics effects. Two well-established features of theoretical particle physics are linked to an essential property of inflation, a naturally-flat inflaton potential: (1) scale invariance, broken by small quantum corrections, and (2) Goldstone's theorem. It is also illustrated how to combine several scenarios of this type to obtain a rather general particle-physics motivated inflationary setup.</description>

      <title>Probing Dark Matter-Electron Interactions in the Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04539v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we consider Dark Matter (DM) interactions and study the same in the light of the Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation (CMBR) data. In particular, we focus on the DM-electron interactions. Assuming that such interactions are mediated by rather heavy mediators, we consider effective operators describing the relevant interaction terms in the lagrangian. The presence of such interaction terms leads to both DM annihilation and DM-electron scattering (drag). We focus on operators which lead to velocity-independent DM annihilation and DM-electron scattering cross-sections. Using the CMBR data, we study the implications of both of these effects, imposing constraints on the respective effective operators. This analysis underscores the importance of taking both scattering and annihilation processes into consideration in the study of DM interactions. We observe that the constraints on the DM annihilation and scattering cross-sections can change, up to about 13\% and 12\%, respectively, for the benchmark scenarios we considered, depending on the mass of DM, as compared to the scenario where only DM annihilation is accounted for.</description>

      <title>Production of $K^+K^-$ Pairs Through Decay of $\phi$ Meson</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.23919v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a theoretical framework for the production of $K^+K^-$ pairs through the decay of $\phi$ mesons produced from a thermal background, based on the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model. The differential production rate of $K^+K^-$ is related to the self-energy of the $\phi$ meson, incorporating the contributions of the quark loop at leading order and the kaon loop at next-to-leading order in the $1/N_c$ expansion. We numerically evaluate the invariant mass spectrum of the $K^+K^-$ pair both in vacuum and at finite temperature. The inclusion of the kaon loop results in a finite width of the spectrum, improving agreement with experimental data. We also investigate the spin alignment of the $\phi$ meson induced by its motion relative to the thermal background. In the NJL model with only chiral condensates, we find that deviations from the unpolarized limit of 1/3 are negligible.</description>

Abstract: The Dark Energy Survey (DES) and the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) measurements claim that the dark energy equation of state $w \ne -1$. This observation can be explained by the axion Dark Energy (aDE) model of an ultralight axion plus a cosmological constant $\Lambda$. Despite a relatively large degeneracy, there is a high probability that $\Lambda &lt;0$. This negative $\Lambda$ leads the universe to end in a big crunch. Using the best-fit values of the model as a benchmark, we find the lifespan of our universe to be 33 billion years.</description>

Abstract: We explore a novel strategy for detecting the radiative decay of very weakly interacting particles by leveraging the extreme sensitivity of quantum devices, such as superconducting transmon qubits and trapped ion systems, to faint electromagnetic signals. By modeling the effective electric field induced by the decay photons, we evaluate the response of quantum sensors across two particle physics scenarios: the cosmic neutrino background and two-component dark matter. We assess the discovery potential of these devices and outline the parameter space accessible under current experimental capabilities. Our analysis demonstrates that quantum sensors can probe radiative decays of dark matter candidates using existing technology, while probing neutrino magnetic moments beyond current limits will require scalable quantum architectures with enhanced coherence.</description>

Abstract: Four-dimensional chiral gauge theory can be formulated as the boundary theory on a five-dimensional manifold in a manner that may be realized on a finite lattice. There are interesting features of these theories which defy a purely four-dimensional conception of universality. We find that QCD when embedded in a chiral gauge theory (the Standard Model) and regulated this way appears to suffer neither from a $U(1)_A$ problem nor a strong $CP$ problem, with a central role played by fermion zeromodes localized far away in the fifth dimension. In this way it differs from conventional lattice QCD formulated as a stand-alone theory. Our analysis builds on recent work by others that highlights the role of global $U(1)$ symmetries in five dimensional formulations of four-dimensional chiral gauge theories, and the generic appearance of fermion zeromodes in the bulk.</description>

      <title>Non-parametric and continuous extraction of amplitudes in electroweak penguin decays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.22549v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel approach to extract the decay-amplitudes in $B\to V(\to M_1M_2)\ell^+\ell^-$ processes, where $V$ represents a meson with either $J = 0$ (S-wave) or $J = 1$ (P-wave). This approach enables the decay-amplitudes across the dihadron and dilepton invariant-masses to be extracted from data in a model-independent and continuous way. To achieve this, the angular decay rate is expressed in a way that allows the application of the \sPlot technique to likelihood fits of the decay angles. We illustrate the abilities of this method on simulated $B^0\to K^+\pi^-\ell^+\ell^-$ data, containing both S- and P-wave contributions to the $K^+\pi^-$ system. We provide the weight functions and show that they allow the extraction of the absolute value of the P-wave and S-wave transversity amplitudes as a function of the dihadron and dimuon invariant-masses in a continuous, unbiased, and statistically-powerful way, while only relying on the angular distribution. As a consequence, the extracted amplitude shapes are model-independent -- up to the angular terms included in the fit -- and can be directly compared to theoretical predictions. A measurement using this technique can improve the sensitivity to potential new physics effects in $b\to s\ell^+\ell^-$ transitions, as well as the understanding of hadronic form factors, particularly in the S-wave system.</description>

      <title>Kination-like Era Driven by the Effective Inflaton/Higgs Potential</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.08786v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Based on the minimal $U(1)_X$ extended Standard Model, we explore cosmic inflation where the $U(1)_X$ Higgs field serves as the inflaton. We demonstrate that a stiff era with an equation of state $w &gt; 1/3$ can emerge during the inflaton's oscillatory phase after inflation, driven by the Coleman-Weinberg potential of the inflaton, arising due to radiative corrections. This leads to significant modulation and enhancement of the irreducible stochastic gravitational wave (GW) background from inflation, deviating from the conventional scale-invariant spectrum. Such a distinct GW spectrum could be detectable by next-generation GW interferometer missions, such as U-DECIGO. In our framework, the GW spectrum depends on the $U(1)_X$ gauge coupling and the mass of the $U(1)_X$ gauge boson ($Z^\prime$). As a result, future GW observations and $Z^\prime$ boson resonance searches at high-energy collider experiments are complementary to one another.</description>

      <title>Neutron Stars in Causal Scalar-Tensor Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23712v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study static, spherically symmetric neutron stars in a class of scalar-tensor theories with non-canonical kinetic terms (K-essence) obeying all causality and hyperbolicity conditions. These models have non-trivial dynamics that lead to a type of anti-screening of the scalar. They lead to small corrections in the solar system due to a small coupling, but can lead to large corrections in regimes of high densities, especially neutron stars. We solve the modified Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equations numerically using realistic equations of state (SLy4, WFF1, MS1, MPA1). For a given central density, we find that two distinct configurations may exist, forming two separate branches of solutions. We find that above a certain critical central density solutions with the correct asymptotic behavior at spatial infinity cannot be obtained. We obtain precise predictions for the mass-radius relation for neutron stars for different values of the parameters in the model and we compare to data.</description>

      <title>Predictability of quantum observables: Applications in QKD and top quarks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24502v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We deepen our understanding of transmitting classical information using quantum means by analyzing the prediction of local quantum observables enhanced by quantum correlations. Our approach focuses on two complementary measures of prediction error, the Bayes risk and the inference variance, both rooted in statistical learning theory. We provide, to our knowledge, the first analytical minimizations of these quantities for arbitrary two-qubit states, together with the optimal measurement strategies. We further analyze their averaged forms, revealing a direct connection to Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen steering criteria. We also embed our Bayes risk minimization into an entanglement-based quantum key distribution protocol, demonstrating higher secure-key rates than the standard BB84 scheme under realistic noise. Finally, we illustrate our results for (i) amplitude-damped Bell pairs, and (ii) spin correlations in top-antitop quark pairs produced in high-energy collisions, highlighting quantum states produced in colliders as a novel platform for quantum information tasks.</description>

      <title>A Semi-Analytic model for Effects of Fuzzy Dark Matter Granule Perturbations on Orbital Motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07963v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In fuzzy dark matter scenarios, the quantum wave nature of ultralight axion-like particles generates stochastic density fluctuations inside dark matter halos. These fluctuations, known as granules, perturb the orbits of subhalos and other orbiting bodies. While previous studies have simulated these effects using N-body techniques or modeled them statistically using diffusion approximations, we propose an alternative framework based on representing the perturbations as a Fourier series with random coefficients, which can be applied to individual orbits, not just populations. We extend the model to finite-size subhalos, identifying a critical length scale below which subhalos behave as point-mass particles. In contrast, larger subhalos exhibit suppressed perturbations from granules due to their extended mass profiles. Using FDM-Simulator, we validate our finite-size model by isolating granule accelerations and confirming their statistical effects on subhalo dynamics.</description>

      <title>A bi-effect model of muon deflections in air showers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17475v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent progress has shown that the geomagnetic field exerts a more significant impact than expected on the behavior of charged secondary particles in inclined air showers. In this study, we for the first time combine it with atmospheric effects to construct a bi-effect model, aiming to investigate the lateral distribution of particles on the ground plane. Despite the complex physical interactions during the development of air showers, a simple formula can describe the overall deflection of $\mu^{\pm}$ and accurately fit the deflection in simulated air showers, thereby validating the hypotheses about these effects in this study. Furthermore, we have obtained the relationship between model parameters and primary particle information for different experimental sites. This new model is highly successful and is promising to provide new insights for improving detector layout design and air shower reconstruction.</description>
