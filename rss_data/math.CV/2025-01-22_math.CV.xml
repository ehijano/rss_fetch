      <title>Polarizations and Convergences of holomorphic sections on the tangent bundle of a Bohr-Sommerfeld Lagrangian submanifold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11254v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $(M, \omega)$ be a K\"ahler manifold and let $(L, \nabla)$ be a prequantum line bundle over $M$. Let $X \subset M$ be a Bohr-Sommerfeld Lagrangian submanifold of $(L, \nabla)$. In this paper, we study an asymptotic behaviour of holomorphic sections of $L^k$ as $k \to \infty$. Our first result shows that the $L^2$-norm of sections of $L^k$ are bounded below around $X$ if these sections converge on $X$ under a suitable trivialization of $L^k$. Since $X$ is a Lagrangian submanifold, we consider that a neighborhood of $X$ is embedded in the tangent bundle $TX$. Let $\Psi_{k}: TX \to TX$ be a multiplication by $\frac{1}{\sqrt{k}}$ in the fibers. The pullback of the K\"ahler polarization by $\Psi_k$ converges to the real polarization, whose leaves are fibers of $TX$, as $k \to \infty$. Let $(f_k)_{k \in \mathbb{N}}$ be holomorphic sections of $L^k$ near $X$. By trivializing $L^k$, we consider $f_k$ as a function. In our second result, we show that $\Psi^* f_k$ converges to a fiberwise constant function on $TX$ as $k \to \infty$ under some condition on Sobolev norms of $f_k$.</description>

      <title>On the Converse of Pr\'{e}kopa's Theorem and Berndtsson's Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11456v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a continuous function $\phi$ defined on a domain $\Omega\subset\mathbb{R}^m\times\mathbb{R}^n$, we show that if a Pr\'ekopa-type result holds for $\phi+\psi$ for any non-negative convex function $\psi$ on $\Omega$, then $\phi$ must be a convex function. Additionally, if the projection of $\Omega$ onto $\mathbb{R}^m$ is convex, then $\overline{\Omega}$ is also convex. This provides a converse of Pr\'ekopa's theorem from convex analysis. We also establish analogous results for Berndtsson's theorem on the plurisubharmonic variation of Bergman kernels, showing that the plurisubharmonicity of weight functions and the pseudoconvexity of domains are necessary conditions in some sense.</description>

      <title>Polynomial meshes on algebraic sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10873v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Polynomial meshes (called sometimes "norming sets") allow us to estimate the supremum norm of polynomials on a fixed compact set by the norm on its discrete subset. We give a general construction of polynomial weakly admissible meshes on compact subsets of arbitrary algebraic hypersurfaces in C^{N+1}. They are preimages by a projection of meshes on compacts in C^N. The meshes constructed in this way are optimal in some cases. Our method can be useful also for certain algebraic sets of codimension greater than one. To illustrate applications of the obtained theorems, we first give a few examples and finally report some numerical results. In particular, we present numerical tests (implemented in Matlab), concerning the use of such optimal polynomial meshes for interpolation and least-squares approximation, as well as for the evaluation of the corresponding Lebesgue constants.</description>

      <title>Boundary representations from constrained interpolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11027v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study $C^*$-envelopes of finite-dimensional operator algebras arising from constrained interpolation problems on the unit disc. In particular, we consider interpolation problems for the algebra $H^\infty_{\text{node}}$ that consists of bounded analytic functions on the unit disk that satisfy $ f(0) = f(\lambda)$ for some $0 \neq \lambda \in \mathbb{D}$. We show that there exist choices of four interpolation nodes that exclude both $0$ and $\lambda$, such that if $I$ is the ideal of functions that vanish at the interpolation nodes, then $C^*_e(H^\infty_{\text{node}}/I)$ is infinite-dimensional. This differs markedly from the behavior of the algebra corresponding to interpolation nodes that contain the constrained points studied in the literature. Additionally, we use the distance formula to provide a completely isometric embedding of $C^*_e(H^\infty_{\text{node}}/I)$ for any choice of $n$ interpolation nodes that do not contain the constrained points into $M_n(G^2_{nc})$, where $G^2_{nc}$ is Brown's noncommutative Grassmannian.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.12298v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We build on a characterization of inner functions $f$ due to Le, in terms of the spectral properties of the operator $V=M_f^*M_f$ and study to what extent the cyclicity on weighted Hardy spaces $H^2_\omega$ of the function $z \mapsto a-z$ can be inferred from the spectral properties of analogous operators $V_a$. We describe several properties of the spectra that hold in a large class of spaces and then, we focus on the particular case of Bergman-type spaces, for which we describe completely the spectrum of such operators and find all eigenfunctions.</description>

      <title>Quaternionic Cartan coverings and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08692v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the topological foundations for the solvability of Multiplicative Cousin problems formulated on an axially symmetric domain $\Omega \subset \mathbb H.$ In particular, we provide a geometric construction of quaternionic Cartan coverings, which are generalizations of (complex) Cartan coverings as presented in Section 4 of [FP]. Because of the requirements of symmetry inherent to the domains of definition of quaternionic regular functions, the existence of quaternionic Cartan coverings of $\Omega$ is not a consequence of the existence of complex Cartan coverings because, for the latter, there are no requirements for the symmetries with respect to the real axis. Due to the real axis's special, also the covering restricted to $\Omega \cap \mathbb R$ must have additional properties. All these required properties were achieved by starting from a particular symmetric tiling of the symmetric set $\Omega \cap (\mathbb R + i\mathbb R)$. Finally, we apply these results to prove the vanishing of 'antisymmetric' cohomology groups of planar symmetric domains for $n \geq 2$.</description>

      <title>Increasing sequences of complex manifolds with uniform squeezing constants and their Bergman spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02130v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For $d\geq 2$, we discuss $d$-dimensional complex manifolds $M$ that are the increasing union of bounded open sets $M_n$'s of $\mathbb{C}^d$ with a common uniform squeezing constant. The description of $M$ is given in terms of the corank of the infinitesimal Kobayashi metric of $M$, which is shown to be identically constant on $M$. The main result of this article says that if $M$ has full Kobayashi corank, then $M$ can be written as an increasing union of the unit ball; if $M$ has zero Kobayashi corank, then $M$ has a bounded realization with a uniform squeezing constant; and if $M$ has an intermediate Kobayashi corank, then $M$ has a local weak vector bundle structure. The above description of $M$ is used to show that the dimension of the Bergman space of $M \subseteq \mathbb{C}^d$ is either zero or infinity. This settles Wiegerinck's conjecture for those pseudoconvex domains in higher dimensions that are increasing union of bounded domains with a common uniform squeezing constant.</description>

Abstract: Let $\Omega \subset \mathbb{C}^n$ be a domain whose Bergman space contains all holomorphic monomials. We derive sufficient conditions for $\Omega$ to be Reinhardt, complete Reinhardt, circular or Hartogs in terms of the orthogonality relations of the monomials with respect to their $L^2$-inner products and their $L^2$-norms. More generally, we give sufficient conditions for $\Omega$ to be invariant under a linear group action of an $r$-dimensional torus, where $r \in \{1,\ldots, n\}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.13246v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A holomorphic pre-foliation $\mathscr{F}=\mathcal{C}\boxtimes\mathcal{F}$ on $\mathbb{P}^{2}_{\mathbb{C}}$ is the data of a reduced complex projective curve $\mathcal{C}$ of $\mathbb{P}^{2}_{\mathbb{C}}$ and a holomorphic foliation $\mathcal{F}$ on $\mathbb{P}^{2}_{\mathbb{C}}$. When the foliation $\mathcal{F}$ is convex (resp. reduced convex) and the curve $\mathcal{C}$ is invariant by $\mathcal{F}$, we say that the pre-foliation $\mathscr{F}=\mathcal{C}\boxtimes\mathcal{F}$ is convex (resp. reduced convex). We prove that the dual web of a reduced convex pre-foliation on $\mathbb{P}^{2}_{\mathbb{C}}$ is flat. This generalizes our previous result obtained in the case where the associated curve consists only of invariant lines.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08552v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The purpose of this manuscript is to derive two distinct integral representations of the generalized polylogarithm using two different techniques. The first approach involves the Dirichlet series and its Laplace representation, which leads to a single integral representation. The second approach utilizes the Hadamard convolution, resulting in a double integral representation. As a consequence, an integral representation of the Lerch transcendent function is obtained. Furthermore, we establish properties such as complete monotonicity, Turan inequality, convexity, and bounds of the generalized polylogarithm. Finally, we provide an alternative proof of an existing integral representation of the generalized polylogarithm using the Hadamard convolution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02563v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper considers paired operators in the context of the Lebesgue Hilbert space $L^2$ on the unit circle and its subspace, the Hardy space $H^2$. The kernels of such operators, together with their analytic projections, which are generalizations of Toeplitz kernels, are studied. Inclusion relations between such kernels are considered in detail, and the results are applied to describing the kernels of finite-rank asymmetric truncated Toeplitz operators.</description>

      <title>Factorization of solutions of linear differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09508v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper supplements recents results on linear differential equations $f''+Af=0$, where the coefficient $A$ is analytic in the unit disc of the complex plane $\mathbb{C}$. It is shown that, if $A$ is analytic and $|A(z)|^2(1-|z|^2)^3\, dm(z)$ is a Carleson measure, then all non-trivial solutions of $f''+Af=0$ can be factorized as $f=Be^g$, where $B$ is a Blaschke product whose zero-sequence $\Lambda$ is uniformly separated and where $g\in{\rm BMOA}$ satisfies the interpolation property $$g'(z_n) = -\frac{1}{2} \, \frac{B''(z_n)}{B'(z_n)}, \quad z_n\in\Lambda.$$ Among other things, this factorization implies that all solutions of $f''+Af=0$ are functions in a Hardy space and have no singular inner factors.
  Zero-free solutions play an important role as their maximal growth is similar to the general case. The study of zero-free solutions produces a new result on Riccati differential equations.</description>
