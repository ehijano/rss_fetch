      <title>Theoretical Study of Impurity Effects on Superconductivity in UTe2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the impurity effects on UTe2 within the self-consistent Born approximation using the six-orbital f-d-p model which contains two uranium and tellurium atoms in the minimum unit cell. We analyze the dependence of superconducting transition temperature (Tc) on impurity concentration for various pairing symmetries proposed by experiments and theories. It clarifies that the decrease of Tc significantly depends on which atom sites the impurities reside. Particulalry, the analysis shows that the impurity at U-site has dominant effect on the change of Tc. Then, either the singlet state in the case of magnetic impurities or the triplet states in both non-magnetic and magnetic impurities are consistent with experiments. Thus, this indicates that elucidating the magnetic properties of impurities (i.e. magnetic or non-magnetic) is crucial for identifying the pairing symmetry of UTe2.</description>

      <title>Quantum-size effect induced Andreev bound states in ultrathin metallic islands proximitized by a superconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While Andreev bound states (ABSs) have been realized in engineered superconducting junctions, their direct observation in normal metal/superconductor heterostructures-enabled by quantum confinement-remains experimentally elusive. Here, we report the detection of ABSs in ultrathin metallic islands (Bi, Ag, and SnTe) grown on the s-wave superconductor NbN. Using high-resolution scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy, we clearly reveal in-gap ABSs with energies symmetric about the Fermi level. While the energies of these states show no position dependence, their wave functions exhibit spatial oscillations, demonstrating a quantum size effect. Both the energy levels and spatial distribution of the ABSs can be reproduced by our effective model in which a metallic island is coupled to the superconducting substrate via the proximity effect. We demonstrate that the coupling strength plays a critical role in determining the ABS energies. Our work introduces a novel physical platform for implementing ABSs, which hold promise for significant device applications.</description>

      <title>Radio-Frequency Quantum Rectification in Kagome Superconductor CsV3Sb5</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15266v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rectification of electromagnetic fields into direct current (DC) is pivotal for energy harvesting, wireless charging, and next-generation communication technologies. The superconducting diode effect, which exploits the nonreciprocal transport of dissipationless superconducting currents, offers ultra-low power consumption and high rectification ratios. Combining the superconducting diode effect with the AC Josephson effect holds promise for converting radio-frequency (rf) irradiation into a quantized DC output. However, experimental realization has been hindered by challenges in achieving the necessary symmetry breaking and fabricating high-performance Josephson junctions. Here we demonstrate the quantum rectification in kagome superconductor CsV3Sb5, which hosts emergent Josephson effects and a zero-field Josephson diode. Under rf irradiation, a DC voltage emerges without applied bias, scaling linearly with frequency as V = hf/2e, where h is Planck's constant, f is the microwave frequency, and e is the electron charge. Furthermore, the rectified voltage exhibits quantized steps with increasing rf power, consistent with Shapiro step quantization. Our work establishes CsV3Sb5 as a versatile platform for wireless quantum power supplies and charging, and underscores the intertwined order parameters as a promising pathway for precise quantum matter control.</description>

      <title>Electron-Hole Crossover in $\mathrm{La}_{3-x}\mathrm{Sr}_{x}\mathrm{Ni}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{7-\delta}$ Thin Films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15284v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ambient-pressure superconductivity in $\mathrm{La}_{3}\mathrm{Ni}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{7}$ thin films via compressive epitaxial strain provides a highly accessible platform for diverse characterization techniques, facilitating the studies of high-temperature superconductivity. Here, we systematically map the superconducting dome in compressively strained $\mathrm{La}_{3-x}\mathrm{Sr}_{x}\mathrm{Ni}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{7-\delta}$ thin films by simultaneously tuning Sr doping and oxygen content and reveal an electron-hole crossover associated with the maximum transition temperature (${T}_{c}$). This electron-hole crossover, marked by an anomalous sign change in the Hall coefficient (${R}_{H}$), is reminiscent of electron-doped cuprates, which may signal a Fermi surface reconstruction. Beyond the superconducting dome, a $\ln1/T$ insulating regime and a $T$-linear resistivity regime are also resolved, resembling behaviors observed in cuprates and infinite-layer nickelates. This work reveals a dome-shaped relationship between ${T}_{c}$ and ${R}_{H}$ and establishes a key framework for understanding unconventional superconductivity in nickelate systems.</description>

      <title>Superpotentials, flat bands and the role of Quantum Geometry for the superfluid stiffness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15604v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the stability and enhancement of superconductivity in a system subject to a 2D periodic superpotential. This externally imposed modulation leads to a reconstructed multi-band structure with flat bands emerging in certain energy regions. When the chemical potential is tuned into one of these flat bands, the associated increase in the density of states can strongly enhance the superconducting critical temperature Tc compared to the homogeneous case while maintaining the superfluid stiffness Ds at a sizeable value. We also clarify the role of the quantum geometric effect for flat bands in such topologically trivial systems. While the overall paramagnetic interband contribution to the stiffness is negative we identify a class of certain interband scattering processes which enhance Ds and scale with the interaction, playing therefore the same role as quantum geometric effects in conventional flat band models. The enhancement of superconductivity is found to be robust against weak to moderate disorder, suggesting that the system is not overly sensitive to imperfections which is an important prerequisite for experimental realizations. Our results demonstrate that engineered superpotentials offer a compelling alternative to twist-based moire systems, providing a pathway toward tailoring superconductivity via lithographic design.</description>

      <title>Identity and Quantify Various Dissipation Mechanisms of Josephson Junction in Superconducting Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15174v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pinpointing the dissipation mechanisms and evaluating their impacts to the performance of Josephson junction (JJ) are crucial for its application in superconducting circuits. In this work, we demonstrate the junction-embedded resonator (JER) as a platform which enables us to identify and quantify various dissipation mechanisms of JJ. JER is constructed by embedding JJ in the middle of an open-circuit, 1/2 {\lambda} transmission-line resonator. When the 1st and 2nd harmonics of JER are excited, JJ experiences different boundary conditions, and is dominated by internal and external dissipations, respectively. We systematically study these 2 dissipation mechanisms of JJ by varying the JJ area and number. Our results unveil the completely different behaviors of these 2 dissipation mechanisms, and quantitatively characterize their contributions, shedding a light on the direction of JJ optimization in various applications.</description>

      <title>Indirect Tunneling Enabled Spontaneous Time-Reversal Symmetry Breaking and Josephson Diode Effect in TiN/Al$_2$O$_3$/Hf$_{0.8}$Zr$_{0.2}$O$_2$/Nb tunnel junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16987v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Josephson diode (JD) effect found in Josephson tunnel junctions (JTJs) has attracted a great deal of attention due to its importance for developing superconducting circuitry based quantum technologies. So far, the highly desirable electrical control of the JD effect has not been demonstrated in any JTJ prepared by techniques used in semiconductor industry. We report the fabrication of JTJs featuring a composite tunnel barrier of Al$_2$O$_3$ and Hf$_{\mathrm{0.8}}$Zr$_\mathrm{0.2}$O$_2$ prepared by complementary-metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) compatible atomic layer deposition (ALD). These JTJs were found to show the JD effect in nominally zero magnetic fields with the nonreciprocity controllable using an electric training current, yielding a surprisingly large diode efficiency not achieved previously. The quasiparticle tunneling, through which the Josephson coupling in a JTJ is established, was found to show no nonreciprocity. We attribute these observations to the simultaneous presence of positive and negative Josephson couplings, with the latter originating from indirect tunneling. The resulted spontaneous time-reversal symmetry breaking and the double-minima washboard potential for the ensemble averaged phase difference in the resistively and capacitively shunted junction (RCSJ) model are shown to fully account for the experimentally observed JD effect.</description>

      <title>Universal Wilson Loop Bound of Quantum Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00100v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We define the absolute Wilson loop winding and prove that it bounds the (integrated) quantum metric from below. This Wilson loop lower bound naturally reproduces the known Chern and Euler bounds of the integrated quantum metric and provides an explicit lower bound of the integrated quantum metric due to the time-reversal protected $Z_2$ index, answering a hitherto open question. In general, the Wilson loop lower bound can be applied to any other topological invariants characterized by Wilson loop winding, such as the particle-hole $Z_2$ index. As physical consequences of the $Z_2$ bound, we show that the time-reversal $Z_2$ index bounds superfluid weight and optical conductivity from below and bounds the direct gap of a band insulator from above.</description>

      <title>$t$-$J$ model for strongly correlated two-orbital systems: Application to bilayer nickelate superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10114v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive a $t$-$J$ model applicable to strongly correlated two-orbital systems including bilayer nickelate superconductors. Using the Schrieffer-Wolff transformation, we exclude the doubly occupied states, which raise the onsite Coulomb energy, and derive the resulting spin interactions from the two-orbital Hubbard model. We also introduce effective interactions attributed to the interorbital Coulomb interaction. To adapt the effective model to bilayer nickelates that exhibit high-temperature superconductivity, we quantitatively evaluate the strengths of the spin interactions based on the hopping parameters in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$. Considering the evaluated effective interactions, we propose a simplified $t$-$J$ model for bilayer nickelate superconductors.</description>
