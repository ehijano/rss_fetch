      <title>Photoluminescent colour centres on a mainstream silicon photonic foundry platform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17610v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The fabrication of silicon photonic components in commercial CMOS-compatible foundries has revolutionized the impact of silicon photonics on advancing communication, quantum computing and artificial intelligence, due to their benefits of mass production, high throughput, low cost, and high performance. The indirect bandgap of silicon introduces a fundamental challenge; thus, the mainstream silicon-on-insulator (SOI) platform does not have efficient light sources. Recently, luminescent colour centres in SOI have emerged as one promising approach for developing efficient on-chip classical and quantum light sources, although past work has relied on custom fabrication that is not foundry-compatible. In this work, we demonstrate W-centre photoluminescence on a mainstream silicon photonics platform through development of a straightforward back end-of-line (BEOL) treatment. At an optimal implant energy of 7~MeV, we observed W-centre photoluminescence with a brightness comparable to prior in-house processes. We performed a series of experiments on Circular Bragg Grating (CBG) devices with varying pitches, duty cycles, and implant energies to confirm the PL emission from the encapsulated SOI device layer rather than the handle wafer. Our novel approach in fabricating silicon colour centres in commercial silicon photonic foundry processes opens up new opportunities for integrating classical and quantum light sources directly onto silicon photonic circuits, unlocking opportunities for large-scale integration of advanced photonic architectures on chip.</description>

      <title>Resonant Modes of Electromagnetic Waves Confined in Dielectric Rings: Formulation and Examples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17745v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dielectric ring resonators are fundamental components in integrated photonics, enabling various applications. Accurate prediction of their resonant modes and effective refractive indices is crucial for optimal device performance. This paper presents a novel numerical method for analyzing electromagnetic wave propagation in dielectric rings. By exploiting the inherent symmetry of the problem and the phase continuity condition for resonance, we derive a set of coupled wave equations in cylindrical coordinates. These equations are then discretized using finite-difference methods. Since the unknown azimuthal mode number ($m$) appears on both sides of the equations, we propose a simple two-step numerical algorithm to determine $m$. First, we introduce a trial azimuthal mode number that is calculated from the ring radius and wave number to obtain the initial eigen-solutions. In the second step, we identify the azimuthal mode numbers corresponding to the desired resonant modes and refine the Hamiltonian matrix accordingly. Our approach offers an easy-to-implement and accurate alternative to full-wave electromagnetic solvers. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through several numerical examples. The results obtained from our method exhibit very good agreement with those from commercial full-wave solvers, validating its accuracy.</description>

      <title>A Nonlinear Finite-Difference Solver for Modal Analysis of Dielectric Waveguides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents a finite-difference-based numerical solver explicitly tailored for the electric field formulation of the vector wave equations in optically linear, non-magnetic, dielectric waveguides. Our approach's key innovation is efficiently handling the problem's inherent non-linearity. We achieve this using a shooting-like algorithm that iteratively refines the propagation constant to determine guided modes accurately. All electric field components are treated self-consistently, reducing spurious numerical artifacts at permittivity boundaries. We validate the proposed solver by applying it to two representative waveguide structures, demonstrating its accuracy in calculating both the propagation constants and the field distributions of guided modes.</description>

      <title>Spectral filtering effect of diffraction gratings with a lens coupling to optical fibers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17925v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a theoretical study of a spectral filter, which consists of a diffraction grating, a coupling lens, and an optical fiber. As the diffracted beam is highly dispersed spatially, coupling into an optical fiber naturally creates a Gaussian spectral filtering effect. Using ray transfer matrices, we derive simple equations to calculate the spectral filter bandwidth and the group velocity dispersion. This study offers insights for designing fiber-based spectral filters, particularly for mode-locked fiber lasers.</description>

      <title>Comparison of near-field light intensities: plasmon nanofocusing vs localized plasmon resonance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The localized surface plasmon resonance of metallic nanostructures produces strongly localized and enhanced near-field light, significantly contributing to nanophotonics research and applications. Plasmon nanofocusing represents another method for generating near-field light through the propagation and condensation of plasmons on tapered plasmonic structures. In both methods, the intensity of near-field light is a critical aspect for many applications. In this study, we numerically inspect and compare the intensities of near-field light generated by either localized plasmon resonance or plasmon nanofocusing. To account for the light-induced changes in the optical properties of plasmonic structures, which in turn influence the near-field light intensity, we couple electromagnetic and thermal calculations to consider in a fully self-consistent manner the effects of the incident light and the light-induced temperature rise within the metal. A gold nanorod and a cone were adopted for exciting the localized plasmon resonance and plasmon nanofocusing, respectively. We find that plasmon nanofocusing generates approximately 1.5 times as strong near-field light as localized plasmon resonance. Our research provides a necessary foundation for generating near-field light, which is crucial for advancing the applications of near-field optics.</description>

      <title>Subvolt high-speed free-space modulator with electro-optic metasurface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17986v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Active metasurfaces incorporating electro-optic (EO) materials enable high-speed free-space optical modulators that show great promise for a wide range of emerging applications, including free-space optical communication, light detection and ranging, and optical computing. However, the limited light-matter interaction lengths in ultrathin metasurfaces typically require high driving voltages exceeding tens of volts. Here we present ultralow-voltage, high-speed free-space optical modulators based on silicon-organic-hybrid metasurfaces with dimerized-grating-based nanostructures. By exploiting a high-Q quasi-bound state in the continuum, normally incident light is effectively trapped within a submicrometer-scale silicon slot region embedded with organic EO material. Consequently, highly efficient modulation is obtained, enabling data transmission at 50 Mbps and 1.6 Gbps with driving voltages of only 0.2 V and 1 V, respectively. These unprecedented metasurface modulators operating at complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS)-compatible voltage levels provide the pathway toward energy-efficient high-speed active metasurface devices.</description>

      <title>Compression benchmarking of holotomography data using the OME-Zarr storage format</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Holotomography (HT) is a label-free, three-dimensional imaging technique that captures refractive index distributions of biological samples at sub-micron resolution. As modern HT systems enable high-throughput and large-scale acquisition, they produce terabyte-scale datasets that require efficient data management. This study presents a systematic benchmarking of data compression strategies for HT data stored in the OME-Zarr format, a cloud-compatible, chunked data structure suitable for scalable imaging workflows. Using representative datasets-including embryo, tissue, and birefringent tissue volumes-we evaluated combinations of preprocessing filters and 25 compression configurations across multiple compression levels. Performance was assessed in terms of compression ratio, bandwidth, and decompression speed. A throughput-based evaluation metric was introduced to simulate real-world conditions under varying network constraints, supporting optimal compressor selection based on system bandwidth. The results offer practical guidance for storage and transmission of large HT datasets and serve as a reference for implementing scalable, FAIR-aligned imaging workflows in cloud and high-performance computing environments.</description>

      <title>Mie resonances in optical trapping: Their role in kinematics and back-action</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The heating rate plays a crucial role in the decoherence of the harmonic motion of an optically levitated nanoparticle. The values of this rate vary depending on both the scattering photon rate and the kinetic energy acquired through individual photon recoils. While the combined roles of these factors have been extensively studied, the energy transfer per recoil has not been explicitly examined. This energy transfer is often approximated using a linear dipole model with coefficients $\{1/5, 2/5, 7/5\}$ which applies in the Rayleigh limit. In this work, we analyze the evolution of energy transfer per photon recoil for low-absorption dielectric nanospheres with diameters ranging from 2 nm to 500 nm. Using a far-field approximation, we demonstrate that the Kerker condition, which enhances the alignment between incident and scattered wavevectors, may significantly reduce the energy transferred per recoil. Although this reduction is counterbalanced by the increasing scattering rate, for an individual scattering event, the reduction of recoil suggests an intrinsic suppression of back-action. Our results reveal a potential enhancement in the accuracy of estimations in tabletop experiments involving Mie particles of the considered sizes and provide guidance for the selection of optimal probe sizes and materials. Our interpretation of recoil reduction as a manifestation of back-action suppression indicates the potential for quantum nondemolition (QND) measurements by tailoring scattered radiation patterns with metamaterials.</description>

      <title>Thermally-controlled magnetooptical metasurface for tunable Faraday rotation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18423v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present novel type of tunable magneto-optical metasurfaces performing Faraday rotation, the sign and value of which are not fixed after the structure fabrication but can be tuned in a wide range via heating of the metasurface. We demonstrate both experimentally and theoretically that the Faraday rotation angle is enhanced in the vicinity of the magnetodipole and electrodipole Mie resonances and can be changed in a wide range from -0.3 degrees to +0.1 degrees for the same metasurface at fixed wavelength of incident light under the temperature changes from the 294~K to 488~K. Such thermal heating can be performed by an external control laser. As laser radiation can be focused at the spots of $~\sim 1\mu$m diameter, the magneto-optical response can also be tuned locally. Thus one may obtain the inhomogeneous magnetooptically-induced polarization rotation distributions across the metasurface by the creation of the laser beam patterns with the desired intensity profiles. Another possibility opened by the proposed merasurface is self-modulation of polarization of laser light performed depending on its intensity.</description>

      <title>Nonreciprocal quantum router with non-Markovian environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18647v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum routers are essential elements of quantum networks, enabling coherent information transfer between distant nodes. While their behavior has been extensively studied under Markovian approximations, investigations in non-Markovian regimes remain limited. In this paper, we study a nonreciprocal quantum router embedded in non-Markovian environments, enabling directional control of single photons, which allows transmission from one side while blocking it from the other. The cascade system under study consists of two quantum nodes: one comprising two coupled coplanar-waveguide resonators and the other featuring a superconducting ring resonator. Each node is respectively coupled to a single Yttrium iron garnet (YIG) disk, with nonreciprocity arising from the selective coupling between magnons and microwave photons in our model. We analytically derive the transmission and reflection spectra of the system when a photon is input respectively from the left and right sides of the transmission line in the non-Markovian regimes. Our results demonstrate that, with appropriate parameters, a single photon can be routed from a given input port to either of the two output ports, while being fully absorbed when incident from the opposite side. We further compare the scattering behavior in non-Markovian and Markovian regimes through numerical simulations. In the non-Markovian case, the transmission spectrum exhibits two unity peaks (two valleys with a minimum value of zero), whereas in the Markovian case, high transmission appears only within a narrow window near zero detuning when the photon is injected from the left. As the environmental bandwidth increases, non-Markovian results converge to the Markovian limit. This formalism may enable new applications in quantum information and communication exploiting non-Markovianity.</description>

      <title>Blind structured illumination microscopy via generalized Richardson-Lucy method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18786v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Structured illumination microscopy (SIM) can achieve a $2\times$ resolution enhancement beyond the classical diffraction limit by employing illumination translations with respect to the object. This method has also been successfully implemented in a ``blind'' configuration, i.e., with unknown illumination patterns, allowing for more relaxed constraints on the control of illumination delivery. Here, we present a similar blind-SIM approach using a novel super-resolution algorithm that employs a generalized version of the popular Richardson-Lucy algorithm, alongside an optimized and customized optical setup. Both numerical and experimental validations demonstrate that our technique exhibits high noise resilience. Moreover, by implementing random translations instead of ``ordered'' ones, noise-related artifacts are reduced. These advancements enable wide-field super-resolved imaging with significantly reduced optical complexity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.17366v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For decades, there have been multiple seemingly contradicting experimental reports on the dependence of the photoluminescence from metal nanostructures on their size. We reconcile these reports using a simple analytic formula which is found to match well photoluminescence measurements for a range of structures and illumination conditions. Our expression requires only knowledge of the local electric field and temperature, and it points to the physical quantities that determine the emission strength and its dependence on size.</description>

      <title>Refining spectroscopic calculations for trivalent lanthanide ions: a revised parametric Hamiltonian and open-source solution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17377v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The historical calculation of spectroscopic properties for trivalent lanthanide ions is a complex multistep process that has been prone to inaccuracies. In this work, we revise the parametric semi-empirical Hamiltonian and address long-standing discrepancies in the literature. We also resurface the distinctions between orthogonal and non-orthogonal operators and use orthogonal operators to provide an alternative parametric description. Based on experimental data available in the literature, a new set of parameter values for the ions in LaF$_3$ and LiYF$_4$ is presented. Additionally, we provide calculations of spontaneous emission rates and oscillator strengths for magnetic dipole transitions in the LaF$_3$ crystal host. To ensure the replicability of our findings, we make available the open-source code $\mathbf{\texttt{qlanth}}$, accompanied by a comprehensive set of electronic files to serve as an updated reference for future calculations.</description>

Abstract: We report two anti-reflection (AR) coatings that give better quantum efficiency (QE) than the existing AR coating on the Gaia astrometric field (AF) CCDs. Light being the core of optical astronomy is extremely important for such missions, therefore, the QE of the devices that are used to capture it should be substantially high. To reduce the losses due to the reflection of light from the surface of the CCDs, AR coatings can be applied. Currently, the main component of the Gaia satellite, the AF CCDs use hafnium dioxide (HfO2) AR coating. In this paper, the ATLAS module of the SILVACO software has been employed for simulating and studying the AF CCD pixel structure and several AR coatings. Our findings evidently suggest that zirconium dioxide (ZrO2) and tantalum pentoxide (Ta2O5) will prove to be better AR coatings for broadband astronomical CCDs in the future and will open new avenues for understanding the evolution of the Milky Way.</description>

      <title>Strengthening the No-Go Theorem for QRNGs</title>

Abstract: Quantum random numbers are essential for security against quantum algorithms. Randomness as a beacon is a service being provided for companies and governments to upgrade their security standards from RSA to PQC - QKD or PQC-RSA protocols. Both security mechanisms assume trust in the service provider unless one aims for device-independent protocols. How does an entity ensure that the beacon service has a quantum signature other than relying on faith? Specifically, given a bit-stream, can a user verify a quantum signature in it? Researchers claim this is indecipherable and have stated a no-go theorem for post-processed bit-streams. In this article, we corroborate the results of the no-go theorem while discussing its nuances using two different random number generators and four test methods. These include the NIST statistical test suite and machine learning algorithms that strengthen the theorem. This work is relevant for companies and governments using QRNG OpenAPI to enhance security against quantum threats.</description>

      <title>Optically tunable spin Hall effect in periodically driven monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18248v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the driving field of circularly polarized light (CPL) can be used to enhance and reverse the spin current generated in the spin Hall effect for some transition-metal dichalcogenides. This is demonstrated by analyzing the time-averaged spin Hall conductivities in the nonequilibrium steady states of monolayers WS$_{2}$, MoS$_{2}$, MoTe$_{2}$, and WTe$_{2}$ driven by CPL with the Floquet linear-response theory. We argue that the enhancement and reversals of the spin current come from a combination of the non-Rashba effect of broken inversion symmetry and the nonperturbative effect of CPL beyond the dynamical localization. This work allows optical control of the magnitude and direction of the pure spin current.</description>

      <title>Fourier State Tomography of Polarization-Encoded Qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18311v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum state tomography is a central technique for the characterization and verification of quantum systems. Standard tomography is widely used for low-dimensional systems, but for larger systems, it becomes impractical due to the exponential scaling of experimental complexity with the number of qubits. Here, we present an experimental realization of Fourier-transform quantum state tomography for polarization-encoded photonic states. We validate the technique using weak coherent states and entangled photon pairs generated by a quantum dot and spontaneous parametric down-conversion source in the telecom wavelength. The reconstructed density matrices show excellent agreement with those obtained through conventional projective tomography, with calculated metrics such as fidelity and concurrence matching within error bars, confirming the reliability and accuracy of the technique. Fourier state tomography employs only a single rotating waveplate per qubit, thereby avoiding repeated adjustments across multiple waveplates and ensuring that the number of physical measurement settings scales linearly with the number of qubits, despite the exponential growth of the underlying state space. This reduction in optical configurations simplifies experimental overhead, making Fourier state tomography a practical alternative for multi-qubit characterization.</description>

      <title>Tracking the photoinduced dynamics of a dark excitonic state in single-layer WS$_2$ via resonant Autler-Townes splitting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18530v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Excitons in a monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides (1L-TMD) are highly bound states characterized by a Rydberg-like spectrum of discrete energy levels. Within this spectrum, states with odd-parity are known as dark excitons because transitions to the ground state are forbidden by selection rules. This makes their stationary and transient characterization challenging using linear optical techniques. Here, we demonstrate that the dynamics of a 2p dark excitonic state in 1L-WS$_2$ can be directly retrieved by measuring the Autler-Townes splitting of bright states in a three-pulse experiment. The splitting of the bright 1s excitonic state, observed by detuning a mid-infrared control field across the 1s-2p transition, provides an accurate characterization of the 2p state, which is used here to reveal its dynamics following a sudden photoinjection of free carriers in the conduction band. We observe a qualitatively different dynamics of the 1s and 2p levels, which is indicative of symmetry-dependent screening and exciton-exciton interactions. These findings provide new insights into many-body effects in TMDs, offering potential avenues for advancing the next generation optoelectronics.</description>

      <title>Experimental Evidence of Vortex $\gamma$ Photons in All-Optical Inverse Compton Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18843v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vortex $\gamma$ photons carrying orbital angular momenta (OAM) hold great potential for various applications. However, their generation remains a great challenge. Here, we successfully generate sub-MeV vortex $\gamma$ photons via all-optical inverse Compton scattering of relativistic electrons colliding with a sub-relativistic Laguerre-Gaussian laser. In principle, directly measuring the OAM of $\gamma$ photons is challenging due to their incoherence and extremely short wavelength. Therein, we put forward a novel method to determine the OAM properties by revealing the quantum opening angle of vortex $\gamma$ photons, since vortex particles exhibit not only a spiral phase but also transverse momentum according to the quantum electrodynamics theory. Thus,$\gamma$ photons carrying OAM anifest a much larger angular distribution than those without OAM, which has been clearly observed in our experiments. This angular expansion is considered as an overall effect lying beyond classical theory. Our method provides the first experimental evidence for detecting vortex $\gamma$ photons and opens a new perspective for investigating OAM-induced quantum phenomena in broad fields.</description>

      <title>Design of an aluminum nitride based electro-optic phase modulator and photonic switch for next generation scalable photonic integrated circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.18861v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electro-optic modulators are fundamental components in atomic physics experiments, including trapped-ion systems used in precision metrology and quantum computing. To enable scalable photonic integration, we design and analyze an integrated photonic electro-optic phase modulator and switch at 411 nm for ytterbium ($Yb^{+}$) ions using aluminum nitride (AlN) waveguides. We employ finite element method (FEM) simulations to optimize optical confinement, RF impedance matching, and electro-optic modulation efficiency. The phase modulator achieves a DC $V_{\pi}L$ of 178 V cm for TE polarization. The photonic switch, designed with a push-pull electrode configuration, demonstrates a $V_{\pi}L$ of 24 V cm, enabling efficient operation at lower voltages. These results highlight AlN as a candidate for ultraviolet photonic integrated circuits, facilitating high-speed optical modulation for trapped-ion applications.</description>

      <title>Optical Spiking Neurons Enable High-Speed and Energy-Efficient Optical Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05726v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Optical neural networks (ONNs) perform extensive computations using photons instead of electrons, resulting in passively energy-efficient and low-latency computing. Among various ONNs, the diffractive optical neural networks (DONNs) particularly excel in energy efficiency, bandwidth, and parallelism, therefore attract considerable attention. However, their performance is limited by the inherent constraints of traditional frame-based sensors, which process and produce dense and redundant information at low operating frequency. Inspired by the spiking neurons in human neural system, which utilize a thresholding mechanism to transmit information sparsely and efficiently, we propose integrating a threshold-locking method into neuromorphic vision sensors to generate sparse and binary information, achieving microsecond-level accurate perception similar to human spiking neurons. By introducing novel Binary Dual Adaptive Training (BAT) and Optically Parallel Mixture of Experts (OPMoE) inference methods, the high-speed, spike-based diffractive optical neural network (S2NN) demonstrates an ultra-fast operating speed of 3649 FPS, which is 30 fold faster than that of reported DONNs, delivering a remarkable computational speed of 417.96 TOPS and a system energy efficiency of 12.6 TOPS/W. Our work demonstrates the potential of incorporating neuromorphic architecture to facilitate optical neural network applications in real-world scenarios for both low-level and high-level machine vision tasks.</description>

      <title>Picocavity-enhanced Raman spectroscopy of physisorbed H2 and D2 molecules</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.10994v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report on tip-enhanced Raman scattering (TERS) of H2 and D2 molecules physisorbed within a plasmonic picocavity at 10 K. The intense Raman peaks resulting from the rotational and vibrational transitions are observed at sub-nanometer gap distances of the junction formed by an Ag tip and Ag(111) surface, where a picocavity-enhanced field plays a crucial role. A significant red-shift of the H-H stretch frequency is found as the gap distance decreases, while the D-D stretch frequency is unaffected. Density functional theory, path-integral molecular dynamics, and quantum anharmonic vibrational energy calculations suggest that this unexpected isotope effect is explained by a different molecular density between H2 and D2 on the surface.</description>

      <title>Quasi-coherent perfect absorption of counter-propagating vector beams of finite spatial extent through an absorptive slab</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11750v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Coherent perfect absorption (CPA) has been a topic of considerable contemporary research interest. Most of the theoretical treatment of CPA with beams, to the best of our knowledge, relies on a scalar (in some cases coupled mode) theories with inadequate input about the polarization states of the incoming light. In view of the lack of a full vectorial theory even for the original CPA configuration by Wan et al \cite{timereversedlasing_science}, we revisit the same when the incident plane waves are replaced by well defined vector beams with or without OAM. We study the absorption characteristics of two counter-propagating monochromatic structured beams, e.g., Gaussian and Laguerre-Gaussian (LG) beams with and without orbital angular momentum, respectively, incident normally on a composite slab from both sides by fulfilling the CPA condition exclusively for the central plane wave component. We show that though perfect absorption is not achievable, there can be a substantial reduction of the scattered light. We also consider the limitations of CPA for oblique incidence and discuss the difficulties. We believe that our study will motivate and necessitate the study of recent advancements with input vector beams, retaining the full polarization information of the off-axis spatial harmonics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06798v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article introduces a methodology for inducing wavenumber bandgaps via alternating Willis coupling signs. A non-reciprocal wave equation of Willis-type is first considered, and its wave dispersion analyses are carried out via the transfer matrix method. By creating unit cells from two identical Willis-type elastic layers, yet with reversed Willis-coupling signs, a reciprocal band structure peculiarly emerges, although each layer exhibits non-reciprocity if considered individually. Wavenumber bandgaps open due to such unit cell configuration, and their width and limits are analytically quantified. Similarities between materials with reversed-sign Willis coupling and bi-layered phononic crystals are noted, followed by concluding remarks.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Opto-Electrical Excitation of Spin-Transfer Torque Nano-Oscillators for Advanced Computing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.00813v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neuromorphic computing, inspired by the brain's parallel and energy-efficient processing, offers a transformative approach to artificial intelligence. In this study, we fabricated optimized spin-transfer torque nano-oscillators (STNOs) and investigated their dynamic behaviors using a hybrid excitation scheme combining AC laser illumination and DC bias currents. Laser-induced thermal gradients generate pulsed thermoelectric voltages ($V_{\text{AC}}$) via the Tunnel Magneto-Seebeck (TMS) effect, while the addition of bias currents enhances this response, producing both $V_{\text{AC}}$ and a DC component ($V_{\text{DC}}$). Magnetic field sweeps reveal distinct switching between parallel (P) and antiparallel (AP) magnetization states in both voltage components, supporting multistate memory applications. Millivolt-range thermovoltage signals in open-circuit conditions demonstrate CMOS compatibility, enabling simplified, scalable neuromorphic systems. Under biased conditions, enhanced thermovoltage outputs exhibit intriguing phenomena, including spikes correlated with Barkhausen jumps and double-switching behavior, offering insights into magnetization dynamics and vortex transitions. These features resemble neural spiking behavior, suggesting applications in spiking neural networks, reservoir computing, multistate logic, analog computing, and high-resolution sensing. By bridging spintronic phenomena with practical applications, this work provides a versatile platform for next-generation AI technologies and adaptive computing architectures.</description>

      <title>Dammann Metasurface Route to Overcoming the Uniformity Defects in Two-Dimensional Beam Multipliers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.06021v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dammann gratings - beam-shaping optical elements acting as beam multipliers with equal-power beams - are a key element in three-dimensional imaging based on structured light and beam combiners for high-power laser applications. However, two-dimensional Dammann grating structures suffer from a significant reduction of the uniformity among the diffraction orders. Here, we report Dammann metasurfaces based on the geometric phase as the structure realization for the target phase profile, which outperform the capabilities of Dammann gratings by overcoming the uniformity defects in their two-dimensional diffraction patterns. We showed that two-dimensional Dammann metasurfaces exhibit high uniformity and diffraction efficiency, in contrast to Dammann gratings, by overcoming the uniformity defects via a robust and highly precise phase imprint. Moreover, Dammann metasurfaces outperform their grating counterparts by exhibiting a polarization-independent response and a broadband operation. This study reveals that by providing physics-driven solutions, metasurfaces can outperform the capabilities of their bulk optics counterparts while facilitating virtually flat, ultrathin, and lightweight optics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.07407v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cavity-based x-ray free-electron lasers (CBXFELs) represent a possible realization of fully coherent hard x-ray sources having high spectral brilliance along with a narrow spectral bandwidth of $\simeq 1 - 50$~meV, a high repetition pulse rate of $\simeq 1$~MHz, and good stability. A diagnostic tool is required to measure CBXFEL spectra with meV resolution and high luminosity on a shot-to-shot basis. We have designed a high-luminosity single-shot hard x-ray spectrograph that images 9.831-keV x-rays in a $\simeq 200$~meV spectral window with a spectral resolution of a few meV. The spectrograph is designed around angular dispersion of x-rays in Bragg diffraction from crystals. It operates close to design specifications, exhibiting a linear dispersion rate of $\simeq$~1.4~$\mu$m/meV and a $\simeq$~200-meV window of high-fidelity spectral imaging. The experimentally demonstrated spectral resolution is $\simeq 20$~meV; this resolution is twice as low as expected from theory primarily because the spectrograph is highly sensitive to crystal angular instabilities. The experiment was performed at the bending magnet x-ray optics testing beamline 1-BM at the Advanced Photon Source.</description>

Abstract: One-dimensional (1D) polymer-based photonic crystals (PhCs) in the $1.55~\mu{}m$ wavelength range can be easily created using a two-photon direct laser writing system. To achieve shorter period structures, we report the use of thermal shrinkage of two-photon polymerized structures, at elevated temperatures, to eliminate unpolymerised material, leading to the uniform shrinkage of the distributed Bragg reflector (DBR) structures by a ratio of $\sim$ 2.5 to 5. Our Finite Difference Time Domain (FDTD) simulation and the angle-resolved light scattering characterization technique using Fourier image spectroscopy (FIS) measurements show that the low order photonic bandgaps of DBRs blue-shift across the NIR-visible region (850 to 400 nm) as the shrinkage increases.</description>

      <title>Learned, uncertainty-driven adaptive acquisition for photon-efficient scanning microscopy</title>

Abstract: Scanning microscopy systems, such as confocal and multiphoton microscopy, are powerful imaging tools for probing deep into biological tissue. However, scanning systems have an inherent trade-off between acquisition time, field of view, phototoxicity, and image quality, often resulting in noisy measurements when fast, large field of view, and/or gentle imaging is needed. Deep learning could be used to denoise noisy microscopy measurements, but these algorithms can be prone to hallucination, which can be disastrous for medical and scientific applications. We propose a method to simultaneously denoise and predict pixel-wise uncertainty for scanning microscopy systems, improving algorithm trustworthiness and providing statistical guarantees for deep learning predictions. Furthermore, we propose to leverage this learned, pixel-wise uncertainty to drive an adaptive acquisition technique that rescans only the most uncertain regions of a sample, saving time and reducing the total light dose to the sample. We demonstrate our method on experimental confocal and multiphoton microscopy systems, showing that our uncertainty maps can pinpoint hallucinations in the deep learned predictions. Finally, with our adaptive acquisition technique, we demonstrate up to 16X reduction in acquisition time and total light dose while successfully recovering fine features in the sample and reducing hallucinations. We are the first to demonstrate distribution-free uncertainty quantification for a denoising task with real experimental data and the first to propose adaptive acquisition based on reconstruction uncertainty.</description>

      <title>Self-trapping phenomenon, multistability and chaos in open anisotropic Dicke dimer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13809v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate semiclassical dynamics of a coupled atom-photon interacting system described by a dimer of anisotropic Dicke model in the presence of photon loss, exhibiting a rich variety of non-linear dynamics. Based on symmetries and dynamical classification, we characterize and chart out various dynamical phases in a phase diagram. A key feature of this system is the multistability of different dynamical states, particularly the coexistence of various superradiant phases as well as limit cycles. Remarkably, this dimer system manifests self-trapping phenomena, resulting in a photon population imbalance between the cavities. Such a self-trapped state arises from a saddle-node bifurcation, which can be understood from an equivalent Landau-Ginzburg description. Additionally, we identify a unique class of oscillatory dynamics self-trapped limit cycle, hosting self-trapping of photons. The absence of stable dynamical phases leads to the onset of chaos, which is diagnosed using the saturation value of the decorrelator dynamics. Moreover, the self-trapped states can coexist with chaotic attractor, which may have intriguing consequences in quantum dynamics. Finally, we discuss the experimental relevance of our findings, which can be tested in cavity and circuit quantum electrodynamics setups.</description>

      <title>Dual axis atomic magnetometer and gyroscope enabled by nuclear spin perturbation</title>

Abstract: Alkali-noble-gas comagnetometers have become an essential tool for tests of fundamental physics and offer a compact platform for precision gyroscopy. They are, however, limited by technical noise at low frequencies, commonly due to their limited suppression of magnetic noise. Here we investigate a new method for co-magnetometry between a single noble gas and alkali species. While similar to well-known devices using self-compensation, our scheme introduces magnetic pulses that controllably perturb the noble gas and pulsed optical pumping to polarise the alkali atoms. These applied pulses allow our scheme to measure, rather than just suppress, the effect of magnetic noise thereby offering reduced cross-talk. We show numerically that our scheme retrieves four signals (rotations and magnetic fields on two transverse axes) with similar sensitivity to a single axis device. We also present a proof-of-principle experiment based on a 87Rb-129Xe cell. Our data shows a low magnetic-rotation cross-talk of $0.2 \pm 0.1\mu$Hz$/$pT, which is already on par with the most sensitive devices relying on self-compensation.</description>

      <title>Axisymmetric model for 1-color laser filament THz emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18963v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A 3D axisymmetric model for laser beam propagation in air is proposed for use with THz emission calculations. The model accounts for nonlinear propagation of the femtosecond pulse that generates the filament (Kerr self-focusing and plasma defocusing). The formalism proposed can be applied across a broad range of experimental parameters - focal lengths, beam profiles, and intensities. We adapt existing models of 1-color THz emission for use with the beam propagation model to calculate THz emission signatures. Two of these THz emission models are used - a 1D model and a more detailed 3D axisymmetric model. For the test case considered, nonlinear propagation dynamics have a large impact on the amplitude of the THz signal, but only a minimal impact on the frequency content and angular distribution of the signal.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetically Induced Transparency Effect Improves Quantum Battery Lifetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16156v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum battery (QB) is an application of quantum thermodynamics which uses quantum effects to store and transfer energy, overcoming the limitations of classical batteries and potentially improving performance. However, due to the interaction with the external environment, it will lead to decoherence and thus reduce the lifetime of QBs. Here, we propose suppressing the environmental dissipation in the energy-storage process of the QB by exploiting the electromagnetically-induced transparency (EIT) and bound states. By constructing a hybrid system composed of a four-level atom and a coupled-cavity array, two bound states are formed in the system when the energy of the QB is in the energy band of the cavity array. Due to the bound states and the EIT effect, the ambient dissipation is significantly suppressed, which improves the lifetime of the QB. In addition, we show that when the energy of the QB is in resonance with the cavity, the ergotropy of the QB reaches the maximum. Furthermore, there exists an optimal coupling strength between two neighbouring cavities which helps improve the performance of the QB. These discoveries may shed the light on the design of high-efficiency QBs.</description>
