      <title>Q-Probe: Scaling Image Quality Assessment to High Resolution via Context-Aware Agentic Probing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15356v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has empowered Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to achieve superior human preference alignment in Image Quality Assessment (IQA). However, existing RL-based IQA models typically rely on coarse-grained global views, failing to capture subtle local degradations in high-resolution scenarios. While emerging "Thinking with Images" paradigms enable multi-scale visual perception via zoom-in mechanisms, their direct adaptation to IQA induces spurious "cropping-implies-degradation" biases and misinterprets natural depth-of-field as artifacts. To address these challenges, we propose Q-Probe, the first agentic IQA framework designed to scale IQA to high resolution via context-aware probing. First, we construct Vista-Bench, a pioneering benchmark tailored for fine-grained local degradation analysis in high-resolution IQA settings. Furthermore, we propose a three-stage training paradigm that progressively aligns the model with human preferences, while simultaneously eliminating causal bias through a novel context-aware cropping strategy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Q-Probe achieves state-of-the-art performance in high-resolution settings while maintaining superior efficacy across resolution scales.</description>

      <title>High-Fidelity 3D Tooth Reconstruction by Fusing Intraoral Scans and CBCT Data via a Deep Implicit Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-fidelity 3D tooth models are essential for digital dentistry, but must capture both the detailed crown and the complete root. Clinical imaging modalities are limited: Cone-Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT) captures the root but has a noisy, low-resolution crown, while Intraoral Scanners (IOS) provide a high-fidelity crown but no root information. A naive fusion of these sources results in unnatural seams and artifacts. We propose a novel, fully-automated pipeline that fuses CBCT and IOS data using a deep implicit representation. Our method first segments and robustly registers the tooth instances, then creates a hybrid proxy mesh combining the IOS crown and the CBCT root. The core of our approach is to use this noisy proxy to guide a class-specific DeepSDF network. This optimization process projects the input onto a learned manifold of ideal tooth shapes, generating a seamless, watertight, and anatomically coherent model. Qualitative and quantitative evaluations show our method uniquely preserves both the high-fidelity crown from IOS and the patient-specific root morphology from CBCT, overcoming the limitations of each modality and naive stitching.</description>

      <title>Aligned Stable Inpainting: Mitigating Unwanted Object Insertion and Preserving Color Consistency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative image inpainting can produce realistic, high-fidelity results even with large, irregular masks. However, existing methods still face key issues that make inpainted images look unnatural. In this paper, we identify two main problems: (1) Unwanted object insertion: generative models may hallucinate arbitrary objects in the masked region that do not match the surrounding context. (2) Color inconsistency: inpainted regions often exhibit noticeable color shifts, leading to smeared textures and degraded image quality. We analyze the underlying causes of these issues and propose efficient post-hoc solutions for pre-trained inpainting models. Specifically, we introduce the principled framework of Aligned Stable inpainting with UnKnown Areas prior (ASUKA). To reduce unwanted object insertion, we use reconstruction-based priors to guide the generative model, suppressing hallucinated objects while preserving generative flexibility. To address color inconsistency, we design a specialized VAE decoder that formulates latent-to-image decoding as a local harmonization task. This design significantly reduces color shifts and produces more color-consistent results. We implement ASUKA on two representative inpainting architectures: a U-Net-based model and a DiT-based model. We analyze and propose lightweight injection strategies that minimize interference with the model's original generation capacity while ensuring the mitigation of the two issues. We evaluate ASUKA using the Places2 dataset and MISATO, our proposed diverse benchmark. Experiments show that ASUKA effectively suppresses object hallucination and improves color consistency, outperforming standard diffusion, rectified flow models, and other inpainting methods. Dataset, models and codes will be released in github.</description>

      <title>OpenVision 3: A Family of Unified Visual Encoder for Both Understanding and Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15369v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a family of advanced vision encoder, named OpenVision 3, that learns a single, unified visual representation that can serve both image understanding and image generation. Our core architecture is simple: we feed VAE-compressed image latents to a ViT encoder and train its output to support two complementary roles. First, the encoder output is passed to the ViT-VAE decoder to reconstruct the original image, encouraging the representation to capture generative structure. Second, the same representation is optimized with contrastive learning and image-captioning objectives, strengthening semantic features. By jointly optimizing reconstruction- and semantics-driven signals in a shared latent space, the encoder learns representations that synergize and generalize well across both regimes. We validate this unified design through extensive downstream evaluations with the encoder frozen. For multimodal understanding, we plug the encoder into the LLaVA-1.5 framework: it performs comparably with a standard CLIP vision encoder (e.g., 62.4 vs 62.2 on SeedBench, and 83.7 vs 82.9 on POPE). For generation, we test it under the RAE framework: ours substantially surpasses the standard CLIP-based encoder (e.g., gFID: 1.89 vs 2.54 on ImageNet). We hope this work can spur future research on unified modeling.</description>

      <title>A Machine Vision Approach to Preliminary Skin Lesion Assessments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Early detection of malignant skin lesions is critical for improving patient outcomes in aggressive, metastatic skin cancers. This study evaluates a comprehensive system for preliminary skin lesion assessment that combines the clinically established ABCD rule of dermoscopy (analyzing Asymmetry, Borders, Color, and Dermoscopic Structures) with machine learning classification. Using a 1,000-image subset of the HAM10000 dataset, the system implements an automated, rule-based pipeline to compute a Total Dermoscopy Score (TDS) for each lesion. This handcrafted approach is compared against various machine learning solutions, including traditional classifiers (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and SVM) and deep learning models. While the rule-based system provides high clinical interpretability, results indicate a performance bottleneck when reducing complex morphology to five numerical features. Experimental findings show that transfer learning with EfficientNet-B0 failed significantly due to domain shift between natural and medical images. In contrast, a custom three-layer Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained from scratch achieved 78.5% accuracy and 86.5% recall on median-filtered images, representing a 19-point accuracy improvement over traditional methods. The results demonstrate that direct pixel-level learning captures diagnostic patterns beyond handcrafted features and that purpose-built lightweight architectures can outperform large pretrained models for small, domain-specific medical datasets.</description>

      <title>FUGC: Benchmarking Semi-Supervised Learning Methods for Cervical Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate segmentation of cervical structures in transvaginal ultrasound (TVS) is critical for assessing the risk of spontaneous preterm birth (PTB), yet the scarcity of labeled data limits the performance of supervised learning approaches. This paper introduces the Fetal Ultrasound Grand Challenge (FUGC), the first benchmark for semi-supervised learning in cervical segmentation, hosted at ISBI 2025. FUGC provides a dataset of 890 TVS images, including 500 training images, 90 validation images, and 300 test images. Methods were evaluated using the Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC), Hausdorff Distance (HD), and runtime (RT), with a weighted combination of 0.4/0.4/0.2. The challenge attracted 10 teams with 82 participants submitting innovative solutions. The best-performing methods for each individual metric achieved 90.26\% mDSC, 38.88 mHD, and 32.85 ms RT, respectively. FUGC establishes a standardized benchmark for cervical segmentation, demonstrates the efficacy of semi-supervised methods with limited labeled data, and provides a foundation for AI-assisted clinical PTB risk assessment.</description>

      <title>THOR: A Versatile Foundation Model for Earth Observation Climate and Society Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current Earth observation foundation models are architecturally rigid, struggle with heterogeneous sensors and are constrained to fixed patch sizes. This limits their deployment in real-world scenarios requiring flexible computeaccuracy trade-offs. We propose THOR, a "computeadaptive" foundation model that solves both input heterogeneity and deployment rigidity. THOR is the first architecture to unify data from Copernicus Sentinel-1, -2, and -3 (OLCI &amp; SLSTR) satellites, processing their native 10 m to 1000 m resolutions in a single model. We pre-train THOR with a novel randomized patch and input image size strategy. This allows a single set of pre-trained weights to be deployed at inference with any patch size, enabling a dynamic trade-off between computational cost and feature resolution without retraining. We pre-train THOR on THOR Pretrain, a new, large-scale multi-sensor dataset and demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on downstream benchmarks, particularly in data-limited regimes like the PANGAEA 10% split, validating that THOR's flexible feature generation excels for diverse climate and society applications.</description>

      <title>Phi-SegNet: Phase-Integrated Supervision for Medical Image Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning has substantially advanced medical image segmentation, yet achieving robust generalization across diverse imaging modalities and anatomical structures remains a major challenge. A key contributor to this limitation lies in how existing architectures, ranging from CNNs to Transformers and their hybrids, primarily encode spatial information while overlooking frequency-domain representations that capture rich structural and textural cues. Although few recent studies have begun exploring spectral information at the feature level, supervision-level integration of frequency cues-crucial for fine-grained object localization-remains largely untapped. To this end, we propose Phi-SegNet, a CNN-based architecture that incorporates phase-aware information at both architectural and optimization levels. The network integrates Bi-Feature Mask Former (BFMF) modules that blend neighboring encoder features to reduce semantic gaps, and Reverse Fourier Attention (RFA) blocks that refine decoder outputs using phase-regularized features. A dedicated phase-aware loss aligns these features with structural priors, forming a closed feedback loop that emphasizes boundary precision. Evaluated on five public datasets spanning X-ray, US, histopathology, MRI, and colonoscopy, Phi-SegNet consistently achieved state-of-the-art performance, with an average relative improvement of 1.54+/-1.26% in IoU and 0.98+/-0.71% in F1-score over the next best-performing model. In cross-dataset generalization scenarios involving unseen datasets from the known domain, Phi-SegNet also exhibits robust and superior performance, highlighting its adaptability and modality-agnostic design. These findings demonstrate the potential of leveraging spectral priors in both feature representation and supervision, paving the way for generalized segmentation frameworks that excel in fine-grained object localization.</description>

      <title>VHU-Net: Variational Hadamard U-Net for Body MRI Bias Field Correction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19181v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bias field artifacts in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans introduce spatially smooth intensity inhomogeneities that degrade image quality and hinder downstream analysis. To address this challenge, we propose a novel variational Hadamard U-Net (VHU-Net) for effective body MRI bias field correction. The encoder comprises multiple convolutional Hadamard transform blocks (ConvHTBlocks), each integrating convolutional layers with a Hadamard transform (HT) layer. Specifically, the HT layer performs channel-wise frequency decomposition to isolate low-frequency components, while a subsequent scaling layer and semi-soft thresholding mechanism suppress redundant high-frequency noise. To compensate for the HT layer's inability to model inter-channel dependencies, the decoder incorporates an inverse HT-reconstructed transformer block, enabling global, frequency-aware attention for the recovery of spatially consistent bias fields. The stacked decoder ConvHTBlocks further enhance the capacity to reconstruct the underlying ground-truth bias field. Building on the principles of variational inference, we formulate a new evidence lower bound (ELBO) as the training objective, promoting sparsity in the latent space while ensuring accurate bias field estimation. Comprehensive experiments on body MRI datasets demonstrate the superiority of VHU-Net over existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of intensity uniformity. Moreover, the corrected images yield substantial downstream improvements in segmentation accuracy. Our framework offers computational efficiency, interpretability, and robust performance across multi-center datasets, making it suitable for clinical deployment.</description>

      <title>An Efficient Quality Metric for Video Frame Interpolation Based on Motion-Field Divergence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01361v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Video frame interpolation is a fundamental tool for temporal video enhancement, but existing quality metrics struggle to evaluate the perceptual impact of interpolation artefacts effectively. Metrics like PSNR, SSIM and LPIPS ignore temporal coherence. State-of-the-art quality metrics tailored towards video frame interpolation, like FloLPIPS, have been developed but suffer from computational inefficiency that limits their practical application. We present $\text{PSNR}_{\text{DIV}}$, a novel full-reference quality metric that enhances PSNR through motion divergence weighting, a technique adapted from archival film restoration where it was developed to detect temporal inconsistencies. Our approach highlights singularities in motion fields which is then used to weight image errors. Evaluation on the BVI-VFI dataset (180 sequences across multiple frame rates, resolutions and interpolation methods) shows $\text{PSNR}_{\text{DIV}}$ achieves statistically significant improvements: +0.09 Pearson Linear Correlation Coefficient over FloLPIPS, while being 2.5$\times$ faster and using 4$\times$ less memory. Performance remains consistent across all content categories and are robust to the motion estimator used. The efficiency and accuracy of $\text{PSNR}_{\text{DIV}}$ enables fast quality evaluation and practical use as a loss function for training neural networks for video frame interpolation tasks. An implementation of our metric is available at www.github.com/conalld/psnr-div.</description>

      <title>Simulating Dual-Pixel Images From Ray Tracing For Depth Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11213v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many studies utilize dual-pixel (DP) sensor phase characteristics for various applications, such as depth estimation and deblurring. However, since the DP image features are entirely determined by the camera hardware, DP-depth paired datasets are very scarce, especially when performing depth estimation on customized cameras. To overcome this, studies simulate DP images using ideal optical system models. However, these simulations often violate real optical propagation laws, leading to poor generalization to real DP data. To address this, we investigate the domain gap between simulated and real DP data, and propose solutions using the Simulating DP images from ray tracing (Sdirt) scheme. The Sdirt generates realistic DP images via ray tracing and integrates them into the depth estimation training pipeline. Experimental results show that models trained with Sdirt-simulated images generalize better to real DP data. The code and collected datasets will be available at github.com/LinYark/Sdirt</description>

      <title>Emergence and Evolution of Interpretable Concepts in Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15473v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models have become the go-to method for text-to-image generation, producing high-quality images from pure noise. However, the inner workings of diffusion models is still largely a mystery due to their black-box nature and complex, multi-step generation process. Mechanistic interpretability techniques, such as Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs), have been successful in understanding and steering the behavior of large language models at scale. However, the great potential of SAEs has not yet been applied toward gaining insight into the intricate generative process of diffusion models. In this work, we leverage the SAE framework to probe the inner workings of a popular text-to-image diffusion model, and uncover a variety of human-interpretable concepts in its activations. Interestingly, we find that even before the first reverse diffusion step is completed, the final composition of the scene can be predicted surprisingly well by looking at the spatial distribution of activated concepts. Moreover, going beyond correlational analysis, we design intervention techniques aimed at manipulating image composition and style, and demonstrate that (1) in early stages of diffusion image composition can be effectively controlled, (2) in the middle stages image composition is finalized, however stylistic interventions are effective, and (3) in the final stages only minor textural details are subject to change.</description>

      <title>Attentive AV-FusionNet: Audio-Visual Quality Prediction with Hybrid Attention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16994v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel deep learning-based audio-visual quality (AVQ) prediction model that leverages internal features from state-of-the-art unimodal predictors. Unlike prior approaches that rely on simple fusion strategies, our model employs a hybrid representation that combines learned Generative Machine Listener (GML) audio features with hand-crafted Video Multimethod Assessment Fusion (VMAF) video features. Attention mechanisms capture cross-modal interactions and intra-modal relationships, yielding context-aware quality representations. A modality relevance estimator quantifies each modality's contribution per content, potentially enabling adaptive bitrate allocation. Experiments demonstrate improved AVQ prediction accuracy and robustness across diverse content types.</description>

      <title>Graph Neural Network Reveals the Local Cortical Morphology of Brain Aging in Normal Cognition and Alzheimers Disease</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10912v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Estimating brain age (BA) from T1-weighted magnetic resonance images (MRIs) provides a useful approach to map the anatomic features of brain senescence. Whereas global BA (GBA) summarizes overall brain health, local BA (LBA) can reveal spatially localized patterns of aging. Although previous studies have examined anatomical contributors to GBA, no framework has been established to compute LBA using cortical morphology. To address this gap, we introduce a novel graph neural network (GNN) that uses morphometric features (cortical thickness, curvature, surface area, gray/white matter intensity ratio and sulcal depth) to estimate LBA across the cortical surface at high spatial resolution (mean inter-vertex distance = 1.37 mm). Trained on cortical surface meshes extracted from the MRIs of cognitively normal adults (N = 14,250), our GNN identifies prefrontal and parietal association cortices as early sites of morphometric aging, in concordance with biological theories of brain aging. Feature comparison using integrated gradients reveals that morphological aging is driven primarily by changes in surface area (gyral crowns and highly folded regions) and cortical thickness (occipital lobes), with additional contributions from gray/white matter intensity ratio (frontal lobes and sulcal troughs) and curvature (sulcal troughs). In Alzheimers disease (AD), as expected, the model identifies widespread, excessive morphological aging in parahippocampal gyri and related temporal structures. Significant associations are found between regional LBA gaps and neuropsychological measures descriptive of AD-related cognitive impairment, suggesting an intimate relationship between morphological cortical aging and cognitive decline. These results highlight the ability of GNN-derived gero-morphometry to provide insights into local brain aging.</description>
