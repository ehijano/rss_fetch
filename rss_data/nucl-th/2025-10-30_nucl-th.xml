      <title>Electroweak form factors of large nuclei as BPS skyrmions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25841v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We employ the Bogomolnyi-Prasad-Sommerfield (BPS) Skyrme model within the framework of semi-classical quantization to compute both electromagnetic and neutral current form factors for heavy nuclei. Our results show excellent agreement with the experimental data for low- to moderate momentum transfer. Further, we present an analytic expression of the neutral current form factor for generic nuclei, expressed as a power series in the momentum transfer. Our method provides an alternative to existing phenomenological approaches, and is particularly relevant for precision neutrino experiments where control over model-dependent systematics is essential for probing physics beyond the Standard Model.</description>

      <title>Sub-barrier fusion enhancement due to positive Q-value four-neutron transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26072v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The influence of positive $Q$-value four-neutron transfer (PQ4NT) effects on the sub-barrier capture cross sections is systematically investigated using the empirical barrier distribution (EBD2) method. For 13 fusion reactions with $Q_{4n}&gt;0$, sustained neutron-pair transfer is found to reduce barrier heights and enhance capture cross sections at sub-barrier energies. In contrast, reactions such as $^{18}$O+$^{58}$Ni, which have $Q_{2n}&gt;0$ but $Q_{4n}&lt;0$, exhibit no enhancement due to the stalling of subsequent neutron-pair transfer after the initial 2n transfer. By incorporating PQ4NT effects into EBD2 for systems with $Q_{4n}&gt;0$, the average deviation between predicted and experimental capture cross sections (113 datasets) is significantly reduced by $22\%$. Additionally, time-dependent Hatree-Fock (TDHF) calculations confirm greater barrier reduction in $^{40}$Ca-induced reactions ($Q_{4n}&gt;0)$ compared to those induced by $^{48}$Ca.</description>

      <title>Energy Dependence of Elliptic Flow Ratio $v_{2}^{\text{PP}}$/$v_{2}^{\text{RP}}$ in Heavy-ion Collisions Using the AMPT Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26482v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a systematic study of the elliptic flow $v_2$ relative to the participant plane (PP) and reaction plane (RP) in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 7.7$-200 GeV using the AMPT model with the string melting version. The ratio $v_{2}^{\text{PP}}$/$v_{2}^{\text{RP}}$ is investigated under different hadronic cascade times (0.6 fm/$c$, 10 fm/$c$, and the maximum evolution time) and across various collision centralities. The results show that, at a fixed collision energy, the ratio exhibits negligible sensitivity to the duration of the hadronic rescattering stage, indicating that hadronic interactions have little effect on the relative difference generated by initial-state fluctuations. However, a strong energy dependence is observed, the ratio increases with beam energy and saturates above $\sqrt{s_{NN}} \approx 62.4$ GeV, a trend that persists across all centralities. These findings highlight the dominant role of the partonic phase in converting initial-state geometry fluctuations into final-state momentum anisotropy. Conversely, at lower energies, the reduced partonic interaction strength limits this conversion efficiency, weakening the system's ability to preserve the initial geometric information. Our results suggest that the conversion of initial geometric fluctuations into final momentum anisotropy requires sufficient partonic interactions.</description>

      <title>One-pion exchange potential in a strong magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive the one-pion exchange potential (OPEP) in the presence of a homogeneous magnetic field using chiral perturbation theory with nonrelativistic nucleons. Our approach is applicable not only to weak magnetic fields but also to strong ones up to around the pion-mass scale. The Green's function of charged pions is modified by the magnetic field, leading to changes in the nuclear force. By numerically evaluating the modified OPEP incorporating its spin and isospin dependencies, we show that the range of the potential decreases in both directions parallel and perpendicular to the magnetic field as the field strength increases. We also compute the resulting energy shift of the deuteron due to the modified OPEP, which can reach the order of 1 MeV around $|eB| = m_\pi^2$, which is comparable to the deuteron binding energy.</description>

      <title>Deriving a parton shower for jet thermalization in QCD plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25837v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Jet quenching - the modification of high-energy jets in the quark-gluon plasma - has been extensively studied through weakly coupled scattering amplitudes embedded in parton-shower frameworks. These models, often combined with bulk hydrodynamic evolution, successfully describe a wide range of observables, though they typically rely on assumptions of rapid thermalization and simplified treatments of medium response. Parallel to these developments, jet thermalization has been investigated within the finite-temperature QCD effective kinetic theory, which provides our best microscopic understanding of equilibration in heavy-ion collisions. Early studies of linearized perturbations have highlighted both the promise and the limitations of current approaches, as existing MC implementations face challenges - particularly in the treatment of recoils and particle merging. Building on this foundation, we introduce a new parton-shower algorithm that exactly reproduces the dynamics of the linearized EKT, enabling a first-principles description of jet thermalization with proper inclusion of recoils, holes, quantum statistics, and merging processes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.26237v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel saturation and leading order collinear factorization based Monte-Carlo implementation of the EKRT model for computing QCD matter initial states in high-energy nuclear collisions. As new features the MC implementation gives a full 3-dimensional initial state event-by-event, introduces new event-by-event fluctuating spatially dependent nuclear parton distribution functions, includes dynamical fluctuations in minijet production and saturation, and accounts for the energy-momentum and valence-quark number conservation.</description>

      <title>Close encounters with attractors of the third kind</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26599v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report on the existence of a hydrodynamic attractor in the Mueller-Israel-Stewart framework of a fluid living in the novel geometry discovered recently by Grozdanov. This geometry, corresponding to a hyperbolic slicing of dS$_3\times\mathbb{R}$, complements previous analyses of attractors in Bjorken (flat slicing) and Gubser (spherical slicing) flows. The fluid behaves like a sharply localized droplet propagating rapidly along the lightcone, reminiscent of wounded nuclei in the CGC picture. Typical solutions approach the hydrodynamic attractor rapidly at late times despite a Knudsen number exceeding unity, suggesting that the inverse Reynolds number captures hydrodynamization more faithfully since the shear stress vanishes at late times. This is in stark contrast to Gubser flow, which has both the Knudsen and inverse Reynolds number becoming small for intermediate times. We close with a comparison to Weyl-transformed Bjorken flow and discuss possible phenomenological applications.</description>

      <title>Moments of parton distributions functions of the pion from lattice QCD using gradient flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26738v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a nonperturbative determination of the pion valence parton distribution function (PDF) moment ratios $\left\langle x^{n-1} \right\rangle / \left\langle x \right\rangle$ up to $n=6$, using the gradient flow in lattice QCD. As a testing ground, we employ SU($3$) isosymmetric gauge configurations generated by the OpenLat initiative with a pseudoscalar mass of $m_\pi \simeq 411~\text{MeV}$. Our analysis uses four lattice spacings and a nonperturbatively improved action, enabling full control over the continuum extrapolation, and the limit of vanishing flow time, $t\to0$. The flowed ratios exhibit O($a^2$) scaling across the ensembles, and the continuum-extrapolated results, matched to the $\overline {\text{MS}}$ scheme at $\mu = 2$ GeV using next-to-next-to-leading order matching coefficients, show only mild residual flow-time dependence. The resulting ratios, computed with a relatively small number of configurations, are consistent with phenomenological expectations for the pion's valence distribution, with statistical uncertainties that are competitive with modern global fits. These findings demonstrate that the gradient flow provides an efficient and systematically improvable method to access partonic quantities from first principles. Future extensions of this work will target lighter pion masses toward the physical point, and applications to nucleon structure such as the proton PDFs and the gluon and sea-quark distributions.</description>

      <title>Determination of the initial condition for the Balitsky-Kovchegov equation with transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26779v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the high-energy limit of QCD, scattering off nucleons and nuclei can be described in terms of Wilson-line correlators whose energy dependence is perturbative. The energy dependence of the two-point correlator, called the dipole amplitude, is governed by the Balitsky-Kovchegov (BK) equation. The initial condition for the BK equation can be fitted to the experimental data, which requires evolving the dipole amplitude for a large set of different parameter values. In this work, we train a transformer model to learn the energy dependence of the dipole amplitude, skipping the time-consuming numerical evaluation of the BK equation. The transformer predicts the learned dipole amplitude and the leading order inclusive deep inelastic scattering cross section very accurately, allowing for efficient fitting of the initial condition to the experimental data. Using this setup, we fit the initial condition of the BK equation to the inclusive deep inelastic scattering data from HERA and consider two different starting points $x_0$ for the evolution. We find better agreement with the experimental data for a smaller $x_0$. This work paves the way for future studies involving global fits of the dipole amplitude at leading order and beyond.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.23061v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We build upon the recently formulated guiding-center kinetic theory for guiding-center plasma by incorporating spin degrees of freedom in the presence of electromagnetic fields. This approach yields a streamlined set of equations for guiding-center ideal hydrodynamics with spin--fewer than those in traditional spin hydrodynamics--owing to a restriction on motion perpendicular to the magnetic field. We propose that this framework offers a promising tool to comprehending how matter behaves under the influence of intense magnetic fields, such as spin polarization effects observed in experimental measurements.</description>

      <title>Contact potentials in presence of a regular finite-range interaction using dimensional regularization and the $N/D$ method</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.01461v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We solve the Lippman-Schwinger equation (LSE) with a kernel that includes a regular finite-range potential and additional contact terms with derivatives. We employ distorted wave theory and dimensional regularization, as proposed in Physics Letters B 568 (2003) 109. We analyze the spin singlet nucleon-nucleon $S-$wave as case of study, with the regular one-pion exchange (OPE) potential in this partial wave and up to ${\cal O}(Q^6)$ (six derivatives) contact interactions. We discuss in detail the renormalization of the LSE, and show that the scattering amplitude solution of the LSE fulfills exact elastic unitarity and inherits the left-hand cut of the long-distance OPE amplitude. Furthermore, we proof that the LSE amplitude coincides with that obtained from the exact $N/D$ calculation, with the appropriate number and typology of subtractions to reproduce the effective range parameters taken as input to renormalize the LSE amplitude. The generalization to higher number of derivatives is straightforward.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.13302v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we extend the method of Kadanoff-Baym equations for open quantum systems to arbitrary kinds of systems and heat baths, either fermionic or bosonic. This includes three spacial dimensions and different potentials for the system-bath interaction or external traps. We study the quantum-mechanical formation of bound states in one and also in three dimensions with the full Kadanoff-Baym equations and compare them to more simplified approaches with and without memory effects. An in-depth examination of the thermodynamics of open systems is performed, showing perfect equilibration of the system's degrees of freedom along with a comprehensive investigation of the influence of the heat bath on the system's wave functions. The formation time, decay time and regeneration of bound states and their dependence on the temperature and coupling strength is explored
  We evaluate the non-equilibrium Kadanoff-Baym equations for the system particles, assuming that interactions are elastic two-particle collisions with the heat-bath particles. Finally, we describe in detail the method used to numerically solve the corresponding spatially heterogeneous integro-differential equations for the set of one-particle Green's functions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07776v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper aims to serve as an introductory resource for disseminating the concept of instanton liquid model to individuals with interests in quantum chromodynamics (QCD) for hadrons. We discuss several topological aspects of the QCD vacuum and briefly review recent progress on this intuitive unifying framework for the lowlying hadron physics rooted in QCD by introducing the vacuum as a liquid of pseudoparticles. We develop systematic density expansion on the dilute vacuum with diagrammatical Feynman rules to calculate the vacuum expectation values (VEVs) and generalize the calculations to hadronic matrix element (charges), and hadronic form factors using the instanton liquid model (ILM). The ILM prediction are well-consistent with those of recent lattice QCD calculations. Thereby, the nonperturbative physics can be well-controlled by only a few parameters: instanton size $\rho$ and instanton density $n_{I+A}$, and current quark mass $m$.</description>

      <title>Digital quantum simulations of scattering in quantum field theories using W states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03111v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: High-energy particle collisions can convert energy into matter through the inelastic production of new particles. Quantum computers are an ideal platform for simulating the out-of-equilibrium dynamics of collisions and the formation of subsequent many-particle states. In this work, evidence for inelastic particle production is observed in one-dimensional Ising field theory using IBM's quantum computers. The scattering experiment is performed on 104 qubits of ibm_marrakesh and uses up to 5,589 two-qubit gates to access the post-collision dynamics. An outgoing heavy particle produced in the collision is identified from the skewness of the measured energy density. Integral to this computation is a new quantum algorithm for preparing the initial state (wavepackets) of a quantum field theory scattering simulation. This method efficiently prepares wavepackets by extending recent protocols for creating W states with mid-circuit measurement and feedforward. The required circuit depth is independent of wavepacket size and spatial dimension, representing a superexponential improvement over previous methods. Our wavepacket preparation algorithm can be applied to a wide range of lattice models and is demonstrated in one-dimensional Ising field theory, scalar field theory, the Schwinger model and two-dimensional Ising field theory.</description>
