      <title>BlackTHUNDER strikes twice: rest-frame Balmer-line absorption and high Eddington accretion rate in a Little Red Dot at $z=7.04$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: JWST spectroscopy has revealed a population of compact objects at redshifts $z=2$-9 with `v'-shaped spectral energy distributions, broad permitted lines, and, often, hydrogen Balmer absorption. Among these `Little Red Dots' (LRDs), Abell2744-QSO1 at $z=7.04$ has been confirmed to have time-variable equivalent width (EW) in its broad emission lines, confirming its AGN nature. We extend the analysis of NIRSpec/IFS data from the BlackTHUNDER survey to the H$\alpha$ line. The broad-line profile in Abell2744-QSO1 is manifestly non-Gaussian, requiring at least two Gaussian components with full width at half maximum FWHM=$450\pm50$ and $1800\pm100$ km s$^{-1}$. Crucially, we also detect a narrow-line Gaussian component, and strong H$\alpha$ absorption (EW relative to the continuum $\approx 30^{+15}_{-9}$ A), confirming a connection between the strong Balmer break and line absorption. The absorber is at rest with respect to broad H$\alpha$, suggesting that the gas cannot be interpreted as an inflow or outflow, forming instead a long-lived structure. Its velocity dispersion is $\sigma_{abs} = 100\pm10$ km s$^{-1}$, consistent with the value inferred from the analysis of the Balmer break. Based on H$\alpha$, we infer a black hole mass of log(M$_{BH}$/M$_\odot$)=6.3-6.7, 0.9-1.3 dex smaller than previous estimates based on H$\beta$. The Eddington ratio is 0.7-1.6. Combining the high signal-to-noise ratio of the narrow H$\alpha$ line with the spectral resolution R=3,700 of the G395H grating, we infer a narrow-line dispersion $\sigma_n = 22^{+5}_{-6}$ km s$^{-1}$, which places a stringent constraint on the black-hole-to-dynamical-mass ratio of this system to be M$_{BH}$/M$_{dyn}$&gt;0.02-0.4. If M$_{BH}$ is near the low-mass end of our estimates, the SMBH would be accreting at a super-Eddington rate. Alternatively, at the high-M$_{BH}$ end, there would be minimal room for a host galaxy.</description>

      <title>The Chicago Carnegie Hubble Program: Improving the Calibration of SNe Ia with JWST Measurements of the Tip of the Red Giant Branch</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11769v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present distances to ten supernova (SN) host galaxies determined via the red giant branch tip (TRGB) using JWST/NIRCAM and the F115W, F356W, and F444W bandpasses. Our analysis, including photometric catalog cleaning, adoption of disk light profiles, TRGB color slope estimation, and a novel technique for identifying the infrared TRGB, was conducted blinded. The new F115W TRGB distances agree well with our previously derived HST TRGB distances, differing by only 1 percent on average and 4 percent on a per-galaxy basis. The color-corrected F115W TRGB is therefore equally precise a method of distance measurement as, and offers unique advantages over, its color-insensitive, I-band counterpart. Using these distances, we update the absolute calibrations of eleven calibrator SNe, yielding 68.4 &lt; H0 &lt; 69.6 km/s/Mpc depending on which of four sets of SN magnitudes are used. We expand the sample of calibrator SNe to 24 by combining with HST TRGB distances. Doing so increases our H0 estimate based on the Carnegie Supernova Project II (CSP-II) by 0.8 km/s/Mpc (1.4 sigma) demonstrating that our JWST H0 based on 11 SNe is not significantly biased toward lower values. In contrast, the Pantheon+ calibration shifts higher by +2 km/s/Mpc (3.1 sigma), a significantly larger increase than seen in both the CSP and the Pantheon team's own SuperCal analysis. More JWST observations of the TRGB as well as independent analyses of low-redshift SNe are needed to continue unraveling the true nature of the Hubble Tension.</description>

      <title>Impacts of the Metagalactic Ultraviolet Background on Circumgalactic Medium Absorption Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11775v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Among the many different pieces of physics that go into simulations of the circumgalactic medium (CGM), the metagalactic ultraviolet background (UVB) plays a significant role in determining the ionization state of different metal species. However, the UVB is uncertain with multiple models having been developed by various research groups over the past several decades. In this work, we examine how different UVB models influence the ionic column densities of CGM absorbers. We use these UVB models to infer ion number densities in the FOGGIE galaxy simulations at $z=2.5$ and use the Synthetic Absorption Line Surveyor Application (SALSA) package to identify absorbers. Absorbers are then matched across UVB models based on their line of sight position so that their column densities can be compared. From our analysis, we find that changing the UVB model produces significant changes in ionization, specifically at lower gas densities and higher temperatures where photoionization dominates over collisional ionization. We also find that the scatter of column density differences between models tends to increase with increasing ionization energy, with the exception of \hi, which has the highest scatter of all species we examined.</description>

      <title>The role of Massive Black Holes in merging star clusters: dynamical evolution, stellar &amp; compact object ejections and gravitational waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11813v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Star clusters can interact and merge in galactic discs, halos, or centers. We present direct N-body simulations of binary mergers of star clusters with $M_{\star} = 2.7 \times 10^4 \: \mathrm{M_{\odot}}$ each, using the N-body code BIFROST with subsystem regularisation and post-Newtonian dynamics. We include 500 $\mathrm{M_{\odot}}$ massive black holes (MBHs) in the progenitors to investigate their impact on remnant evolution. The MBHs form hard binaries interacting with stars and stellar black holes (BHs). A few Myr after the cluster merger, this produces sizable populations of runaway stars ($\sim$800 with $v_{\mathrm{ej}} \gtrsim 50 \mathrm{kms^{-1}}$) and stellar BHs ($\sim$30) escaping within 100 Myr. The remnants lose $\sim30\%$ of their BH population and $\sim3\%$ of their stars, with $\sim$30 stars accelerated to high velocities $\gtrsim 300 \mathrm{kms^{-1}}$. Comparison simulations of isolated clusters with central hard MBH binaries and cluster mergers without MBHs show that the process is driven by MBH binaries, while those with a single 1000 $\mathrm{M_{\odot}}$ MBH in isolated or merging clusters produce fewer runaway stars at lower velocities. Low-eccentricity merger orbits yield rotating remnants ($v_{\mathrm{rot}} \sim 3 \mathrm{kms^{-1}}$) , but probing the presence of MBHs via kinematics alone remains challenging. We expect the binary MBHs to merge within a Hubble time, producing observable gravitational-wave (GW) events detectable by future GW detectors such as the Einstein Telescope and LISA. The results suggest that interactions with low-mass MBH binaries formed in merging star clusters are an important additional channel for producing runaway and high-velocity stars, free-floating stellar BHs and compact objects.</description>

      <title>A spectroscopic map of the Galactic centre -- Observations and resolved stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11856v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Galactic Centre region contains a dense accumulation of stars, which can be separated into two components: A flattened and dense nuclear star cluster (NSC), and a surrounding, more extended and more flattened, nuclear stellar disc (NSD). Previous studies have collected a few thousand spectra of the inner NSC, and also the outer NSD, and measured line-of-sight velocities and metallicities. Until now, such measurements exist only for a few 100 stars in the region where the stellar surface density transitions from being dominated by the NSC into being dominated by the NSD. We want to study the stellar population from the centre of the NSC out to well beyond its effective radius, where the NSD dominates. We investigate whether and how the mean properties and kinematics of the stars change systematically. We conducted spectroscopic observations with Flamingos-2 in the K-band via a continuous slit-scan. The data extend from the central NSC into the inner NSD, out to 32 pc from Sgr A* along Galactic longitude l. Based on their CO equivalent width, we classify the stars as hot or cool stars. The former are massive, young stars, while almost all of the latter are older than one to a few Gyr. We measure the overall metallicity [M/H] and line-of-sight velocity for &gt;2,500 cool stars, and present the first continuous spatial maps and profiles of the mean value of various stellar and kinematic parameters. We identify hot, young stars across the field of view. Some stars appear to be isolated, while others accumulate near the Quintuplet cluster or the central parsec cluster. The position-velocity curve of the cool stars shows no dependence on [M/H], but it depends on the colour of the stars. The colour may be a tracer of the line-of-sight distance and thus distinguish stars located in the NSC from those in the NSD. [abridged]</description>

      <title>The Critical Role of Dust On The [O III] Planetary Nebula Luminosity Function's Bright-End Cutoff</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11977v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine the relationship between circumnebular extinction and core mass for sets of [O III]-bright planetary nebulae (PNe) in the Large Magellanic Cloud and M31. We confirm that for PNe within one magnitude of the Planetary Nebula Luminosity Function's (PNLF's) bright-end cutoff magnitude (M*), higher core-mass PNe are disproportionally affected by greater circumnebular extinction. We show that this result can explain why the PNLF cutoff is so insensitive to population age. In younger populations, the higher-mass, higher-luminosity cores experience greater circumnebular extinction from the dust created by their AGB progenitors compared to the lower-mass cores. We further show that when our core-mass-nebular extinction law is combined with post-AGB stellar evolutionary models, the result is a large range of population ages where the brightest PNe all have nearly identical [O III] luminosities. Finally, we note that while there is some uncertainty about whether the oldest stellar populations can produce planetary nebulae as bright as M*, this issue is resolved if the initial-final mass relation (IFMR) for the lowest-mass stars results in slightly more massive cores, as observed in some clusters. Alternatively, introducing a small amount of intrinsic scatter (0.022 Msun) into the IFMR also addresses this uncertainty.</description>

      <title>A molecule-rich torus-like structure in the 21 $\mu$m source IRAS 23304+6147</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A long-standing enigma in observational astronomy is the identification of the so-called 21 $\mu$m feature in a subset of envelopes of post-asymptotic giant branch (post-AGB) stars. Identifying this transient feature is important for understanding the chemical processes during the brief post-AGB phase and the enrichment of the interstellar medium. Understanding the structures and chemical environments of these objects is a prerequisite for such an endeavor. We investigate the structure of the circumstellar envelope and the spatial distribution of gas-phase molecules in the 21 $\mu$m source IRAS 23304+6147, aiming to explor the potential physicochemical conditions required for the emergence of the 21 $\mu$m feature. Molecular line observations toward IRAS 23304+6147 at the 1.3 mm band were performed using the Northern Extended Millimeter Array. A morpho-kinematic model was built to reproduce the observed $^{13}$CO images and to decipher the structures of the nebula. The imaging results reveal an elliptically elongated shell with an equatorial density enhancement (or a torus-like structure),and in detail how the various molecules distribute in the envelope. The nebular morphology points to a binary system in which the ultraviolet radiation from the companion may trigger photochemistry in the inner regions. The torus-like structure exhibits an enrichment of linear carbon-chain molecules and a depletion of silicon-bearing molecules. The chemically stratified structure of $^{13}$CN, HC$_3$N, and C$_4$H represents an observational evidence of the internal radiation that initiates photochemistry. The carbon-rich torus-like structure probably offers a conducive environment for the formation of dust and complex molecules implicated in the rare 21 $\mu$m emission.</description>

      <title>Metallicity dependence of the CO-to-H$_2$ and the [CI]-to-H$_2$ conversion factors in galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the molecular gas content in the interstellar medium (ISM) is crucial for studying star formation and galaxy evolution. The CO-to-H$_2$ ($X_{\rm CO}$) and the [CI]-to-H$_2$ ($X_{\rm CI}$) conversion factors are widely used to estimate the molecular mass content in galaxies. However, these factors depend on many ISM environmental parameters. This work investigates the dependence of $X_{\rm CO}$ and $X_{\rm CI}$ on these parameters, with a focus on the low-metallicity $\alpha$-enhanced ISM ($\rm [C/O]&lt;0$), to provide improved tracers of molecular gas in diverse conditions. We used the PDFchem algorithm, coupled with a database of 3D-PDR models. These account for a wide range of metallicities, dust-to-gas mass ratios, FUV intensities, and cosmic-ray ionization rates. The conversion factors were computed by integrating the PDR properties over log-normal column density distributions ($A_{\rm V}$-PDFs) representing various cloud types. The $X_{\rm CO}$ factor increases significantly with decreasing metallicity, exceeding $\sim\!\!1000$ times the Galactic value at ${\rm [O/H] = -1.0}$ under $\alpha$-enhanced conditions, as opposed to $\sim\!\!300$ times under non-$\alpha$-enhanced conditions (${\rm [C/O]=0}$). In contrast, $X_{\rm CI}$ shows a more gradual variation with metallicity, making it a more reliable tracer of molecular gas in metal-poor environments under most conditions. The fraction of `CO-dark' molecular gas increases dramatically in low-metallicity regions, exceeding 90\% at ${\rm [O/H] = -1.0}$, particularly in diffuse clouds and environments with strong FUV radiation fields. We recommend the use of the $\log_{10}X_{\rm CO}\simeq-2.41Z+41.3$ relation for the CO-to-H$_2$ conversion factor, and the $\log_{10}X_{\rm CI}\simeq-0.99Z+29.7$ relation for the [CI]-to-H$_2$, where $Z=12+\log_{10}({\rm O/H})$.</description>

      <title>Inversely synthesizing the core mass function of high-mass star-forming regions from the canonical initial mass function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12251v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many studies have revealed that the core mass function (CMF) in high-mass star-forming regions is top-heavy. In this work, we start from the canonical initial mass function (IMF) to inversely synthesize the observed CMFs of high-mass star formation regions, taking into account variations in multiplicity and mass conversion efficiency from core to star ($\epsilon_{\rm core}$). To match the observed CMFs, cores of different masses should have varying $\epsilon_{\rm core}$, with $\epsilon_{\rm core}$ increasing as the core mass decreases. However, the multiplicity fraction does not affect the synthesized CMFs. To accurately fit the high-mass end of the CMF, it is essential to determine whether the CMF shows a slope transition from the low-mass end to the high-mass one. If the CMF truly undergoes a slope transition but observational biases obscure it, leading to a combined fit with a shallower slope, this could artificially create a top-heavy CMF.</description>

      <title>Gas Transfer Between the Inner 3-kpc Disk and the Galactic Central Molecular Zone</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12313v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We uncovered a more tilted molecular gas structure with highly negative velocities located near the dust lane. Our observations also show that the approaching gas flows from the overshoot process are captured by the bar gravitational and then flows towards the Galactic Central Molecular Zone (CMZ) through the bar channel. The recycling gas from the overshoot effect, in conjunction with freshly accreted gas from the inner 3-kpc disk, accumulates significantly near R_GC~1/2R_bar and R_GC~2/3R_bar regions by adopting a bar length of ~3.2--3.4kpc. Importantly, within these regions, there are frequent collisions and substantial angular momentum exchanges between gas flows with different trajectories. In this scenario, the DISSIPATION processes arising from interactions between colliding flows, together with the varying torques induced by the non-axisymmetric bar, effectively transfer the angular momentum of viscous gas outward, thereby driving the molecular gas to settle into the CMZ within ~3 orbital periods. A long-term gas inflow with an average rate of &gt;1.1Msun/yr, coupled with intense transient accretion events that exceed the average rate by several times due to the overshoot effect, significantly regulates the gas distribution, physical properties, and dynamical evolution of the CMZ. These findings provide robust observational evidence for elucidating the intricate dynamics of molecular gas flows towards the CMZ. Our results show that gas dynamics has a significant impact on the secular evolution of both the Milky Way and the extragalactic gas-rich galaxies.</description>

      <title>Ring or no ring -- Revisiting the Multiphase Nuclear Environment in M31</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nuclear rings, prevalent in barred galaxies, are essential to understanding gas transport toward galactic nuclei. However, the peculiar nuclear ring in our neighboring galaxy M31 remains poorly understood. Here we present a comprehensive study of this multiphase gas structure, originally revealed by its dust emission, based on newly acquired CO mappings and archival spectroscopic imaging of atomic hydrogen and warm ionized gas, along with custom numerical simulations. These multi-wavelength data offer an unprecedented view of the surface mass density and kinematics of the nuclear ring, challenging the notion of it being a single coherent structure. In particular, the ring shows significant asymmetry in its azimuthal mass distribution, with neutral gas concentrated in the northeast and ionized gas prominent in the southwest. The observed off-centered and lopsided morphology disfavors an interpretation of gas streamers or resonance rings driven solely by a barred potential known to exist in M31. Furthermore, the ring's line-of-sight velocity distribution suggests circular motion in a plane inclined by $\sim 30^\circ$ relative to M31's outer disk, implying external torque likely from M32's recent close-in passage. Our hydrodynamical simulations tracking the evolution of nuclear gas of M31 influenced by both a barred potential and an oblique collision with M32, reveal the natural formation of asymmetric spiral arms several hundred Myr after the collision, which could appear ring-like under appropriate viewing angles. Therefore, we suggest that M31's nuclear gas structure, instead of being a persisting rotating ring, comprises recently formed, asymmetric spirals with a substantial tilt.</description>

      <title>Strengthening the Link Between Fullerenes and a Subset of Diffuse Interstellar Bands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A debate persists regarding the correlation between the DIBs 9577 and 9632 \r{A}, and whether they share a common molecular carrier (i.e., C$_{60}^{+}$). A robust high correlation determination emerges after bridging the baseline across an order of magnitude ($\simeq 50 - 700$ m\r{A}, $r=0.93\pm0.02$), and nearly doubling the important higher equivalent width domain by adding new Mg II-corrected sightlines. Moreover, additional evidence is presented of possible DIB linkages to fullerenes, whereby attention is drawn to DIBs at 7470.38, 7558.44, and 7581.47 \r{A}, which match the Campbell experimental results for C$_{70}^{+}$ within 1 \r{A}, and the same is true of 6926.48 and 7030.26 \r{A} for C$_{70}^{2+}$. Yet their current correlation uncertainties are unsatisfactory and exacerbated by expectedly low EWs (e.g., $\overline{EW}=4$ m\r{A} for 6926.48 \r{A}), and thus further observations are required to assess whether they represent a bona fide connection or numerical coincidence.</description>

      <title>The HASHTAG project II. Giant molecular cloud properties across the M31 disc</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12513v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a study of giant molecular cloud (GMC) properties in the Andromeda galaxy (M31) using CO(3-2) data from the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT) in selected regions across the disc and in the nuclear ring, and comparing them with CO(1-0) observations from the IRAM 30m telescope in the same regions. We find that GMCs in the centre of M31 generally exhibit larger velocity dispersions ($\sigma$) and sizes ($R$) compared to those in the disc, while their average surface density ($\Sigma$) and turbulent pressure ($P_{\rm turb}$) are lower. This low turbulent pressure in the central region is primarily due to the low density of molecular gas. The estimated GMC properties depend on the choice of CO transitions. Compared to CO(1-0), CO(3-2) exhibits smaller velocity dispersion and equivalent radius but higher surface density. These differences highlight the distinct physical conditions probed by different molecular gas tracers. We estimate the virial parameter $\alpha_{\rm vir}\propto \sigma^2 R/\Sigma$ and find that most molecular clouds exhibit high values ($\alpha_{\rm vir} \sim 4-6$) for both CO transitions, indicating that they are unbound. Furthermore, clouds in the nuclear ring display even larger $\alpha_{\rm vir}$ values of $\lesssim 100$, suggesting that they may be highly dynamic, short-lived structures, although they could potentially achieve equilibrium under the external pressure exerted by the surrounding interstellar medium.</description>

      <title>First detections of CO absorption in the Magellanic Clouds and direct measurement of the CO-to-H$_2$ ratio</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Molecular hydrogen (H$_2$) is by far the most abundant molecule in the Universe. However, due to the low emissivity of H$_2$, carbon monoxide (CO) is widely used instead to trace molecular gas in galaxies. The relative abundances of these molecules is expected to depend on both physical (e.g., density) and chemical (e.g., metal enrichment) properties of the gas, making direct measurements in diverse environments crucial. We present a systematic search for CO in absorption toward 34 stars behind H$_2$ gas in the Magellanic Clouds using the Hubble Space Telescope. We report the first two definitive detections of CO absorption in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) and one in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC), along with stringent upper limits for the remaining sightlines. Non-detections of CO are consistent with models of low thermal pressures and/or low metallicities while detections at the lower metallicities of the Magellanic Clouds require higher thermal pressures, $P_{\rm th}=10^5-10^6$$\,$K$\,$cm$^{-3}$ than detections the Milky Way at similar $N({\rm H_2})$. Notably, the high density derived from the rotational excitation of CO towards SK$\,$143 in the SMC suggests full molecularization of CO in the absorbing cloud, with CO/H$_2 = 8.3^{+2.0}_{-1.6}\times10^{-5}$ consistent with the standard ratio ($3.2\times10^{-4}$) measured in dense molecular gas in the Milky Way, scaled to the SMC's $0.2\,Z_{\odot}$ metallicity.</description>

      <title>The Morphology and Kinematics of a Giant, Symmetric Nebula Around a Radio-Loud Quasar 3C$\,$57: Extended Rotating Gas or Biconical Outflows?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gas flows between galaxies and the CGM play a crucial role in galaxy evolution. When ionized by a quasar, these gas flows can be directly traced as giant nebulae. We present a study of a giant nebula around a radio-loud quasar, 3C$\,$57 at $z\approx0.672$. Observations from MUSE reveal that the nebula is elongated with a major axis of $70 \, \rm kpc$ and a minor axis of $40 \, \rm kpc$. The nebula displays an approximately symmetric blueshifted-redshifted pattern along the major axis and multi-component emission features in its $\rm[O\,II]$ and $\rm [O\,III]$ profiles. The morphology and kinematics can be explained as rotating gas or biconical outflow, both of which qualitatively reproduce the observed position-velocity diagram. The 3C$\,$57 nebula is significantly more kinematically disturbed, with $\rm W_{80}$ (the line width encompassing 80$\%$ of the flux) of approximately $300{-}400\,\rm km\,s^{-1}$, compared to $\rm H\,I$ gas in local early-type galaxies, which typically shows $\rm W_{80} \approx 50\,\rm km\,s^{-1}$. This velocity dispersion is comparable to the gas in cool-core clusters despite originating in a group 100 times less massive. For biconical outflow models, the inferred $10{-}20^{\circ}$ inclination angle is in tension with the unobscured nature of the quasar, as the dusty torus is expected to be perpendicular to the outflow. Neither a quiescent rotating gas origin nor a biconical outflow fully reproduces the observed kinematics and morphology of the 3C$\,$57 nebula, suggesting a more intricate origin likely involving both rotation and AGN feedback.</description>

      <title>Line-of-sight mass estimator and the masses of the Milky Way and Andromeda Galaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12612v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The total mass of a galaxy group, such as the Milky Way (MW) and the Andromeda Galaxy (M31), is usually determined from the kinematics of the satellites within their virial zones. Bahcall and Tremaine (1981) proposed the $v^2r$ estimator as an alternative to the virial theorem. We develop this approach by taking into account the three-dimensional distribution of satellites in the system to improve the reliability and accuracy of galaxy mass estimates. Applying this method to comprehensive dataset of Local Group satellites based on recent precise distance measurements, we estimate the total mass of MW of $(7.9 \pm 2.3) \times 10^{11}$ Msun and M31 of $(1.55 \pm 0.34) \times 10^{12}$ Msun. The capability of the method is limited by the distance measurement accuracy, making it extremely useful for the Local Group, but challenging for more distant systems.</description>

      <title>FAST Ultra-Deep Survey (FUDS): the star formation histories of FUDS0 galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12857v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the ultraviolet, optical and infrared counterparts of 128 galaxies detected in neutral hydrogen (HI) in the FAST Ultra-Deep Survey (FUDS) field 0 (FUDS0). HI mass upper limits are also calculated for 134 non-detections in the field. Stellar masses ($M_*$), star formation rates (SFRs) and star formation histories are computed by fitting spectral energy distributions (SEDs) using ProSpect. The results show that HI-selected galaxies prefer recent long-lasting, but mild star formation activity, while HI non-detections have earlier and more intense star formation activity. Based on their distribution on the SFR versus $M_*$ diagram, the typical evolution of HI-selected galaxies follows three distinct stages: (i) Early stage: the total SFR increases, though the specific SFR (sSFR) decreases from 10$^{-8}$ to 10$^{-9}$ yr$^{-1}$; (ii) Mass accumulation stage: the SFR is steady, and stellar mass increase linearly with time; (iii) Quenching stage: star formation activity quenches on a rapid timescale and at constant stellar mass. 37 non-detections are located on star-forming main sequence, but are not detected in HI due to low sensitivity close to field edges or close to strong radio frequency interference. Comparisons with the existing optical, optically-selected HI, and HI catalogs show a good agreement with respect to measured $M_*$ and SFR, with minor discrepancies due to selection effects. The ongoing full FUDS survey will help us better explore the evolutionary stages of HI galaxies through a larger sample.</description>

      <title>A Sample of Low-mass AGNs Extended to z $\approx$ 0.6</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12898v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a catalog of 927 low-mass active galactic nuclei (AGNs) with black hole mass of $M_{BH}\leqslant2\times10^{6} M_{\odot}$ characterized by broad H$\alpha$ or H$\beta$ emission lines,uniformly selected from the Seventeenth Data Release (DR17) of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) spectra. Taking advantages of the wide wavelength coverage of BOSS/eBOSS spectra of the SDSS, this sample significantly extends the redshift range to $z\leqslant0.57$, a marked improvement over the previous studies which were generally limited to $z\leqslant0.35$. This sample encompasses black hole masses from $10^{3.7}$ to $10^{6.3} M_{\odot}$, with Eddington ratios ranging from 0.01 to 3.3. Preliminary analysis of this sample reveals a marked decline in maximum accretion rates (namely $L/L_{Edd}$) and broad-H$\alpha$ luminosities with decreasing redshift, analogous to the passive ``downsizing'' evolutionary trend observed in high-mass AGNs. This systematic catalog of low-redshift low-mass AGNs, the largest so far, will benefit the studies on accretion physics, AGN--galaxy connection and the origin of supermassive black holes.</description>

      <title>The Role of Large-Scale Environment in Shaping the Stellar Mass-Gas Metallicity Relation Across Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12928v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the stellar mass-gas metallicity relation (MZR) which shows a significant scatter for a fixed stellar mass. By defining global environments, nodes, filaments, and voids within the Horizon Run 5 cosmological hydrodynamical simulation, we explore when and where the enrichment of galaxies occurs, analysing key evolution parameters such as star-formation rate and changes in gas-fraction and gas-metallicity per unit time. At high redshift ($z&gt;4.5$), there are minimal deviations from the MZR due to environment, however, larger deviations emerge as redshift decreases. Low stellar mass galaxies in nodes, $M_{\star} &lt; 10^{9.8}\,\text{M}_{\odot}$, start showing deviations at $z = 3.5$, whilst other environments do not. For, $z &lt; 2$, filaments and voids begin to show deviations above and below the MZR, respectively. By $z = 0.625$, the last epoch of HR5, deviations exist for all stellar masses and environments, with a maximum value of 0.13 dex at $M_{\star} \approx 10^{9.35}\,\text{M}_{\odot}$, between the median gas metallicities of node and void galaxies. To explain this environmental variance we discuss gas accretion, AGN, ram-pressure-stripping and strangulation as regulators of $Z_{g}$. Concurrently, at high metallicities, for $z &lt; 2$, while massive galaxies in nodes show increasing $Z_{g}$ and decreasing [O/Fe], void galaxies show a turnover where $Z_{g}$ falls with decreasing [O/Fe]. This directly points to the importance of cold-gas accretion in retaining lower $Z_{g}$ in massive void galaxies for $z &lt; 2$, whilst its absence in nodes allowed $Z_{g}$ to access higher values.</description>

      <title>SISSI: Supernovae in a stratified, shearing interstellar medium -- I. The geometry of supernova remnants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12977v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aims. We introduce the SISSI (Supernovae In a Stratified, Shearing Interstellar medium) simulation suite, which aims to enable a more comprehensive understanding of supernova remnants (SNRs) evolving in a complex interstellar medium (ISM) structured under the influence of galactic rotation, gravity and turbulence. Methods. We utilize zoom-in simulations of 30 SNRs expanding in the ISM of a simulated isolated disk galaxy. The ISM of the galaxy is resolved down to a maximum resolution of $\sim 12\,\text{pc}$, while we achieve a zoomed-in resolution of $\sim 0.18\, \text{pc}$ in the vicinity of the explosion sources. We compute the time-evolution of the SNRs' geometry and compare it to the observed geometry of the Local Bubble. Results. During the early stages of evolution, SNRs are well described by existing analytical models. On longer timescales, starting at about a percent of the orbital timescale, they depart from spherical symmetry and become increasingly prolate or oblate. The timescale for the departure from spherical symmetry is shorter than the expectation from a simple model for the deformation by galactic shear, suggesting that galactic shear alone cannot explain these differences. Yet, the alignment of the minor- and major axis of the SNRs is in line with expectations from said model, indicating that the deformation might have a shear-related origin. A comparison with the geometry of the Local Bubble reveals that it might be slightly younger than previously believed, but otherwise has a standard morphology for a SNR of its age and size. Conclusions. Studying the geometry of SNRs can reveal valuable insights about the complex interactions shaping their dynamical evolution. Future studies targeting the geometry of Galactic SNRs may use this insight to obtain a clearer picture of the processes shaping the Galactic ISM.</description>

      <title>The VMC survey -- LII. The internal kinematics of the LMC with new VISTA observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13039v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context: Studying the internal kinematics of galaxies provides insights into their past evolution, current dynamics, and future trajectory. The Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), as the largest and one of the nearest satellite galaxies of the Milky Way, presents unique opportunities to investigate these phenomena in great detail. Aims: We investigate the internal kinematics of the LMC by deriving precise stellar proper motions using data from the VISTA survey of the Magellanic Clouds system (VMC). The main objective is to refine the LMC's dynamical parameters using improved proper motion measurements including one additional epoch of VISTA observations which extended the time baseline from ~ 2 to 10 years. Methods: The precision of the proper motion was significantly enhanced, reducing uncertainties from 6 mas/yr to 1.5 mas/yr. We derived geometrical and kinematic parameters, generating velocity maps and rotation curves, for both young and old stellar populations. Finally, we compared a suite of dynamical models, which simulate the interaction of the LMC with the Milky Way and Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC), against the observations. Results: The tangential rotation curve reveals an asymmetric drift between young and old stars, while the radial velocity curve for the young population shows an increasing trend within the inner bar region, suggesting non-circular orbits. We confirm the clockwise rotation around the dynamical centre of the LMC, consistent with previous predictions. A significant residual motion was detected toward the north-east of the LMC, directed away from the centre. This feature observed in the inner disk region is kinematically connected with a substructure identified in the periphery known as Eastern Substructure 1. This motion suggests a possible tidal influence from the Milky Way, combined with the effects of the recent close pericentre passage of the SMC ~150 Myr ago.</description>

      <title>CO Observations of the SMC-N66 Hii Region with ALMA: Properties of Clumps along Filamentary Molecular Clouds and Possible Expansion Motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13065v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The star-forming region N66, as a host of the majority of OB stars in the Small Magellanic Cloud, provides a unique opportunity to enhance our understanding of the triggers of high-mass star formation. We investigate the properties of the molecular cloud in N66 using the $^{12}$CO(1-0) data obtained with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array. A cloud decomposition analysis identified 165 independent cloud structures and substructures. The size-linewidth scaling relation for the entire region exhibits an index of 0.49, indicating that the region is in a state of virial equilibrium. In contrast, a detailed analysis of the central N66 region revealed a size-linewidth scaling relation with an index of 0.75, suggesting that distinct factors are influencing the dynamics of this central area. Averaging the spectra in the central N66 region revealed three distinct velocity peaks at 145, 152, and 160 $\mathrm{km \, s^{-1}}$, indicating that some kinds of interactions are occurring within the cloud. The analysis of the position-velocity diagrams in the central region revealed a ring-like structure, indicating the presence of an expanding bubble. The bubble exhibits supersonic characteristics, with an expansion velocity of $v_{\mathrm{exp}} \approx 11$ $\mathrm{km \, s^{-1}}$, and an overall systemic velocity of $v_{\mathrm{sys}}\approx $ 151 $\mathrm{km \, s^{-1}}$. The radius is estimated to be in the range of $r \approx [9.8 - 12.9] \pm 0.5$ pc and is approximately 1.2 Myr old.</description>

      <title>The Lyman alpha Sky as Observed by New Horizons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13182v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: During September 2023 the Alice ultraviolet spectrograph on the New Horizons (NH) spacecraft was used to map diffuse Lyman alpha (Lya) emission over most of the sky, at a range of 56.9 AU from the Sun. At that distance, models predict that the interplanetary medium Lya emissions result from comparable amounts of resonant backscattering of the solar Lya line by interstellar hydrogen atoms (HI) passing through the solar system, in addition to an approximately isotropic background of 30-70 R from the Local InterStellar Medium (LISM). The NH observations show no strong correlations with nearby cloud structures of the LISM or with expected structures of the heliosphere, such as a hydrogen wall associated with the heliopause. To explain the relatively bright and uniform Lya of the LISM we propose that hot, young stars within the Local Hot Bubble (LHB) shine on its interior walls, photoionizing HI atoms there. Recombination of these ions can account for the observed 50 R Lya background, after amplification of the diffuse Lya by resonant scattering, although sophisticated (i.e., 3-D) radiative transfer models should be used to confirm this conjecture. Future observations of the diffuse Lya, with instruments capable of resolving the line profile, could provide a new window on HI populations in the LISM and heliosphere. The NH Alice all-sky Lya observations presented here may be repeated at some point in the future, if resources allow, and the two maps could be combined to provide a significant increase in angular resolution.</description>

      <title>Starburst-Driven Galactic Outflows -- Unveiling the Suppressive Role of Cosmic Ray Halos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13261v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aims. We investigate the role of cosmic ray (CR) halos in shaping the properties of starburst-driven galactic outflows. Methods. We develop a microphysical model for galactic outflows driven by a continuous central feedback source, incorporating a simplified treatment of CRs. The model parameters are linked to the effective properties of a starburst. By analyzing its asymptotic behavior, we derive a criterion for launching starburst-driven galactic outflows and determine the corresponding outflow velocities. Results. We find that in the absence of CRs, galactic outflows can only be launched if the star-formation rate (SFR) surface density exceeds a critical threshold proportional to the dynamical equilibrium pressure. In contrast, CRs can always drive slow outflows. CRs dominate in systems with SFR surface densities below the critical threshold but become negligible in highly star-forming systems. However, in older systems with established CR halos, the CR contribution to outflows diminishes once the outflow reaches the galactic scale height, rendering CRs ineffective in sustaining outflows in such systems. Conclusions. Over cosmic time, galaxies accumulate relic CRs in their halos, providing additional non-thermal pressure support that suppresses low-velocity CR-driven outflows. We predict that such low-velocity outflows are expected only in young systems that have not yet built up significant CR halos. In contrast, fast outflows in starburst galaxies, where the SFR surface density exceeds the critical threshold, are primarily driven by momentum injection and remain largely unaffected by CR halos.</description>

      <title>GD-1 and the Milky Way Starless Subhalos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Measurements of the GD-1 star stream velocity distribution within $\pm$3 degrees of the centerline find a total line of sight velocity spread of 5-6 km/s in the well measured $\phi_1=$ [-30, 0] region (Valluri25). The velocity spread is far above the $\sim$2-3 km/s of a dissolved globular cluster in a smooth galactic potential. The dynamical heating of the GD-1 star stream is simulated in an evolving model Milky Way potential which includes the subhalos extracted from cosmological CDM and WDM Milky Way-like halos. The model bridges fully cosmological Milky Way-like halos and late time static Milky Way potentials allowing individual streams to be accurately integrated. An evolving CDM subhalo population acting for $\sim$11 Gyr heats GD-1 to 6.2 km/s. The WDM (7 keV and lighter) models develop a velocity dispersion of 3.9 km/s, only slightly greater than the 3.5 km/s in an evolving smooth halo without subhalos for 11 Gyr. The dynamical age of the best model stream is close to the isochrone age of the stars in the stream. Subhalos with masses in the decade around $10^{7.5} M_\odot$, below the mass range of dwarf galaxies, dominate the dynamical stream heating.</description>

      <title>Detection of millimeter-wave coronal emission in a quasar at cosmological distance using microlensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13313v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Determining the nature of emission processes at the heart of quasars is critical for understanding environments of supermassive black holes. One of the key open questions is the origin of long-wavelength emission from radio-quiet quasars. The proposed mechanisms span a broad range, from central star formation to dusty torus, low-power jets, or coronal emission from the innermost accretion disk. Distinguishing between these scenarios requires probing spatial scales $\leq$0.01 pc, beyond the reach of any current millimetre-wave telescope. Fortunately, in gravitationally lensed quasars, compact mm-wave emission might be microlensed by stars in the foreground galaxy, providing strong constraints on the source size. We report a striking change in rest-frame 1.3-mm flux-ratios in RXJ1131-1231, a quadruply-lensed quasar at z = 0.658, observed by the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) in 2015 and 2020. The observed flux-ratio variability is consistent with microlensing of a very compact source with a half-light radius $\leq$50 astronomical units. The compactness of the source leaves coronal emission as the most likely scenario. Furthermore, the inferred mm-wave and X-ray luminosities follow the characteristic G\"udel-Benz relationship for coronal emission. These observations represent the first unambiguous evidence for coronae as the dominant mechanism for long-wavelength emission in radio-quiet quasars.</description>

      <title>On matching galaxy number densities to reconstruct galaxy evolutionary tracks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The cumulative number density matching approach equates number densities between adjacent redshifts to derive empirical galaxy evolution tracks from the observed galaxy stellar mass function. However, it is well known that this approach overlooks scatter in mass assembly histories and merger effects, with previous studies relying on model-based corrections, either from hydrodynamical cosmological simulations or adjustments to the evolution of cumulative number density with redshift. Here, we revisit this approach, showing that dark matter halo assembly histories imply evolving number densities that are far from constant. These exhibit an average slope of $d \log n_\text{vir} /dz \sim 0.2$ dex for progenitors at $z=0$, leading to evolutionary tracks where galaxies are $\sim2-3$ times smaller in mass at $z\sim2$ and an order of magnitude smaller by $z\sim7$ compared to the number density matching approach. We show that evolving halo number densities provide realistic evolutionary tracks without relying on model-based corrections. Accounting for random errors in stellar mass measurements is also crucial for robust track derivation. We also discuss a generalization that incorporates a galaxy's star formation activity. When additionally considering the scatter around the $M_\ast-M_\text{vir}$ relation ($\sim0.15$ dex), our evolving halo cumulative number density approach shows that some observed stellar masses, $M_{\text{obs},\ast}$, can exceed the universal baryon fraction $f_\text{bar}\sim0.16$. For instance, at $z=5$, around $2\%$ of progenitor galaxies of haloes with $M_\text{vir} \sim 3\times 10^{12}\,M_\odot$ have $M_{\text{obs},\ast}&gt;f_\text{bar} \; M_\text{vir}$, suggesting a potential ``early galaxy formation problem''. However, when deconvolving mass from random errors this tension is reduced with significant confidence at the $\sim5-6\sigma$ level.</description>

      <title>Identifying intermediate mass binary black hole mergers in AGN disks using LISA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11721v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that Laser Interferometer Space Antenna can uniquely identify the sites of intermediate-mass binary black hole (IMBBH) mergers if they occur in Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) disks with a gas density $\rho\geq10^{-12} \, {\rm g/cc}$ via measurement of dynamical friction effect in the gravitational waveform. We find that even a single observation of a gravitational wave source with a total mass of $10^3 M_{\odot}$ and a mass ratio of 2 at a luminosity distance of 3 Gpc is sufficient to confidently associate the merger to be in an AGN disk with a density $\sim 10^{-12} \, {\rm g/cc}$, as it allows estimation of the density with an error bar ${\cal O}(100\%)$. This provides a new way of inferring AGN disk densities that complement traditional X-ray observations. Further, we find that neglecting the presence of environmental effects in the waveform models used for parameter estimation can bias the chirp mass, mass ratio and arrival time of a merger. If not corrected, this can significantly impact our ability to carry out multiband data analysis of IMBBHs that combines information from LISA and the ground-based gravitational wave detectors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.11768v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Wide-orbit planets are particularly sensitive to detection by the Roman Galactic Bulge Time Domain Survey (GBTDS). This study investigates the degeneracy of these events with binary sources, focusing on how observation cadence affects the resolution of these degeneracies. We analyzed the impact of various cadences from (3.6 min)^(-1) to (5 hr)^(-1), which encompasses planned cadences for both the GBTDS and cadences used by ground-based surveys like KMTNet. The results show that a $\sim (15 min)^(-1) cadence is generally sufficient to resolve this degeneracy unless the source star is a giant (rho &gt;~ 0.01).</description>

      <title>The Power of the Cosmic Web</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11778v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the cosmological information contained in the cosmic web, categorized as four structure types: nodes, filaments, walls, and voids, using the Quijote simulations and a modified  nexus+ algorithm. We show that splitting the density field by the four structure types and combining the power spectrum in each provides much tighter constraints on cosmological parameters than using the power spectrum without splitting. We show the rich information contained in the cosmic web structures -- related to the Hessian of the density field -- for measuring all of the cosmological parameters, and in particular for constraining neutrino mass. We study the constraints as a function of Fourier scale, configuration space smoothing scale, and the underlying field. For the matter field with $k_{\rm max}=0.5\,h/{\rm Mpc}$, we find a factor of $\times20$ tighter constraints on neutrino mass when using smoothing scales larger than 12.5~Mpc/$h$, and $\times80$ tighter when using smoothing scales down to 1.95~Mpc/$h$. However, for the CDM+Baryon field we observe a more modest $\times1.7$ or $\times3.6$ improvement, for large and small smoothing scales respectively. We release our new python package for identifying cosmic structures pycosmmommf at https://github.com/James11222/pycosmommf to enable future studies of the cosmological information of the cosmic web.</description>

Abstract: The Trinity Demonstrator is a proof of concept prototype for the Trinity Neutrino Observatory, which is sensitive to astrophysical neutrinos above PeV energies. The Demonstrator is a one-square meter class imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescope deployed on Frisco Peak, Utah, and remotely operated. The light-collection surface is equipped with 77 mirror facets with 15 cm diameter, and its $3.87^\circ\times3.87^\circ$ field of view is instrumented with a 256-pixel camera yielding a $0.24^\circ$ angular resolution. The camera signals are digitized with a 100 MS/s, and 12-bit resolution switched capacitor array readout. We discuss the Demonstrator's design, the telescope's deployment on Frisco Peak, and its commissioning.</description>

      <title>Planets and planetesimals at cosmic dawn: Vortices as planetary nurseries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11877v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Low-mass, metal-enriched stars were likely present as early as cosmic dawn. In this work, we investigate whether these stars could have hosted planets in their protoplanetary disks. If so, these would have been the first planets to form in the Universe, emerging in systems with metallicities much lower than solar. In the core accretion model, planetesimals serve as the building blocks of planets, meaning that planetesimal formation is a prerequisite for planet formation. In a non-structured disk, planetesimal formation typically requires near-solar metallicities according to our current understanding. However, mechanisms that concentrate solid material can significantly lower this metallicity threshold. Here, we explore whether vortices can facilitate the formation of the first planets and planetesimals at cosmic dawn. Vortices are prime sites for planetesimal formation due to their ability to efficiently trap and concentrate dust. We conduct simulations spanning a range of metallicities, and identify a metallicity threshold at Z &gt;=~ 0.04 Zsun for planetesimal formation. If these planetesimals remain inside the vortex long enough to accrete the remaining trapped solids, Mercury-mass planets can form. The formation of Mars-mass planets or larger requires a metallicity of Z &gt;=~ 0.08 Zsun. These results assume a low level of disk turbulence, with higher turbulence levels leading to higher metallicity thresholds.</description>

      <title>NLTE spectral modelling for a carbon-oxygen and helium white-dwarf merger as a Ca-rich transient candidate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12105v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We carry out NLTE (non local thermodynamic equilibrium) radiative transfer simulations to determine whether explosion during the merger of a carbon-oxygen (CO) white dwarf (WD) with a helium (He) WD can reproduce the characteristic Ca II/[Ca II] and He I lines observed in Ca-rich transients. Our study is based on a 1D representation of a hydrodynamic simulation of a 0.6 $M_{\odot}$ CO + 0.4 $M_{\odot}$ He WD merger. We calculate both photospheric and nebular-phase spectra including treatment for non-thermal electrons, as is required for accurate modelling of He I and [Ca II]. Consistent with Ca-rich transients, our simulation predicts a nebular spectrum dominated by emission from [Ca II] 7291, 7324 angstrom and the Ca II near-infrared (NIR) triplet. The photospheric-phase synthetic spectrum also exhibits a strong Ca II NIR triplet, prominent optical absorption due to He I 5876 angstrom and He I 10830 angstrom in the NIR, as is commonly observed for Ca-rich transients. Overall, our results therefore suggest that CO+He WD mergers are a promising channel for Ca-rich transients. However, the current simulation overpredicts some He I features, in particular both He I 6678 and 7065 angstrom and shows a significant contribution from Ti II, which results in a spectral energy distribution that is substantially redder than most Ca-rich transients at peak. Additionally the Ca II nebular emission features are too broad. Future work should investigate if these discrepancies can be resolved by considering full 3D models and exploring a range of CO+He WD binary configurations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.12136v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the discovery of a radio megahalo in the merging cluster PLCKG287.0+32.9, based on upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio telescope (uGMRT) observations at frequencies 300-850 MHz. The sensitive radio observations provide a new window to study the complex physics occurring in this system. Apart from significant detections of the known diffuse radio emission in the cluster, we detect the central diffuse emission to a much larger extent of $\sim$ 3.2 Mpc, reaching the R$_{500}$ of the cluster. The radial surface brightness profile shows a distinct flattening beyond $\sim$0.5R$_{500}$, dividing the emission into inner and outer components. This outer envelope shows a steep spectral index ($\lesssim$ -1.5) and, emissivity $\sim 20$ times lower than the inner component, confirming the megahalo characteristics. The radial profile of the spectral index also distinguishes the steep spectrum megahalo emission. Our observational results align with recent numerical simulations, showing megahalo emission oriented along the merger axis and the re-acceleration of electrons driven by late-stage merger-induced turbulence. This is the first detection of a radio megahalo at a frequency higher than the LOFAR 144 MHz, opening the possibilities for more discoveries and spectral studies to understand their origin.</description>

      <title>Searching for accreting compact binary systems from spectroscopy and photometry: Application to LAMOST spectra</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.12410v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Compact objects undergoing mass transfer exhibit significant (and double-peaked) $H_{\alpha}$ emission lines. Recently, new methods have been developed to identify black hole X-ray binaries (BHXBs) and calculate their systematic parameters using $H_{\alpha}$ line parameters, such as the full-width at half maximum (FWHM), equivalent width (EW), and separation of double peaks. In addition, the FWHM-EW plane from spectroscopy and the $H_{\alpha}$ color-color diagram from photometry can be used for rapid stellar classification. We measure the $H_{\alpha}$ and $H_{\beta}$ profiles (e.g., FWHM and EW) using the LAMOST DR9 low- and medium-resolution spectra, and calculate the systematic parameters (e.g., velocity semi-amplitude of the donor star, mass ratio, inclination angle, and mass of the accretor). A new correlation between FWHM and $K_{\rm 2}$, $K_{\rm 2} = 0.205(18)\ \rm{FWHM}$, is obtained for cataclysmic variables (CVs) in our sample. Both the FWHM-EW plane and the $H_{\alpha}$ color-color diagram can distinguish CVs with FWHM $\gtrsim$ 1000 km/s from Be stars and young stellar objects (YSOs) to some extent. To improve classification accuracy and enhance the selection of compact objects, we propose a new set of idealized filters with effective widths of 30 \AA, 130 \AA, and 400 \AA \ for the narrow $H_{\alpha}$ filter, broad $H_{\alpha}$ filter, and $r$-band filter, respectively.</description>

      <title>Calibration of Complementary Metal-oxide-semiconductor Sensor-based Photometry to a Few-millimagnitude Precision: The Case of the Mini-SiTian Array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12449v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a pioneering achievement in the high-precision photometric calibration of CMOS-based photometry, by application of the Gaia BP/RP (XP) spectra-based synthetic photometry (XPSP) method to the mini-SiTian array (MST) photometry. Through 79 repeated observations of the $\texttt{f02}$ field on the night, we find good internal consistency in the calibrated MST $G_{\rm MST}$-band magnitudes for relatively bright stars, with a precision of about 4\,mmag for $G_{\rm MST}\sim 13$. Results from more than 30 different nights (over 3100 observations) further confirm this internal consistency, indicating that the 4\,mmag precision is stable and achievable over timescales of months. An independent external validation using spectroscopic data from the Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope (LAMOST) DR10 and high-precision photometric data using CCDs from Gaia DR3 reveals a zero-point consistency better than 1\,mmag. Our results clearly demonstrate that CMOS photometry is on par with CCD photometry for high-precision results, highlighting the significant capabilities of CMOS cameras in astronomical observations, especially for large-scale telescope survey arrays.</description>

      <title>Evidence for symbiotic nature of 2MASS J21012803+4555377</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12462v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Just less than 300 symbiotic stars are currently known in the Galaxy. The population synthesis methods predict that this amount should be 10--100 times larger. In recent years, several works have attempted to find symbiotic candidates from photometric surveys. Regular spectroscopic observations of these candidates can increase the number of known symbiotic systems. We aim to verify the symbiotic nature of 2MASS J21012803+4555377. Archive photometry and low-resolution spectra (R=1500-2000) of the candidate are presented. Besides molecular bands, the spectrum displays numerous emission lines including forbidden and high-ionization ones -- He II, [Fe VII], etc. A strong Raman-scattered O VI line is observed at 6825A. The source shows prominent excessive emission in the infrared related to a dense circumstellar dust shell. All this evidence indicates that 2MASS J21012803+4555377 should be classified as a D-type symbiotic star.</description>

      <title>Gravitational instability and affine dynamics of gaseous astrophysical discs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12659v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop several aspects of the theory of gaseous astrophysical discs in which the gravity of the disc makes a significant contribution to its structure and dynamics. We show how the internal gravitational potential can be expanded in powers of the aspect ratio of the disc (or of a structure within it) and separated into near and far contributions. We analyse the hydrostatic vertical structure of a wide family of disc models, both analytically and numerically, and show that the near contribution to the internal gravitational potential energy can be written in an almost universal form in terms of the surface density and scaleheight. We thereby develop an affine model of the dynamics of (generally non-hydrostatic) self-gravitating discs in which this contribution to the energy acts as a gravitational pressure in the plane of the disc. This combines with and significantly reinforces the gas pressure, allowing us to define an enhanced effective sound speed and Toomre stability parameter Q for self-gravitating discs. We confirm that this theory fairly accurately reproduces the onset of axisymmetric gravitational instability in discs with resolved vertical structure. Among other things, this analysis shows that the critical wavelength is on the order of twenty times the scaleheight, helping to justify the validity of the affine model. The weakly nonlinear theory also typically exhibits subcritical behaviour, with equilibrium solutions of finite amplitude being found in the linearly stable regime Q &gt; 1 for adiabatic exponents less than 1.50.</description>

      <title>JWST/MIRI detects the dusty SN1993J about 30 years after explosion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12950v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) have long been considered to contribute significantly to the cosmic dust budget. New dust cools quickly and is therefore detectable at mid-infrared (mid-IR) wavelengths. However, before the era of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), direct observational evidence for dust condensation was found in only a handful of nearby CCSNe, and dust masses (~10$^{-2}-10^{-3} M_{\odot}$, generally limited to &lt;5 yr and to &gt;500K temperatures) have been 2-3 orders of magnitude smaller than either theoretical predictions or dust amounts found by far-IR/submm observations of Galactic SN remnants and in the very nearby SN 1987A. The combined angular resolution and mid-IR sensitivity of JWST finally allow us to reveal hidden cool (~100-200K) dust reservoirs in extragalactic SNe beyond SN 1987A. Our team received JWST/MIRI time for studying a larger sample of CCSNe to fill the currently existing gap in their dust formation histories. The first observed target of this program is the well-known Type IIb SN~1993J appeared in M81. We generated its spectral energy distribution (SED) from the current JWST/MIRI F770W, F1000W, F1500W, and F2100W fluxes. We fit single- and two-component silicate and carbonaceous dust models to the SED. We found that SN 1993J still contains a significant amount (~0.01 $M_{\odot}$) of dust ~30 yr after explosion. Comparing these results to those of the analysis of earlier {Spitzer Space Telescope data, we see a similar amount of dust now that was detected ~15-20 yr ago, but at a lower temperature. We also find residual background emission near the SN site (after point-spread-function subtraction on the JWST/MIRI images) that may plausibly be attributed to an IR echo from more distant interstellar dust grains heated by the SN shock-breakout luminosity or ongoing star formation in the local environment.</description>

      <title>The nebular spectra of SN 2023ixf: A lower mass, partially stripped progenitor may be the result of binary interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13017v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: SN 2023ixf is one of the brightest Core Collapse Supernovae of the 21st century and offers a rare opportunity to investigate the late stage of a Supernova through nebular phase spectroscopy. We present four nebular phase spectra from day +291 to +413 after explosion. This is supplemented with high cadence early phase spectroscopic observations and photometry covering the first 500 days to investigate explosion parameters. The narrow and blue-shifted nebular Oxygen emission lines are used to infer an ejected Oxygen mass of $&lt;0.65M_\odot$, consistent with models of a relatively low mass ($M_{ZAMS}&lt;15M_\odot$) progenitor. An energy of 0.3 to $1.4 \times10^{51}$ erg and a light curve powered by an initial $^{56}$Ni mass of $0.049 \pm 0.005 M_\odot$ appear consistent with a relatively standard Type II explosion, while an incomplete $\gamma$-ray trapping (with timescale of $240\pm4$ days) suggests a lower ejecta mass. Assuming a typical explosion, the broad Hydrogen and Calcium profiles suggest a common origin within a lower mass, partially stripped envelope. Hydrogen emission broadens with time, indicating contribution from an additional power source at an extended distance; while the emergence of high velocity ($\sim$6,000 km s$^{-1}$) Hydrogen emission features (beginning around day +200) may be explained by Shock Interaction with a dense Hydrogen-rich region located at $\sim1.5 \times 10^{16}$cm. Such envelope mass loss for a low mass progenitor may be explained through theoretical models of Binary interaction.</description>

      <title>Using chemical evolution models of the Milky Way disk to constrain Type Ia supernova progenitors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13024v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Thermonuclear explosions of carbon-oxygen white dwarfs as Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) play a significant role in the galactic chemical evolution (GCE) of the Milky Way. However, a long-standing and as yet unresolved problem of modern astrophysics concerns the identity of their progenitor. We aim to use GCE predictions to help constrain potential SN Ia progenitor scenarios, since it is well known that SN Ia nucleosynthesis yields, in particular the Fe-peak elements, depend on the explosion mechanism. We calculated 1140 GCE models and compared the GCE-predicted abundance ratios for four different SN Ia explosion mechanisms -- two from sub-Chandrasekhar (MCh) mass progenitors and two from near-MCh mass progenitors -- to spectroscopic measurements of Milky Way disk stars, considering both local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) and non-LTE (NLTE) assumptions. We calibrated the GCE framework for two sets of massive star yields in order to assess how stellar modelling uncertainties affect the relative contribution from core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) towards Si, Ca, and the Fe-peak elements. From a GCE perspective, Si and Ca cannot be used to constrain SN Ia progenitors since there is little variation in their yields between different explosion types. The GCE of [Ti/Fe] and [Co/Fe] are not reproduced by any combination of yields. The [Cr/Fe] ratio is also problematic, since hardly any NLTE data of the disk are available and there are conflicting yields from CCSNe. For [Mn/Fe], neither CCSN yield set are compatible with the NLTE data. For [Ni/Fe], the NLTE data are well fit by one set of CCSN yields, with the best-fitting GCE models having a $\sim85\%$ contribution from sub-MCh SNe Ia. We advise caution when using GCE models to constrain the Galaxy's SN Ia population, since the results depend on both the choice of CCSN yields and the elemental ratio used as a diagnostic.</description>

      <title>A slowly pulsating run-away B star at high Galactic latitude ejected from a spiral arm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13095v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the discovery of the young B6V run-away star LAMOST J083323.18+430825.4, 2.5\,kpc above the Galactic plane. Its atmospheric parameters and chemical composition are determined from LAMOST spectra, indicating normal composition. Effective temperature (Teff=14,500) and gravity (log g=3.79) suggest that the star is close to terminating hydrogen burning. An analysis of the spectral energy distribution allowed us to determine the angular diameter as well as the interstellar reddening. Using evolutionary models from the MIST database we derived the stellar mass (4.75Msun) and age (104^+11_-13 Myr). The spectroscopic distance (4.17 kpc), the radius (4.5 Rsun), and the luminosity (log(L/Lsun)=2.89) then result from the atmospheric parameters. Using Gaia proper motions, the trajectory is traced back to the Galactic disk to identify the place of birth in a spiral arm. The ejection velocity of 92 km s^{-1} is typical for runaway stars in the halo. The age of the star is larger than its time of flight (78+-4 Myr), which favors a binary supernova event as the likely ejection mechanism. The TESS light curve shows variations with a period of 3.58 days from which we conclude that it is a slowly pulsating B-star, one of very few run-away B-stars known to pulsate.</description>

      <title>Synthetic Spectroscopy for White Dwarf Classification: Addressing Label Uncertainty and Class Imbalance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13231v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the imminent data releases from next-generation spectroscopic surveys, hundreds of thousands of white dwarf spectra are expected to become available within the next few years, increasing the data volume by an order of magnitude. This surge in data has created a pressing need for automated tools to efficiently analyze and classify these spectra. Although machine learning algorithms have recently been applied to classify large spectroscopic datasets, they remain constrained by the limited availability of training data. The Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) serves as the current standard training set, as it provides the largest collection of labeled spectra; however, it faces challenges related to severe class imbalance and uncertain label consistency across different surveys. In this work, we address these limitations by training histogram gradient-boosted classifiers on a synthetic SDSS dataset to identify six ubiquitous chemical signatures in the atmosphere of white dwarfs, and test them on 14,246 objects with SNR$&gt;$10 SDSS spectroscopy. We show our approach not only surpasses human expert performance, but also enables subtype classification and effectively resolves label transferability issues. The methodology developed here is adaptable to any spectroscopic survey, providing a critical tool for the astronomical community.</description>

      <title>Mass-Dependent Radial Distribution of Single and Binary Stars in the Pleiades and their Dynamical Implications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13280v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Pleiades is a young open cluster that has not yet dynamically relaxed, making it an ideal target to observe various internal dynamical effects. By employing a well-defined sample of main-sequence (MS) cluster members, including both MS single stars and unresolved MS+MS binaries, we revisited their individual masses and mass functions and quantified the mass dependence of their radial distributions. We found that the mass function of binaries is more top-heavy than that of single stars. Significant mass segregation is observed for both single and binary populations respectively, with more massive objects concentrated towards the cluster center. Notably, within given mass ranges, binaries are distributed more scattered than single stars, providing direct evidence for more efficient dynamical disruption of binaries in the inner region. The radial distribution of the binary fraction, expressed as the $f_{\rm b}-R$ relation can be characterized by a bimodal shape, with higher $f_{\rm b}$ values in both innermost and outermost regions of the cluster. The lower-mass subsample exhibits a monotonic increase in $f_{\rm b}$ with radius, reflecting the impact of binary disruption. Conversely, for the higher-mass subsample, $f_{\rm b}$ decreases with radius. It can be explained that these massive cluster members, which possess higher binary probabilities, have already undergone significant mass segregation. All these observational evidence and analyses related to the radial mass distribution imply that the Pleiades is currently undergoing a complicated interplay of various internal dynamical effects, of which the modulation between mass segregation and binary disruption is particularly pronounced.</description>

      <title>Extended mass and spheroidal deformation effects on epicyclic frequencies and periapsis shift in quasi-circular orbits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13334v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the effects of extended mass and spheroidal deformation on the periapsis shift of quasi-circular orbits inside a gravitating mass distribution in the Newtonian framework. Focusing on the internal gravitational potential of a spheroidal body with both homogeneous and inhomogeneous density profiles, we elucidate how the ratio of local density to average density governs the extended mass effect on the periapsis shift. By analyzing the orbital angular frequency, along with the radial and vertical epicyclic frequencies, we demonstrate that in the uniform density case (i.e., the Maclaurin spheroid), where the potential takes the form of a harmonic oscillator, the periapsis exhibits a constant retrograde shift of $-\pi$. In contrast, in regions where density inhomogeneity and spheroidal deformation (in both prolate and oblate forms) are significant, the periapsis shift varies with the guiding orbital radius due to local density contrast and deformation effects. The resuls indicate that oblate deformation suppresses the extended mass effect associated with the ratio of local density to average density, whereas prolate deformation amplifies it. Furthermore, by varying the density distribution parameters, we establish the conditions for orbital stability and identify the emergence of marginally stable orbits.</description>

      <title>Exploring Scalarized Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet Theories Through the Lens of Parametrized Post-Newtonian Formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13339v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore scalarized Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet theories within the context of the Parameterized Post-Newtonian formalism, which serves as a robust framework for examining modifications to General Relativity that exhibit scalarization. This approach enables us to impose a variety of constraints on the parameter space, particularly focusing on the PPN parameters $\gamma$ and $\beta$. Our analysis reveals several significant bounds for each scalarized model, utilizing data from the Cassini mission, Lunar Laser Ranging, and the forthcoming BepiColombo mission, in conjunction with geodetic Very Long Baseline Interferometry measurements around the Sun. In particular, we conducted a combined analysis of the MESSENGER mission's precision measurements of Mercury's perihelion precession $\dot{\omega}$ alongside the Cassini constraints on $\gamma$, yielding intriguing limits for the Ricci-EGB model. Furthermore, we investigate the impact of the new post-Newtonian potential introduced by the Gauss-Bonnet term at fourth order, which necessitates an expanded formulation of the PPN parameters. This highlights that the parameter $\beta$ exhibits different effects when analyzing the Ricci-EGB model. Additional constraints are derived from this framework by estimating the $\gamma$ PPN parameter using data from strong-lensing galaxy systems.</description>

      <title>The R-Process Alliance: Hunting for gold in the near-UV spectrum of 2MASS J05383296-5904280</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13426v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context. Over the past few years, the $R$-Process Alliance (RPA) has successfully carried out a search for stars that are highly enhanced in elements produced via the rapid neutron-capture ($r$-) process. In particular, the RPA has identified a number of relatively bright, highly $r$-process-enhanced ($r$-II) stars, suitable for observations with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST), facilitating abundance derivation of elements such as gold (Au) and cadmium (Cd). Aims. This paper presents the detailed abundances derived for the metal-poor ([Fe/H] = -2.55) highly $r$-process-enhanced ([Eu/Fe] = +1.29) $r$-II star 2MASS J05383296-5904280. Methods. 1D LTE elemental abundances are derived via equivalent width and spectral synthesis using high-resolution high signal-to-noise near-UV HST/STIS and optical Magellan/MIKE spectra. Results. Abundances are determined for 43 elements, including 26 neutron-capture elements. In particular, abundances of the rarely studied elements Nb, Mo, Cd, Lu, Os, Pt, and Au are derived from the HST spectrum. These results, combined with RPA near-UV observations of two additional $r$-II stars, increase the number of Cd abundances derived for $r$-process-enriched stars from seven to ten and Au abundances from four to seven. A large star-to-star scatter is detected for both of these elements, highlighting the need for more detections enabling further investigations, specifically into possible non-LTE (local thermodynamical equilibrium) effects.</description>

Abstract: The currently observing Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) places sub-percent constraints on the Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) scaling parameters from the Lyman-$\alpha$ (Ly-$\alpha$) forest. However, no systematic error budget stemming from non-linearities in the 3D clustering of the Ly-$\alpha$ forest is included in the DESI-Ly-$\alpha$ analysis. In this work, we measure the size of the shift of the BAO peak using large Ly-$\alpha$ forest mocks produced on the $N$-body simulation suite \textsc{AbacusSummit}. Specifically, we measure the Ly-$\alpha$ auto-correlation and the Ly-$\alpha$-quasar cross-correlation functions. We use the DESI Ly-$\alpha$ forest fitting pipeline, \textsc{Vega}, with the publicly available covariance matrix from eBOSS DR16. To mitigate the noise, we adopt a linear control variates (LCV) technique, reducing the error bars by a factor of up to $\sim \sqrt{50}$ on large scales. From the auto-correlation, we detect a small positive shift in radial direction of $\Delta \alpha_\parallel = 0.35\%$ at the 3$\sigma$ level and virtually no shift in the transverse direction, $\alpha_\perp$. From the cross-correlation, we see a similar shift to $\Delta\alpha_\parallel$, albeit with larger error bars, and a small negative shift, $\Delta \alpha_\perp=\sim$0.25\%, at the 2$\sigma$ level. We also make a connection with the Ly-$\alpha$ forest effective field theory (EFT) framework and find that the one-loop EFT power spectrum yields unbiased measurements of the BAO shift parameters in radial and transverse direction for Ly-$\alpha$ auto and the Ly-$\alpha$-quasar cross-correlation measurements. When using the one-loop EFT framework, we find that we can recover the BAO parameters without a shift, which has important implications for future Ly-$\alpha$ forest analyses based on EFT. This work paves the way for the full-shape analysis of DESI and future surveys.</description>

      <title>The baryonic Tully-Fisher relation of HI-bearing low-surface brightness galaxies implies their formation mechanism</title>

Abstract: We investigate the baryonic Tully-Fisher relation in low surface brightness galaxies selected from the Arecibo Legacy Fast ALFA survey. We find that the $\rm HI$-bearing low surface brightness galaxies still follow the baryonic Tully-Fisher relation of typical late-type galaxies, with a slope of approximately 4 in the baryonic mass versus rotational velocity diagram on the logarithmic scale, i.e., $M_{\rm{b}}\propto v_{\rm{rot}}^4$. Our findings suggest that the matter distributions in low surface brightness galaxies may resemble that of general late-type galaxies, and hint that low surface brightness galaxies may not originate from dark matter halos of low densities or stronger/weaker feedback processes, but may emerge from dark matter halos with high spin values.</description>

      <title>Galaxy evolution in compact groups II. Witnessing the influence of major structures in their evolution</title>

Abstract: Compact groups (CGs) of galaxies are extreme environments for morphological transformations and the cessation of star formation. Though initially considered isolated, it is now recognised that many CGs are embedded in larger structures. We aim to understand the dynamics of CGs and how their surrounding environments impact their physical properties. We selected 316 CGs in the Stripe 82 region (1011 galaxies) and 2281 field galaxies as a control sample. At least 41% of CGs are part of major structures (non-isolated CGs). We find a bimodal distribution in the effective radius ($R_e$)-Sersic index ($n$) plane for transition galaxies ($(u-r) &gt; 2.3$ and $n&lt;2.5$) in CGs. Transition galaxies in isolated CGs are denser in the $R_e-n$ plane for $n &lt; 1.75$, while those in non-isolated CGs show a smoother increase in $n$, with 62% having $n &gt; 1.5$. This suggests that many have undergone morphological transformation, contributing to the compact galaxy population. Galaxies in CGs have lower mean specific star formation rates (sSFR) than the control sample, with non-isolated CGs showing even lower sSFR, indicating stronger star formation suppression. Non-isolated CGs also have a higher fraction of quenched galaxies. When dividing by morphology, significant differences arise only for early-type galaxies (ETGs; $(u-r) &gt; 2.3$ and $n&gt;2.5$). In isolated CGs, ETGs show lower quenched fractions and higher sSFR in low-mass bins ($\log(M_/M_{\odot}) &lt; 11$), suggesting sustained star formation. In non-isolated CGs, ETGs show higher quenched fractions and lower sSFR in high-mass bins ($\log(M_/M_{\odot}) &gt; 11$), underscoring the environmental suppression of star formation. We propose that major structures accelerate morphological transformations and facilitate preprocessing. Our results highlight the need to consider larger structures when analysing CGs, as they significantly affect galaxy evolution.</description>

      <title>Detection of [OIII]88$\mu$m in JADES-GS-z14-0 at z=14.1793</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.20549v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the first successful ALMA follow-up observations of a secure $z &gt; 10$ JWST-selected galaxy, by robustly detecting ($6.6\sigma$) the [OIII]$_{88\mu m}\,$ line in JADES-GS-z14-0 (hereafter GS-z14). The ALMA detection yields a spectroscopic redshift of $z=14.1793\pm0.0007$, and increases the precision on the prior redshift measurement of $z=14.32_{-0.20}^{+0.08}$ from NIRSpec by $\gtrsim$180$\times$. Moreover, the redshift is consistent with that previously determined from a tentative detection ($3.6\sigma$) of CIII]$_{1907,1909}$ ($z=14.178\pm0.013$), solidifying the redshift determination via multiple line detections. We measure a line luminosity of $L_\mathrm{[OIII]88} = (2.1 \pm 0.5)\times10^8\,L_\odot$, placing GS-z14 at the lower end, but within the scatter of, the local $L_\mathrm{[OIII]88}$-star formation rate relation. No dust continuum from GS-z14 is detected, suggesting an upper limit on the dust-to-stellar mass ratio of $&lt; 2 \times 10^{-3}$, consistent with dust production from supernovae with a yield $y_d &lt; 0.3\,M_\odot$. Combining a previous JWST/MIRI photometric measurement of the [OIII]$\lambda\lambda$4959,5007$\mathrm{\mathring{A}}$ and H$\beta$ lines with Cloudy models, we find GS-z14 to be surprisingly metal-enriched ($Z\sim0.05 - 0.2\,Z_\odot$) a mere $300\,\mathrm{Myr}$ after the Big Bang. The detection of a bright oxygen line in GS-z14 thus reinforces the notion that galaxies in the early Universe undergo rapid evolution.</description>

      <title>UNCOVER: 404 Error -- Models Not Found for the Triply Imaged Little Red Dot A2744-QSO1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06257v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: JWST has revealed an abundance of compact, red objects at $z\approx5-8$ dubbed "little red dots" (LRDs), whose SEDs display a faint blue UV continuum followed by a steep rise in the optical. Despite extensive study of their characteristic V-shaped SEDs, the nature of LRDs remains unknown. We present a new analysis of the NIRSpec/PRISM spectrum of A2744-QSO1, a triply imaged LRD at $z=7.04$ from the UNCOVER survey. The spectrum shows a strong Balmer break and broad Balmer emission lines, both of which are difficult to explain with models invoking exclusively AGN or stellar contributions. Our fiducial model decomposes the spectrum into a post-starburst galaxy dominating the UV-optical continuum and a reddened AGN being sub-dominant at all wavelength and contributing at $\sim20\%$ level. However, our most credible model infers a stellar mass of $M_\star\approx 4\times10^9\,\mathrm{M_\odot}$ within a radius of $r_\mathrm{e}&lt;30\,$pc, driving its central density to the highest among observations to date. This high central density could be explained if A2744-QSO-1 is the early-forming core of a modern-day massive elliptical galaxy that later puffed up via the inside-out growth channel. The models also necessitate an unusually steep dust law to preserve the strong break strength, though this steepness may be explained by a deficit of large dust grains. It is also probable that these challenges reflect our ignorance of A2744-QSO1's true nature. Future variability and reverberation mapping studies could help disentangle the galaxy and AGN contribution to the continuum, and deeper redder observations could also unveil the dust properties in LRDs.</description>

      <title>Improving photometric redshifts of Epoch of Reionization galaxies: a new empirical transmission curve with neutral hydrogen damping wing Ly$\alpha$ absorption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21543v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a new analytical model for the attenuation to Epoch of Reionization (EoR) galaxies by proximate neutral hydrogen gas. Many galaxy spectra in the EoR taken by JWST have shown a flux deficit at wavelengths just redward of the Lyman break, and this has been regarded as resulting from Ly$\alpha$ damping wing absorption by the increasing amount of neutral hydrogen in the line-of-sight. However, previous attenuation models for the intergalactic medium (IGM) commonly used in photometric redshift template-fitting codes assume that the Lyman break is rather sharp, which leads to systematic overestimation of photometric redshifts at $z&gt;7$. In this letter, we build and empirically calibrate a new attenuation model that takes the increased Ly$\alpha$ damping wing absorption into account. Our model consists of the canonical IGM absorption and an additional absorption component due to dense neutral hydrogen gas clouds proximate to the galaxy, and we derive the redshift evolution of HI column density of the proximate clouds by calibrating the model using CANUCS JWST observations. The resulting total transmission curve resolves the photometric redshift bias at $z&gt;7$, an improvement that is robust to choice of template-fitting code, template set, and photometric catalog used. The new attenuation model can be easily implemented in existing template-fitting codes, and significantly improves the photometric redshift performance in the EoR.</description>

      <title>Hawking Radiation from non-evaporating primordial black holes cannot enable the formation of direct collapse black holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09081v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The formation of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in the early Universe is a subject of significant debate. In this study, we examine whether non-evaporating primordial black holes (PBHs) can offer a solution. We establish initial constraints on the range of PBH masses that correspond to Hawking radiation (HR) effective temperatures in the range needed to suppress $H_2$ cooling, which would facilitate the formation of massive black hole seeds in atomic cooling halos. We also investigate the specific intensity of the HR from non-evaporating PBHs and compare it with the critical radiation needed for direct collapse black holes (DCBHs). We show that HR from non-evaporating PBHs cannot serve as an irradiating mechanism to facilitate the formation of the seeds for the SMBHs we observe in the high-redshift Universe unless, perhaps, the PBHs within the relevant mass range comprise a significant fraction of dark matter and are significantly clustered towards the center of the primordial halo.</description>

      <title>A Large Molecular Gas Reservoir in the Protocluster SPT2349$-$56 at $z\,{=}\,4.3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17980v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present Atacama Compact Array (ACA) Band-3 observations of the protocluster SPT2349$-$56, an extreme system hosting ${\gtrsim}\,12$ submillimeter galaxies (SMGs) at $z\,{=}\,4.3$, to study its integrated molecular gas content via CO(4-3) and long-wavelength dust continuum. The $\sim$30-hour integration represents one of the longest exposures yet taken on a single pointing with the ACA 7-m. The low-resolution ACA data ($21.0''\,{\times}\,12.2''$) reveal a 75% excess CO(4-3) flux compared to the sum of individual sources detected in higher-resolution Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) data ($1.0''\,{\times}\,0.8''$). Our work also reveals a similar result by tapering the ALMA data to $10''$. In contrast, the 3.2mm dust continuum shows little discrepancy between ACA and ALMA. A single-dish [CII] spectrum obtained by APEX/FLASH supports the ACA CO(4-3) result, revealing a large excess in [CII] emission relative to ALMA. The missing flux is unlikely due to undetected faint sources but instead suggests that high-resolution ALMA observations might miss extended and low-surface-brightness gas. Such emission could originate from the circum-galactic medium (CGM) or the pre-heated proto-intracluster medium (proto-ICM). If this molecular gas reservoir replenishes the star formation fuel, the overall depletion timescale will exceed 400Myr, reducing the requirement for the simultaneous SMG activity in SPT2349$-$56. Our results highlight the role of an extended gas reservoir in sustaining a high star formation rate (SFR) in SPT2349$-$56, and potentially establishing the ICM during the transition phase to a mature cluster.</description>

      <title>Exploring Multiple Stellar Populations in Globular Clusters with Euclid: A Theoretical Overview and Insights from NGC 6397</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08135v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the behavior of multiple stellar populations in globular clusters (GCs) using photometric diagrams constructed with Euclid photometry. By employing synthetic spectra and isochrones that incorporate the chemical differences between first-population (1P) stars, resembling field stars, and second-population (2P) stars, enriched in helium and nitrogen but depleted in carbon and oxygen, we identify, from a theoretical perspective, the color-magnitude diagrams and the chromosome maps most effective at distinguishing these populations within GCs. Euclid photometry proves to be a powerful tool for identifying multiple populations among M-dwarfs, as 1P and 2P stars form distinct sequences in well-chosen photometric diagrams, driven by differences in the strength of oxygen-based molecular features, such as water vapor. To validate our theoretical findings, we analyzed Euclid photometry and astrometry of the GC NGC 6397, complemented by photometric and astrometric data from the Hubble Space Telescope and James Webb Space Telescope, enabling a comprehensive study of its stellar populations across a wide field of view. We find that the 1P constitutes about 30% of the M-dwarfs in NGC 6397, with the fraction of 1P stars remaining consistent across different stellar masses and throughout the entire field of view. 2P stars exhibit an [O/Fe] depletion of about 0.3 dex relative to 1P stars, and both populations display isotropic proper motions. This study represents the first comprehensive analysis of multiple populations among M-dwarfs across a wide field of view, demonstrating that Euclid photometry is a powerful instrument for investigating multiple populations in GCs.</description>

      <title>DIISC -- VI (COS-DIISC): UV Metal Absorption Relative to the H I disk of Galaxies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.02583v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As part of the Deciphering the Interplay between the Interstellar medium, Stars, and the Circumgalactic medium (DIISC) survey, we present the UV metal absorption features in the Circumgalactic Medium (CGM) near the H I gas disk ($&lt;$4.5$R_\mathrm{HI}$) of 31 nearby galaxies through quasar absorption line spectroscopy. Of the ions under study, Si III $\lambda1206$ was most frequently detected (18 of 31 sight lines), while C II $\lambda1334$ and Si II $\lambda1260$ were detected in 17 and 15 of 31 sight lines, respectively. Many components were consistent with photoionization equilibrium models, most of the cold and cool gas phase clouds were found to have lengths smaller than 2 kpc. Sight lines with smaller impact parameters ($\rho$) normalized by the galaxy's virial radius ($R_\mathrm{vir}$) and H I radius ($R_\mathrm{HI}$) tend to have more components and larger rest-frame equivalent widths ($W_r$) than those that probe the CGM at larger radii. In particular, we find that the location of metals are better traced by $\rho$ / $R_\mathrm{HI}$ rather than the traditional $\rho$ / $R_\mathrm{vir}$. Larger covering fractions are found closer to galaxies, with a radial decline that depends on the $W_r$ limit used. Our results provide new insights into the spatial distribution of metals around the H I disks of low-redshift galaxies.</description>

      <title>Orthogonal Alignment of Galaxy Group Angular Momentum with Cosmic Filament Spines: An Observational Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05478v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the alignment between the angular momenta of galaxy groups and the spines of their associated cosmic filaments. Our results demonstrate a significant tendency for these two orientations to be perpendicular, indicating that the rotation of a galaxy group does not originate from the spin of cosmic filaments. Instead, it is driven by the orbital angular momentum contributed by member galaxies as they accrete along the direction of the filament spines. Moreover, the strength of this perpendicular alignment signal varies with the richness of the galaxy groups, with the most pronounced alignment observed among the wealthiest groups. This pronounced alignment is largely due to the more coherent spatial distribution of member galaxies in richer groups relative to the filament spines. Our study provides valuable insights into the mechanisms of angular momentum acquisition in galaxy groups from an observational standpoint.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.07730v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we utilize photometric and kinematic data from \textit{Gaia} DR3 and the {\sc ASteCA} package to analyze the sparsely studied open clusters, King 2 and King 5. For King 2, we identify 340 probable members with membership probabilities exceeding 50\%. Its mean proper motion components are determined as $(\mu_\alpha\cos\delta,~\mu_\delta) = (-1.407 \pm 0.008, -0.863 \pm 0.012)$ mas yr$^{-1}$, and its limiting radius is derived as $6.94_{-1.06}^{+0.22}$ arcminutes based on radial density profiles. The cluster has an estimated age of $4.80 \pm 0.30$ Gyr, a distance of $6586 \pm 164$ pc, and a metallicity of $\text{[Fe/H]} = -0.25$ dex ($z = 0.0088$). We detect 17 blue straggler stars (BSSs) concentrated in its core, and its total mass is estimated to be $356 \pm 19~M_{\odot}$. The computed apex motion is $(A_o,~D_o) = (-142^\circ.61 \pm 0^\circ.08, -63^\circ.58 \pm 0^\circ.13)$. Similarly, King 5 consists of 403 probable members with mean proper motion components $(\mu_\alpha\cos\delta,~\mu_\delta) = (-0.291 \pm 0.005, -1.256 \pm 0.005)$ mas yr$^{-1}$ and a limiting radius of $11.33_{-2.16}^{+5.45}$ arcminutes. The cluster's age is determined as $1.45 \pm 0.10$ Gyr, with a distance of $2220 \pm 40$ pc and a metallicity of $\text{[Fe/H]} = -0.15$ dex ($z = 0.0109$). We identify 4 centrally concentrated BSSs, and the total mass is estimated as $484 \pm 22~M_{\odot}$. The apex motion is calculated as $(A_o,~D_o) = (-115^\circ.10 \pm 0^\circ.09, -73^\circ.16 \pm 0^\circ.12)$. The orbital analysis of King 2 and King 5 indicates nearly circular orbits, characterized by low eccentricities and minimal variation in their apogalactic and perigalactic distances. King 2 and King 5 reach maximum heights of $499 \pm 25$ pc and $177 \pm 2$ pc from the Galactic plane, respectively, confirming their classification as young stellar disc population.</description>

      <title>Tentative rotation in a galaxy at z$\sim$14 with ALMA</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.10751v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We re-analysed ALMA observations of the [OIII]$\lambda$88$\mu$m emission line in JADES-GS-z14.0, so far the most distant spectroscopically confirmed galaxy at z=14.18. Our analysis shows a tentative detection of a velocity gradient of [OIII]$\lambda$88$\mu$m using three independent tests: 1) construction of moment maps; 2) extraction of integrated spectra from a grid of apertures; and 3) spectro-astrometry in both the image and uv planes. We performed kinematical fitting using the KinMS code and estimated a dynamical mass of log$_{10}$(M$_{\rm dyn}$/$\rm M_\odot$)= 9.4$^{+0.8}_{-0.4}$, with the bulk of the uncertainties due to the degeneracy between dynamical mass and inclination. We measure an upper limit on the velocity dispersion ($\sigma_{v}$) of $&lt;40~$ km/s~which results in an estimate of V$_{\rm rot}/\sigma&gt;$ 2.5. This result, if confirmed with higher-resolution observations, would imply that kinematically cold discs are already in place at $z\sim14$. Comparison with mock observations from the SERRA cosmological simulations confirms that even low-resolution observations are capable of detecting a velocity gradient in $z&gt;10$ galaxies as compact as JADES-GS-z14.0. This work shows that deeper ALMA or JWST/NIRSpec IFS observations with high spatial resolution will be able to estimate an accurate dynamical mass for JADES-GS-z14.0, providing an upper limit to the stellar mass of this over-luminous galaxy.</description>

      <title>A non-relativistic theory of quantum mechanics with local modulus symmetry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2008.07749v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We have constructed a non-relativistic theory of quantum mechanics based on local modulus symmetry. The resulting connection in the covariant derivative is identified as the escape velocity of the gravitational field. A new real and positive function called the quantum metric function is attached to the complex conjugate of the wave function to satisfy the local modulus symmetry requirement. In an expanding universe, these theoretical features produce new effects that deviate from predictions of conventional quantum mechanics and Newtonian gravity. The quantum metric function yields negligible change for microscopic objects but produces quantum pointer states for macroscopic objects, thus providing a solution to the quantum measurement problem. The time-reversal symmetry is broken in the new quantum kinematics, which has implications for the second law of thermodynamics. The modification of Newtonian gravity is negligible in smaller bound systems but can become significant at the galactic scales. Its potential association with the mass discrepancy problem in the galactic systems is discussed.</description>

      <title>Scalable inference with Autoregressive Neural Ratio Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.08597v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years, there has been a remarkable development of simulation-based inference (SBI) algorithms, and they have now been applied across a wide range of astrophysical and cosmological analyses. There are a number of key advantages to these methods, centred around the ability to perform scalable statistical inference without an explicit likelihood. In this work, we propose two technical building blocks to a specific sequential SBI algorithm, truncated marginal neural ratio estimation (TMNRE). In particular, first we develop autoregressive ratio estimation with the aim to robustly estimate correlated high-dimensional posteriors. Secondly, we propose a slice-based nested sampling algorithm to efficiently draw both posterior samples and constrained prior samples from ratio estimators, the latter being instrumental for sequential inference. To validate our implementation, we carry out inference tasks on three concrete examples: a toy model of a multi-dimensional Gaussian, the analysis of a stellar stream mock observation, and finally, a proof-of-concept application to substructure searches in strong gravitational lensing. In addition, we publicly release the code for both the autoregressive ratio estimator and the slice sampler.</description>

      <title>The Mystery of Alpha and the Isotopes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.00888v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report unbiased AI measurements of the fine structure constant $\alpha$ in two proximate absorption regions in the spectrum of the quasar HE0515$-$4414. The data are high resolution, high signal to noise, and laser frequency comb calibrated, obtained using the ESPRESSO spectrograph on the VLT. The high quality of the data and proximity of the regions motivate a differential comparison, exploring the possibility of spatial variations of fundamental constants, as predicted in some theories. We show that if the magnesium isotopic relative abundances are terrestrial, the fine structure constants in these two systems differ at the 7$\sigma$ level. A 3$\sigma$ discrepancy between the two measurements persists even for the extreme non-terrestrial case of 100\% $^{24}$Mg, if shared by both systems. However, if Mg isotopic abundances take independent values in these two proximate systems, one terrestrial, the other with no heavy isotopes, both can be reconciled with a terrestrial $\alpha$, and the discrepancy between the two measurements falls to 2$\sigma$. We cannot rule out other systematics that are unaccounted for in our study that could masquerade as a varying alpha signal. We discuss varying constant and varying isotope interpretations and resolutions to this conundrum for future high precision measurements.</description>

      <title>Modeling the UV/Optical light curve of re-brightening tidal disruption events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12549v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years, a new subclass of tidal disruption events (TDEs) was reported from the literature. The light curve of these TDEs show a re-brightening feature in the decline phase after the first peak, which then leads to a second flare. The re-brightening TDEs challenges the existing light curve fitting tools, which are designed to handle single flare. In this work, we present a model, aimed at reproducing of the light curve of the re-brightening TDEs, based on the scenario that the consecutive flares are produced by the same star who experienced two partial disruptions (PTDEs). We also develop a fitting code from this model, and apply it to two re-brightening TDEs: AT 2022dbl and AT 2023adr. The light curve of both TDEs are well fitted. Finally, we forecast the time and peak brightness of the next flare for these two TDEs, so that the observers could get prepared in advance and make an examination on our model.</description>

      <title>Minute-cadence observations on Galactic plane with Wide Field Survey Telescope (WFST): Overview, methodology and early results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12601v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As the time-domain survey telescope of the highest survey power in the northern hemisphere currently, Wide Field Survey Telescope (WFST) is scheduled to hourly/daily/semi-weekly scan northern sky up to ~23 mag in four optical (ugri) bands. Unlike the observation cadences in the forthcoming regular survey missions, WFST performed "staring" observations toward Galactic plane in a cadence of $\approx$1 minute for a total on-source time of about 13 hours, during the commissioning and pilot observation phases. Such an observation cadence is well applied in producing densely sampling light curves and hunting for stars exhibiting fast stellar variabilities. Here we introduce the primary methodologies in detecting variability, periodicity, and stellar flares among a half million sources from the minute-cadence observations, and present the WFST g-/r-band light curves generated from periodic variable stars and flaring stars. Benefit from high photometric precisions and deep detection limits of WFST, the observations have captured several rare variable stars, such as a variable hot white dwarf (WD) and an ellipsoidal WD binary candidate. By surveying the almost unexplored parameter spaces for variables, WFST will lead to new opportunities in discovering unique variable stars in the northern sky.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the Classics: On the Optical Colours of Novae as Standard Crayons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15108v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a systematic study of the $BVRI$ colours of novae over the course of their eruptions. Where possible, interstellar reddening was measured using the equivalent widths of Diffuse Interstellar Bands (DIBs). Some novae lack spectra with sufficient resolution and signal-to-noise ratios; therefore, we supplement as necessary with 3D and 2D dust maps. Utilising only novae with DIB- or 3D-map-based $E(B-V)$, we find an average intrinsic $(B-V)_0$ colour of novae at $V$-band light curve peak of 0.20 with a standard deviation of 0.31, based on 25 novae. When the light curve has declined by 2 magnitudes ($t_2$), we find an average $(B-V)_0 = -0.03$ with a standard deviation of 0.19. These average colours are consistent with previous findings, although the spreads are larger than previously found due to more accurate reddening estimates. We also examined the intrinsic $(R-I)_0$ and $(V-R)_0$ colours across our sample. These colours behave similarly to $(B-V)_0$, except that the $(V-R)_0$ colour gets redder after peak, likely due to the contributions of emission line flux. We searched for correlations between nova colours and $t_2$, peak $V$-band absolute magnitude, and GeV $\gamma$-ray luminosity, but find no statistically significant correlations. Nova colours can therefore be used as standard ``crayons" to estimate interstellar reddening from photometry alone, with 0.2--0.3 mag uncertainty. We present a novel Bayesian strategy for estimating distances to Galactic novae based on these $E(B-V)$ measurements, independent of assumptions about luminosity, built using 3D dust maps and a stellar mass model of the Milky Way.</description>

      <title>Multi-Tracer Correlated Stacking: A Novel Way to Discover Anisotropy in nano-Hz Stochastic Gravitational Wave Background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01499v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The isotropic stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) generated by a population of supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs) provides a unique window into their cosmic evolution. In addition to the isotropic power spectrum, the anisotropic component of the signal carries additional information about the supermassive black holes (SMBHs) and host galaxy connection. The measurement of this signal is usually carried out by angular power spectra, which is only a sufficient measure for a Gaussian and statistically isotropic distribution of SMBHBs, where the statistical properties of a field remain unchanged across the sky. In contrast, the contribution from SMBHBs in nano-hertz SGWB will be hosted by fewer massive galaxies, making the nano-hertz background anisotropic and non-Gaussian. As a result, the performance of angular power spectra in extracting the underlying physics is limited. In this work, we propose a novel technique called the \texttt{Multi-Tracer Correlated Stacking}, which enables the detection of anisotropies in the SGWB by stacking the signal from regions of the sky with tracers of BHs such as active galactic nucleus (AGNs), quasars, bright galaxies, etc., that can be mapped up to high redshift. We demonstrate this technique on a simulated supermassive BHBs distribution using an AGN catalog, which maps the underlying matter distribution approximately up to redshift $z=5$. This stacking technique uniquely distinguishes between isotropic and anisotropic distributions of SGWB source, surpassing the capabilities of angular power spectrum-based methods in detecting anisotropic signals. This highlights the effectiveness of this technique in detecting anisotropic SGWB signals and in the future, this technique can play a crucial role in its discovery.</description>

      <title>Thermal emission from bow shocks. III. Variable diffuse X-ray emission from stellar-wind bow shocks driven by dynamical instabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06021v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: X-ray emission from wind-driven bow shocks is both difficult to measure and predict, but may give important insights into the energy budget of the hot phase of the ISM by quantifying mixing at the interface between hot and warm gas phases. We investigate the effect of magnetic fields and numerical resolution on predicted X-ray emission and other observable properties of bow shocks, to study convergence properties and assess robustness of predicted observables from simulations. A suite of 2D and 3D HD and MHD simulations of bow shocks were run and analysed to generate synthetic emission maps and light curves in X-ray and infrared emission. Resolving the Kelvin-Helmholtz (KH) instability at the wind-ISM contact discontinuity is crucial for obtaining converged results and for predicting X-ray emission and the properties of the hot shocked wind. When sufficient spatial resolution is used, we measure time variation of X-ray emission of at least an order of magnitude on a timescale comparable to the advection timescale of the wake downstream from the bow shock. Good correspondence is found between 2D and 3D simulations with comparable resolution, and 3D simulations can achieve the required resolution with reasonable computing resources. Development of the KH instability is inhibited for shear flows parallel to the ISM magnetic field, compared with what is seen in the perpendicular direction, resulting in synthetic IR emission maps of bow shocks that are smooth when seen from one perspective but show strong distortions from another. Measuring the X-ray morphology and luminosity in bow shocks may be useful for constraining mixing and energy-transfer rates between hot and warm gas phases of the ISM. Dynamical instabilities at the wind-ISM interface are a crucial ingredient in determining the properties of the hot-gas phase in stellar bow-shocks, in particular to capture its time dependence.</description>

      <title>Asteroseismic Study of Subgiants and Giants of the Open Cluster M67 using Kepler/K2: Expanded Sample and Precise Masses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18714v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sparked by the asteroseismic space revolution, ensemble studies have been used to produce empirical relations linking observed seismic properties and fundamental stellar properties. Cluster stars are particularly valuable because they have the same metallicity, distance, and age, thus reducing scatter to reveal smoother relations. We present the first study of a cluster that spans the full evolutionary sequence from subgiants to core helium-burning red giants using asteroseismology to characterise the stars in M67, including a yellow straggler. We use Kepler/K2 data to measure seismic surface gravity, examine the potential influence of core magnetic fields, derive an empirical expression for the seismic surface term, and determine the phase term $\epsilon$ of the asymptotic relation for acoustic modes, extending its analysis to evolutionary states previously unexplored in detail. Additionally, we calibrate seismic scaling relations for stellar mass and radius, and quantify their systematic errors if surface term corrections are not applied to state-of-the-art stellar models. Our masses show that the Reimers mass loss parameter can not be larger than $\eta$ $\sim$ 0.23 at the 2-$\sigma$ level. We use isochrone models designed for M67 and compare their predictions with individual mode frequencies. We find that the seismic masses for subgiants and red giant branch stars align with the isochrone-predicted masses as per their luminosity and colour. However, our results are inconsistent with the mass of one of the stellar components of an eclipsing binary system near the TAMS. We use traditional seismic $\chi^2$ fits to estimate a seismic cluster age of 3.95 $\pm$ 0.35 Gyrs.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00636v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We describe updated scientific goals for the wide-field, millimeter-wave survey that will be produced by the Simons Observatory (SO). Significant upgrades to the 6-meter SO Large Aperture Telescope (LAT) are expected to be complete by 2028, and will include a doubled mapping speed with 30,000 new detectors and an automated data reduction pipeline. In addition, a new photovoltaic array will supply most of the observatory's power. The LAT survey will cover about 60% of the sky at a regular observing cadence, with five times the angular resolution and ten times the map depth of Planck. The science goals are to: (1) determine the physical conditions in the early universe and constrain the existence of new light particles; (2) measure the integrated distribution of mass, electron pressure, and electron momentum in the late-time universe, and, in combination with optical surveys, determine the neutrino mass and the effects of dark energy via tomographic measurements of the growth of structure at $z &lt; 3$; (3) measure the distribution of electron density and pressure around galaxy groups and clusters, and calibrate the effects of energy input from galaxy formation on the surrounding environment; (4) produce a sample of more than 30,000 galaxy clusters, and more than 100,000 extragalactic millimeter sources, including regularly sampled AGN light-curves, to study these sources and their emission physics; (5) measure the polarized emission from magnetically aligned dust grains in our Galaxy, to study the properties of dust and the role of magnetic fields in star formation; (6) constrain asteroid regoliths, search for Trans-Neptunian Objects, and either detect or eliminate large portions of the phase space in the search for Planet 9; and (7) provide a powerful new window into the transient universe on time scales of minutes to years, concurrent with observations from Rubin of overlapping sky.</description>

      <title>Lost in the FoG: Pitfalls of Models for Large-Scale Hydrogen Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01956v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large-scale HI surveys and their cross-correlations with galaxy distributions have immense potential as cosmological probes. Interpreting these measurements requires theoretical models that must incorporate redshift-space distortions (RSDs), such as the Kaiser and fingers-of-God (FoG) effect, and differences in the tracer and matter distributions via the tracer bias. These effects are commonly approximated with assumptions that should be tested on simulated distributions. In this work, we use the hydrodynamical simulation suite IllustrisTNG to assess the performance of models of $z \leq 1$ HI auto and HI-galaxy cross-power spectra, finding that the models employed by recent observations introduce errors comparable to or exceeding their measurement uncertainties. In particular, neglecting FoG causes $\gtrsim 10\%$ deviations between the modeled and simulated power spectra at $k \gtrsim 0.1$ $h$ / Mpc, larger than assuming a constant bias which reaches the same error threshold at slightly smaller scales. However, even without these assumptions, models can still err by $\sim 10\%$ on relevant scales. These remaining errors arise from multiple RSD damping sources on HI clustering, which are not sufficiently described with a single FoG term. Overall, our results highlight the need for an improved understanding of RSDs to harness the capabilities of future measurements of HI distributions.</description>

      <title>Distinguishing Tidal Disruption Events and Changing-look Active Galactic Nuclei via Variation of Mid-infrared Color</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10053v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: At present, there is a lack of effective probes to distinguish between mid-infrared (MIR) outbursts induced by tidal disruption events (TDEs) and changing-look active galactic nuclei (CLAGNs) based on only MIR data. Here, we propose that the time variation of MIR color (K-corrected W1-W2 after subtracting the quiescent fluxes) is a promising probe. With an optically selected sample containing TDEs, ambiguous nuclear transients (ANTs), and CLAGNs, we studied the MIR color variation of their MIR counterparts using NEOWISE-R data. We found that the MIR color of TDEs and ANTs turns red faster than CLAGNs during the rising phase, and TDEs have a redder color than ANTs at the earliest phase. The former may be caused by the difference between the ultraviolet light curves of TDEs/ANTs and CLAGNs, or be related to no or relatively weak underlying AGN in TDEs/ANTs, while the latter may be related to the difference in the dust geometry. Based on color variation rate, we selected high-probability TDE, ANT, and CLAGN candidates from MIR outbursts in samples of Jiang et al. (2021) and Masterson et al. (2024). We found that both samples are mixtures of TDEs/ANTs and CLAGNs. For MIR outbursts whose hosts are not Seyfert galaxies, we estimated that $\sim50\%-80\%$ are TDEs and inferred a rate of infrared TDEs of $1.5-2.8\times10^{-5}$ galaxy$^{-1}$ yr$^{-1}$, comparable with that of optical TDEs. The rest are CLAGNs, suggesting the presence of weak AGNs that cannot be identified using common diagnoses. We predicted that with our method, a large amount of dust-obscured TDEs could be selected from future infrared surveys with higher data quality and cadence.</description>

      <title>Period-Luminosity Relations for Galactic Type II Cepheids in the Sloan bands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10532v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Type II Cepheids (T2Ceps), alongside RR Lyrae stars, serve as important distance indicators for old population II stars due to their period-luminosity (PL) relations. However, studies of these relations in the Sloan photometric system are rather limited in the literature. Our goal is to calibrate PL relations (and their counterparts in Wesenheit magnitudes) in the Sloan-Pan-STARRS gP1rP1iP1 bands for Galactic T2Ceps located in the vicinity of the Sun. We collected data for 16 T2Ceps of the BLHer type and 17 of the WVir type using 40 cm telescopes of the Las Cumbres Observatory Global Telescope Network. Geometric parallaxes were adopted from Gaia Data Release 3. We have calibrated PL and period-Wesenheit relations for Milky Way BLHer and WVir stars in the solar neighborhood, as well as for a combined sample of both types. The relationships derived here will allow to determine the distances to T2Ceps that will be discovered by the Legacy Survey of Space and Time survey and, in turn, to probe the extended halo of the Milky Way, as well as the halos of nearby galaxies. To the best of our knowledge, the relations derived in this study are the first for Milky Way T2Ceps in the Sloan bands.</description>

      <title>A FLASH on Blazars: Capturing the Radio Realm of 4FGL Blazars with SKAO Pathfinders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10811v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work investigates the multi-wavelength properties of 165 4FGL blazars from the Fermi-LAT fourth source catalogue, looking for with counterparts in the Australian SKA Pathfinder (ASKAP) First Large Absorption Survey in HI (FLASH) continuum. Using high-resolution data from FLASH and complementary radio datasets, combined with archival Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) observations, we perform detailed spectral energy distribution (SED) analyses across cm-to-mm wavelengths. Our findings reveal that most blazars exhibit re-triggered peaked spectra, indicative of emission dominated by a single emitting region. Additionally, we identify strong correlations between radio and gamma-ray luminosities, highlighting the significant role of relativistic jets in these active galactic nuclei. The inclusion of spectroscopic redshifts from Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and Gaia enables a comprehensive analysis of the evolutionary trends and physical characteristics of the sources. Furthermore, we report a tight Radio-X-ray Correlation for Flat Spectrum Radio Quasars, contrasting with the more scattered behaviour observed in BL-Lacs, reflecting their distinct accretion and jet-driving mechanisms. These results provide critical insights into the physics of blazars and their environments, paving the way for future studies with next-generation facilities like the SKA Observatory (SKAO) for radio observations and Cherenkov Telescope Array for gamma-ray studies.</description>
