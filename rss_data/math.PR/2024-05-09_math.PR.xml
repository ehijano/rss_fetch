      <title>Precise large deviation for stationary sequence of branching process with immigration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04835v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is known that there exists the stationary sequence of branching process with immigration $\{X_{n}\}_{n\in\mathbb{Z}}$ under some conditions (Foster and Williamson (1971)), when the offspring is critical or subcritical. A precise large deviation probability for the partial sum $S_{n}=X_{1}+\cdots+X_{n}$ is specified, the significant difference is revealed for the critical and subcritical cases.</description>

      <title>Gaussian consensus processes and their Lyapunov exponents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a simple dynamic model of opinion formation, in which a finite population of individuals hold vector-valued opinions. At each time step, each individual's opinion moves towards the mean opinion but is then perturbed independently by a centred multivariate Gaussian random variable, with covariance proportional to the covariance matrix of the opinions of the population. We establish precise necessary and sufficient conditions on the parameters of the model, under which all opinions converge to a common limiting value. Asymptotically perfect correlation emerges between opinions on different topics. Our results are rigorous and based on properties of the partial products of an i.i.d. sequence of random matrices. Each matrix is a fixed linear combination of the identity matrix and a real Ginibre matrix. We derive an analytic expression for the maximal Lyapunov exponent of this product sequence. We also analyze a continuous-time analogue of our model.</description>

      <title>Small ball probability for multiple singular values of symmetric random matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04999v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $A_n$ be an $n\times n$ random symmetric matrix with $(A_{ij})_{i&lt; j}$ i.i.d. mean $0$, variance 1, following a subGaussian distribution and diagonal elements i.i.d. following a subGaussian distribution with a fixed variance. We investigate the joint small ball probability that $A_n$ has eigenvalues near two fixed locations $\lambda_1$ and $\lambda_2$, where $\lambda_1$ and $\lambda_2$ are sufficiently separated and in the bulk of the semicircle law. More precisely we prove that for a wide class of entry distributions of $A_{ij}$ that involve all Gaussian convolutions (where $\sigma_{min}(\cdot)$ denotes the least singular value of a square matrix), $$\mathbb{P}(\sigma_{min}(A_n-\lambda_1 I_n)\leq\delta_1n^{-1/2},\sigma_{min}(A_n-\lambda_2 I_n)\leq\delta_2n^{-1/2})\leq c\delta_1\delta_2+e^{-cn}.$$ The given estimate approximately factorizes as the product of the estimates for the two individual events, which is an indication of quantitative independence. The estimate readily generalizes to $d$ distinct locations. As an application, we upper bound the probability that there exist $d$ eigenvalues of $A_n$ asymptotically satisfying any fixed linear equation, which in particular gives a lower bound of the distance to this linear relation from any possible eigenvalue pair that holds with probability $1-o(1)$, and rules out the existence of two equal singular values in generic regions of the spectrum.</description>

      <title>Maximum of the Characteristic Polynomial of I.I.D. Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the leading order asymptotic of the maximum of the characteristic polynomial for i.i.d. matrices with real or complex entries. In particular, this result is new even for real Ginibre matrices, which was left as an open problem in [arXiv:2303.09912]; the complex Ginibre case was covered in [arXiv:1902.01983]. These are the first universality results for the non--Hermitian analog of the first order term of the Fyodorov--Hiary--Keating conjecture. Our methods are based on constructing a coupling to the branching random walk via Dyson Brownian motion. In particular, we find a new connection between real i.i.d. matrices and inhomogeneous branching random walk.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The decreasing Markov chain on \{1,2,3, \ldots\} with transition probabilities $p(j,j-i) \propto 1/i$ arises as a key component of the analysis of the beta-splitting random tree model. We give a direct and almost self-contained "probability" treatment of its occupation probabilities, as a counterpart to a more sophisticated but perhaps opaque derivation using a limit continuum tree structure and Mellin transforms.</description>

      <title>A multiple coupon collection process and its Markov embedding structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05203v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The embedding problem of Markov transition matrices into Markov semigroups is a classic problem that regained a lot of impetus and activities in recent years. We consider it here for the following generalisation of the well-known coupon collection process: from a finite set of distinct objects, a subset is drawn repeatedly according to some probability distribution, independently and with replacement, and each time united with the set of objects sampled so far. We derive and interpret properties and explicit conditions for the resulting discrete-time Markov chain to be representable within a semigroup or a flow of a continuous-time process of the same type.</description>

      <title>Semi-infinite particle systems with exclusion interaction and heterogeneous jump rates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study semi-infinite particle systems on the one-dimensional integer lattice, where each particle performs a continuous-time nearest-neighbour random walk, with jump rates intrinsic to each particle, subject to an exclusion interaction which suppresses jumps that would lead to more than one particle occupying any site. Under appropriate hypotheses on the jump rates (uniformly bounded rates is sufficient) and started from an initial condition that is a finite perturbation of the close-packed configuration, we give conditions under which the particles evolve as a single, semi-infinite "stable cloud". More precisely, we show that inter-particle separations converge to a product-geometric stationary distribution, and that the location of every particle obeys a strong law of large numbers with the same characteristic speed.</description>

      <title>Isomorphisms between random $d$-hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04670v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We characterize the size of the largest common induced subgraph of two independent random uniform $d$-hypergraphs of different sizes with $d\geq 3$. More precisely, its distribution is asymptotically concentrated on two points, and we obtain as a consequence a phase transition for the inclusion of the smallest hypergraph in the largest one. This generalizes to uniform random $d$-hypergraphs the results of Chatterjee and Diaconis for uniform random graphs.
  Our proofs rely on the first and second moment methods.</description>

      <title>On linear-combinatorial problems associated with subspaces spanned by $\{\pm 1\}$-vectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05082v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A complete answer to the question about subspaces generated by $\{\pm 1\}$-vectors, which arose in the work of I.Kanter and H.Sompolinsky on associative memories, is given. More precisely, let vectors $v_1, \ldots , v_p,$ $p\leq n-1,$ be chosen at random uniformly and independently from $\{\pm 1\}^n \subset {\bf R}^n.$ Then the probability ${\mathbb P}(p, n)$ that $$span \ \langle v_1, \ldots , v_p \rangle \cap \left\{ \{\pm 1\}^n \setminus \{\pm v_1, \ldots , \pm v_p\}\right\} \ne \emptyset \ $$ is shown to be $$4{p \choose 3}\left(\frac{3}{4}\right)^n + O\left(\left(\frac{5}{8} + o_n(1)\right)^n\right) \quad \mbox{as} \quad n\to \infty,$$ where the constant implied by the $O$-notation does not depend on $p$. The main term in this estimate is the probability that some 3 vectors $v_{j_1}, v_{j_2}, v_{j_3}$ of $v_j$, $j= 1, \ldots , p,$ have a linear combination that is a $\{\pm 1\}$-vector different from $\pm v_{j_1}, \pm v_{j_2}, \pm v_{j_3}. $</description>

      <title>Full error analysis of the random deep splitting method for nonlinear parabolic PDEs and PIDEs with infinite activity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05192v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a randomized extension of the deep splitting algorithm introduced in [Beck, Becker, Cheridito, Jentzen, and Neufeld (2021)] using random neural networks suitable to approximately solve both high-dimensional nonlinear parabolic PDEs and PIDEs with jumps having (possibly) infinite activity. We provide a full error analysis of our so-called random deep splitting method. In particular, we prove that our random deep splitting method converges to the (unique viscosity) solution of the nonlinear PDE or PIDE under consideration. Moreover, we empirically analyze our random deep splitting method by considering several numerical examples including both nonlinear PDEs and nonlinear PIDEs relevant in the context of pricing of financial derivatives under default risk. In particular, we empirically demonstrate in all examples that our random deep splitting method can approximately solve nonlinear PDEs and PIDEs in 10'000 dimensions within seconds.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05223v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that the Harnack inequality fails for nonlocal kinetic equations. Such equations arise as linearized models for the Boltzmann equation without cutoff and are of hypoelliptic type. We provide a counterexample for the simplest equation in this theory, the fractional Kolmogorov equation. Our result reflects a purely nonlocal phenomenon since the Harnack inequality holds true for local kinetic equations like the Kolmogorov equation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2111.10875v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $N_n(a, b)$ denote the number of real zeros of Gaussian elliptic polynomials of degree $n$ on the interval $(a, b)$, where $a$ and $b$ may vary with $n$. We obtain a precise formula for the variance of $N_n(a, b)$ and utilize this expression to derive an asymptotic expansion for large values of $n$. Furthermore, we provide sharp estimates for the cumulants and central moments of $N_n(a, b)$. These estimates are instrumental in establishing sufficient conditions on the interval $(a, b)$ for $N_n(a, b)$ to satisfy both a central limit theorem and a strong law of large numbers. In the second part of the paper, we extend our analysis to nondegenerate Gaussian analytic functions, including well-known examples such as the Gaussian Weyl series and Weyl polynomials.</description>

      <title>The half-space log-Gamma polymer in the bound phase</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.10960v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the log-Gamma polymer in the half-space with bulk weights distributed as $\operatorname{Gamma}^{-1}(2\theta)$ and diagonal weights as $\operatorname{Gamma}^{-1}(\alpha+\theta)$ for $\theta&gt;0$ and $\alpha&gt;-\theta$. We show that in the bound phase, i.e., when $\alpha\in (-\theta,0)$, the endpoint of the polymer lies within an $O(1)$ stochastic window of the diagonal. This result gives the first rigorous proof of the pinned phenomena for the half-space polymers in the bound phase conjectured by Kardar(1985). We also show that the limiting quenched endpoint distribution of the polymer around the diagonal is given by a random probability mass function proportional to the exponential of a random walk with log-Gamma type increments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.05979v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Building on the work of Arizmendi and Celestino (2021), we derive the $*$-distributions of polynomials in monotone independent and infinitesimally monotone independent elements. For non-zero complex numbers $\alpha$ and $\beta$, we derive explicitly the $*$-distribution of $p_{\alpha,\beta}=\alpha ab + \beta ba$ whenever $a$ and $b$ are monotone or infinitesimally monotone independent elements. This encompasses both cases of the commutator and anti-commutator. This approach can be pushed to study more general polynomials. As applications, we derive the limiting distribution with respect to the partial trace of polynomials in a certain class of random matrices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.10625v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A soft random graph $G(n,r,p)$ can be obtained from the random geometric graph $G(n,r)$ by keeping every edge in $G(n,r)$ with probability $p$. The soft random simplicial complexes is a model for random simplicial complexes built over the soft random graph $G(n,r,p)$. This new model depends on a probability vector $\rho$ which allows the simplicial complexes to present randomness in all dimensions. In this article, we use a normal approximation theorem to prove central limit theorems for the number of $k$-faces and for the Euler's characteristic for soft random simplicial complexes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.16021v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The critical beta-splitting tree, introduced by Aldous, is a Markov branching phylogenetic tree of poly-logarithmic height. Recently, by a technical analysis, Aldous and Pittel proved, amongst other results, a central limit theorem for the height $H_n$ of a random leaf.
  We give an alternative proof, via contraction methods for random recursive structures. These techniques were developed by Neininger and R\"uschendorf, motivated by Pittel's article "Normal convergence problem? Two moments and a recurrence may be the clues." Aldous and Pittel estimated the first two moments of $H_n$, with great precision. We show that a limit theorem follows, and bound the distance from normality.</description>

      <title>Strong solutions to McKean-Vlasov SDEs associated to a class of degenerate Fokker-Planck equations with coefficients of Nemytskii-type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18918v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While the nondegenerate case is well-known, there are only few results on the existence of strong solutions to McKean-Vlasov SDEs with coefficients of Nemytskii-type in the degenerate case. We consider a broad class of degenerate nonlinear Fokker-Planck(-Kolmogorov) equations with coefficients of Nemytskii-type. This includes, in particular, the classical porous medium equation perturbed by a first-order term with initial datum in a subset of probability densities, which is dense with respect to the topology inherited from $L^1$, and, in the one-dimensional setting, the classical porous medium equation with initial datum in an arbitrary point $x\in\mathbb{R}$. For these kind of equations the existence of a Schwartz-distributional solution $u$ is well-known. We show that there exists a unique strong solution to the associated degenerate McKean-Vlasov SDE with time marginal law densities $u$. In particular, every weak solution to this equation with time marginal law densities $u$ can be written as a functional of the driving Brownian motion.
  Moreover, plugging any Brownian motion into this very functional yields a weak solution with time marginal law densities $u$.</description>

      <title>Competing bootstrap processes on the random graph $G(n,p)$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00363v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a generalization of classic bootstrap percolation in which two competing processes concurrently evolve on the same graph $G(n,p)$. Nodes can be in one of three states, conveniently represented by different colors: red, black and white. Initially, a given number $a_R$ of active red nodes (red seeds) are selected uniformly at random among the $n$ nodes. Similarly, a given number $a_B$ of active black nodes (black seeds) are selected uniformly at random among the other $n-a_R$ nodes. All remaining nodes are initially white (inactive). White nodes wake up at times dictated by independent Poisson clocks of rate 1. When a white node wakes up, it checks the state of its neighbors: if the number of red (black) neighbors exceeds the number of black (red) neighbors by a fixed amount $r \geq 2$, the node becomes an active red (black) node, and remains so forever. The parameters of the model are, besides $r$ (fixed) and $n$ (tending to $\infty$), the numbers $a_R$ ($a_B$) of initial red (black) seeds, and the edge existence probability $p=p(n)$. We study the size $A^*_R$ ($A^*_B$) of the final set of active red (black) nodes, identifying different regimes which are analyzed under suitable time-scales, allowing us to obtain detailed (asymptotic) temporal dynamics of the two concurrent activation processes.</description>

      <title>Equidistribution of high traces of random matrices over finite fields and cancellation in character sums of high conductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.01344</link>

Abstract: Let $g$ be a random matrix distributed according to uniform probability measure on the finite general linear group $\mathrm{GL}_n(\mathbb{F}_q)$. We show that $\mathrm{Tr}(g^k)$ equidistributes on $\mathbb{F}_q$ as $n \to \infty$ as long as $\log k=o(n^2)$ and that this range is sharp. We also show that nontrivial linear combinations of $\mathrm{Tr}(g^1),\ldots, \mathrm{Tr}(g^k)$ equidistribute as long as $\log k =o(n)$ and this range is sharp as well. Previously equidistribution of either a single trace or a linear combination of traces was only known for $k \le c_q n$, where $c_q$ depends on $q$, due to work of the first author and Rodgers.
  We reduce the problem to exhibiting cancellation in certain short character sums in function fields. For the equidistribution of $\mathrm{Tr}(g^k)$ we end up showing that certain explicit character sums modulo $T^{k+1}$ exhibit cancellation when averaged over monic polynomials of degree $n$ in $\mathbb{F}_q[T]$ as long as $\log k = o(n^2)$. This goes far beyond the classical range $\log k =o(n)$ due to Montgomery and Vaughan. To study these sums we build on the argument of Montgomery and Vaughan but exploit additional symmetry present in the considered sums.</description>

      <title>Multilevel Monte Carlo methods for the Dean-Kawasaki equation from Fluctuating Hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.08872v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Stochastic PDEs of Fluctuating Hydrodynamics are a powerful tool for the description of fluctuations in many-particle systems. In this paper, we develop and analyze a Multilevel Monte Carlo (MLMC) scheme for the Dean--Kawasaki equation, a pivotal representative of this class of SPDEs. We prove analytically and demonstrate numerically that our MLMC scheme provides a significant reduction in computational cost (with respect to a standard Monte Carlo method) in the simulation of the Dean--Kawasaki equation. Specifically, we link this reduction in cost to having a sufficiently large average particle density, and show that sizeable cost reductions can be obtained even when we have solutions with regions of low density. Numerical simulations are provided in the two-dimensional case, confirming our theoretical predictions.
  Our results are formulated entirely in terms of the law of distributions rather than in terms of strong spatial norms: this crucially allows for MLMC speed-ups altogether despite the Dean--Kawasaki equation being highly singular.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics of the five-vertex model with scalar-product boundary conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.17565v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the homogeneous five-vertex model on a rectangle domain of the square lattice with so-called scalar-product boundary conditions. Peculiarity of these boundary conditions is that the configurations of the model are in an one-to-one correspondence with the 3D Young diagrams limited by a box of a given size. We address the thermodynamics of the model using a connection of the partition function with the $\tau$-function of the sixth Painlev\'e equation. We compute an expansion of the logarithm of the partition function to the order of a constant in the size of the system. We find that the geometry of the domain is crucial for phase transition phenomena. Two cases need to be considered separately: one is where the region has an asymptotically square shape and the second one is where it is of an arbitrary rectangle, but not square, shape. In the first case there are three regimes, which can be attributed to dominance in the configurations of a ferroelectric order, disorder, and anti-ferroelectric order. In the second case the third regime is absent.</description>
