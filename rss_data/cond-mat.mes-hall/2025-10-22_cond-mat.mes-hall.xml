      <title>Magnon scattering and transduction in Coulomb-coupled quantum Hall ferromagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18974v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The magnetization field of a quantum Hall ferromagnet (QHFM) can host a variety of spin textures, including skyrmions and magnons. When projected into the lowest Landau level with $\nu = 1$ filling, the topological (Pontryagin) charge density of the magnetization field is proportional to the electric charge density, allowing for long-range spin-spin interactions. Inspired by recent experimental developments that enable all-electrical magnon generation and detection, in this work we theoretically demonstrate two phenomena that can occur due to Coulomb interactions that are unique to QHFMs: magnons can scatter off of point charges at a distance, and skyrmions can act as transmitters and receivers for magnons to be transduced between separate layers of a bilayer QHFM. The latter Coulomb-mediated spin drag effect occurs at arbitrary distance and could facilitate long-range magnonics, such as detection of spin waves for future experiments in 2D materials.</description>

      <title>iDART: Interferometric Dual-AC Resonance Tracking nano-electromechanical mapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM) has established itself as a very successful and reliable imaging and spectroscopic tool for measuring a wide variety of nanoscale electromechanical functionalities. Quantitative imaging of nanoscale electromechanical phenomena requires high sensitivity while avoiding artifacts induced by large drive biases. Conventional PFM often relies on high voltages to overcome optical detection noise, leading to various non-ideal effects including electrostatic crosstalk, Joule heating, and tip-induced switching. To mitigate this situation, we introduce interferometrically detected, resonance-enhanced dual AC resonance tracking (iDART), which combines femtometer-scale displacement sensitivity of quadrature phase differential interferometry with contact resonance amplification. Through this combination, iDART achieves 10x or greater signal-to-noise improvement over current state of the art PFM approaches including both single frequency interferometric PFM or conventional, resonance enhanced PFM using optical beam detection. In this work, we demonstrate a &gt;10x improvement of imaging sensitivity on PZT and Y-HfO. Switching spectroscopy shows similar improvements, where further demonstrates reliable hysteresis loops at small biases, mitigating nonlinearities and device failures that can occur at higher excitation amplitudes. These results position iDART as a powerful approach for probing conventional ferroelectrics with extremely high signal to noise down to weak piezoelectric systems, extending functional imaging capabilities to thin films, 2D ferroelectrics, beyond-CMOS technologies and bio-materials.</description>

      <title>Sliding Disassembly of van der Waals Heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many recent advances in our understanding of two-dimensional (2D) electron systems stem from van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures. The assembly process relies on the weak bonding across interfaces between layered vdW compounds, making it possible to construct exceptionally clean heterostructures from chemically and structurally distinct materials - a challenging task for traditional thin-film growth techniques. Here we demonstrate an additional, dynamic degree of freedom afforded by vdW interfaces, wherein we use microstructured polymer stamps to disassemble and reconfigure vdW heterostructures by sliding. We apply this technique to alter the dielectric environment of monolayer graphene, perform scanning tunneling microscopy on semiconducting and air-sensitive monolayers, and manipulate strain-sensitive moir\'e materials. Together these demonstrations suggest a new paradigm for assembling and dynamically modifying van der Waals heterostructures, with the potential to reveal new insights into 2D electron systems.</description>

      <title>Control of out-of-plane anti-damping spin torque with a canted ferromagnetic spin source</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To achieve efficient anti-damping switching of nanoscale magnetic memories with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy using spin-orbit torque requires that the anti-damping spin-orbit torque have a strong out-of-plane component. The spin anomalous Hall effect and the planar Hall effect spin current produced by a ferromagnetic layer are candidate mechanisms for producing such an out-of-plane anti-damping torque, but both require that the magnetic moment of the spin source layer be canted partly out of the sample plane at zero applied magnetic field. Here we demonstrate such a canted configuration for a ferromagnetic SrRuO3 layer and we characterize all vector components of the torque that it produces, including non-zero out-of-plane anti-damping torques. We verify that the out-of-plane spin component can be tuned by the orientation of magnetic moment, with significant contributions from both the spin anomalous Hall effect and the planar Hall effect spin current.</description>

      <title>Mapping the twist angle dependence of quasi-Brillouin zones in doubly aligned graphene/BN heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19369v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When monolayer graphene is crystallographically aligned to hexagonal boron nitride (BN), a moir\'e superlattice is formed, producing characteristic satellite Dirac peaks in the electronic band structure. Aligning a second BN layer to graphene creates two coexisting moir\'e patterns, which can interfere to produce periodic, quasi-periodic or non-periodic superlattices, depending on their relative alignment. Here, we investigate one of the simplest realizations of such a double-moir\'e structure, graphene encapsulated between two BN layers, using dynamically rotatable van der Waals heterostructures. Our setup allows \textit{in situ} control of the top BN alignment while keeping the bottom BN fixed. By systematically mapping the charge transport as a function of BN angular alignment, we identify the simultaneous signatures of the original moir\'es, super-moir\'es, and a third set of features corresponding to quasi-Brillouin zones (qBZ) formed when the system's periodicity becomes ill-defined. Comparing our measurements with theoretical models, we provide the first experimental mapping of the qBZs as a function of angular alignment. Our results establish a direct experimental link between moir\'e interference and qBZ formation, opening new avenues for engineering electronic structures in multi-aligned 2D heterostructures.</description>

      <title>Relation between structure and functionality in photosynthetic antenna complex of green sulfur bacteria: efficiency under natural sunlight pumping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large-scale simulations of light-matter interaction in natural photosynthetic antenna complexes of the Chlorobium Tepidum green sulfur bacteria (GSB) containing more than one hundred thousand chlorophyll molecules, comparable with natural size, have been performed. Here we have modeled the entire process of the exciton energy transfer, from sunlight absorption to exciton trapping in the reaction centers (RCs) in presence of a thermal bath. The energy transfer has been analyzed using the radiative non-Hermitian Hamiltonian and solving the rate equations for the populations. Sunlight pumping has been modeled as black-body radiation with an attenuation factor that takes the Sun-Earth distance into account. Cylindrical structures typical of GSB antenna complexes, and the dimeric baseplate comparable to natural size have been considered. Our analysis shows that under natural sunlight, in photosynthetic antennae of GSB the number of excitations reaching the RC per unit time matches the RC closure rate and the internal efficiency shows values close to $\sim 80\%$. We also considered cylindrical structures where the orientation of the dipoles does not reflect the natural one. Specifically, we vary continuously the angle of the transition dipole with respect to the cylinder main axis, focusing on the case where all dipoles are parallel to the cylinder axis. We also consider the important case where the dipoles are randomly oriented. In all cases the light-harvesting efficiency is lower than in the natural structure, showing the high sensitivity of light harvesting to the specific orientation of the dipole moments. Our results allow for a better understanding of the relationship between structure and functionality in photosynthetic antennae of GSB and could drive the design of efficient light-harvesting devices.</description>

      <title>Thermal Hall conductivity of semi-metallic graphite dominated by ambipolar phonon drag</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is now known that in addition to electrons, other quasi-particles such as phonons and magnons can also generate a thermal Hall signal. Graphite is a semimetal with extremely mobile charge carriers of both signs and a large lattice thermal conductivity. We present a study of the thermal Hall effect in highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG) samples with electronic, phononic and phonon drag contributions to the thermal Hall signal. The measured thermal Hall conductivity ($\kappa_{xy}$) is two orders of magnitude higher than what is expected by electronic carriers according to the electrical Hall conductivity and the Wiedemann-Franz law, yielding a record Hall Lorenz number of $164.9\times10^{-8}V^2 K^{-2}$ ($\sim$67$L_0$) - the largest ever observed in a metal. The temperature dependence of the thermal Hall conductivity significantly differs from its longitudinal counterpart, ruling out a purely phononic origin of the non-electronic component. Based on the temperature dependence and the amplitudes of the Seebeck and Nernst responses, we demonstrate that ambipolar phonon drag dominates the thermal Hall response of graphite.</description>

      <title>Universal non-Hermitian valley filtering via uniform dissipation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19588v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Valley, as a ubiquitous degree of freedom in lattices, has found wide applications in both electronic and classical-wave devices in recent years. However, achieving valley-polarized states, a prerequisite for valley-based operations, still remains challenging. Here, we propose and experimentally demonstrate a universal non-Hermitian mechanism for valley filtering using only uniform background dissipation, which creates a propagation length contrast between valleys through their intrinsic group velocity differences. We implement this concept in an acoustic crystal, observing switchable and robust valley polarization of sound through large-scale field mapping. Remarkably, our approach is solely based on uniform loss, without the need for any special lattice structures, tailored excitations, or external fields. We further provide designs of our non-Hermitian valley filter on photonic and electronic platforms. Our results offer a simple and effective solution to valley-polarized state generation and may advance the development of novel valley-based devices in both classical and quantum regimes.</description>

      <title>Direct visualization of gate-tunable flat bands in twisted double bilayer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The symmetry-broken correlated states in twisted double bilayer graphene (TDBG) can be tuned via several external knobs, including twist angle, displacement field, and carrier density. However, a direct, momentum-resolved characterization of how these parameters reshape the flat-band structure remains limited. In this study, we employ micro focused angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy to investigate the flat-band dispersion of TDBG at a twist angle of 1.6, systematically varying the displacement field and carrier density via electrostatic gating. We directly observe multiple flat moir'e minibands near charge neutrality, including a flat remote valence band residing below the low-energy flat-band manifold. Furthermore, the dominant Coulomb repulsive energy over the flat- band bandwidth suggests favorable conditions for the emergence of interaction-driven correlated phenomena in TDBG. These findings establish that the formation and evolution of flat bands in TDBG arises from the interplay between the electron filling and the displacement field.</description>

      <title>Single-Scale Magnetoelastic Landau Quantization: Thermodynamics, Quantum Oscillations, and Metrology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a unified, single-scale description of thermodynamics and quantum oscillations in electronic systems with a uniform areal density of screw dislocations under a uniform magnetic field. A single tunable gap, $\hbar|\omega_{eff}|$ with $\omega_{eff}=\omega_{c}+\omega_{cl}$, organizes all equilibrium observables obtained from a compact harmonic-oscillator partition function: free energy, internal energy, entropy, heat capacity, magnetization, magnetic susceptibility, and magnetocaloric responses collapse onto universal hyperbolic kernels in $x=\hbar|\omega_{eff}|/(2k_{B}T)$. We identify a compensated-field regime where the transverse gap closes and the heat capacity reaches an equipartition plateau, providing a sharp signature of magnetoelastic interference. In transport and torque, the same scale rigidly shifts the Hall fan and compresses the $1/B$ period of de Haas-van Alphen and Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations when expressed in $1/B_{eff}$, enabling a phase-unwarping protocol that metrologizes the dislocation density from a single field sweep. In mesoscopic samples, boundary corrections to the Landau degeneracy generate finite-size calorimetric oscillations that diagnose the effective magnetic length. Moderate disorder and weak interactions preserve the kernel structure while smoothing amplitudes. We outline an experimental roadmap combining on-chip calorimetry, torque magnetometry, and transport, and discuss device-level opportunities in caloritronics and strain engineering, magnetocaloric microcooling, magnetoelastic heat switching, and dilatometric transduction, where the single scale $\hbar|\omega_{eff}|$ enables rational design and optimization.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Ising machine based on phase-locking of an auto-oscillator to a bi-harmonic external driving with noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19648v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a universal theory of phase auto-oscillators driven by a bi harmonic signal (having frequency components close to single and double of the free-running oscillator frequency) with noise. With it, we show how deterministic phase locking and stochastic phase slips can be continuously tuned by varying the relative amplitudes and frequencies of the driving components. Using, as an example, a spin-torque nano-oscillator, we numerically validate this theory by implementing a deterministic Ising machine paradigm, a probabilistic one, and dual-mode operation of the two. This demonstration introduces the concept of adaptive Ising machines (AIM), a unified oscillator-based architecture that dynamically combines both regimes within the same hardware platform by properly tuning the amplitudes of the bi-harmonic driving relative to the noise strength. Benchmarking on different classes of combinatorial optimization problems, the AIM exhibits complementary performance compared to oscillator based Ising machines and probabilistic Ising machines, with adaptability to the specific problem class. This work introduces the first OIM capable of transitioning between deterministic and probabilistic computation taking advantage of a proper design of the trade-off between the strength of phase-locking of an auto-oscillator to a bi harmonic external driving and noise, opening a path toward scalable, CMOS compatible hardware for hybrid optimization and inference.</description>

      <title>Spin-Locked Helical Currents and Pure Spin Pumping in Altermagnetic Nanotubes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19700v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that rolling a two-dimensional altermagnet into a nanotube turns it into a spin-programmable chiral nanosolenoid with two reciprocal, SOC-free functionalities. (i) Direct: injecting a single-spin-polarized current produces a steady helical current whose handedness is locked to the spin orientation, yielding opposite axial magnetic fields for opposite spins. (ii) Inverse: a time-varying axial flux Phi(t) induces a circumferential Faraday field E_theta = -(dPhi/dt)/(2 pi R) that drives equal-magnitude, opposite-sign axial charge currents in the two spin channels, Iz^up = - Iz^down, thereby pumping a pure spin current Is = (hbar/2e)(Iz^up - Iz^down) with zero net charge flow. Both effects arise from the interplay between momentum-odd spin polarization inherent to altermagnets and the screw symmetry of the rolled geometry, and persist in the complete absence of spin-orbit coupling. Using V2Se2O as a prototype, first-principles calculations reveal spin-dependent chiral wave functions near both the conduction- and valence-band edges. These results establish a nonrelativistic route toward compact spin-controlled flux generators and charge-neutral spin injectors in light-element materials without static magnetic bias.</description>

Abstract: Modern mechanical sensors increasingly measure motion with precision sufficient to resolve the fundamental thermal noise floor over a broad band. Compared to traditional sensors -- achieving this limit only near resonance -- this capability provides massive gains in acquisition rates along with access to otherwise obscured transient signals. However, these stronger measurements of motion are naturally accompanied by increased back-action. Here we show how resolving the broadband thermal noise spectrum reveals back-action-induced correlations in the noise from many mechanical modes, even those well-separated in frequency. As a result, the observed spectra can deviate significantly from predictions of the usual single-mode and (uncorrelated) multimode models over the broad band, notably even at the mechanical resonance peaks. This highlights that these effects must be considered in all systems exhibiting measurement back-action, regardless of whether the resonances are spectrally isolated or the readout noise is high enough that the noise peaks appear consistent with simpler models. Additionally, these correlations advantageously allow the thermal noise spectrum to reach a minimum -- equivalent to that of a single mode -- in a band far from the resonance peak, where the mechanical susceptibility is comparatively stable against frequency noise.</description>

      <title>Memory Effects in Time-Modulated Radiative Heat Transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19378v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a general theory of radiative heat exchange between dipoles with time-modulated optical properties. This framework extends fluctuational electrodynamics beyond equilibrium by incorporating nonstationary correlations and memory effects induced by temporal modulation. Closed-form expressions for the heat currents in modulated many-body systems are obtained, together with a generalized Landauer-like formulation of the pairwise exchanges, where the transmission coefficient accounts for all inelastic frequency-conversion channels. Near-resonant modulation redistributes and amplifies thermal fluctuations across Floquet sidebands, acting as a parametric amplifier of thermal radiation and enabling active, frequency-selective control of nanoscale heat transfer.</description>

      <title>Mechanism of the electrochemical hydrogenation of graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19505v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The electrochemical hydrogenation of graphene induces a robust and reversible conductor-insulator transition, of strong interest in logic-and-memory applications. However, its mechanism remains unknown. Here we show that it proceeds as a reduction reaction in which proton adsorption competes with the formation of H2 molecules via an Eley-Rideal process. Graphene's electrochemical hydrogenation is up to $10^6$ times faster than alternative hydrogenation methods and is fully reversible via the oxidative desorption of protons. We demonstrate that the proton reduction rate in defect-free graphene can be enhanced by an order of magnitude by the introduction of nanoscale corrugations in its lattice, and that the substitution of protons for deuterons results both in lower potentials for the hydrogenation process and in a more stable compound. Our results pave the way to investigating the chemisorption of ions in 2D materials at high electric fields, opening a new avenue to control these materials' electronic properties.</description>

      <title>Atomic displacements drive flat band formation and lateral electron and hole separation in near-60 degree twisted MoSe2/WSe2 bilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19596v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) bilayers with an interlayer twist exhibit a moire super-period, whose effects can manifest in both structural and electronic properties. Atomic displacements can lead to reconstruction into domains of aligned stacking, and flat bands can form that may host correlated electron states. In heterobilayers angular mismatch is nearly unavoidable, so understanding the consequences of an interlayer twist is essential. Using ab initio density functional theory, we find that in near-60 degree twisted MoSe2/WSe2 bilayers valence and conduction band flat bands emerge at ~3 degree twist. Despite relatively limited reconstruction at these angles, atomic displacement creates a polarization gradient that forms a confining potential, localizing and laterally separating electrons and holes within the moire supercell. Excitons formed from flat band electrons and holes should therefore have not only the out-of-plane dipole moment familiar from MoSe2/WSe2 interlayer excitons, but an in-plane dipole moment as well.</description>

      <title>Twisted superconducting quantum diodes: Towards anharmonicity and high fidelity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19627v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As quantum technologies advance, a fundamental challenge is mitigating noise and backscattering in superconducting circuits to achieve scalable, high-fidelity operations. Conventional superconducting components lack directionality, causing energy loss and decoherence. Superconducting diodes, that allow dissipationless current in one direction and resistive flow in the other, offer a potential remedy, yet their efficiency and quantum integration remain limited. Here, we realize a quantum diode in twisted NbSe2 bilayers under in-plane and out-of-plane magnetic fields. A mere 1 degree twist yields an efficiency enhancement over pristine devices, reaching 27.6 percent. Quantum simulations reveal that this intermediate efficiency, well below 100 percent ideal, is both experimentally practical and optimal for preserving qubit anharmonicity and stabilizing two-level systems. These findings show that maximal rectification is not always beneficial for quantum information, establishing a new principle for designing the fundamental properties of twisted superconductors towards low-power, high-fidelity quantum circuits.</description>

      <title>Extracting transport coefficients from local ground-state currents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19742v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transport properties are central to characterizing quantum matter, yet their extraction typically requires external forcing and time-resolved measurements. In this work, we propose a scheme to access transport coefficients directly from measurements of local, static ground-state currents -- quantities readily accessible in quantum-engineered platforms. By exploiting the exponential decay of correlations in gapped systems and the finite velocity of correlation spreading, we demonstrate that the local Hall response can be reconstructed from a small set of quasi-local current observables. We derive explicit relations connecting these static observables to a practical local Chern marker, and introduce a scalable digital protocol for measuring the required generalized currents in cold-atom quantum simulators. Numerical simulations of a non-interacting Chern insulator validate our approach. Moreover, the scheme extends naturally to fractional Chern insulators and other strongly correlated systems, even at finite temperature, offering a broadly applicable route to probing transport in engineered quantum matter.</description>

      <title>Magnetizing weak links by time-dependent spin-orbit interactions: momentum conserving and non-conserving processes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18961v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Rashba spin-orbit interactions generated by time-dependent electric fields acting on weak links (that couple together non-magnetic macroscopic leads) can magnetize the junction. The Rashba spin-orbit interaction that affects the spins of electrons tunneling through the weak links changes their momentum concomitantly. We establish the connection between the magnetization flux induced by processes that conserve the momentum and the magnetization created by tunneling events that do not. Control of the induced magnetization can be achieved by tuning the polarization of the AC electric field responsible for the spin-orbit Rashba interaction (e.g., from being circular to linear), by changing the applied bias voltage, and by varying the degree of a gate voltage-induced asymmetry of the device.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.21450v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a six-band $\mathbf{k} \cdot \mathbf{p}$ model to describe the electronic structure and optical response of chiral multifold semimetals, such as RhSi. By means of invariants method we construct the effective Hamiltonian describing the states near the $\Gamma$-point of the Brillouin zone where the spin-orbit coupling and $\mathbf{k}$-linear Rashba terms, which are crucial for circular photogalvanic effect, are taken into account. The model is parameterized using tight-binding calculations. We compute the interband absorption spectrum, showing a linear-in-frequency dependence at low energies and a resonant feature near the spin-orbit splitting energy. Furthermore, we calculate the circular photogalvanic effect. In agreement with previous works the current generation rate at low frequencies exhibits a quantized low-frequency response, governed by the universal value $|\mathcal{C}| = 4$ for the effective topological charge. Our results provide an analytical framework for understanding the role of Rashba coupling and topology in the optoelectronic properties of multifold chiral semimetals.</description>

      <title>Fractional Thouless pumping of solitons: a unique manifestation of bulk-edge correspondence of nonlinear eigenvalue problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.08016v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent foundational studies have established the bulk-edge correspondence for nonlinear eigenvalue problems using auxiliary eigenvalues $\hat{H}\Psi=\omega S(\omega)\Psi$, spanning both linear [T. Isobe et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 132, 126601 (2024)] and nonlinear [Chenxi Bai and Zhaoxin Liang, Phys. Rev. A. 111, 042201 (2025)] Hamiltionians. This progress prompts a fundamental question: Can eigenvalue nonlinearity generate observable physical phenomena absent in conventional approaches ($\hat{H}\Psi=E\Psi$)? In this work, we address this question by demonstrating the first uniquely nonlinear manifestation of the bulk-edge correspondence: fractional Thouless pumping of solitons. Through systematic investigation of nonlinear Thouless pumping in an extended Rice-Mele model incorporating next-nearest-neighbor (NNN) couplings, we uncover that NNN interaction parameters can induce fractional topological phases|even in the presence of quantized topological invariants as predicted by conventional linear approaches. Crucially, these fractional phases are naturally explained within the auxiliary eigenvalue framework, directly linking nonlinear spectral characteristics to the bulk-boundary correspondence. Our findings reveal novel emergent phenomena arising from the interplay between nonlinearity and NNN couplings, providing key insights for the design of topological insulators and the controlled manipulation of quantum edge states in nonlinear regimes.</description>

Abstract: ABACUS (Atomic-orbital Based Ab-initio Computation at USTC) is an open-source software for first-principles electronic structure calculations and molecular dynamics simulations. It mainly features density functional theory (DFT) and molecular dynamics functions and is compatible with both plane-wave basis sets and numerical atomic orbital basis sets. ABACUS serves as a platform that facilitates the integration of various electronic structure methods, such as Kohn-Sham DFT, stochastic DFT, orbital-free DFT, and real-time time-dependent DFT, etc. In addition, with the aid of high-performance computing, ABACUS is designed to perform efficiently and provide massive amounts of first-principles data for generating general-purpose machine learning potentials, such as DPA models. Furthermore, ABACUS serves as an electronic structure platform that interfaces with several AI-assisted algorithms and packages, such as DeePKS-kit, DeePMD, DP-GEN, DeepH, DeePTB, HamGNN, etc.</description>

      <title>Enhancing the Performances of Autonomous Quantum Refrigerators via Two-Photon Transitions</title>

Abstract: Conventional autonomous quantum refrigerators rely on uncorrelated heat exchange between the working system and baths via two-body interactions enabled by single-photon transitions and positive-temperature work baths, inherently limiting their cooling performance. Here, we introduce distinct qutrit refrigerators that exploit correlated heat transfer via two-photon transitions with the hot and cold baths, yielding a genuine enhancement in performance over conventional qutrit refrigerators that employ uncorrelated heat transfer. These refrigerators achieve at least a twofold enhancement in cooling power and reliability compared to conventional counterparts. Moreover, we show that cooling power and reliability can be further enhanced simultaneously by several folds, even surpassing existing cooling limits, by utilizing a synthetic negative-temperature work bath. Such refrigerators can be realized by combining correlated heat transfer and synthetic work baths, which consist of a four-level system coupled to hot and cold baths and two conventional work baths via two independent two-photon transitions. Here, the composition of two work baths effectively creates a synthetic negative-temperature work bath under suitable parameter choices. Additionally, our autonomous refrigerators with negative temperature baths significantly outperform previously studied autonomous and non-autonomous refrigerators in terms of cooling ability without requiring any additional energy resources, as they cool the cold bath to much lower temperature, which is forbidden for others refrigerators. Our results demonstrate that correlated heat transfers and baths with negative temperatures can yield thermodynamic advantages in quantum devices. Finally, we discuss the experimental feasibility of the proposed refrigerators across various existing platforms.</description>

      <title>Asymmetric Effects Underlying Dynamic Heterogeneity in Miscible Blends of Poly(methyl methacrylate) with Poly(ethylene oxide)</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.12143v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The emergence of spatially variable local dynamics, or dynamic heterogeneity, is common in multicomponent polymer systems. Although often attributed to differences in the intrinsic dynamics of each component, the molecular origin of their coupling and its dependencies remain unclear. Here, we use molecular dynamics simulations of polyethylene oxide (PEO)/poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) blends, across the full range of compositions and multiple thermal regimes, to characterize local fluctuations and sub-chain relaxations for both PEO and PMMA. By constructing probability distributions of local composition and computing entropic measures, we connect nanoscale heterogeneity to differences in mobility between PEO and PMMA, extending beyond mean-field treatments. While PMMA segmental fluctuations in blends broadly align with $T_\text{g}$-equivalent neat PMMA systems, PEO exhibits enhanced mobility correlated with increased free volume and broader, more diverse local compositions upon blending. Rouse-mode analysis, used to probe relaxation dynamics over different length scales, shows that PEO relaxation approaches neat-like behavior in PEO-rich domains, whereas PMMA relaxation accelerates uniformly across all mode numbers. Given the local mobility enhancement of PMMA by PEO, this uniform shift suggests a nanoscale facilitation process that extends PEO's influence beyond its immediate environment. These findings link the statistics of local compositional heterogeneity to dynamic asymmetry across length scales, provide physical insight into the behavior of this archetypal blend system, and establish a framework for analyzing dynamic coupling in others.</description>

      <title>Observation of relativistic domain wall motion in amorphous ferrimagnets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.13950v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Domain walls in ferrimagnets and antiferromagnets behave as relativistic sine-Gordon solitons with the spin-wave group velocity setting the ultimate velocity of domain walls and speed of magnetic devices. While this relativistic regime has been achieved in crystalline ferrimagnets, they cannot be routinely integrated in devices. To enable technological breakthroughs, relativistic dynamics must be demonstrated in easy-to-integrate ferrimagnets such as rare-earth -- transition-metal alloys. However, this scenario remains elusive due to the inherent magnetic disorder of these materials, complex spin-wave spectra, and challenges in modeling their ultrafast dynamics. Here, we demonstrate relativistic domain wall motion in amorphous ferrimagnetic GdFeCo devices operated in the proximity of the angular momentum compensation point. The current-induced domain wall velocity saturates within 10% of the spin-wave speed of 2 km/s, a behavior consistent with relativistic model of domain wall motion. Our observation of relativistic dynamics in technologically relevant ferrimagnets opens the way to magnetic devices operating at the ultimate speed limit.</description>

      <title>General Many-Body Perturbation Framework for Moir\'e Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.19764v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Moir\'e superlattices host a rich variety of correlated topological states, including interaction-driven integer and fractional Chern insulators. A common approach to study interacting ground states at integer fillings is the Hartree-Fock mean-field method. However, this method neglects dynamical correlations, which often leads to an overestimation of spontaneous symmetry breaking and fails to provide quantitative descriptions of single-particle excitations. This work introduces a general many-body perturbation framework for moir\'e systems, combining all-band Hartree-Fock calculations with random phase approximation (RPA) correlation energies and $GW$ quasiparticle corrections. We apply this framework to hexagonal boron nitride aligned rhombohedral pentalayer graphene and magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene. We show that incorporating RPA correlation energy and $GW$ self-energy corrections yields phase diagrams and single-particle spectra that quantitatively align with experimental measurements. Our versatile framework provides a systematic beyond-mean-field approach applicable to generic moir\'e systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.18209v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In condensed matter physics, a broad spectrum of physical characteristics, such as chirality, axiality, and polarity, arises as a direct consequence of the underlying symmetry of the system. We here theoretically investigate the effective coupling between chirality and axiality at their domain boundaries, mediated by polarity. Based on symmetry considerations and model analyses, we propose the concept of chirality-induced axiality via surface polarization, which refers to a phenomenon where the handedness of chirality selects an axial moment with a particular orientation by lowering its energy at the surface. We further establish the inverse process, termed axiality-induced chirality via surface polarization, whereby axiality in turn dictates the preferred chirality. These reciprocal couplings open a new pathway for stabilizing single-domain states of chirality and axiality. They further imply interfacial functionalities, including the selective adsorption of chiral and axial molecules.</description>
