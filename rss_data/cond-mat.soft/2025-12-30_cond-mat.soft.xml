      <title>Unveiling the CO2 Hydrate Phase Diagram from Computer Simulation: Locating the Hydrate-Liquid-Vapor Coexistence and its Upper Quadruple Point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22389v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Carbon dioxide (CO2) hydrates hold promising applications in capturing and separating CO2 for climate change mitigation. Understanding their behavior at the molecular level is therefore essential, and computer simulations have become powerful tools for exploring their formation and stability, providing valuable insights into their underlying mechanisms. In this work, we perform molecular dynamics simulations to compute the three-phase coexistence line involving the stability region where CO2 is in the vapor phase: CO2 hydrate - liquid water - vapor. This computation was previously inaccessible using the traditional three-phase direct coexistence technique. To achieve this, we employ a novel solubility-based method, which allows us to accurately evaluate the coexistence line. Finally, we have determined the upper quadruple point (Q2) where the four phases, namely hydrate, liquid water, liquid CO2, and vapor, coexist. Our pioneering result for the Q2 value shows remarkable agreement with experimental observations, validating the accuracy of our findings and representing a significant milestone in the field of gas hydrate research.</description>

      <title>A dynamical trap made of target-tracking chasers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a dynamical trapping system composed of multiple chasers subject to target-tracking forces utilizing the velocity and position information of a single escaping target. To successfully capture the target, dividing chasers into multiple groups while each group approaching its assigned destination in the proper vicinity of the target is essential. Moving direction synchronization between the target and its chasers is crucial to the capturing process, while guiding chasers to the predicted position of the target in future only improves the efficiency of capture but is not indispensable. Potential applications of our trapping system include capturing live animals such as bears invading a human residential area.</description>

      <title>Thermally Activated Non-Affine Rearrangements in Amorphous Glass: Emergence of Intrinsic Length Scales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a systematic study of temperature-driven nonaffine rearrangements in a model amorphous solid across the full thermodynamic range, from a high-temperature liquid, through supercooled and sub-glass regimes, into deep glassy states. The central result is a quantitative characterisation of the componentwise nonaffine residual displacements, obtained by subtracting local affine maps from particle displacements. For each state point the tails of the probability distributions of these nonaffine components display clear exponential decay; linear fits to the logarithm of the tail region yield characteristic nonaffine length scales {\xi}NA,x and {\xi}NA,y , which quantify the spatial extent of purely nonaffine, local rearrangements. To compare with other length scales, we compute van Hove distributions Gx(ux), Gy (uy ) which capture the full particle displacement field (coherent affine-like motion plus residuals). A robust, key finding is that the van Hove length scale consistently exceeds the filtered nonaffine length scale, i.e. {\xi}VH &gt; {\xi}NA, across all temperatures, state points, and densities we studied. The nonaffine length {\xi}NA quantifies the distance over which complex deformation occurs, specifically nonlinear and anharmonic responses, irreversible (plastic) rearrangements, topological non-recoverable particle rearrangements, and other residual motions that cannot be represented by a local affine map. Moreover, near equality of {\xi}NA,x and {\xi}NA,y in all conditions provides further evidence that nonaffine rearrangements propagate isotropically under thermally driven deformation in contrast to externally driven shear.</description>

      <title>Scaled charges for ions: an improvement but not the final word for modeling electrolytes in water</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22571v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we discuss the use of scaled charges when developing force fields for NaCl in water. We shall develop force fields for Na$^+$ and Cl$^-$ using the following values for the scaled charge (in electron units) : 0.75, 0.80, 0.85, 0.92 along with the TIP4P/2005 model of water (for which previous force fields were proposed for q = 0.85 and q = 1). The properties considered in this work are: densities, structural properties, transport properties, surface tension, freezing point depression and maximum in density. All the developed models were able to describe quite well the experimental values of the densities. Structural properties were well described by models with charges equal or larger than 0.85, surface tension by the charge 0.92, maximum in density by the charge 0.85 and transport properties by the charge 0.75. The use of a scaled charge of 0.75 is able to reproduce with high accuracy the viscosities and diffusion coefficients of NaCl solutions by the first time. We have also considered the case of KCl in water and the results obtained were fully consistent with those of NaCl. There is no value of the scaled charge able to reproduce all the properties considered in this work. Although certainly scaled charges are not the final word in the development of force fields for electrolytes in water its use may have some practical advantages. Certain values of the scaled charge could be the best option when the interest is to describe certain experimental properties.</description>

      <title>Dissociation Line and Driving Force for Nucleation of the Multiple Occupied Hydrogen Hydrate from Computer Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22583v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we determine the dissociation temperature of the hydrogen (H$_2$) hydrate by computer simulation using two different methods. In both cases, the molecules of water and H$_2$ are modeled using the TIP4P/Ice and a modified version of the Silvera and Goldman models respectively, and the Berthelot combining rule for the cross water-H$_2$ interactions has been modified. The first method used in this work is the solubility method which consists in determining the solubility of H$_2$ in an aqueous phase when in contact with a H$_2$ hydrate (H--L$_{\text{w}}$) phase and when in contact with a pure H$_2$ phase (L$_{\text{w}}$--L$_{\text{H}_2}$) at different temperatures. At a given pressure value, both solubility curves intersect at the temperature ($T_3$) at which the three phases coexist in equilibrium. Following this approach, we determine the dissociation temperature of the H$_2$ hydrate at $185\,\text{MPa}$ finding a good agreement with the data previously reported in the literature. We also analyze the effect of the multiple occupancy of the D, or small, and H, or large, cages of the sII hydrate structure. We conclude that the $T_3$ value is barely affected by the occupancy of the H$_2$ hydrate at $185\,\text{MPa}$. From the analysis of the solubility curves and performing extra bulk simulations of the three phases involved in the equilibrium, we also determine the driving force for nucleation ($\Delta\mu^{\text{EC}}_{N}$) at $185\,\text{MPa}$ as a function of the supercooling degree and the H$_2$ hydrate occupancy. We determine that, thermodynamically, the most favored occupancy of the H$_2$ hydrate consists of 1 H$_2$ molecule in the D cages and 3 in the H cages (named as 1-3 occupancy).</description>

      <title>Geometry-controlled Onset of Inertial Drag in Granular Impact</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The impact of solid intruders into granular media is commonly described by a combination of quasi-static resistance and an inertial drag force proportional to the square of the impact speed. While intruder geometry is known to influence force magnitudes, its role in controlling the onset of inertial drag has remained largely unexplored. Here we present systematic impact experiments using conical intruders spanning a wide range of apex angles. By measuring the peak acceleration during impact, we show that the emergence of a well-defined inertial response depends sensitively on cone geometry. Blunt cones exhibit quadratic scaling with impact speed over the full range of velocities studied, whereas sharper cones display a delayed transition to inertial behavior at higher speeds. We define a geometry-dependent crossover speed marking the onset of the inertial regime and find that it scales approximately linearly with the cone angle through $\tan\phi$. Once the inertial regime is established, the peak force collapses when rescaled by $\tan\phi$, indicating that cone geometry controls the effective momentum transfer to the grains. These results demonstrate that intruder geometry governs not only the magnitude of inertial drag, but also the impact speed at which it becomes dominant.</description>

      <title>Epigenetic state encodes locus-specific chromatin mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22820v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chromatin is repeatedly deformed in vivo during transcription, nuclear remodeling, and confined migration - yet how mechanical response varies from locus to locus, and how it relates to epigenetic state, remains unclear. We develop a theory to infer locus-specific viscoelasticity from three-dimensional genome organization. Using chromatin structures derived from contact maps, we calculate frequency-dependent storage and loss moduli for individual loci and establish that the mechanical properties are determined both by chromatin epigenetic marks and organization. On large length scales, chromatin exhibits Rouse-like viscoelastic scaling, but this coarse behavior masks extensive heterogeneity at the single-locus level. Loci segregate into two mechanical subpopulations with distinct longest relaxation times: one characterized by single-timescale and another by multi-timescale relaxation. The multi-timescale loci are strongly enriched in active marks, and the longest relaxation time for individual loci correlates inversely with effective local stiffness. Pull-release simulations further predict a time-dependent susceptibility: H3K27ac-rich loci deform more under sustained forcing yet can resist brief, large impulses. At finer genomic scales, promoters, enhancers, and gene bodies emerge as "viscoelastic islands" aligned with their focal interactions. Together, these results suggest that chromatin viscoelasticity is an organized, epigenetically coupled property of the 3D genome, providing a mechanistic layer that may influence enhancer-promoter communication, condensate-mediated organization, and response to cellular mechanical stress. The prediction that locus-specific mechanics in chromatin are controlled by 3D structures as well as the epigenetic states is amenable to experimental test.</description>

      <title>Myofibroblasts slow down defect recombination dynamics in mixed cell monolayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cellular organization and mechanotransduction pathways are crucial regulators of tissue morphogenesis, whereas their dysregulation contributes to pathologies. Overactive fibroblasts, or myofibroblasts, are key drivers of fibrosis, yet how their presence alters collective cellular ordering remains unclear. Inspired by the analogy between liquid crystals and cells, we investigate how topological defects influence reorganization in dense monolayers of co-cultured fibroblasts and myofibroblasts. Owing to steric interactions, these elongated cells exhibit local order; topological defects, where alignment is disrupted, have been postulated to serve as mechanical centers. In this study, we examine how the incorporation of contractile myofibroblasts impacts defect relaxation. The behavior is reminiscent of active nematics with quenched disorder: myofibroblast concentration modulates the disorder strength; increasing their fraction slows defect recombination. Higher myofibroblast concentrations similarly reduce the overall cell alignment on microgrooved surfaces, as myofibroblasts interfere with monolayer reorganization. This observation highlights the potential of a simple, quantitative assay for diagnosing disease progression. Furthermore, we found that myofibroblasts preferentially localize at negatively charged -1/2 defects, compared to fibroblasts, which tend to be localized in +1/2 defects. Consequently, the slowdown of recombination dynamics can be partially attributed to the reduced velocity of the more mobile +1/2 defects. Our study suggests that myofibroblasts can exploit negatively charged defects by avoiding regions of compressive stress and evading apoptosis. Combining live-cell imaging and immunofluorescence studies, this work provides insights into the role of topological defects in fibrotic disease progression.</description>

      <title>Understanding the mechanisms of supported lipid membrane reshaping into tubular networks using quantitative DIC microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Biological membranes are known to form various structural motifs, from lipid bilayers to tubular filaments and networks facilitating e.g. adhesion and cell-cell communication. To understand the biophysical processes underpinning lipid-lipid interactions in these systems, synthetic membrane models are crucial. Here, we demonstrate the formation of tubular networks from supported lipid membranes of controlled lipid composition on glass. We quantify tube radii using quantitative differential interference contrast (qDIC) and propose a biophysical mechanism for the formation of these structures, regulated by surface tension and lipid exchange with connected supported membranes. Two lipid types are investigated, namely DOPC and DC15PC, exhibiting a liquid disordered and a solid ordered phase at room temperature, respectively. Tube formation is studied versus temperature, revealing bilamellar layers retracting and folding into tubes upon DC15PC lipids transitioning from liquid to solid phase, which is explained by lipid transfer from bilamellar to unilamellar layers. This study introduces a novel model system for bilayer tubes, allowing to elucidate the biophysics of lipid-lipid interactions governing lipid membrane reshaping into tubular structures, important for our understanding of biological membrane filaments.</description>

      <title>Inverse Bauschinger to Bauschinger Crossover under Steady Shear in Amorphous Solids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23313v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Directional memory in amorphous solids is commonly quantified through the Bauschinger effect, yet the observation of the inverse Bauschinger effect suggests that the sign of memory can invert, pointing to distinct underlying plastic organization. Here, we connect directional memory to the nature of yielding in steadily sheared amorphous solids. Using simulations of two-dimensional polydisperse glasses, we show that the type of directional memory (Bauschinger versus inverse Bauschinger) is jointly controlled by deformation history, strain rate, and parent temperature. We identify a critical history amplitude $\gamma_{N,\mathrm{crit}}(T_p,\dot{\gamma})$ and construct a phase diagram that delineates regimes with memory inversion from those showing only conventional Bauschinger response. Microscopically, memory inversion correlates with network-like shear-band morphology and plastic healing, whereas conventional memory is associated with persistent localization and cumulative damage. These results establish directional memory as an order parameter for a shear-rate and annealing-controlled brittle-ductile crossover and suggest that plastic healing provides a generic route to memory inversion in disordered solids.</description>

      <title>An elasto-viscoplastic thixotropic model for fresh concrete capturing flow-rest transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The flow properties of fresh concrete are critical in the construction industry, as they directly affect casting quality and the durability of the final structure. Although non-Newtonian fluid models, such as the Bingham model, are widely used to model these flow properties, they often fail to capture key phenomena, including flow stoppage, and frequently rely on non-physical regularization or stabilization techniques to mitigate numerical instabilities at low shear rates. To address these limitations, this study proposes an elasto-viscoplastic constitutive model within the continuum mechanics framework, which treats fresh concrete as a solid-like material with a rate-dependent yield stress. The model inherently captures the transition from elastic response to viscous flow following Bingham rheology, and vice versa, enabling accurate prediction of flow cessation without ad-hoc criteria. Additionally, a thixotropy evolution law is incorporated to account for the time-dependent behavior resulting from physical flocculation and shear-induced deflocculation. The proposed model is implemented within the Material Point Method (MPM), whose Lagrangian formulation facilitates tracking of history-dependent variables and robust simulation of large deformation flows. Numerical examples demonstrate the model's effectiveness in reproducing a range of typical concrete flow scenarios, offering a more physically consistent numerical tool for optimizing concrete construction processes and minimizing defects.</description>

      <title>Exploring phase transitions and thermal dynamics in nanoconfined liquid crystals using liquid-phase TEM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23588v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nanoconfined liquid crystals (LCs) and their nanocomposites are driving the next generation of photonic applications. Consequently, deepening our understanding of mesophase stability, defect topology, and the dynamic response of LCs at the nanoscale requires the development of novel characterization approaches. This motivates us to perform in situ observations on model 4'-octyl-4-cyanobiphenyl (8CB) LC using liquid-phase scanning transmission electron microscopy (LP-STEM). We find that the electron beam induced consecutive phase changes from smectic A to nematic (SmA-N) and from nematic to isotropic (N-I). The kinetic dependence of the phase transition on dose rate shows that the time between SmA-N and N-I shortens with increasing rate, revealing the hypothesis that a higher electron dose rate increases the energy dissipation rate, leading to substantial heat generation in the sample. We report on the spontaneous formation of disclinations, ordering effects, and complete process reversibility. Radiolytic effects of the electron beam are discussed in detail, and additional experiments with external heating indicate that the observed phenomena are mainly thermal in nature. The results are supported by calculations of heat diffusion, suggesting the nanoconfined 8CB differs significantly in thermal properties compared to the bulk one. This is the first detailed study of LC phase transitions using LP-STEM, which paves the way for further studies of nanoconfined LCs and for the development of the technique for advanced LC materials research.</description>

      <title>Predicting random close packing of binary hard-disk mixtures via third-virial-based parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23613v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a simple and accurate approach to estimate the random close packing (RCP) fraction of binary hard-disk mixtures. By introducing a parameter based on the reduced third virial coefficient of the mixture, we show that the RCP fraction depends nearly linearly on this parameter, leading to a universal collapse of simulation data across a wide range of size ratios and compositions. Comparisons with previous models by Brouwers and Zaccone demonstrate that our approach provides the most consistent and accurate predictions. The method can be naturally extended to polydisperse mixtures with continuous size distributions, offering a robust framework for understanding the universality of RCP in hard-disk systems.</description>

Abstract: Anisotropic intensity distributions on nanostructured surfaces and polarization-sensitive spectra have been observed in a number of nanoscale infrared spectroscopic imaging methods, including nano-FTIR [Bakir et al., Molecules, 2020, 25, 4295], photothermal induced resonance (PTIR) [Waeytens et al., Analyst, 2021, 146], tapping AFM-IR [Hondl et al., ACS Meas. Sci. Au, 2025, 5, 469; Luo et al., APL, 2022, 121, 23330], infrared photoinduced force microscopy (PiF-IR) [Anindo et al., JPCC, 2025, 129, 4517; Shcherbakov et al., Rev Methods Primers, 2025, 5, 1; Ali et al., Anal. Chem., 2025, 97, 23914] and peak force infrared microscopy (PFIR) [Xie et al., JPCC, 2022, 126, 8393; Anindo, JPCC, 2025]. A recent work combining modeling and experiment demonstrated that the hybrid field coupling of the IR illumination E0 with a polymer nanosphere and a metallic AFM probe is nearly as strong as the plasmonic coupling in case of a gold nanosphere [Anindo, JPCC, 2025]. For p-polarized illumination, this results in enhanced IR absorption on the surface perpendicular to the propagation of E0 which can explain the observed anisotropic intensity distribution. An additional anisotropy may be introduced by aligned surface molecules with oriented vibrational transition moments [Bakir et al., Molecules, 2020, 25, 4295; Luo, APL, 2022]. PiF-IR is strongly surface sensitive combining an unprecedented spatial resolution &lt; 5 nm with high spectral resolution [Shcherbakov, Rev Methods Primers, 2025; Ali, Anal. Chem., 2025], which allows, for example, to visualize nanoscale chemical variation on the surface of bacteria cells affected by antimicrobial interaction [Ali, Anal. Chem., 2025]. We compare PiF-IR hyperspectra of aligned perylene Langmuir Blodgett monolayers on nanostructured and planar gold substrates and use quantum chemical calculations of the oriented vibrational oscillators to interpret the observations.</description>

      <title>Structural changes in the Lennard-Jones supercooled liquid and ideal glass: an improved integral equation for the replica method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22548v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Framing the glass formation within standard statistical mechanics is an outstanding problem of condensed matter theory. To provide new insight, we investigate the structural properties of the Lennard-Jones fluid in the very-low temperature regime, by using a replicated version of the refined HMSA theory of the liquid state, combined with an appropriate split of the pair potential [Bomont and Bretonnet, J. Chem. Phys. 114, 4141 (2001)]. Our scheme allows one to reach an unprecedented low-temperature domain within both the supercooled liquid and the ideal-glass phase. Therein, a density-dependent temperature is identified, whereupon the radial distribution function experiences clear-cut structural changes, insofar as an additional peak develops in between the main and the second peaks. Such a structural feature points to a local structure of the Lennard-Jones ideal glass with an fcc-like short-range order, in the absence of any long-range order.</description>

      <title>Unravelling 2,4-D -- biochar interactions by molecular dynamics: adsorption modes and surface functionalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22573v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report a molecular dynamics investigation of 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) adsorption at the aqueous-biochar interface using experimentally constrained woody biochar models representative of softwood-derived biochars produced at 400, 600 and 800 ${\deg}$C. The models reproduce experimental descriptors (H/C, O/C, aromaticity, true density, and surface functionality) of their experimental counterparts, and simulations enable calculation of adsorption isotherms that align with available experimental measurements. Our results reveal that 2,4-D$^{-}$ uptake is governed by a synergy of three interaction classes: (i) ${\pi}$-${\pi}$ and ${\pi}$-Cl contacts with graphitic domains with either parallel or perpendicular alignments, (ii) polar interactions including H-bonding to surface -OH and other oxygen-containing groups, and (iii) Na$^{+}$-mediated cation bridging that links 2,4-D$^{-}$ anion to surface oxygens, that would have an increasing relevance for biochars near or above the pH at point of zero charge. Notably, we found that low-temperature produced biochars, which retain higher densities of surface O functionalities, exhibit higher adsorption per unit surface area due to cooperative polar interactions alongside ${\pi}$-${\pi}$ binding, whereas medium-to-high temperature biochars rely more on ${\pi}$-${\pi}$ and cation-bridging mechanisms. The distinct adsorption distances measured emphasize surface heterogeneity and porosity. Taken together, these atomistic insights corroborate experimental observations and yield actionable guidance for the rational design of biochars for remediation of anionic herbicides, highlighting how surface functionality and solution chemistry can be tuned to optimize sorption. Our approach provides a general framework to interrogate pollutant-biochar interactions and to inform remediation strategies.</description>

      <title>Crystalline Motion of discrete interfaces in the Blume-Emery-Griffiths Model: partial wetting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22870v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We continue the variational study of the discrete-to-continuum evolution of lattice systems of Blume-Emery-Griffith type which model two immiscible phases in the presence of a surfactant. In our previous work \cite{CFS}, we analyzed the case of a completely wetted crystal and described how the interplay between surfactant evaporation and mass conservation leads to a transition between crystalline mean curvature flow and pinned evolutions. In the present paper, we extend the analysis to the regime of partial wetting, where the surfactant occupies only a portion of the interface. Within the minimizing-movements scheme, we rigorously derive the continuum evolution and show how partial wetting introduces a complex coupling between interfacial motion and redistribution of surfactant. The resulting evolution exhibits new features absent in the fully wetted case, including the coexistence of moving and pinned facets or the emergence and long-lived metastable states. This provides, to our knowledge, the first discrete-to-continuum variational description of partially wetted crystalline interfaces, bridging the gap between microscopic lattice models and experimentally observed surfactant-induced pinning phenomena in immiscible systems.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetically-Induced Transparency Bridges Disconnected Light-Harvesting Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23272v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The energy-transfer efficiency of the natural photosynthesis system seems to be perfectly optimized during the evolution for millions of years. However, how to enhance the efficiency in the artificial light-harvesting systems is still unclear. In this paper, we investigate the energy-transfer process in the photosystem I (PSI). When there is no effective coupling between the outer antenna (OA) and the reaction center (RC), the two light-harvesting networks are disconnected and thus the energy transfer is inefficient. In order to repair these disconnected networks, we introduce a bridge with three sites between them. We find that by modulating the level structure of the 3-site bridge to be resonant, the energy transfer via the dark state will be enhanced and even outperform the original PSI. Our discoveries may shed light on the designing mechanism of artificial light-harvesting systems.</description>

      <title>Phase-field modeling of multicomponent vesicles in viscoelastic fluid</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.23315v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multicomponent vesicles suspended in viscoelastic fluids are crucial for understanding a variety of physiological processes. In this work, we develop a continuum surface force (CSF) phase-field model to investigate the hydrodynamics of inextensible multicomponent vesicles in viscoelastic fluid flows with inertial forces. Our model couples a fluid field comprising both Newtonian and Oldroyd-B fluids, a surface concentration field representing the multicomponent distribution on the vesicle membrane, and a phase-field variable governing the membrane evolution. The viscoelasticity effect of extra stress is well incorporated into the full Navier-Stokes equations in the fluid field. The surface concentration field is determined by Cahn-Hilliard equations, while the membrane evolution is governed by a nonlinear advection-diffusion equation. The membrane is coupled to the surrounding fluid through the continuum surface force (CSF) framework. To ensure stable numerical solutions of the highly nonlinear multi-field model, we employ a residual-based variational multiscale (RBVMS) method for the Navier-Stokes equations, a Streamline-Upwind Petrov-Galerkin (SUPG) method for the Oldroyd-B equations, and a standard Galerkin finite element framework for the remaining equations. The system of PDEs is solved using an implicit, monolithic scheme based on the generalized-$\alpha$ time integration method. To enhance spatial accuracy, we employ isogeometric analysis (IGA). We present a series of two-dimensional numerical examples in shear and Poiseuille flows to elucidate the influence of membrane composition and fluid viscoelasticity on the hydrodynamics of multicomponent vesicles.</description>

      <title>Patterns of active dipolar particles in external magnetic fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17641v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Active particles with a (magnetic) dipole moment are of interest for steering self-propelled motion, but also result in novel collective effects due to their dipole-dipole interaction. Here systems of active dipolar particles are studied with Brownian dynamics simulations to systematically characterize the different patterns they form, specifically in the presence of an external (magnetic) field. The combination of three types of order - clustering, orientational alignment and chain formation - is used to classify the patterns observed in these systems. In the presence of an external field, oriented chains and bands are found to be dominant. These structures show some similarities with columnar cluster seen in (passive) ferrofluids and display columnar spacing and number of lanes per cluster that both decrease with increasing field strength.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Wetting by Concentrated Granular Suspensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.01762v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many functional materials, such as paints and inks used in applications like coating and 3D printing, are concentrated granular suspensions. In such systems, the contact line dynamics and the internal structure of the suspension interact through shear rate dependent viscosity and microstructural rearrangements. The local shear rate increases sharply near moving contact lines, leading to the non-Newtonian rheology of dense suspensions in this region. While hydrodynamic solutions can describe dilute suspensions, their applicability near advancing contact lines in dense suspensions remains unclear. This study quantifies the deviation from the Newtonian solution by systematically varying interparticle interactions through the choice of dispersion medium. We use silica particles suspended in two refractive index-matched fluids: (i) aqueous 2,2'-thiodiethanol (weak interactions) and (ii) aqueous sodium thiocyanate solution (strong interactions). These systems exhibit substantially different rheological responses, shear-thickening and yield-stress behaviour, respectively. Using astigmatism particle tracking velocimetry (APTV), we resolve the three-dimensional trajectories of tracer particles within a drop driven over a substrate, in an arrangement enabling tracking the internal flows over a long travel distance of the drop. We observe distinct flow behaviours depending on the particle interactions and the resulting suspension rheology. The more the particle interactions play a role, i.e., the more pronounced the non-Newtonian effects are, the stronger the measured flow profiles differ from the Newtonian solution to the hydrodynamic equations. In the shear-thickening suspension, a notable deviation from Newtonian behaviour is observed. Conversely, the yield-stress suspension exhibits plug flow over the substrate, with Newtonian-like behaviour restricted to the yielded region near the substrate.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.18000v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The study of active solids offers a window into the mechanics and thermodynamics of dense living matter. A key aspect of the non-equilibrium dynamics of such active systems is a mechanistic description of how the underlying mechano-chemical couplings arise, which cannot be resolved in models that are phenomenologically constructed. Here, we follow a bottom-up theoretical approach to develop a thermodynamically consistent active solid (TCAS) model, and uncover a non-trivial cross-talk that naturally ensues between mechanical response and dissipation. In particular, we show that dissipation reaches a maximum at finite stresses, while it is inhibited under large stresses, effectively reverting the system to a passive state. Our findings establish a generic mechanism plausibly responsible for the non-monotonic behaviour observed in recent experimental measurements of entropy production rate in an actomyosin material and enzymatic activity in crowded condensates.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.22398v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The coalescence of liquid lenses is relevant in various applications, including inkjet printing and fog harvesting. However, the dynamics of liquid-lens coalescence have been relatively underexplored, particularly in the case of liquid lenses with larger contact angles. We numerically investigate the coalescence of low-viscosity liquid lenses by means of the pseudopotential multi-component lattice Boltzmann method over a wide range of contact angles. In two-dimensional simulations, our numerical results on the growth of the bridge height are in quantitative agreement with experimental measurements for small contact angles. In addition, by comparing our simulation results with a theoretical approach based on the thin-sheet equations for liquid lenses, we find that the thin-sheet equations accurately capture the bridge-growth dynamics up to contact angles of approximately $\theta &lt; 40^{\circ}$. For the three-dimensional case, the growth of the bridge radius is independent of the equilibrium contact angle of the liquid lenses at the initial stage of growth. The dependency between the growth of the bridge height and the bridge radius exhibits a non-linear to linear transition.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.16884v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent minimalist modeling has demonstrated that overdamped polar chiral active matter can support emergent, inviscid Euler turbulence, despite the system's strictly dissipative microscopic nature. In this article, we establish the statistical mechanical foundation for this emergent inertial regime by deriving a formal isomorphism between the model's agent dynamics and the overdamped Langevin equation for disordered Josephson junctions. We identify the trapped agent state as carrying non-dissipative phase rigidity supercurrents, a mapping we confirm empirically by demonstrating a disorder-broadened Adler-Ohmic crossover in the system's slip velocity. Generalizing this framework to three dimensions ($S^1\to S^2$), we show that the polar alignment interaction is geometrically equivalent to the Gilbert damping term in spintronics. This constraint naturally generates inertial spin waves (ferromagnetic magnons) from the overdamped active bath, recovering the macroscopic transport predicted by Toner-Tu theory without invoking microscopic inertia. These results classify chiral active matter as a dissipative spintronic fluid, revealing that the transition to active turbulence is the emergence of a topological quasiparticle gas, where macroscopic Onsager dipoles acquire effective inertia from the Goldstone modes of the underlying broken symmetry.</description>

      <title>An exact dimension-reduced dynamic theory for developable surfaces and curve-fold origami</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.19712v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Curve-fold origami, composed of developable panels joined along a curved crease, exhibits rich dynamic behaviors relevant to metamaterials and soft robotic systems. Despite multiple approximated models, a comprehensive and exact dynamical theory for curve-fold origami remains absent, limiting the precise predictions of its dynamics, especially for those with wide panels. In this work, we develop an exact dimension-reduced theory that focuses on the dynamics of curve-fold origami, utilizing the intrinsic one-dimensional nature of developable surfaces. Starting from a single developable surface, we investigate the kinematics and kinetic energy of a moving developable surface. By overcoming the difficulty of describing the motion of local frames, we derive the exact velocity field of wide surfaces solely described by the motion of the reference curve, which leads to the kinetic energy of the entire surface. Owing to the one-dimensional feature, the Lagrangian of the system, composed of both kinetic and elastic energy, is a functional of the reference curve. Thus, we may variate the Lagrangian and derive a nonlinear dynamical theory for the reference curve, which comprises governing equations similar to the rod model but can precisely describe the motion of developable surfaces. The theory is validated consistently in both Lagrangian and Eulerian frameworks and is further extended to curved-fold origami modeled as a coupled bi-rod system. Utilizing our exact 1D model, we theoretically analyze the dynamical behaviors of various developable structures, revealing that the coupling of curvature and torsion along with the motion of local frames in our theory leads to the accurate modeling of arbitrarily deformed developable surfaces, which are validated by finite element analysis quantitatively.</description>

      <title>Emergence of Friedel-like oscillations from Lorenz dynamics in walking droplets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.21049v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Friedel oscillations are spatially decaying density modulations near localized defects and are a hallmark of quantum systems. Walking droplets provide a macroscopic platform for hydrodynamic quantum analogs, and Friedel-like oscillations were recently observed in droplet-defect scattering through wave-mediated speed modulation [P.~J.~S\'aenz \textit{et al.}, \textit{Sci.\ Adv.} \textbf{6}, eay9234 (2020)]. Here we show that Friedel-like oscillatory statistics can also arise from a purely local dynamical mechanism, revealed using a minimal Lorenz model description of a walking droplet viewed as an active particle with internal degrees of freedom. A localized defect directly perturbs the particle's internal dynamical state, generating underdamped velocity oscillations that give rise to oscillatory ensemble position statistics. This work opens new avenues for hydrodynamic quantum analogs by revealing how quantum-like statistics can emerge from local internal-state dynamics of active particles.</description>

      <title>Transfer of active motion from medium to probe via the induced friction and noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03210v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Can activity be transmitted from smaller to larger scales? We report on such a transfer from a homogeneous active medium to a Newtonian spherical probe. The active medium consists of faster and dilute self-propelled particles, modeled as run-and-tumble particles in 1D or as active Brownian particles in 2D. We derive the reduced fluctuating dynamics of the probe, valid for arbitrary probe velocity, characterized by velocity-dependent friction and noise. In addition to a standard passive regime, we identify peculiar active regimes where the probe becomes self-propelled with high persistence, and its velocity distribution begets peaks at nonzero values. These features are quantitatively confirmed by numerical simulations of the joint probe-medium system. The emergence of active regimes depends not only on the far-from-equilibrium nature of the medium but also on the probe-medium coupling. Our findings reveal how, solely via the induced friction and noise, persistence can cross different scales to transfer active motion.</description>

      <title>Unifying same- and different-material particle charging through stochastic scaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23775v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Triboelectric charging of insulating particles through contact is critical in diverse physical and engineering processes, from dust storms and volcanic eruptions to industrial powder handling. However, many experiments over the years have consistently revealed counterintuitive charging patterns, including variable impact charge under identical conditions, charge sign reversal with repeated impacts, and bipolar charging of differently sized particles. Existing computational models cannot predict these patterns; they either rely on oversimplified heuristics or require inaccessible detailed surface properties. We present a stochastic scaling model (SSM) for particle charging that unifies same-material (particle-particle) and different-material (particle-wall) charging in a single theoretical framework. The model grounds in a physics-based stochastic closure by the mean, variance, skewness, and minimum impact charge measured in a highly-controlled reference experiment. To test the SSM, we implemented it in an open-source Lagrangian-Eulerian CFD solver. When simulating 300 000 insulating particles transported by turbulent wall-bounded flows, the SSM takes less than 0.01% of the CPU time. By scaling the statistical parameters of the reference impact to each collision, the new model reproduces the complex charging patterns observed in experiments without requiring surface-level first-principles inputs. The SSM offers a physically grounded route to large-scale simulations of electrostatic effects across many fields of particle-laden flows.</description>

      <title>Energetics-based model for a diffusiophoretic motion of a deformable droplet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09684v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct a mathematical model for a diffusiophoretic motion of a deformable droplet, which is floating at a liquid surface and is driven by the surface tension gradient originating from the surface concentration field of the chemicals that are emitted from the droplet. We define the free energy of the system by including the surface and line energies. From the calculation of the functional of the free energy, we obtain a mathematical model for the diffusiophoretic motion with deformation. By only considering the deformation of the second mode, we explicitly derive the time-evolution equations for the translational motion and the elliptic deformation. There are three stable states: an immobile circular droplet, an immobile elliptically deformed droplet, and a moving droplet with the elliptic deformation in which the minor axis meets the motion direction, and we discuss the transition between these three stable states.</description>

      <title>A mini-review on combinatorial solutions to the Marcus-Lushnikov irreversible aggregation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11459v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Over the past decade, a combinatorial framework for discrete, finite, and irreversibly aggregating systems has emerged. This work reviews its progress, practical applications, and limitations. We outline the approach's assumptions and foundations, based on direct enumeration of system states, contrasting with classical Smoluchowski and Marcus-Lushnikov methods. Using the constant kernel as an example, we derive combinatorial expressions for the average number of clusters of a given size and their standard deviation, and present the complete probability distribution for cluster counts. The method is then extended to several kernels (additive, product, linear-chain, condensation) by explicitly enumerating ways to form clusters of a given size. For general kernels, approximate solutions are obtained via recursive expressions, enabling predictions without explicit solutions. Applications to aerosol growth and planetesimal formation are demonstrated, with comparisons to numerical results. We summarize issues of validity and precision and propose open problems. The appendix includes partial Bell polynomials, generating functions, Lagrange inversion, potential applications, and links between combinatorial and scaling solutions of the Smoluchowski equation.</description>
