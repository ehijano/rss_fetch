      <title>On the means, costs, and system-level impacts of 24/7 carbon-free energy procurement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07876v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A growing number of public and private energy buyers are interested in 24/7 carbon-free energy (CFE) procurement, which means that every kilowatt-hour of electricity consumption is met by carbon-free sources at all times. It has the potential to overcome the limitations of established procurement schemes, such as the temporal mismatch between clean electricity supply and buyers' demand that is inherent to "volumetric" matching. Yet it is unclear how 24/7 CFE procurement affects the rest of the power system, and whether this effect is consistent across regional contexts and different levels of system cleanness. We use a mathematical model to systematically examine different designs, optimal procurement strategies, costs, and impacts of the 24/7 CFE matching, both for participating buyers and for regions where voluntary procurement occurs. We examine mechanisms driving system-level missions reduction and how they vary across regions and over time. Our results indicate that clean energy procurement commitments have consistent beneficial effects on participants and the electricity system. Even as grids become cleaner over time, the hourly matching strategy contributes significantly to system-level emissions reduction. In addition, voluntary commitments to 24/7 CFE have a further transformative effect on electricity systems through accelerated innovation and early deployment of advanced energy technologies.</description>

      <title>Epidemic modelling requires knowledge of the social network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07881v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Compartmental models of epidemics are widely used to forecast the effects of communicable diseases such as COVID-19 and to guide policy. Although it has long been known that such processes take place on social networks, the assumption of random mixing is usually made, which ignores network structure. However, super-spreading events have been found to be power-law distributed, suggesting that the underlying networks may be scale free or at least highly heterogeneous. The random-mixing assumption would then produce an overestimation of the herd-immunity threshold for given $R_0$; and a (more significant) overestimation of $R_0$ itself. These two errors compound each other, and can lead to forecasts greatly overestimating the number of infections. Moreover, if networks are heterogeneous and change in time, multiple waves of infection can occur, which are not predicted by random mixing. A simple SIR model simulated on both Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi and scale-free networks shows that details of the network structure can be more important than the intrinsic transmissibility of a disease. It is therefore crucial to incorporate network information into standard models of epidemics.</description>

      <title>Evaluating the Impact of Vaccine Hesitancy on the Allocation of Vital Resources During COVID-19 Pandemic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07971v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted significant challenges in the allocation of vital healthcare resources. Existing epidemiological models, specifically compartmental models, aimed to predict the spread of the COVID-19 virus and its impact on the population, but they overlooked the influence of \ac{VH} on disease dynamics, including the expected number of hospitalizations and fatalities. We propose improvements to the \ac{SEIR} model for COVID-19 by incorporating the influence of vaccination, \ac{VH}, and resource availability on the disease dynamics. We collect publicly available data and perform data analysis to capture \ac{VH} dynamic changes over time and develop scenario paths for \ac{VH}. We simulate the proposed compartmental model for each \ac{VH} path to explain the impacts of public attitudes toward vaccination, the impacts of healthcare resources on patient outcomes, and the timing of vaccination rollout on the progression and severity of the epidemic. Our analysis demonstrates that reducing \ac{VH} improves health outcomes, reinforcing the importance of addressing \ac{VH} to curb the spread of infectious diseases. Our results show that adequate levels of critical healthcare resources are crucial for minimizing fatalities and also highlight the life-saving impact of timely and effective vaccination programs.</description>

      <title>Navigating the Quantum Divide(s)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08033v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article explores the possible divides resulting from the introduction of emerging quantum technologies (QT) to society. It provides the multidirectional impacts of QT on science, technology, geopolitics, and societal structures. We aim to challenge the idea of a singular "quantum divide" by presenting a more comprehensive perspective. To complement the existing literature on the quantum divide, we propose four distinct divides that could result from the emergence of QT. Firstly, we examine the "Quantum Divide in Science", representing the paradigmatic gap among scientists and inequalities in access to knowledge/resources within research communities. We suggest the "Quantum Divide in Technologies through Path-dependency" as the second possible divide, examining the adoption processes of certain technologies to be developed by nations, firms, and research communities. The discussion extends internationally, focusing on the "Quantum Divide between Countries," by dealing with the reasons and outcomes of the adoption processes between countries of different development levels (economically, industrially, and technologically). As the final divide, we put forth our perspective on the "Quantum Divide within Societies", one of the most explored ones in the literature, addressing societal implications. For each type of the divide, we propose several directions to navigate them, some complementary, some incompatible. Finally, we discuss the interconnectedness and distinctness of different types of divides and how they impact the directions to navigate them. This study serves as a guidance for those interested in a more in-depth investigation of the concept of quantum divide, possible directions of navigating the divides, and how the introduction of QT might affect the innovation ecosystems by impacting the scientific, technological, international, and societal institutions.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Space Situational Awareness to Mitigate Risk: A Case Study in the Misidentification of Starlink Satellites as UAP in Commercial Aviation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the past several years, the misidentification of SpaceX Starlink satellites as Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAP) by pilots and laypersons has generated unnecessary aviation risk and confusion. The many deployment and orbital evolution strategies, coupled with changing sun specular reflection angles, contribute to this gap in space situational awareness. In this paper we present a case analysis of an incident that generated multiple, corroborating reports of a UAP from five pilots on two commercial airline flights over the Pacific Ocean on August 10th, 2022. This incident included two cell phone photos and a video of an unrecognizable and possibly anomalous phenomenon. We then use supplemental two-line elements (TLEs) for the Starlink train of satellites launched that same day and Automatic Dependent Surveillance Broadcast (ADS-B) data from the flight with the photographs to reconstruct a view of these satellites from the cockpit at the time and place of the sighting. The success of this work demonstrates an approach that could, in principle, warn aviators about satellites that could be visible in unusual or novel illumination configurations, thus increasing space situational awareness and supporting aviation safety. We conclude with recommendations for governments and satellite operators to provide better a-priori data that can be used to create advisories to aviators and the public. The automated simulation of known specular reflection off constellations of satellites could also support researchers investigating sightings of unfamiliar aerial or aerospace objects as likely being from normal versus novel space events.</description>

      <title>Robustness of Random Networks with Selective Reinforcement against Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08535v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the robustness of random networks reinforced by adding hidden edges against targeted attacks. This study focuses on two types of reinforcement: uniform reinforcement, where edges are randomly added to all nodes, and selective reinforcement, where edges are randomly added only to the minimum degree nodes of the given network. We use generating functions to derive the giant component size and the critical threshold for the targeted attacks on reinforced networks. Applying our analysis and Monte Carlo simulations to the targeted attacks on scale-free networks, it becomes clear that selective reinforcement significantly improves the robustness of networks against the targeted attacks.</description>

      <title>Equitable Data-Driven Facility Location and Resource Allocation to Fight the Opioid Epidemic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.06179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.06179v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The opioid epidemic is a crisis that has plagued the United States (US) for decades. One central issue is inequitable access to treatment for opioid use disorder (OUD), which puts certain populations at a higher risk of opioid overdose. We integrate a predictive dynamical model and a prescriptive optimization problem to compute high-quality opioid treatment facility and treatment budget allocations for each US state. Our predictive model is a differential equation-based epidemiological model that captures opioid epidemic dynamics. We use a process inspired by neural ODEs to fit this model to opioid epidemic data for each state and obtain estimates for unknown parameters in the model. We then incorporate this epidemiological model into a mixed-integer optimization problem (MIP) that aims to minimize opioid overdose deaths and the number of people with OUD. We develop strong relaxations based on McCormick envelopes to efficiently compute approximate solutions to our MIPs with a mean optimality gap of 3.99%. Our method provides socioeconomically equitable solutions, as it incentivizes investments in areas with higher social vulnerability (from the US Centers for Disease Control's Social Vulnerability Index) and opioid prescribing rates. On average, our approach decreases the number of people with OUD by 9.03 $\pm$ 1.772%, increases the number of people in treatment by 88.75 $\pm$ 26.223%, and decreases opioid-related deaths by 0.58 $\pm$ 0.111% after 2 years compared to baseline epidemiological model predictions. Our solutions show that policy-makers should target adding treatment facilities to counties that have fewer facilities than their population share and are more socially vulnerable. We demonstrate that our optimization approach should help inform these decisions, as it yields population health benefits in comparison to benchmarks based solely on population and social vulnerability.</description>

      <title>Determinants of successful disease control through voluntary quarantine dynamics on social networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.06297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.06297v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the wake of epidemics, quarantine measures are typically recommended by health authorities or governments to help control the spread of the disease. Compared with mandatory quarantine, voluntary quarantine offers individuals the liberty to decide whether to isolate themselves in case of infection exposure, driven by their personal assessment of the trade-off between economic loss and health risks as well as their own sense of social responsibility and concern for public health. To better understand self-motivated health behavior choices under these factors, here we incorporate voluntary quarantine into an endemic disease model -- the susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) model -- and perform comprehensive agent-based simulations to characterize the resulting behavior-disease interactions in structured populations. We quantify the conditions under which voluntary quarantine will be an effective intervention measure to mitigate disease burden. Furthermore, we demonstrate how individual decision-making factors, including the level of temptation to refrain from quarantine and the degree of social compassion, impact compliance levels of voluntary quarantines and the consequent collective disease mitigation efforts. We find that successful disease control requires either a sufficiently low level of temptation or a sufficiently high degree of social compassion, such that even complete containment of the epidemic is attainable. In addition to well-mixed populations, our simulation results are applicable to other more realistic social networks of contacts, including spatial lattices, small-world networks, and real social networks. Our work offers new insights into the fundamental social dilemma aspect of disease control through non-pharmaceutical interventions, such as voluntary quarantine and isolation, where the collective outcome of individual decision-making is crucial.</description>

      <title>Infection-induced Cascading Failures -- Impact and Mitigation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.16767v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two-layer spreading processes on unidirectionally dependent networks are studied, where the spreading infection of diseases or malware in one layer can trigger cascading failures in another layer and lead to secondary disasters, e.g., disrupting public services, supply chains, or power distribution. We utilize the dynamic message-passing method to devise efficient algorithms for inferring the system states, which allows one to investigate systematically the nature of such complex intertwined spreading processes and evaluate their impact. Based on the dynamic message-passing framework and optimal control, we further develop an effective optimization algorithm for mitigating network failures.</description>

Abstract: The ongoing debate surrounding the impact of the Internet Research Agency s (IRA) social media campaign during the 2016 U.S. presidential election has largely overshadowed the involvement of other actors. Our analysis brings to light a substantial group of suspended Twitter users, outnumbering the IRA user group by a factor of 60, who align with the ideologies of the IRA campaign. Our study demonstrates that this group of suspended Twitter accounts significantly influenced individuals categorized as undecided or weak supporters, potentially with the aim of swaying their opinions, as indicated by Granger causality.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.14668v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a statistical physics model of a neutral community, where each agent can represent identical plant species growing in the vertical direction with sunlight in the form of rich-get-richer competition. Disturbance added to this ecosystem, which makes an agent restart from the lowest growth level, is realized as a stochastic resetting. We show that in this model for sufficiently strong competition, vertical diversity characterized by a family of Hill numbers robustly emerges as a local maximum at intermediate disturbance.</description>
