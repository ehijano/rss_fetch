      <title>Lieb-Thirring inequalities on the spheres and $SO(3)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15134v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we obtain new upper bounds for the Lieb-Thirring inequality on the spheres of any dimension greater than $2$. As far as we have checked, our results improve previous results found in the literature for all dimensions greater than $2$. We also prove and exhibit an explicit new upper bound for the Lieb-Thirring inequality on $SO(3)$. We also discuss these estimates in the case of general compact Lie groups. Originally developed for estimating the sums of moments of negative eigenvalues of the Schr\"odinger operator in $L^2(\mathbb{R}^n)$, these inequalities have applications in quantum mechanics and other fields.</description>

      <title>Prescribed exponential stabilization of a one-layer neural network with delayed feedback: Insights in seizure prevention and neural control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13730v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper provides control-oriented delay-based modelling of a one-layer neural network of Hopfield-type subject to an external input designed as delayed feedback. The specificity of such a model is that it makes the considered neuron less susceptible to seizure caused by its inherent dynamic instability. This modelling exploits a recently set partial pole placement for linear functional differential equations, which relies on the coexistence of real spectral values, allowing the explicit prescription of the closed-loop solution's exponential decay. The proposed framework improves some pioneering and scarce results from the literature on the characterization of the exact solution's exponential decay when a simple real spectral value exists. Indeed, it improves neural stability when the inherent dynamic is stable and provides insights into the design of a one-layer neural network that can be stabilized exponentially with delayed feedback and with a prescribed decay rate regardless of whether the inherent neuron dynamic is stable or unstable.</description>

      <title>Positivity and entanglement of polynomial Gaussian integral operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04438v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Positivity preservation is an important issue in the dynamics of open quantum systems: positivity violations always mark the border of validity of the model. We investigate the positivity of self-adjoint polynomial Gaussian integral operators $\widehat{\kappa}_{PG}$, that is, the multivariable kernel $\kappa_{PG}$ is a product of a polynomial $P$ and a Gaussian kernel $\kappa_G$. These operators frequently appear in open quantum systems.
  We show that $\widehat{\kappa}_{PG}$ can be only positive if the Gaussian part is positive, which yields a strong and quite easy test for positivity. This has an important corollary for the bipartite entanglement of the density operators $\widehat{\kappa}_{PG}$: if the Gaussian density operator $\widehat{\kappa}_G$ fails the Peres-Horodecki criterion, then the corresponding polynomial Gaussian density operators $\widehat{\kappa}_{PG}$ also fail the criterion for all $P$, hence they are all entangled.
  We prove that polynomial Gaussian operators with polynomials of odd degree cannot be positive semidefinite.
  We introduce a new preorder $\preceq$ on Gaussian kernels such that if $\kappa_{G_0}\preceq \kappa_{G_1}$ then $\widehat{\kappa}_{PG_0}\geq 0$ implies $\widehat{\kappa}_{PG_1}\geq 0$ for all polynomials $P$. Therefore, deciding the positivity of a polynomial Gaussian operator determines the positivity of a lot of another polynomial Gaussian operators having the same polynomial factor, which might improve any given positivity test by carrying it out on a much larger set of operators. We will show an example that this really can make positivity tests much more sensitive and efficient. This preorder has implication for the entanglement problem, too.</description>
