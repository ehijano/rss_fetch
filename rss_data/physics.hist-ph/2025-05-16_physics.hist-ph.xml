      <title>Towards an Account of Complementarities and Context-Dependence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09622v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern physics proposals present deep tensions between seemingly contradictory descriptions of reality. Views of wave-particle duality, black hole complementarity, and the Unruh effect demand explanations that shift depending on how a system is observed. However, traditional models of scientific explanation impose a fixed structure that fails to account for varying observational contexts. This paper introduces context-dependent mapping, a framework that reorganizes physical laws into self-consistent subsets structured around what can actually be observed in a given context. By doing so, it provides a principled way to integrate complementarity into the philosophy of explanation.</description>

      <title>Temporal Interception and Present Reconstruction: A Cognitive-Signal Model for Human and AI Decision Making</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09646v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel theoretical model to explain how the human mind and artificial intelligence can approach real-time awareness by reducing perceptual delays. By investigating cosmic signal delay, neurological reaction times, and the ancient cognitive state of stillness, we explore how one may shift from reactive perception to a conscious interface with the near future. This paper introduces both a physical and cognitive model for perceiving the present not as a linear timestamp, but as an interference zone where early-arriving cosmic signals and reactive human delays intersect. We propose experimental approaches to test these ideas using human neural observation and neuro-receptive extensions. Finally, we propose a mathematical framework to guide the evolution of AI systems toward temporally efficient, ethically sound, and internally conscious decision-making processes</description>

      <title>Folded State Dynamics -- A Geometric and Deterministic Origin of Irreversibility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09650v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The emergence of irreversibility in isolated, deterministic systems remains a central challenge in statistical mechanics. Traditional approaches, such as Boltzmann's H-theorem and Lanford's derivation of the Boltzmann equation, rely on probabilistic assumptions and are limited to dilute gases and short timescales. We introduce Folded State Dynamics (FSD), a framework in which irreversibility arises from the geometric structure of phase space in systems with coupled rotational and translational degrees of freedom. In contrast to conventional models with unfolded, weakly coupled modes, FSD exhibits phase space folding, where deterministic coupling induces instability and chaotic mixing. We show that equilibrium states exponentially dominate the accessible phase space volume, while constrained configurations (e.g., pure rotation) occupy measure-zero subsets. This yields a geometric derivation of entropy growth, with reversal probabilities suppressed as Prev and recurrence times Trec, resolving Loschmidt's and Zermelo's objections without coarse-graining or fine-tuning. FSD is further extended to include charged systems (cFSD), where electromagnetic interactions continuously drive phase space folding. FSD thus offers a deterministic and testable mechanism for irreversibility, with implications ranging from confined colloids to the cosmological arrow of time</description>

      <title>Quantum censors: backreaction builds horizons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09689v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cosmic censorship posits spacetime singularities remain concealed behind event horizons, preserving the determinism of General Relativity. While quantum gravity is expected to resolve singularities, we argue that cosmic censorship remains necessary whenever spacetime has a reliable semi-classical description. Using holography to construct exact solutions to semi-classical gravity, we show backreaction of quantum matter generates horizons -- quantum censors -- to thwart potential violations of censorship. Along with a quantum Penrose inequality, this provides compelling evidence cosmic censorship is robust, even nonperturbatively, in semi-classical gravity.</description>

      <title>Einstein, Free Creations, and His Worldly Cloister</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09530v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper examines "Free Creations of the Human Mind: The Worlds of Albert Einstein" by Diana Kormos Buchwald and Michael D. Gordin. The authors seek to dispel the long-standing myths of Einstein as the "lone genius" of Bern and the "stubborn sage" of Princeton, drawing on newly uncovered archival materials to illuminate his intellectual networks and collaborative engagements. By exploring the authors' reasoning, this paper engages with their interpretations, highlighting the strengths of their archival revelations and areas where alternative perspectives may enrich the understanding of Einstein's intellectual development.</description>
