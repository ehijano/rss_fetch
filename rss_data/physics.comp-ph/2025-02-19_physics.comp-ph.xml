      <title>Monotone conservative strategies in data assimilation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies whether numerically preserving monotonic properties can offer modelling advantages in data assimilation, particularly when the signal or data is a realization of a stochastic partial differential equation (SPDE) or partial differential equation (PDE) with a monotonic property. We investigate the combination of stochastic Strong Stability Preserving (SSP) time-stepping, nonlinear solving strategies and data assimilation. Experimental results indicate that a particle filter whose ensemble members are solved monotonically can increase forecast skill when the reference data (not necessarily observations) also has a monotone property. Additionally, more advanced techniques used to avoid the degeneracy of the filter (tempering-jittering) are shown to be compatible with a conservative monotone approach.</description>

      <title>An Adaptive Model Order Reduction Approach for the Finite Element Method in Time Domain in Electromagnetics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12785v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time domain simulations are crucial for analyzing transient behavior and broadband responses in electromagnetic problems. However, conventional numerical methods such as finite element method in time domain (FEMTD) and finite difference time domain, can be computationally demanding due to their high-dimensional nature, making large-scale simulations impractical for design optimization and real-time analysis.
  This paper introduces TA-ROMTD, a time-adaptive reduced order model (ROM) for FEMTD simulations that significantly reduces computational costs while maintaining accuracy. The method alternates between FEMTD and a reduced order model in time domain (ROMTD), using an error estimator to detect when the ROMTD solution loses accuracy and switching back to FEMTD to update the ROM with new data. Thus, TA-ROMTD does not require prior knowledge of the problem, as the ROM is constructed on the fly using FEMTD data. A key feature of this approach is the use of a coarse time step during FEMTD time intervals, capturing essential system dynamics while minimizing computational overhead. By reducing the number of degrees of freedom, this method enables efficient electromagnetic simulations, making it a powerful tool for antenna and microwave circuit design.
  The efficiency of the TA-ROMTD strategy is demonstrated through numerical examples, including an antipodal Vivaldi antenna, a dielectric resonator antenna, a fully metallic dual-polarization frequency selective surface, and a mushroom-type electromagnetic bandgap structure. These cases show the capability of the proposed approach to achieve accurate solutions while significantly reducing the computation time from tens of hours to minutes.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12955v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The current work presents a novel COllaborative Open-source Lattice Boltzmann Method framework, so-called CooLBM. The computational framework is developed for the simulation of single and multi-component multi-phase problems, along with a reactive interface and conjugate fluid-solid heat transfer problems. CooLBM utilizes a multi-CPU/GPU architecture to achieve high-performance computing (HPC), enabling efficient and parallelized simulations for large scale problems. The code is implemented in C++ and makes extensive use of the Standard Template Library (STL) to improve code modularity, flexibility, and re-usability. The developed framework incorporates advanced numerical methods and algorithms to accurately capture complex fluid dynamics and phase interactions. It offers a wide range of capabilities, including phase separation, interfacial tension, and mass transfer phenomena. The reactive interface simulation module enables the study of chemical reactions occurring at the fluid-fluid interface, expanding its applicability to reactive multi-phase systems. The performance and accuracy of CooLBM are demonstrated through various benchmark simulations, showcasing its ability to capture intricate fluid behaviors and interface dynamics. The modular structure of the code allows for easy customization and extension, facilitating the implementation of additional models and boundary conditions. Finally, CooLBM provides visualization tools for the analysis and interpretation of simulation results. Overall, CooLBM offers an efficient computational framework for studying complex multi-phase systems and reactive interfaces, making it a valuable tool for researchers and engineers in several fields including, but not limited to chemical engineering, materials science, and environmental engineering. CooLBM will be available under open source initiatives for scientific communities.</description>

      <title>Many-body theory and Gaussian-basis implementation of positron annihilation $\gamma$-ray spectra on polyatomic molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12364v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Doppler-broadened $\gamma$-ray spectra for positron annihilation on molecules are calculated using many-body theory. By employing Gaussian bases for the electron and positron wavefunctions, a computable expression that involves a four-centre integral over the two-annihilation-photon momenta is derived for the $\gamma$ spectra in the independent particle model approximation to the annihilation vertex, and implemented in the open-source {\tt EXCITON+} code. The influence of electron-positron correlations on the $\gamma$ spectra is examined through \textit{ab initio} treatment of the positron wavefunction, whilst corrections to the annihilation vertex are treated approximately via enhancement factors previously calculated [D. G. Green and G. F. Gribakin, Phys.~Rev.~Lett.~{\bf 114}, 093201 (2015)] exactly for atoms. Calculated $\gamma$ spectra for furan and acetonitrile are presented for annihilation from the positron bound state with electrons of individual molecular orbitals. For such annihilation from the positron-molecule bound state, it is found that the magnitude of the partial contribution to the $\gamma$ spectra from individual molecular orbitals depends not just on the orbital energies, but also on the molecular symmetry, more precisely the relative localisation of the positron and electron densities.</description>

      <title>Real-time interpretation of neutron vibrational spectra with symmetry-equivariant Hessian matrix prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13070v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The vibrational behavior of molecules serves as a crucial fingerprint of their structure, chemical state, and surrounding environment. Neutron vibrational spectroscopy provides comprehensive measurements of vibrational modes without selection rule restrictions. However, analyzing and interpreting the resulting spectra remains a computationally formidable task. Here, we introduce a symmetry-aware neural network that directly predicts Hessian matrices from molecular structures, thereby enabling rapid vibrational spectral reconstruction. Unlike traditional approaches that focus on eigenvalue prediction, the Hessian matrix provides richer, more fundamental information with broader applications and superior extrapolation. This approach also paves the way for predicting other properties, such as reaction pathways. Trained on small molecules, our model achieves spectroscopic-level accuracy, allowing real-time, unambiguous peak assignment. Moreover, it maintains high accuracy for larger molecules, demonstrating strong transferability. This adaptability unlocks new capabilities, including on-the-fly spectral interpretation for future autonomous laboratories, and offers insights into molecular design for targeted chemical pathways.</description>

      <title>Multiscale nanoindentation modeling of concentrated solid solutions: A continuum plasticity model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.11833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.11833v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently developed single-phase concentrated solid-solution alloys (CSAs) contain multiple elemental species in high concentrations with different elements randomly arranged on a crystalline lattice. These chemically disordered materials present excellent physical properties, including high-temperature thermal stability and hardness, with promising applications to industries at extreme operating environments. The aim of this paper is to present a continuum plasticity model accounting for the first time for the behaviour of a equiatomic five-element CSA, that forms a face-centered cubic lattice. The inherent disorder associated with the lattice distortions caused by an almost equiatomic distribution of atoms, is captured by a single parameter {\alpha} that quantifies the relative importance of an isotropic plastic contribution to the model. This results in multiple plasticity mechanisms that go beyond crystallographic symmetry-based ones, common in the case of conventional single element metals. We perform molecular dynamics simulations of equiatomic CSAs: NiFe, NiFeCr, NiFeCrCo, and Cantor alloys to validate the proposed continuum model which is implemented in the finite element method and applied to model nanoindentation tests for three different crystallographic orientations. We obtain the representative volume element model by tracking the combined model yield surface.</description>

      <title>CH$_4$ and CO$_2$ Adsorption Mechanisms on Monolayer Graphenylene and their Effects on Optical and Electronic Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.13472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.13472v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we employ a computational chemistry-based modeling approach to investigate the adsorption mechanisms of CH$_4$ and CO$_2$ on monolayer GPNL, with a specific focus on their effects on optical adsorption and electrical transport properties at room temperature. To simulate the adsorption dynamics as closely as possible to experimental conditions, we utilize the self-consistent charge tight-binding density functional theory (SCC-DFTB). Through semi-classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, we observe the formation of H$_2$ molecules from the dissociation of CH$_4$ and the formation of CO+O species from carbon dioxide molecules. This provides insights into the adsorption and dispersion mechanisms of CH$_4$ and CO$_2$ on GPNL. Furthermore, we explore the impact of molecular adsorption on optical absorption properties. Our results demonstrate that CH$_4$ and CH$_2$ affects drastically the optical adsorption of GPNL, while CO$_2$ does not significantly affect the optical properties of the two-dimensional material. To analyze electron transport, we employ the open-boundary non-equilibrium Green's function method. By studying the conductivity of GPNL and graphene under voltage bias up to 300 mV, we gain valuable insights into the electrical transport properties of GPNL under optical absorption conditions. The findings from our computational modeling approach might contribute to a deeper understanding of the potential applications of GPNL in hydrogen production and advanced electronic devices.</description>

      <title>Atomistic modeling of the channeling process with and without account for ionising collisions: A comparative study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07633v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a quantitative analysis of the impact of inelastic collisions of ultra-relativistic electrons and positrons, passing through oriented crystalline targets, on the channeling efficiency and on the intensity of the channeling radiation. The analysis is based on the numerical simulations of the channeling process performed using the MBNExplorer software package. The ionising collisions, being random, fast and local events, are incorporated into the classical molecular dynamics framework according to their probabilities. This methodology is outlined in the paper. The case studies presented refer to electrons with energy $\E$ ranging from 270 to 1500 MeV and positrons with $\E=530$ MeV incident on thick (up to 1 mm) single diamond, silicon and germanium crystals oriented along the (110) and (111) planar directions. In order to elucidate the role of the ionising collisions, the simulations were performed with and without account for the ionising collisions. The case studies presented demonstrate that both approaches yield highly similar results for the electrons. For the positrons, the ionising collisions reduce significantly the channeling efficiency. However, it has been observed that this effect does not result in a corresponding change in the radiation intensity.</description>

      <title>Non-iterative Triples for Transcorrelated Coupled Cluster Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07858v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an implementation of a perturbative triples correction for the coupled cluster ansatz including single and double excitations based on the transcorrelated Hamiltonian. Transcorrelation introduces explicit electron correlation in the electronic Hamiltonian through similarity transformation with a correlation factor. Due to this transformation, the transcorrelated Hamiltonian includes up to three-body couplings and becomes non-Hermitian. Since the conventional coupled cluster equations are solved by projection, it is well suited to harbor non-Hermitian Hamiltonians. The arising three-body operator, however, creates a huge memory bottleneck and increases the runtime scaling of the coupled cluster equations. As it has been shown that the three-body operator can be approximated, by expressing the Hamiltonian in the normal-ordered form, we investigate this approximation for the perturbative triples correction. Results are compared with a code-generation based transcorrelated coupled cluster implementation up to quadruple excitations.</description>

      <title>Efficient Strategies for Reducing Sampling Error in Quantum Krylov Subspace Diagonalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02504v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Within the realm of early fault-tolerant quantum computing (EFTQC), quantum Krylov subspace diagonalization (QKSD) has emerged as a promising quantum algorithm for the approximate Hamiltonian diagonalization via projection onto the quantum Krylov subspace. However, the algorithm often requires solving an ill-conditioned generalized eigenvalue problem (GEVP) involving erroneous matrix pairs, which can significantly distort the solution. Since EFTQC assumes limited-scale error correction, finite sampling error becomes a dominant source of error in these matrices. This work focuses on quantifying sampling errors during the measurement of matrix element in the projected Hamiltonian examining two measurement approaches based on the Hamiltonian decompositions: the linear combination of unitaries and diagonalizable fragments. To reduce sampling error within a fixed budget of quantum circuit repetitions, we propose two measurement strategies: the shifting technique and coefficient splitting. The shifting technique eliminates redundant Hamiltonian components that annihilate either the bra or ket states, while coefficient splitting optimizes the measurement of common terms across different circuits. Numerical experiments with electronic structures of small molecules demonstrate the effectiveness of these strategies, reducing sampling costs by a factor of 20-500.</description>

      <title>Evaluating many-body stabilizer R\'enyi entropy by sampling reduced Pauli strings: singularities, volume law, and nonlocal magic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12146v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a novel quantum Monte Carlo method for evaluating the $\alpha$-stabilizer R\'enyi entropy (SRE) for any integer $\alpha\ge 2$. By interpreting $\alpha$-SRE as partition function ratios, we eliminate the sign problem in the imaginary-time path integral by sampling reduced Pauli strings within a reduced configuration space, which enables efficient classical computations of $\alpha$-SRE and its derivatives to explore magic in previously inaccessible 2D/higher-dimensional systems. Physically, we first separate the free energy contribution in $2$-SRE. At quantum critical points in 1D/2D transverse field Ising (TFI) models, we reveal nontrivial singularities associated with the characteristic function contribution, directly tied to magic. Their interplay leads to complicated behaviors of $2$-SRE, avoiding extrema at critical points generally. In contrast, by analyzing the volume-law correction of magic, which represents nonlocal magic residing in correlations, we find that its discontinuity is bound to critical properties and would be more useful than the full-state magic. Finally, we verify that $2$-SRE fails to characterize magic in mixed states (e.g. Gibbs states), yielding nonphysical results. This work provides a powerful tool for exploring the roles of magic in large-scale many-body systems, and reveals intrinsic relation between magic and many-body physics.</description>
