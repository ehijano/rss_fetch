      <title>Renormalization group analysis of directed percolation process: Towards multiloop calculation of scaling functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11369v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we employ a field-theoretic renormalization group approach to study a paradigmatic model of directed percolation. We focus on the perturbative calculation of the equation of state, extending the analysis to the three-loop order in the expansion parameter $\varepsilon = 4-d$. We show that a large group of the necessary three-loop Feynman diagrams can be mapped onto already existing three-loop results, and develop a technique for the calculation of the remaining -- truly novel -- ones. The described semi-analytic procedure is further used to verify existing two-loop results. The main aim of this study is to provide an update on this ongoing work, as full three-loop calculations utilizing the described procedure are in progress.</description>

      <title>Metastable Dynamical Computing with Energy Landscapes: A Primer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11390v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Smartphones, laptops, and data centers are CMOS-based technologies that ushered our world into the information age of the 21st century. Despite their advantages for scalable computing, their implementations come with surprisingly large energetic costs. This challenge has revitalized scientific and engineering interest in energy-efficient information-processing designs. One current paradigm -- dynamical computing -- controls the location and shape of minima in potential energy landscapes that are connected to a thermal environment. The landscape supports distinguishable metastable energy minima that serve as a system's mesoscopic memory states. Information is represented by microstate distributions. Dynamically manipulating the memory states then corresponds to information processing. This framing provides a natural description of the associated thermodynamic transformations and required resources. Appealing to bifurcation theory, a computational protocol in the metastable regime can be analyzed by tracking the evolution of fixed points in the state space. We illustrate the paradigm's capabilities by performing 1-bit and 2-bit computations with double-well and quadruple-well potentials, respectively. These illustrate how dynamical computing can serve as a basis for designing universal logic gates and investigating their out-of-equilibrium thermodynamic performance.</description>

      <title>Intermediate Thermal Equilibrium Stages in Molecular Dynamics Simulations of two Bodies in Contact</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Zeroth Law of Thermodynamics states that if two systems are in thermal equilibrium with a third one, then they are also in equilibrium with each other. This study explores not only the final state of thermal equilibrium between ideal gases separated by heat-conducting walls, but also the intermediate stages leading up to equilibrium, using classical molecular dynamics simulations. Two- and three-region models with argon atoms are analyzed. Fluctuations, correlations, and temperature distributions are observed, highlighting how heat conduction between regions influences the time to reach equilibrium. This work is distinguished by its detailed analysis of the intermediate stages that occur until the system reaches thermal equilibrium, in accordance with the Zeroth Law of Thermodynamics.</description>

      <title>Early stages of collective cell invasion: Biomechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11813v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The early stages of the collective invasion may occur by single mesenchymal cells or hybrid epithelial-mesenchymal cell groups that detach from cancerous tissue. Tumors may also emit invading protrusions of epithelial cells, which could be led (or not) by a basal cell. Here we devise a fractional step cellular Potts model comprising passive and active cells able to describe these different types of collective invasion before cells start proliferating. Durotaxis and active forces have different symmetry properties and are included in different half steps of the fractional step method. Compared with a single step method, fractional step produces more realistic cellular invasion scenarios with little extra computational effort. Biochemical mechanisms that determine how cells acquire their different phenotypes and cellular proliferation will be incorporated to the model in future publications.</description>

      <title>Microscopic field theory for active Brownian particles with translational and rotational inertia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While active matter physics has traditionally focused on particles with overdamped dynamics, recent years have seen an increase of experimental and theoretical work on active systems with inertia. This also leads to an increased need for theoretical models that describe inertial active dynamics. Here, we present a microscopic derivation for a general continuum model describing the nonequilibrium thermodynamics of inertial active matter that generalizes several previously existing works. It applies to particles with translational and rotational inertia and contains particle density, velocity, angular velocity, temperature, polarization, velocity polarization, and angular velocity polarization as dynamical variables. We moreover discuss to which extend commonly used approximations (factorization and local equilibrium) used in the derivation of hydrodynamic models are applicable to inertial active matter.</description>

      <title>Topological chiral random walker</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12020v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding how biological and synthetic systems achieve robust function in noisy environments remains a fundamental challenge across the physical and life sciences. To connect robust behavior with non-trivial topological features present already in the dynamics of individual units, here we introduce the topological chiral random walker (TCRW) model. While exploring the system, a TCRW locates edges and boundaries in the system and develops topologically protected edge currents even in the presence of defects and disorder. Drawing on the bulk-boundary correspondence found in hard condensed matter systems allows us to rationalize the emergence of robust edge currents through topological features of the dynamic spectrum. We show that chiral motion and rotational noise with opposite chirality are two crucial components in our inherently non-Hermitian model. As proofs of principle, we first show that a topological walker outperforms diffusive motion to efficiently solve complex mazes due to its property of remaining on the edge with some rare detachments. Second, we use this model to design building blocks that can perform efficient self-assembly overcoming the timescale bottlenecks of diffusion-limited growth and reducing self-assembly times by approximately 80%.</description>

      <title>Markov State Models for Tracking Reaction Dynamics on Catalytic Nanoparticles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Markov state models (MSMs) are a powerful tool to analyze and coarse-grain complex dynamical data into interpretable kinetic processes. This capability is particularly important in heterogeneous catalysis, where a medley of reactants and intermediates interact on surfaces that might simultaneously experience structural fluctuations. For these very complex systems, standard transition state theory (TST) approaches are no longer appropriate, motivating alternative approaches that can retain dynamical complexity while providing physical insight. With machine learned interatomic potentials being more and more ubiquitous, directly simulating complex catalytic systems with molecular dynamics (MD) is becoming increasingly feasible. Extending MSMs to dynamically coarse grain MD simulation data of catalytic processes, we analyze hydrogen dynamics on rhodium catalysts with slab and nanoparticle geometries over a range of hydrogen surface concentrations. Somewhat counterintuitively, nanoparticle features, such as corners and edges, effectively slow down the association/dissociation process, and the cooperative behavior of hydrogen-hydrogen interactions leads to a non-monotonic concentration dependence of the rates, which would not be predicted with standard TST.</description>

      <title>Charged moments and symmetry-resolved entanglement from Ballistic Fluctuation Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The charged moments of a reduced density matrix provide a natural starting point for deriving symmetry-resolved R\'enyi and entanglement entropies, which quantify how entanglement is distributed among symmetry sectors in the presence of a global internal symmetry in a quantum many-body system. In this work, we study charged moments within the framework of Ballistic Fluctuation Theory (BFT). This theory describes large-scale ballistic fluctuations of conserved charges and associated currents and, by exploiting the height-field formulation of twist fields, gives access to the asymptotic behaviour of their two-point correlation functions. In Del Vecchio Del Vecchio et al. $[1]$, this approach was applied to the special case of branch-point twist fields used to compute entanglement entropies within the replica approach. Here, we extend those results by applying BFT to composite branch-point twist fields, obtained by inserting an additional gauge field. Focusing on free fermions, we derive analytic expressions for charged R\'enyi entropies both at equilibrium, in generalized Gibbs ensembles, and out of equilibrium following a quantum quench from $U(1)$ preserving pair producing integrable initial states. In the latter case, our results agree with the conjecture arising from the quasiparticle picture.</description>

      <title>Generalizing Deconfined Criticality to 3D $N$-Flavor $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ Quantum Chromodynamics on the Fuzzy Sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11255v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The infra-red behaviour of gauge theories coupled to matter remains an open problem in quantum field theory. For a given gauge group, such theories are expected to flow to an interacting conformal fixed point over a range of fermion or scalar flavours, known as the `conformal window.' Their nature is important for understanding critical phases and phase transitions beyond the Landau paradigm like the deconfined quantum critical point (DQCP), yet remains challenging for conventional non-perturbative approaches. In this work, we study a family of fuzzy-sphere models corresponding to non-linear sigma models with $\mathrm{Sp}(N)$ global symmetry extended to the strongly-coupled region. These theories are expected have an infra-red fixed point described by $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ quantum chromodynamics (QCD) in three space-time dimensions with $N$ flavours of fermions. They can be viewed as a generalisation of the $\mathrm{SO}(5)$ DQCP, corresponding to $N=2$. We investigate them using quantum Monte Carlo for $N$ up to $16$. We find evidence that for $N\geq4$ the phase diagram contains a critical phase that appears to be absent for $N=2$. Within this phase, we measure the two-point correlation function and the excitation spectrum, which exhibit emergent conformal symmetry. We also extract the scaling dimension $\Delta_\phi$ of a leading operator and find consistency with large-$N$ expectations.</description>

      <title>Quantum computing with anyons is fault tolerant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11258v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In seminal work (arxiv:quant-ph/9707021) Alexei Kitaev proposed topological quantum computing (arXiv:cond-mat/0010440, arxiv:quant-ph/9707021, arXiv:quant-ph/0001108, arXiv:0707.1889), whereby logic gates of a quantum computer are conducted by creating, braiding and fusing anyonic particles on a two-dimensional plane. Furthermore, he showed the proposal is inherently robust to local perturbations (arXiv:cond-mat/0010440, arxiv:quant-ph/9707021, arXiv:1001.0344, arXiv:1001.4363) when anyons are created as quasiparticle excitations of a topologically ordered lattice model prepared at zero temperature. Over the decades following this proposal there have been considerable technological developments towards the construction of a fault-tolerant quantum computer. Rather than maintaining some target ground state at zero temperature, a modern approach is to actively correct the errors a target state experiences, where we use noisy quantum circuit elements to identify and subsequently correct for deviations from the ideal state. We present an error-correction scheme that enables us to carry out robust universal quantum computation by braiding anyons. We show that our scheme can be carried out on a suitably large device with an arbitrarily small failure rate assuming circuit elements are below some threshold level of local noise. The error-corrected scheme we have developed therefore enables us to carry out fault-tolerant topological quantum computation using modern quantum hardware that is now under development.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.11265v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Precondensation is a peculiar phenomenon in phase transitions, characterised by the occurrence of a condensate only over a finite range of length scales. It is closely connected to the emergence of domains, pseudo-gapped phases and spatial inhomogeneities in equilibrium. In this work, we show its occurrence in gauge-fermion theories in the chiral limit, close to the thermal chiral phase transition. We further show that the precondensation regime becomes increasingly pronounced and extends over a wider temperature range as the number of fermion flavours is increased. We analyse the underlying dynamics which is shared by a broad class of fermionic systems, ranging from condensed matter to high-energy physics. Specifically, we discuss the potential relevance of this phenomenon for physics beyond the Standard Model.</description>

      <title>Long-Range Pairing in the Kitaev Model: Krylov Subspace Signatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11278v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Krylov subspace methods quantify operator growth in quantum many-body systems through Lanczos coefficients that encode how operators spread under time evolution. While these diagnostics have been proposed to distinguish quantum chaos from integrability, quadratic fermionic Hamiltonians are widely expected to exhibit trivial Lanczos structure. Here we demonstrate that Lanczos coefficients generated from local boundary operators provide a quantitative diagnostic of whether the lowest excitation gap is controlled by boundary-localized or bulk-extended modes in the long-range Kitaev chain, the model for topological superconductivity with algebraically decaying couplings. We introduce \emph{Krylov staggering parameter}, defined as the logarithmic ratio of consecutive odd and even Lanczos coefficients, whose sign structure correlates robustly with the edge versus bulk character of the gap across the full phase diagram. This correlation arises from a bipartite Krylov structure induced by pairing, power-law couplings, and open boundaries. We derive an exact single-particle operator Lanczos algorithm that reduces the recursion from exponentially large operator space to a finite-dimensional linear problem, achieving machine precision for chains of hundreds of sites. These results establish Krylov diagnostics as operational probes of how low-energy excitations are localized along the chain and how strongly they are tied to the boundaries with broken U(1) symmetry, with potential applications to trapped-ion and cold-atom quantum simulators.</description>

      <title>Krylov space perturbation theory for quantum synchronization in closed systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11431v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Strongly interacting quantum many-body systems are expected to thermalize, however, some evade thermalization due to symmetries. Quantum synchronization provides one such example of ergodicity breaking, but previous studies have focused on open systems. Here, motivated by the problem of ergodicity breaking in closed systems and the study of non-trivial dynamics, we investigate synchronization in a closed disordered Heisenberg spin chain. In the presence of large random disorder, strongly breaking the permutation symmetry of the system, we observe the emergence of spatial synchronization, where spins lock into locally synchronized patches. This behavior can be interpreted as a fragmentation of the global dynamical symmetry $S^+$ into a collection of local dynamical symmetries, each characterized by a distinct frequency. In the weak-disorder regime, still without permutation symmetry, we show that the synchronization mechanism can be understood perturbatively within Krylov space. In the absence of disorder, the Krylov space associated with the dynamical symmetry $S^+$ is two-dimensional. Introducing disorder couples this subspace to the remainder of the Krylov space. This coupling leads only to a second-order correction to the frequency of the dynamical symmetry, thereby preserving coherent oscillations despite the presence of small disorder. At stronger disorder, the perturbation modifies $S^+$ so that it acquires a finite lifetime, providing an example of a transient dynamical symmetry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.11601v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a collaboration ring model -- a network of players playing the prisoner's dilemma game and collaborating among the nearest neighbours by forming coalitions. The microscopic stochastic updating of the players' strategies are driven by their innate nature of seeking selfish gains and shared intentionality. Cooperation emerges in such a structured population through non-equilibrium phase transitions driven by propensity of the players to collaborate and by the benefit that a cooperator generates. The robust results are qualitatively independent of number of neighbours and collaborators.</description>

It focuses on the pioneering perspectives of Gallavotti and Cohen, according to which a fluctuation theorem describes the statistics of the deviations of entropy production from its expected value. For time-reversal invariant systems, these fluctuations obey a universal (i.e., model-independent) symmetry called the fluctuation relation. The probabilistic framework introduced in the first part of the book allows for a very general formulation of Fluctuation Relations and Theorems for both deterministic and stochastic dynamical systems. The authors further explore models of physical interest, illustrating this framework by concrete applications. The second part of the book focuses on chaotic dynamics. The formulation of two general Fluctuation Theorems, followed by the detailed study of a concrete example, provides the reader with an understanding of both the theoretical and practical aspects of the subject.</description>

      <title>Stacking-dependent magnetic ordering in bilayer ScI$_{2}$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.11781v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stacking-dependent magnetism in two-dimensional van der Waals materials offers an effective route for controlling magnetic order without chemical modification. Here, we present a combined first-principles and finite-temperature study of magnetic ordering in bilayer ScI$_{2}$ with different stacking configurations. Using density functional theory with Hubbard-U corrections, we investigate the structural, electronic, and magnetic properties of monolayer and bilayer ScI$_{2}$ in $AA$, $AB$, and $BA$ stackings. The electronic structure exhibits a spin-polarized ground state dominated by Sc-$d$ states near the Fermi level. Mapping total energies onto an effective Heisenberg spin Hamiltonian reveals strong intralayer ferromagnetic exchange that is largely insensitive to stacking, while the inter-layer exchange depends strongly on stacking geometry, favoring ferromagnetic coupling for $AA$ and $BA$ stackings and antiferromagnetic coupling for the $AB$ stacking. Spin-orbit coupling calculations show that both monolayer and bilayer ScI$_{2}$ possess a robust out-of-plane magnetic easy axis. Finite-temperature Monte Carlo simulations indicate that all bilayer configurations sustain magnetic ordering at and above room temperature, with ordering temperatures in the range $360-375$ K, as confirmed by Binder cumulant analysis and finite-size scaling. These results demonstrate that stacking geometry enables control of the magnetic ground state in bilayer ScI$_{2}$ without significantly affecting its thermal stability.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.12000v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using techniques of conformal bootstrap, we propose analytical expressions for a large class of two-point functions of bulk fields in critical loop models defined on the upper-half plane. Our results include the two-point connectivities in the Fortuin--Kasteleyn random cluster model with both free and wired boundary conditions. We link the continuum expressions to lattice quantities by computing universal ratios of amplitudes for the two-point connectivities, and find excellent agreement with transfer-matrix numerics.</description>

      <title>Quantum-Coherent Thermodynamics: Leaf Typicality via Minimum-Variance Foliation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12212v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Equilibrium statistical ensembles commute with the Hamiltonian and thus carry no coherence in the energy eigenbasis. We develop a thermodynamic framework in which energy fluctuations can retain genuinely quantum-coherent contributions. We foliate state space into "minimum-variance leaves," defined by minimizing the average energy variance over all pure-state decompositions, with the minimum set by the quantum Fisher information. On each leaf we construct the least-biased state compatible with normalization and mean energy, defining a leaf-canonical ensemble. The Gibbs ensemble is recovered on the distinguished commuting leaf, while generic states are organized by their leaf label. This structure provides a natural setting to extend eigenstate thermalization beyond equilibrium via a "leaf typicality" hypothesis. According to that hypothesis, under unitary time evolution local observables depend only on the leaf and energy and, at all times, are reproduced by evolving a representative (pure) state drawn from the optimal ensemble.</description>

      <title>Entropy production in non-reciprocal polar active mixtures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05209v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The out-of-equilibrium character of active systems is often twofold, arising from both the activity itself and from non-reciprocal couplings between constituents. A well-established measure to quantify the system's distance from equilibrium is the informatic entropy production rate. Here, we ask the question whether and how the informatic entropy production rate reflects collective behaviors and transitions in an active mixture with non-reciprocal polar couplings. In such systems, non-reciprocal orientational couplings can induce chiral motion of particles. At the field-theoretical level, transitions to these time-dependent chiral states are marked by so-called critical exceptional points. Here, we show that at a particle level, the entropy production rate within the chiral states increases with the degree of non-reciprocity, provided it is sufficiently strong. Moreover, even at small degrees of non-reciprocity, the transitions via exceptional points leave clear signatures in the entropy production rate, which exhibits pronounced peaks at coupling strengths corresponding to the field-theoretical exceptional points. Overall, the increase and peaks of the entropy production rate mirror the susceptibility of the polarization vector at the particle level. This correspondence is supported by a field-theoretical analysis, which reveals that, in the long-wavelength limit, the entropy production rate scales with the susceptibilities of the polarization fields.</description>

      <title>Stationary densities and delocalized domain walls in asymmetric exclusion processes competing for finite pools of resources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23983v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the stationary densities and domain walls in the steady states of a pair of asymmetric exclusion processes (TASEP) antiparallelly coupled to two particle reservoirs without any spatial extent by using the model in Haldar et al., Phys. Rev. E {\bf 111}, 014154 (2025). We show that the model admits a pair of {\em delocalized} domain walls, which exist for some choices of the model parameters that define the effective entry and exit rates into the TASEP lanes. Surprisingly, in the parameter space spanned by these model parameters, the region corresponding to delocalized domain walls covers an {\em extended} region, in contrast to the delocalized domain walls that appear only along a line in the relevant parameter space of the other known variants of TASEP. This implies large fluctuations in the TASEP particle numbers even in the thermodynamic limit that can be found over a range of the control parameters. The corresponding phase diagrams in the plane of the control parameters have different topology from those for an open TASEP or other models with multiple TASEPs connected to two reservoirs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1712.05167v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the Fluctuation Theorem (FT) for entropy production in chaotic discrete-time dynamical systems on compact metric spaces, and extend it to empirical measures, all continuous potentials, and all weak Gibbs states. In particular, we establish the FT in the phase transition regime. These results hold under minimal chaoticity assumptions (expansiveness and specification) and require no ergodicity conditions. They are also valid for systems that are not necessarily invertible and involutions other than time reversal. Further extensions involve asymptotically additive potential sequences and the corresponding weak Gibbs measures. The generality of these results allows to view the FT as a structural facet of the thermodynamic formalism of dynamical systems.</description>

      <title>Wigner Cat Phases: A finely tunable system for exploring the transition to quantum chaos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22169v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A transition to quantum chaos is characterized by a finely tunable mixed random matrix ensemble. The {\it mixed Gaussian Orthogonal Ensemble (mGOE)} offers a pedagogically accessible framework for simulating {\it Many-Body Localization (MBL)} transitions. It can be tuned from chaotic to localized and heavy-tailed phases in a continuous fashion, providing an opportunity to explore new phases. We numerically study how the spectral properties of mGOE evolve across these transitions. Characterization of the transition to quantum chaos is computed and analyzed via empirical spectral density, nearest-neighbor spacing, and adjacent gap, with statistical uncertainty quantification that strengthens the robustness of the evidence for transitions. The transitions are identified as the {\it Wigner Cat Phases}, due to the shape of empirical spectral density, which depend on the tunable parameter. These simulated phases in mGOE provide a valuable framework to study the {\it Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis (ETH)} and its related transitions, representing a family of systems with tunable localization and disorder.</description>

      <title>Electrical conductivity of a random nanowire network: comparison of two-dimensional and quasi-three-dimensional models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.22734v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is shown that the widely used two-dimensional model of random networks of metallic nanowires or carbon nanotubes significantly overestimates the number of contacts between elements compared to real systems, which, within the mean-field approach, leads to overestimated estimates of electrical conductivity, especially when the contact resistances between conductors make the main contribution to the electrical conductivity of the system. In the case of a two-dimensional model, the electrical conductivity of the system depends quadratically on the number density of conductors, whereas in the case of a three-dimensional model this dependence is linear.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics of the Heisenberg XXX chain with negative spin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03714v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the thermodynamics of the isotropic Heisenberg XXX spin chain with negative spin, focusing on the case $s=-1$. The model is equivalent to the quantum lattice nonlinear Schr\"odinger (NLS) model and appears as an effective theory in deep inelastic scattering in high-energy quantum chromodynamics. Owing to its integrability, it admits a consistent Bethe Ansatz description and a well-defined thermodynamic limit. Using the thermodynamic Bethe Ansatz, we analyze the ground state, elementary excitations, and finite-temperature properties.
  In contrast to the conventional positive spin XXX chain, the negative spin model exhibits a distinct vacuum structure and excitation spectrum, leading to modified TBA equations and unconventional low-temperature behavior. Although the integral equations resemble those of the Lieb-Liniger Bose gas, the thermodynamics and scaling properties are qualitatively different and cannot be continuously connected.
  We derive the free energy, entropy, and specific heat, and identify a quantum phase transition separating different thermodynamic regimes. At zero temperature, the excitation spectrum becomes linear in the continuum limit and can be described by a conformal field theory. The low-temperature regime realizes a Luttinger-liquid like phase with features unique to the negative spin XXX chain.</description>
