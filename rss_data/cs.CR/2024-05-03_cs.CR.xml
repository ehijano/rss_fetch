      <title>Federated Graph Learning for EV Charging Demand Forecasting with Personalization Against Cyberattacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mitigating cybersecurity risk in electric vehicle (EV) charging demand forecasting plays a crucial role in the safe operation of collective EV chargings, the stability of the power grid, and the cost-effective infrastructure expansion. However, existing methods either suffer from the data privacy issue and the susceptibility to cyberattacks or fail to consider the spatial correlation among different stations. To address these challenges, a federated graph learning approach involving multiple charging stations is proposed to collaboratively train a more generalized deep learning model for demand forecasting while capturing spatial correlations among various stations and enhancing robustness against potential attacks. Firstly, for better model performance, a Graph Neural Network (GNN) model is leveraged to characterize the geographic correlation among different charging stations in a federated manner. Secondly, to ensure robustness and deal with the data heterogeneity in a federated setting, a message passing that utilizes a global attention mechanism to aggregate personalized models for each client is proposed. Thirdly, by concerning cyberattacks, a special credit-based function is designed to mitigate potential threats from malicious clients or unwanted attacks. Extensive experiments on a public EV charging dataset are conducted using various deep learning techniques and federated learning methods to demonstrate the prediction accuracy and robustness of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>The Impact of IMSI Catcher Deployments on Cellular Network Security: Challenges and Countermeasures in 4G and 5G Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: IMSI (International Mobile Subscriber Identity) catchers, also known as "Stingrays" or "cell site simulators," are rogue devices that pose a significant threat to cellular network security [1]. IMSI catchers can intercept and manipulate cellular communications, compromising the privacy and security of mobile devices and their users. With the advent of 4G and 5G networks, IMSI catchers have become more sophisticated and pose new challenges to cellular network security [2]. This paper provides an overview of the impact of IMSI catcher deployments on cellular network security in the context of 4G and 5G networks. It discusses the challenges posed by IMSI catchers, including the unauthorized collection of IMSI numbers, interception of communications, and potential misuse of subscriber information. It also highlights the potential consequences of IMSI catcher deployments, including the compromise of user privacy, financial fraud, and unauthorized surveillance. The paper further reviews the countermeasures that can be employed to mitigate the risks posed by IMSI catchers. These countermeasures include network-based solutions such as signal analysis, encryption, and authentication mechanisms, as well as user-based solutions such as mobile applications and device settings. The paper also discusses the limitations and effectiveness of these countermeasures in the context of 4G and 5G networks. Finally, the paper identifies research gaps and future directions for enhancing cellular network security against IMSI catchers in the era of 4G and 5G networks. This includes the need for improved encryption algorithms, authentication mechanisms, and detection techniques to effectively detect and prevent IMSI catcher deployments. The paper also emphasizes the importance of regulatory and policy measures to govern the deployment and use of IMSI catchers to protect user privacy and security.</description>

      <title>A Blockchain-Based Audit Mechanism for Trust and Integrity in IoT-Fog Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00844v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The full realization of smart city technology is dependent on the secure and honest collaboration between IoT applications and edge-computing. In particular, resource constrained IoT devices may rely on fog-computing to alleviate the computing load of IoT tasks. Mutual authentication is needed between IoT and fog to preserve IoT data security, and monetization of fog services is needed to promote the fog service ecosystem. However, there is no guarantee that fog nodes will always respond to IoT requests correctly, either intentionally or accidentally. In the public decentralized IoT-fog environment, it is crucial to enforce integrity among fog nodes. In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based system that 1) streamlines the mutual authentication service monetization between IoT and fog, 2) verifies the integrity of fog nodes via service audits, and 3) discourages malicious activity and promotes honesty among fog nodes through incentives and penalties.</description>

      <title>Hiding Sensitive Information Using PDF Steganography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00865v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The use of steganography to transmit secret data is becoming increasingly common in security products and malware today. Despite being extremely popular, PDF files are not often the focus of steganography research, as most applications utilize digital image, audio, and video files as their cover data. However, the PDF file format is promising for usage in medium-capacity steganography applications. In this paper, we present a novel PDF steganography algorithm based upon least-significant bit insertion into the real-valued operands of PDF stream operators. Where prior research has only considered a small subset of these operators, we take an extensive look at all the possible operators defined in the Adobe PDF standard to evaluate their usability in our steganography algorithm. We also provide a case study which embeds malware into a given cover PDF document.</description>

      <title>Towards Trust Proof for Secure Confidential Virtual Machines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Virtual Machine (VM)-based Trusted-Execution-Environment (TEE) technology, like AMD Secure-Encrypted-Virtualization (SEV), enables the establishment of Confidential VMs (CVMs) to protect data privacy. But CVM lacks ways to provide the trust proof of its running state, degrading the user confidence of using CVM. The technology of virtual Trusted Platform Module (vTPM) can be used to generate trust proof for CVM. However, the existing vTPM-based approaches have the weaknesses like lack of a well-defined root-of-trust, lack of vTPM protection, and lack of vTPM's trust proof. These weaknesses prevent the generation of the trust proof of the CVM. This paper proposes an approach to generate the trust proof for AMD SEV-based CVM so as to ensure its security by using a secure vTPM to construct Trusted Complete Chain for the CVM (T3CVM). T3CVM consists of three components: 1) TR-Manager, as the well-defined root-of-trust, helps to build complete trust chains for CVMs; 2) CN-TPMCVM, a special CVM provides secure vTPMs; 3) CN-CDriver, an enhanced TPM driver. Our approach overcomes the weaknesses of existing approaches and enables trusted computing-based applications to run seamlessly in the trusted CVM. We perform a formal security analysis of T3CVM, and implement a prototype system to evaluate its performance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01046v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Critical infrastructures (CNI) are vulnerable to cyberattacks due to their interconnected communication systems. We are developing a platform using real-time simulation of cyber-physical systems to enhance CNI resilience and security. The platform, initiated in the Vaasa Harbor Microgrid, allows creation of a digital twin and real-time execution of its functions. It provides a co-simulation environment for simulating cyberattack scenarios, aiding in the design of a cybersecurity simulator-based platform and offering services for CNI stakeholders.</description>

      <title>KDPrint: Passive Authentication using Keystroke Dynamics-to-Image Encoding via Standardization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In contemporary mobile user authentication systems, verifying user legitimacy has become paramount due to the widespread use of smartphones. Although fingerprint and facial recognition are widely used for mobile authentication, PIN-based authentication is still employed as a fallback option if biometric authentication fails after multiple attempts. Consequently, the system remains susceptible to attacks targeting the PIN when biometric methods are unsuccessful. In response to these concerns, two-factor authentication has been proposed, albeit with the caveat of increased user effort. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a passive authentication system that utilizes keystroke data, a byproduct of primary authentication methods, for background user authentication. Additionally, we introduce a novel image encoding technique to capture the temporal dynamics of keystroke data, overcoming the performance limitations of deep learning models. Furthermore, we present a methodology for selecting suitable behavioral biometric features for image representation. The resulting images, depicting the user's PIN input patterns, enhance the model's ability to uniquely identify users through the secondary channel with high accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed imaging approach surpasses existing methods in terms of information capacity. In self-collected dataset experiments, incorporating features from prior research, our method achieved an Equal Error Rate (EER) of 6.7\%, outperforming the existing method's 47.7\%. Moreover, our imaging technique attained a True Acceptance Rate (TAR) of 94.4\% and a False Acceptance Rate (FAR) of 8\% for 17 users.</description>

      <title>Mining REST APIs for Potential Mass Assignment Vulnerabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01111v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: REST APIs have a pivotal role in accessing protected resources within cyberspace. Despite the availability of security testing tools, mass assignment vulnerabilities are common, yielding unauthorized access to sensitive data. We propose a lightweight approach to mine the REST API specifications and identify operations and attributes that are prone to mass assignment. We conducted a preliminary study on 100 APIs and found 25 prone to this vulnerability. We confirmed nine real vulnerable operations in six open-source APIs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Template engines play a pivotal role in modern web application development, facilitating the dynamic rendering of content, products, and user interfaces. Nowadays, template engines are essential in any website that deals with dynamic data, from e-commerce platforms to social media. However, their widespread use also makes them attractive targets for attackers seeking to exploit vulnerabilities and gain unauthorized access to web servers. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of template engines, focusing on their susceptibility to Remote Code Execution (RCE) attacks, a critical security concern in web application development.</description>

      <title>Boosting Communication Efficiency of Federated Learning's Secure Aggregation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01144v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a decentralized machine learning approach where client devices train models locally and send them to a server that performs aggregation to generate a global model. FL is vulnerable to model inversion attacks, where the server can infer sensitive client data from trained models. Google's Secure Aggregation (SecAgg) protocol addresses this data privacy issue by masking each client's trained model using shared secrets and individual elements generated locally on the client's device. Although SecAgg effectively preserves privacy, it imposes considerable communication and computation overhead, especially as network size increases. Building upon SecAgg, this poster introduces a Communication-Efficient Secure Aggregation (CESA) protocol that substantially reduces this overhead by using only two shared secrets per client to mask the model. We propose our method for stable networks with low delay variation and limited client dropouts. CESA is independent of the data distribution and network size (for higher than 6 nodes), preventing the honest-but-curious server from accessing unmasked models. Our initial evaluation reveals that CESA significantly reduces the communication cost compared to SecAgg.</description>

      <title>Measuring the Exploitation of Weaknesses in the Wild</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01289v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Identifying the software weaknesses exploited by attacks supports efforts to reduce developer introduction of vulnerabilities and to guide security code review efforts. A weakness is a bug or fault type that can be exploited through an operation that results in a security-relevant error. Ideally, the security community would measure the prevalence of the software weaknesses used in actual exploitation. This work advances that goal by introducing a simple metric that utilizes public data feeds to determine the probability of a weakness being exploited in the wild for any 30-day window. The metric is evaluated on a set of 130 weaknesses that were commonly found in vulnerabilities between April 2021 and March 2024. Our analysis reveals that 92 % of the weaknesses are not being constantly exploited.</description>

      <title>Decentralization of Ethereum's Builder Market</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01329v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Blockchains protect an ecosystem worth more than $500bn with their strong security properties derived from the principle of decentralization. Is today's blockchain really decentralized? In this paper, we empirically studied one of the {\em least decentralized} parts of Ethereum -- the most used blockchain system in practice -- and shed light on the decentralization issue from a new perspective.
  To avoid centralization caused by Maximal Extractable Value (MEV), Ethereum adopts a novel mechanism that produces blocks through a {\em builder market}. After two years in operation, however, the builder market has evolved to a highly centralized one with three builders producing more than 90% of blocks. {\em Why does the builder market centralize, given that it is permissionless and anyone can join?} Moreover, {\em what are the security implications of a centralized builder market to MEV-Boost auctions?} Through a rigorous empirical study of the builder market's core mechanism, MEV-Boost auctions, we answered these two questions using a large-scale auction dataset we curated since 2022.
  Unlike previous works that focus on {\em who} wins the auctions, we focus on {\em why} they win, to shed light on the {openness, competitiveness, and efficiency} of MEV-Boost auctions. Our findings also help identify directions for improving the decentralization of builder markets.</description>

      <title>IDPFilter: Mitigating Interdependent Privacy Issues in Third-Party Apps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01411v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Third-party applications have become an essential part of today's online ecosystem, enhancing the functionality of popular platforms. However, the intensive data exchange underlying their proliferation has increased concerns about interdependent privacy (IDP). This paper provides a comprehensive investigation into the previously underinvestigated IDP issues of third-party apps. Specifically, first, we analyze the permission structure of multiple app platforms, identifying permissions that have the potential to cause interdependent privacy issues by enabling a user to share someone else's personal data with an app. Second, we collect datasets and characterize the extent to which existing apps request these permissions, revealing the relationship between characteristics such as the respective app platform, the app's type, and the number of interdependent privacy-related permissions it requests. Third, we analyze the various reasons IDP is neglected by both data protection regulations and app platforms and then devise principles that should be followed when designing a mitigation solution. Finally, based on these principles and satisfying clearly defined objectives, we propose IDPFilter, a platform-agnostic API that enables application providers to minimize collateral information collection by filtering out data collected from their users but implicating others as data subjects. We implement a proof-of-concept prototype, IDPTextFilter, that implements the filtering logic on textual data, and provide its initial performance evaluation with regard to privacy, accuracy, and efficiency.</description>

      <title>An Exploratory Case Study on Data Breach Journalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01446v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores the novel topic of data breach journalism and data breach news through the case of databreaches.net, a news outlet dedicated to data breaches and related cyber crime. Motivated by the issues in traditional crime news and crime journalism, the case is explored by the means of text mining. According to the results, the outlet has kept a steady publishing pace, mainly focusing on plain and short reporting but with generally high-quality source material for the news articles. Despite these characteristics, the news articles exhibit fairly strong sentiments, which is partially expected due to the presence of emotionally laden crime and the long history of sensationalism in crime news. The news site has also covered the full scope of data breaches, although many of these are fairly traditional, exposing personal identifiers and financial details of the victims. Also hospitals and the healthcare sector stand out. With these results, the paper advances the study of data breaches by considering these from the perspective of media and journalism.</description>

      <title>Unconditionally Safe Light Client</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01459v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Blockchain applications often rely on lightweight clients to access and verify on-chain data efficiently without the need to run a resource-intensive full node. These light clients must maintain robust security to protect the blockchain's integrity for users of applications built upon it, achieving this with minimal resources and without significant latency. Moreover, different applications have varying security needs. This work focuses on addressing these two key requirements in the context of Proof-of-Stake (PoS) blockchains and identifying the fundamental cost-latency trade-offs to achieve tailored, optimal security for each light client.
  The key security guarantee of PoS blockchains is economic (implied by the "stake"). In this paper we formalize this cryptoeconomic security to light clients, ensuring that the cost of corrupting the data provided to light clients must outweigh the potential profit, thereby economically deterring malicious actors. We further introduce "insured" cryptoeconomic security to light clients, providing unconditional protection via the attribution of adversarial actions and the consequent slashing of stakes. The divisible and fungible nature of stake facilitates programmable security, allowing for customization of the security level and insurance amount according to the specific needs of different applications.
  We implemented the protocols in less than 1000 lines of Solidity and TypeScript code and evaluated their gas cost, latency, and the computational overhead. For example, for a transaction with value of \$32k, the light client can choose between zero cost with a latency of 5 hours or instant confirmation with an insurance cost of \$7.45. Thus, the client can select the optimal point on the latency-cost trade-off spectrum that best aligns with its needs. Light clients require negligible storage and face minimal computational costs,...</description>

      <title>Purify Unlearnable Examples via Rate-Constrained Variational Autoencoders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unlearnable examples (UEs) seek to maximize testing error by making subtle modifications to training examples that are correctly labeled. Defenses against these poisoning attacks can be categorized based on whether specific interventions are adopted during training. The first approach is training-time defense, such as adversarial training, which can mitigate poisoning effects but is computationally intensive. The other approach is pre-training purification, e.g., image short squeezing, which consists of several simple compressions but often encounters challenges in dealing with various UEs. Our work provides a novel disentanglement mechanism to build an efficient pre-training purification method. Firstly, we uncover rate-constrained variational autoencoders (VAEs), demonstrating a clear tendency to suppress the perturbations in UEs. We subsequently conduct a theoretical analysis for this phenomenon. Building upon these insights, we introduce a disentangle variational autoencoder (D-VAE), capable of disentangling the perturbations with learnable class-wise embeddings. Based on this network, a two-stage purification approach is naturally developed. The first stage focuses on roughly eliminating perturbations, while the second stage produces refined, poison-free results, ensuring effectiveness and robustness across various scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate the remarkable performance of our method across CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and a 100-class ImageNet-subset.

      <title>Learnable Linguistic Watermarks for Tracing Model Extraction Attacks on Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01509v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the rapidly evolving domain of artificial intelligence, safeguarding the intellectual property of Large Language Models (LLMs) is increasingly crucial. Current watermarking techniques against model extraction attacks, which rely on signal insertion in model logits or post-processing of generated text, remain largely heuristic. We propose a novel method for embedding learnable linguistic watermarks in LLMs, aimed at tracing and preventing model extraction attacks. Our approach subtly modifies the LLM's output distribution by introducing controlled noise into token frequency distributions, embedding an statistically identifiable controllable watermark.We leverage statistical hypothesis testing and information theory, particularly focusing on Kullback-Leibler Divergence, to differentiate between original and modified distributions effectively. Our watermarking method strikes a delicate well balance between robustness and output quality, maintaining low false positive/negative rates and preserving the LLM's original performance.</description>

      <title>DAM: A Universal Dual Attention Mechanism for Multimodal Timeseries Cryptocurrency Trend Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00522v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the distributed systems landscape, Blockchain has catalyzed the rise of cryptocurrencies, merging enhanced security and decentralization with significant investment opportunities. Despite their potential, current research on cryptocurrency trend forecasting often falls short by simplistically merging sentiment data without fully considering the nuanced interplay between financial market dynamics and external sentiment influences. This paper presents a novel Dual Attention Mechanism (DAM) for forecasting cryptocurrency trends using multimodal time-series data. Our approach, which integrates critical cryptocurrency metrics with sentiment data from news and social media analyzed through CryptoBERT, addresses the inherent volatility and prediction challenges in cryptocurrency markets. By combining elements of distributed systems, natural language processing, and financial forecasting, our method outperforms conventional models like LSTM and Transformer by up to 20\% in prediction accuracy. This advancement deepens the understanding of distributed systems and has practical implications in financial markets, benefiting stakeholders in cryptocurrency and blockchain technologies. Moreover, our enhanced forecasting approach can significantly support decentralized science (DeSci) by facilitating strategic planning and the efficient adoption of blockchain technologies, improving operational efficiency and financial risk management in the rapidly evolving digital asset domain, thus ensuring optimal resource allocation.</description>

      <title>Federated Learning and Differential Privacy Techniques on Multi-hospital Population-scale Electrocardiogram Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00725v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This research paper explores ways to apply Federated Learning (FL) and Differential Privacy (DP) techniques to population-scale Electrocardiogram (ECG) data. The study learns a multi-label ECG classification model using FL and DP based on 1,565,849 ECG tracings from 7 hospitals in Alberta, Canada. The FL approach allowed collaborative model training without sharing raw data between hospitals while building robust ECG classification models for diagnosing various cardiac conditions. These accurate ECG classification models can facilitate the diagnoses while preserving patient confidentiality using FL and DP techniques. Our results show that the performance achieved using our implementation of the FL approach is comparable to that of the pooled approach, where the model is trained over the aggregating data from all hospitals. Furthermore, our findings suggest that hospitals with limited ECGs for training can benefit from adopting the FL model compared to single-site training. In addition, this study showcases the trade-off between model performance and data privacy by employing DP during model training. Our code is available at https://github.com/vikhyatt/Hospital-FL-DP.</description>

      <title>Recovering Labels from Local Updates in Federated Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00955v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gradient inversion (GI) attacks present a threat to the privacy of clients in federated learning (FL) by aiming to enable reconstruction of the clients' data from communicated model updates. A number of such techniques attempts to accelerate data recovery by first reconstructing labels of the samples used in local training. However, existing label extraction methods make strong assumptions that typically do not hold in realistic FL settings. In this paper we present a novel label recovery scheme, Recovering Labels from Local Updates (RLU), which provides near-perfect accuracy when attacking untrained (most vulnerable) models. More significantly, RLU achieves high performance even in realistic real-world settings where the clients in an FL system run multiple local epochs, train on heterogeneous data, and deploy various optimizers to minimize different objective functions. Specifically, RLU estimates labels by solving a least-square problem that emerges from the analysis of the correlation between labels of the data points used in a training round and the resulting update of the output layer. The experimental results on several datasets, architectures, and data heterogeneity scenarios demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms existing baselines, and helps improve quality of the reconstructed images in GI attacks in terms of both PSNR and LPIPS.</description>

      <title>The Privacy Power of Correlated Noise in Decentralized Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01031v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Decentralized learning is appealing as it enables the scalable usage of large amounts of distributed data and resources (without resorting to any central entity), while promoting privacy since every user minimizes the direct exposure of their data. Yet, without additional precautions, curious users can still leverage models obtained from their peers to violate privacy. In this paper, we propose Decor, a variant of decentralized SGD with differential privacy (DP) guarantees. Essentially, in Decor, users securely exchange randomness seeds in one communication round to generate pairwise-canceling correlated Gaussian noises, which are injected to protect local models at every communication round. We theoretically and empirically show that, for arbitrary connected graphs, Decor matches the central DP optimal privacy-utility trade-off. We do so under SecLDP, our new relaxation of local DP, which protects all user communications against an external eavesdropper and curious users, assuming that every pair of connected users shares a secret, i.e., an information hidden to all others. The main theoretical challenge is to control the accumulation of non-canceling correlated noise due to network sparsity. We also propose a companion SecLDP privacy accountant for public use.</description>

      <title>Poisoning Attacks on Federated Learning for Autonomous Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01073v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a decentralized learning paradigm, enabling parties to collaboratively train models while keeping their data confidential. Within autonomous driving, it brings the potential of reducing data storage costs, reducing bandwidth requirements, and to accelerate the learning. FL is, however, susceptible to poisoning attacks. In this paper, we introduce two novel poisoning attacks on FL tailored to regression tasks within autonomous driving: FLStealth and Off-Track Attack (OTA). FLStealth, an untargeted attack, aims at providing model updates that deteriorate the global model performance while appearing benign. OTA, on the other hand, is a targeted attack with the objective to change the global model's behavior when exposed to a certain trigger. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our attacks by conducting comprehensive experiments pertaining to the task of vehicle trajectory prediction. In particular, we show that, among five different untargeted attacks, FLStealth is the most successful at bypassing the considered defenses employed by the server. For OTA, we demonstrate the inability of common defense strategies to mitigate the attack, highlighting the critical need for new defensive mechanisms against targeted attacks within FL for autonomous driving.</description>

      <title>DLAP: A Deep Learning Augmented Large Language Model Prompting Framework for Software Vulnerability Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01202v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Software vulnerability detection is generally supported by automated static analysis tools, which have recently been reinforced by deep learning (DL) models. However, despite the superior performance of DL-based approaches over rule-based ones in research, applying DL approaches to software vulnerability detection in practice remains a challenge due to the complex structure of source code, the black-box nature of DL, and the domain knowledge required to understand and validate the black-box results for addressing tasks after detection. Conventional DL models are trained by specific projects and, hence, excel in identifying vulnerabilities in these projects but not in others. These models with poor performance in vulnerability detection would impact the downstream tasks such as location and repair. More importantly, these models do not provide explanations for developers to comprehend detection results. In contrast, Large Language Models (LLMs) have made lots of progress in addressing these issues by leveraging prompting techniques. Unfortunately, their performance in identifying vulnerabilities is unsatisfactory. This paper contributes \textbf{\DLAP}, a \underline{\textbf{D}}eep \underline{\textbf{L}}earning \underline{\textbf{A}}ugmented LLMs \underline{\textbf{P}}rompting framework that combines the best of both DL models and LLMs to achieve exceptional vulnerability detection performance. Experimental evaluation results confirm that \DLAP outperforms state-of-the-art prompting frameworks, including role-based prompts, auxiliary information prompts, chain-of-thought prompts, and in-context learning prompts, as well as fine-turning on multiple metrics.</description>

Abstract: Membership Inference (MI) poses a substantial privacy threat to the training data of Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems, while also offering an opportunity to audit these models with regard to user data. This paper explores the effectiveness of loss-based features in combination with Gaussian and adversarial perturbations to perform MI in ASR models. To the best of our knowledge, this approach has not yet been investigated. We compare our proposed features with commonly used error-based features and find that the proposed features greatly enhance performance for sample-level MI. For speaker-level MI, these features improve results, though by a smaller margin, as error-based features already obtained a high performance for this task. Our findings emphasise the importance of considering different feature sets and levels of access to target models for effective MI in ASR systems, providing valuable insights for auditing such models.</description>

      <title>Boosting Jailbreak Attack with Momentum</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01229v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success across diverse tasks, yet they remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks, notably the well-documented \textit{jailbreak} attack. Recently, the Greedy Coordinate Gradient (GCG) attack has demonstrated efficacy in exploiting this vulnerability by optimizing adversarial prompts through a combination of gradient heuristics and greedy search. However, the efficiency of this attack has become a bottleneck in the attacking process. To mitigate this limitation, in this paper we rethink the generation of adversarial prompts through an optimization lens, aiming to stabilize the optimization process and harness more heuristic insights from previous iterations. Specifically, we introduce the \textbf{M}omentum \textbf{A}ccelerated G\textbf{C}G (\textbf{MAC}) attack, which incorporates a momentum term into the gradient heuristic. Experimental results showcase the notable enhancement achieved by MAP in gradient-based attacks on aligned language models.

      <description>arXiv:2405.01312v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Benchmarking is crucial for evaluating a DBMS, yet existing benchmarks often fail to reflect the varied nature of user workloads. As a result, there is increasing momentum toward creating databases that incorporate real-world user data to more accurately mirror business environments. However, privacy concerns deter users from directly sharing their data, underscoring the importance of creating synthesized databases for benchmarking that also prioritize privacy protection. Differential privacy has become a key method for safeguarding privacy when sharing data, but the focus has largely been on minimizing errors in aggregate queries or classification tasks, with less attention given to benchmarking factors like runtime performance. This paper delves into the creation of privacy-preserving databases specifically for benchmarking, aiming to produce a differentially private database whose query performance closely resembles that of the original data. Introducing PrivBench, an innovative synthesis framework, we support the generation of high-quality data that maintains privacy. PrivBench uses sum-product networks (SPNs) to partition and sample data, enhancing data representation while securing privacy. The framework allows users to adjust the detail of SPN partitions and privacy settings, crucial for customizing privacy levels. We validate our approach, which uses the Laplace and exponential mechanisms, in maintaining privacy. Our tests show that PrivBench effectively generates data that maintains privacy and excels in query performance, consistently reducing errors in query execution time, query cardinality, and KL divergence.</description>

      <title>A Framework for the Systematic Assessment of Anomaly Detectors in Time-Sensitive Automotive Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01324v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Connected cars are susceptible to cyberattacks. Security and safety of future vehicles highly depend on a holistic protection of automotive components, of which the time-sensitive backbone network takes a significant role. These onboard Time-Sensitive Networks (TSNs) require monitoring for safety and -- as versatile platforms to host Network Anomaly Detection Systems (NADSs) -- for security. Still a thorough evaluation of anomaly detection methods in the context of hard real-time operations, automotive protocol stacks, and domain specific attack vectors is missing along with appropriate input datasets. In this paper, we present an assessment framework that allows for reproducible, comparable, and rapid evaluation of detection algorithms. It is based on a simulation toolchain, which contributes configurable topologies, traffic streams, anomalies, attacks, and detectors. We demonstrate the assessment of NADSs in a comprehensive in-vehicular network with its communication flows, on which we model traffic anomalies. We evaluate exemplary detection mechanisms and reveal how the detection performance is influenced by different combinations of TSN traffic flows and anomaly types. Our approach translates to other real-time Ethernet domains, such as industrial facilities, airplanes, and UAVs.</description>

      <title>Position Paper: Beyond Robustness Against Single Attack Types</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01349v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current research on defending against adversarial examples focuses primarily on achieving robustness against a single attack type such as $\ell_2$ or $\ell_{\infty}$-bounded attacks. However, the space of possible perturbations is much larger and currently cannot be modeled by a single attack type. The discrepancy between the focus of current defenses and the space of attacks of interest calls to question the practicality of existing defenses and the reliability of their evaluation. In this position paper, we argue that the research community should look beyond single attack robustness, and we draw attention to three potential directions involving robustness against multiple attacks: simultaneous multiattack robustness, unforeseen attack robustness, and a newly defined problem setting which we call continual adaptive robustness. We provide a unified framework which rigorously defines these problem settings, synthesize existing research in these fields, and outline open directions. We hope that our position paper inspires more research in simultaneous multiattack, unforeseen attack, and continual adaptive robustness.</description>

      <title>Navigating Heterogeneity and Privacy in One-Shot Federated Learning with Diffusion Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01494v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables multiple clients to train models collectively while preserving data privacy. However, FL faces challenges in terms of communication cost and data heterogeneity. One-shot federated learning has emerged as a solution by reducing communication rounds, improving efficiency, and providing better security against eavesdropping attacks. Nevertheless, data heterogeneity remains a significant challenge, impacting performance. This work explores the effectiveness of diffusion models in one-shot FL, demonstrating their applicability in addressing data heterogeneity and improving FL performance. Additionally, we investigate the utility of our diffusion model approach, FedDiff, compared to other one-shot FL methods under differential privacy (DP). Furthermore, to improve generated sample quality under DP settings, we propose a pragmatic Fourier Magnitude Filtering (FMF) method, enhancing the effectiveness of generated data for global model training.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01495v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Linear hashes are known to possess error-correcting capabilities. However, in most applications, non-linear hashes with pseudorandom outputs are utilized instead. It has also been established that classical non-systematic random codes, both linear and non-linear, are capacity achieving in the asymptotic regime. Thus, it is reasonable to expect that non-linear hashes might also exhibit good error-correcting capabilities. In this paper, we show this to be the case. Our proof is based on techniques from multiple access channels. As a consequence, we show that Systematic Random Non-Linear Codes (S-RNLC) are capacity achieving in the asymptotic regime. We validate our results by comparing the performance of the Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA) with that of Systematic Random Linear Codes (SRLC) and S-RNLC, demonstrating that SHA performs equally.</description>

      <title>Identifying Non-Control Security-Critical Data through Program Dependence Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2108.12071v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As control-flow protection gets widely deployed, it is difficult for attackers to corrupt control-data and achieve control-flow hijacking. Instead, data-oriented attacks, which manipulate non-control data, have been demonstrated to be feasible and powerful. In data-oriented attacks, a fundamental step is to identify non-control, security-critical data. However, critical data identification processes are not scalable in previous works, because they mainly rely on tedious human efforts to identify critical data. To address this issue, we propose a novel approach that combines traditional program analysis with deep learning. At a higher level, by examining how analysts identify critical data, we first propose dynamic analysis algorithms to identify the program semantics (and features) that are correlated with the impact of a critical data. Then, motivated by the unique challenges in the critical data identification task, we formalize the distinguishing features and use customized program dependence graphs (PDG) to embed the features. Different from previous works using deep learning to learn basic program semantics, this paper adopts a special neural network architecture that can capture the long dependency paths (in the PDG), through which a critical variable propagates its impact. We have implemented a fully-automatic toolchain and conducted comprehensive evaluations. According to the evaluations, our model can achieve 90% accuracy. The toolchain uncovers 80 potential critical variables in Google FuzzBench. In addition, we demonstrate the harmfulness of the exploits using the identified critical variables by simulating 7 data-oriented attacks through GDB.</description>

      <title>Mouse Dynamics Behavioral Biometrics: A Survey</title>

Abstract: Utilization of the Internet in our everyday lives has made us vulnerable in terms of privacy and security of our data and systems. Therefore, there is a pressing need to protect our data and systems by improving authentication mechanisms, which are expected to be low cost, unobtrusive, and ideally ubiquitous in nature. Behavioral biometric modalities such as mouse dynamics (mouse behaviors on a graphical user interface (GUI)) and widget interactions (another modality closely related to mouse dynamics that also considers the target (widget) of a GUI interaction, such as links, buttons, and combo-boxes) can bolster the security of existing authentication systems because of their ability to distinguish an individual based on their unique features. As a result, it can be difficult for an imposter to impersonate these behavioral biometrics, making them suitable for authentication. In this paper, we survey the literature on mouse dynamics and widget interactions dated from 1897 to 2023. We begin our survey with an account of the psychological perspectives on behavioral biometrics. We then analyze the literature along the following dimensions: tasks and experimental settings for data collection, taxonomy of raw attributes, feature extractions and mathematical definitions, publicly available datasets, algorithms (statistical, machine learning, and deep learning), data fusion, performance, and limitations. Lastly, we end the paper with presenting challenges and promising research opportunities.</description>

      <title>A Case Study of Large Language Models (ChatGPT and CodeBERT) for Security-Oriented Code Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.12488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.12488v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: LLMs can be used on code analysis tasks like code review, vulnerabilities analysis and etc. However, the strengths and limitations of adopting these LLMs to the code analysis are still unclear. In this paper, we delve into LLMs' capabilities in security-oriented program analysis, considering perspectives from both attackers and security analysts. We focus on two representative LLMs, ChatGPT and CodeBert, and evaluate their performance in solving typical analytic tasks with varying levels of difficulty. Our study demonstrates the LLM's efficiency in learning high-level semantics from code, positioning ChatGPT as a potential asset in security-oriented contexts. However, it is essential to acknowledge certain limitations, such as the heavy reliance on well-defined variable and function names, making them unable to learn from anonymized code. For example, the performance of these LLMs heavily relies on the well-defined variable and function names, therefore, will not be able to learn anonymized code. We believe that the concerns raised in this case study deserve in-depth investigation in the future.</description>

      <title>ABACuS: All-Bank Activation Counters for Scalable and Low Overhead RowHammer Mitigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.09977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.09977v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce ABACuS, a new low-cost hardware-counter-based RowHammer mitigation technique that performance-, energy-, and area-efficiently scales with worsening RowHammer vulnerability. We observe that both benign workloads and RowHammer attacks tend to access DRAM rows with the same row address in multiple DRAM banks at around the same time. Based on this observation, ABACuS's key idea is to use a single shared row activation counter to track activations to the rows with the same row address in all DRAM banks. Unlike state-of-the-art RowHammer mitigation mechanisms that implement a separate row activation counter for each DRAM bank, ABACuS implements fewer counters (e.g., only one) to track an equal number of aggressor rows.
  Our evaluations show that ABACuS securely prevents RowHammer bitflips at low performance/energy overhead and low area cost. We compare ABACuS to four state-of-the-art mitigation mechanisms. At a near-future RowHammer threshold of 1000, ABACuS incurs only 0.58% (0.77%) performance and 1.66% (2.12%) DRAM energy overheads, averaged across 62 single-core (8-core) workloads, requiring only 9.47 KiB of storage per DRAM rank. At the RowHammer threshold of 1000, the best prior low-area-cost mitigation mechanism incurs 1.80% higher average performance overhead than ABACuS, while ABACuS requires 2.50X smaller chip area to implement. At a future RowHammer threshold of 125, ABACuS performs very similarly to (within 0.38% of the performance of) the best prior performance- and energy-efficient RowHammer mitigation mechanism while requiring 22.72X smaller chip area. ABACuS is freely and openly available at https://github.com/CMU-SAFARI/ABACuS.</description>

      <title>Read Disturbance in High Bandwidth Memory: A Detailed Experimental Study on HBM2 DRAM Chips</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.14665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.14665v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We experimentally demonstrate the effects of read disturbance (RowHammer and RowPress) and uncover the inner workings of undocumented read disturbance defense mechanisms in High Bandwidth Memory (HBM). Detailed characterization of six real HBM2 DRAM chips in two different FPGA boards shows that (1) the read disturbance vulnerability significantly varies between different HBM2 chips and between different components (e.g., 3D-stacked channels) inside a chip, (2) DRAM rows at the end and in the middle of a bank are more resilient to read disturbance, (3) fewer additional activations are sufficient to induce more read disturbance bitflips in a DRAM row if the row exhibits the first bitflip at a relatively high activation count, (4) a modern HBM2 chip implements undocumented read disturbance defenses that track potential aggressor rows based on how many times they are activated. We describe how our findings could be leveraged to develop more powerful read disturbance attacks and more efficient defense mechanisms. We open source all our code and data to facilitate future research at https://github.com/CMU-SAFARI/HBM-Read-Disturbance.</description>

      <title>Neural Exec: Learning (and Learning from) Execution Triggers for Prompt Injection Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03792v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a new family of prompt injection attacks, termed Neural Exec. Unlike known attacks that rely on handcrafted strings (e.g., "Ignore previous instructions and..."), we show that it is possible to conceptualize the creation of execution triggers as a differentiable search problem and use learning-based methods to autonomously generate them.
  Our results demonstrate that a motivated adversary can forge triggers that are not only drastically more effective than current handcrafted ones but also exhibit inherent flexibility in shape, properties, and functionality. In this direction, we show that an attacker can design and generate Neural Execs capable of persisting through multi-stage preprocessing pipelines, such as in the case of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)-based applications. More critically, our findings show that attackers can produce triggers that deviate markedly in form and shape from any known attack, sidestepping existing blacklist-based detection and sanitation approaches.</description>

      <title>Privacy-Preserving Diffusion Model Using Homomorphic Encryption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05794v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a privacy-preserving stable diffusion framework leveraging homomorphic encryption, called HE-Diffusion, which primarily focuses on protecting the denoising phase of the diffusion process. HE-Diffusion is a tailored encryption framework specifically designed to align with the unique architecture of stable diffusion, ensuring both privacy and functionality. To address the inherent computational challenges, we propose a novel min-distortion method that enables efficient partial image encryption, significantly reducing the overhead without compromising the model's output quality. Furthermore, we adopt a sparse tensor representation to expedite computational operations, enhancing the overall efficiency of the privacy-preserving diffusion process. We successfully implement HE-based privacy-preserving stable diffusion inference. The experimental results show that HE-Diffusion achieves 500 times speedup compared with the baseline method, and reduces time cost of the homomorphically encrypted inference to the minute level. Both the performance and accuracy of the HE-Diffusion are on par with the plaintext counterpart. Our approach marks a significant step towards integrating advanced cryptographic techniques with state-of-the-art generative models, paving the way for privacy-preserving and efficient image generation in critical applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03877v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-speed interconnects, such as NVLink, are integral to modern multi-GPU systems, acting as a vital link between CPUs and GPUs. This study highlights the vulnerability of multi-GPU systems to covert and side channel attacks due to congestion on interconnects. An adversary can infer private information about a victim's activities by monitoring NVLink congestion without needing special permissions. Leveraging this insight, we develop a covert channel attack across two GPUs with a bandwidth of 45.5 kbps and a low error rate, and introduce a side channel attack enabling attackers to fingerprint applications through the shared NVLink interconnect.</description>

      <title>On the Potential of Re-configurable Intelligent Surface (RIS)-assisted Physical Layer Authentication (PLA)</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00426v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Re-configurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS) technology is increasingly becoming a potential component for next-generation wireless networks, offering enhanced performance in terms of throughput, spectral, and energy efficiency. However, the broadcast nature of RIS-assisted wireless communication makes it vulnerable to malicious attacks at the physical layer. At the same time, physical layer authentication is gaining popularity as a solution to secure wireless networks, thwarting different attacks such as cloning, spoofing, and impersonation by using the random features of the physical layer.
  In this paper, we investigate RIS-assisted wireless communication systems to unlock the potential of using RIS for physical layer authentication (PLA). In particular, we exploit two distinct features of the physical layer: pathloss and channel impulse response (CIR) for PLA in RIS-assisted wireless communication. We construct hypothesis tests for the estimated features and derive closed-form error expressions. Further, we consider the critical error, i.e., missed detection, as our objective function to minimize by optimizing the phase shift of the RIS pannel. We compare the performance of our proposed mechanisms with PLA schemes using the same features but with no RIS. Furthermore, we thoroughly evaluate our proposed schemes using performance metrics such as the probability of false alarm (PFA), the probability of missed detection (PMD), and the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. The results demonstrate a clear positive impact of RIS on PLA, as it effectively reduces PMD values to zero when determining the optimal phase shift.</description>

Abstract: Quorum systems are a key abstraction in distributed fault-tolerant computing for capturing trust assumptions. They can be found at the core of many algorithms for implementing reliable broadcasts, shared memory, consensus and other problems. This paper introduces asymmetric Byzantine quorum systems that model subjective trust. Every process is free to choose which combinations of other processes it trusts and which ones it considers faulty. Asymmetric quorum systems strictly generalize standard Byzantine quorum systems, which have only one global trust assumption for all processes. This work also presents protocols that implement abstractions of shared memory, broadcast primitives, and a consensus protocol among processes prone to Byzantine faults and asymmetric trust. The model and protocols pave the way for realizing more elaborate algorithms with asymmetric trust.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2301.10226v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Potential harms of large language models can be mitigated by watermarking model output, i.e., embedding signals into generated text that are invisible to humans but algorithmically detectable from a short span of tokens. We propose a watermarking framework for proprietary language models. The watermark can be embedded with negligible impact on text quality, and can be detected using an efficient open-source algorithm without access to the language model API or parameters. The watermark works by selecting a randomized set of "green" tokens before a word is generated, and then softly promoting use of green tokens during sampling. We propose a statistical test for detecting the watermark with interpretable p-values, and derive an information-theoretic framework for analyzing the sensitivity of the watermark. We test the watermark using a multi-billion parameter model from the Open Pretrained Transformer (OPT) family, and discuss robustness and security.</description>

      <title>On the Reliability of Watermarks for Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.04634v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As LLMs become commonplace, machine-generated text has the potential to flood the internet with spam, social media bots, and valueless content. Watermarking is a simple and effective strategy for mitigating such harms by enabling the detection and documentation of LLM-generated text. Yet a crucial question remains: How reliable is watermarking in realistic settings in the wild? There, watermarked text may be modified to suit a user's needs, or entirely rewritten to avoid detection. We study the robustness of watermarked text after it is re-written by humans, paraphrased by a non-watermarked LLM, or mixed into a longer hand-written document. We find that watermarks remain detectable even after human and machine paraphrasing. While these attacks dilute the strength of the watermark, paraphrases are statistically likely to leak n-grams or even longer fragments of the original text, resulting in high-confidence detections when enough tokens are observed. For example, after strong human paraphrasing the watermark is detectable after observing 800 tokens on average, when setting a 1e-5 false positive rate. We also consider a range of new detection schemes that are sensitive to short spans of watermarked text embedded inside a large document, and we compare the robustness of watermarking to other kinds of detectors.</description>

      <title>Intriguing Properties of Diffusion Models: An Empirical Study of the Natural Attack Capability in Text-to-Image Generative Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.15692v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Denoising probabilistic diffusion models have shown breakthrough performance to generate more photo-realistic images or human-level illustrations than the prior models such as GANs. This high image-generation capability has stimulated the creation of many downstream applications in various areas. However, we find that this technology is actually a double-edged sword: We identify a new type of attack, called the Natural Denoising Diffusion (NDD) attack based on the finding that state-of-the-art deep neural network (DNN) models still hold their prediction even if we intentionally remove their robust features, which are essential to the human visual system (HVS), through text prompts. The NDD attack shows a significantly high capability to generate low-cost, model-agnostic, and transferable adversarial attacks by exploiting the natural attack capability in diffusion models. To systematically evaluate the risk of the NDD attack, we perform a large-scale empirical study with our newly created dataset, the Natural Denoising Diffusion Attack (NDDA) dataset. We evaluate the natural attack capability by answering 6 research questions. Through a user study, we find that it can achieve an 88% detection rate while being stealthy to 93% of human subjects; we also find that the non-robust features embedded by diffusion models contribute to the natural attack capability. To confirm the model-agnostic and transferable attack capability, we perform the NDD attack against the Tesla Model 3 and find that 73% of the physically printed attacks can be detected as stop signs. Our hope is that the study and dataset can help our community be aware of the risks in diffusion models and facilitate further research toward robust DNN models.</description>

      <title>On the Learnability of Watermarks for Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.04469v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Watermarking of language model outputs enables statistical detection of model-generated text, which can mitigate harms and misuses of language models. Existing watermarking strategies operate by altering the decoder of an existing language model. In this paper, we ask whether language models can directly learn to generate watermarked text, which would have significant implications for the real-world deployment of watermarks. First, learned watermarks could be used to build open models that naturally generate watermarked text, enabling watermarking for open models, where users can control the decoding procedure. Second, if watermarking is used to determine the provenance of generated text, an adversary can hurt the reputation of a victim model by spoofing its watermark and generating damaging watermarked text. To investigate the learnability of watermarks, we propose watermark distillation, which trains a student model to behave like a teacher model that uses decoding-based watermarking. We test our approach on three decoding-based watermarking strategies and various hyperparameter settings, finding that models can learn to generate watermarked text with high detectability. We also find limitations to learnability, including the loss of watermarking capabilities under fine-tuning on normal text and high sample complexity when learning low-distortion watermarks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.15502v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Differential privacy has emerged as an significant cornerstone in the realm of scientific hypothesis testing utilizing confidential data. In reporting scientific discoveries, Bayesian tests are widely adopted since they effectively circumnavigate the key criticisms of P-values, namely, lack of interpretability and inability to quantify evidence in support of the competing hypotheses. We present a novel differentially private Bayesian hypotheses testing framework that arise naturally under a principled data generative mechanism, inherently maintaining the interpretability of the resulting inferences. Furthermore, by focusing on differentially private Bayes factors based on widely used test statistics, we circumvent the need to model the complete data generative mechanism and ensure substantial computational benefits. We also provide a set of sufficient conditions to establish results on Bayes factor consistency under the proposed framework. The utility of the devised technology is showcased via several numerical experiments.</description>

Abstract: In current cellular network generations (4G, 5G) the IMS (IP Multimedia Subsystem) plays an integral role in terminating voice calls and short messages. Many operators use VoWiFi (Voice over Wi-Fi, also Wi-Fi calling) as an alternative network access technology to complement their cellular coverage in areas where no radio signal is available (e.g., rural territories or shielded buildings). In a mobile world where customers regularly traverse national borders, this can be used to avoid expensive international roaming fees while journeying overseas, since VoWiFi calls are usually invoiced at domestic rates. To not lose this revenue stream, some operators block access to the IMS for customers staying abroad.
  This work evaluates the current deployment status of VoWiFi among worldwide operators and analyzes existing geoblocking measures on the IP layer by measuring connectivity from over 200 countries. We show that a substantial share (IPv4: 14.6%, IPv6: 65.2%) of operators implement geoblocking at the DNS- or VoWiFi protocol level, and highlight severe drawbacks in terms of emergency calling service availability.</description>

      <title>MISLEAD: Manipulating Importance of Selected features for Learning Epsilon in Evasion Attack Deception</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15656</link>

Abstract: Emerging vulnerabilities in machine learning (ML) models due to adversarial attacks raise concerns about their reliability. Specifically, evasion attacks manipulate models by introducing precise perturbations to input data, causing erroneous predictions. To address this, we propose a methodology combining SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) for feature importance analysis with an innovative Optimal Epsilon technique for conducting evasion attacks. Our approach begins with SHAP-based analysis to understand model vulnerabilities, crucial for devising targeted evasion strategies. The Optimal Epsilon technique, employing a Binary Search algorithm, efficiently determines the minimum epsilon needed for successful evasion. Evaluation across diverse machine learning architectures demonstrates the technique's precision in generating adversarial samples, underscoring its efficacy in manipulating model outcomes. This study emphasizes the critical importance of continuous assessment and monitoring to identify and mitigate potential security risks in machine learning systems.</description>

      <title>Espresso: Robust Concept Filtering in Text-to-Image Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19227</link>

Abstract: Diffusion-based text-to-image (T2I) models generate high-fidelity images for given textual prompts. They are trained on large datasets scraped from the Internet, potentially containing unacceptable concepts (e.g., copyright infringing or unsafe). Retraining T2I models after filtering out unacceptable concepts in the training data is inefficient and degrades utility. Hence, there is a need for concept removal techniques (CRTs) which are effective in removing unacceptable concepts, utility-preserving on acceptable concepts, and robust against evasion with adversarial prompts. None of the prior filtering and fine-tuning CRTs satisfy all these requirements simultaneously.
  We introduce Espresso, the first robust concept filter based on Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training (CLIP). It identifies unacceptable concepts by projecting the generated image's embedding onto the vector connecting unacceptable and acceptable concepts in the joint text-image embedding space. This ensures robustness by restricting the adversary to adding noise only along this vector, in the direction of the acceptable concept. Further fine-tuning Espresso to separate embeddings of acceptable and unacceptable concepts, while preserving their pairing with image embeddings, ensures both effectiveness and utility. We evaluate Espresso on eleven concepts to show that it is effective (~5% CLIP accuracy on unacceptable concepts), utility-preserving (~93% normalized CLIP score on acceptable concepts), and robust (~4% CLIP accuracy on adversarial prompts for unacceptable concepts). Finally, we present theoretical bounds for the certified robustness of Espresso against adversarial prompts, and an empirical analysis.</description>
