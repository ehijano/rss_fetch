      <title>Reply To: Global Gridded Population Datasets Systematically Underrepresent Rural Population by Josias L\'ang-Ritter et al</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09248v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper titled ''Global gridded population datasets systematically underrepresent rural population'' by Josias L\'ang-Ritter et al. provides a valuable contribution to the discourse on the accuracy of global population datasets, particularly in rural areas. We recognize the efforts put into this research and appreciate its contribution to the field. However, we feel that key claims in the study are overly bold, not properly backed by evidence and lack a cautious and nuanced discussion. We hope these points will be taken into account in future discussions and refinements of population estimation methodologies. We argue that the reported bias figures are less caused by actual undercounting of rural populations, but more so by contestable methodological decisions and the historic misallocation of (gridded) population estimates on the local level.</description>

      <title>Population-scale Ancestral Recombination Graphs with tskit 1.0</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09649v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ancestral recombination graphs (ARGs) are an increasingly important component of population and statistical genetics. The tskit library has become key infrastructure for the field, providing an expressive and general representation of ARGs together with a suite of efficient fundamental operations. In this note, we announce tskit version 1.0, describe its underlying rationale, and document its stability guarantees. These guarantees provide a foundation for durable computational artefacts and support long-term reproducibility of code and analyses.</description>

      <title>Popularity Feedback Constrains Innovation in Cultural Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09997v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Real-world creative processes ranging from art to science rely on social feedback-loops between selection and creation. Yet, the effects of popularity feedback on collective creativity remain poorly understood. We investigate how popularity ratings influence cultural dynamics in a large-scale online experiment where participants ($N = 1\,008$) iteratively \textit{select} images from evolving markets and \textit{produce} their own modifications. Results show that exposing the popularity of images reduces cultural diversity and slows innovation, delaying aesthetic improvements. These findings are mediated by alterations of both selection and creation. During selection, popularity information triggers cumulative advantage, with participants preferentially building upon popular images, reducing diversity. During creation, participants make less disruptive changes, and are more likely to expand existing visual patterns. Feedback loops in cultural markets thus not only shape selection, but also, directly or indirectly, the form and direction of cultural innovation.</description>

      <title>A predator-prey model with age-structured role reversal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19748v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a predator-prey model with an age-structured predator population that exhibits a functional role reversal. The structure of the predator population in our model embodies the ecological concept of an "ontogenetic niche shift," in which a species' functional role changes as it grows. This structure adds complexity to our model but increases its biological relevance. The time evolution of the age-structured predator population is motivated by the Kermack-McKendrick Renewal Equation (KMRE). Unlike KMRE, the predator population's birth and death rate functions depend on the prey population's size. We establish the existence, uniqueness, and positivity of the solutions to the proposed model's initial value problem. The dynamical properties of the proposed model are investigated via Latin Hypercube Sampling in the 15-dimensional space of its parameters. Our Linear Discriminant Analysis suggests that the most influential parameters are the maturation age of the predator and the rate of consumption of juvenile predators by the prey. We carry out a detailed study of the long-term behavior of the proposed model as a function of these two parameters. In addition, we reduce the proposed age-structured model to ordinary and delayed differential equation (ODE and DDE) models. The comparison of the long-term behavior of the ODE, DDE, and the age-structured models with matching parameter settings shows that the age structure promotes the instability of the Coexistence Equilibrium and the emergence of the Coexistence Periodic Attractor.</description>

      <title>Generalized Lotka-Volterra model with sparse interactions: non-Gaussian effects and topological multiple-equilibria phase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20887v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the equilibrium phases of a generalized Lotka-Volterra model characterized by a species interaction matrix which is random, sparse and symmetric. Dynamical fluctuations are modeled by a demographic noise with amplitude proportional to the effective temperature T. The equilibrium distribution of species abundances is obtained by means of the cavity method and the Belief Propagation equations, which allow for an exact solution on sparse networks. Our results reveal a rich and non-trivial phenomenology that deviates significantly from the predictions of fully connected models. Consistently with data from real ecosystems, which are characterized by sparse rather than dense interaction networks, we find strong deviations from Gaussianity in the distribution of abundances. In addition to the study of these deviations from Gaussianity, which are not related to multiple-equilibria, we also identified a novel topological glass phase, present at both finite temperature, as shown here, and at T=0, as previously suggested in the literature. The peculiarity of this phase, which differs from the multiple-equilibria phase of fully-connected networks, is its strong dependence on the presence of extinctions. These findings provide new insights into how network topology and disorder influence ecological networks, particularly emphasizing that sparsity is a crucial feature for accurately modeling real-world ecological phenomena.</description>

      <title>The quenched coalescent for structured diploid populations with large migrations and uneven offspring distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21079v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work we describe a new model for the evolution of a diploid structured population backwards in time that allows for large migrations and uneven offspring distributions. The model generalizes both the mean-field model of Birkner et al. [\textit{Electron. J. Probab.} 23: 1-44 (2018)] and the haploid structured model of M\"{o}hle [\textit{Theor. Popul. Biol.} 2024 Apr:156:103-116]. We show convergence, with mild conditions on the joint distribution of offspring frequencies and migrations, of gene genealogies conditional on the pedigree to a time-inhomogeneous coalescent process driven by a Poisson point process $\Psi$ that records the timing and scale of large migrations and uneven offspring distributions. This quenched scaling limit demonstrates a significant difference in the predictions of the classical annealed theory of structured coalescent processes. In particular, the annealed and quenched scaling limits coincide if and only if these large migrations and uneven offspring distributions are absent. The proof proceeds by the method of moments and utilizes coupling techniques from the theory of random walks in random environments. Several examples are given and their quenched scaling limits established.</description>
