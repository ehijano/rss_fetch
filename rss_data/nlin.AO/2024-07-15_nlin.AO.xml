      <title>A mean field analysis of the role of indirect transmission in emergent infection events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09587v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We developed a mathematical model to investigate the role of indirect transmission in the spread of infectious diseases, using the illustrative example of sarcoptic mange as a case study. This disease can be transmitted through direct contact between an infected host and a susceptible one, or indirectly when potential hosts encounter infectious mites and larvae deposited in the environment, commonly referred to as fomites. Our focus is on exploring the potential of these infectious reservoirs as triggers for emerging infection events and as stable reservoirs of the disease. To achieve this, our mean field compartmental model incorporates the epidemiological dynamics driven by indirect transmission via fomites. We identify different types of dynamics that the system can go into, controlled by different levels of direct and indirect transmission. Among these, we find a new regime where the disease can emerge and persist over time solely through fomites, without the necessity for direct transmission. This possibility of the system reveals an evolutionary pathway that could enable the parasite to enhance its fitness beyond host co-evolution. We also define a new threshold based on an effective reproductive number, that enables us to predict the conditions for disease persistence. Our model allows us to assess the potential effectiveness of various disease intervention measures by incorporating a feature observed in real systems. We hope this contributes to a better understanding of infectious disease outbreaks.</description>

      <title>Spatio-temporal breather dynamics in microcomb soliton crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10213v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Solitons, the distinct balance between nonlinearity and dispersion, provide a route toward ultrafast electromagnetic pulse shaping, high-harmonic generation, real-time image processing, and RF photonic communications. Here we newly explore and observe the spatio-temporal breather dynamics of optical soliton crystals in frequency microcombs, examining spatial breathers, chaos transitions, and dynamical deterministic switching in nonlinear measurements and theory. To understand the breather solitons, we describe their dynamical routes and two example transitional maps of the ensemble spatial breathers, with and without chaos initiation. We elucidate the physical mechanisms of the breather dynamics in the soliton crystal microcombs, in the interaction plane limit cycles and in the domain-wall understanding with parity symmetry breaking from third order dispersion. We present maps of the accessible nonlinear regions, the breather frequency dependences on third order dispersion and avoided mode crossing strengths, and the transition between the collective breather spatiotemporal states. Our range of measurements matches well with our first-principles theory and nonlinear modeling. To image these soliton ensembles and their breathers, we further constructed panoramic temporal imaging for simultaneous fast and slow axis two dimensional mapping of the breathers. In the phase differential sampling, we present two dimensional evolution maps of soliton crystal breathers, including with defects, in both stable breathers and breathers with drift. Our fundamental studies contribute to the understanding of nonlinear dynamics in soliton crystal complexes, their spatiotemporal dependences, and their stability-existence zones.</description>

      <title>Implementation of digital MemComputing using standard electronic components</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.12437</link>

Abstract: Digital MemComputing machines (DMMs), which employ nonlinear dynamical systems with memory (time non-locality), have proven to be a robust and scalable unconventional computing approach for solving a wide variety of combinatorial optimization problems. However, most of the research so far has focused on the numerical simulations of the equations of motion of DMMs. This inevitably subjects time to discretization, which brings its own (numerical) issues that would be otherwise absent in actual physical systems operating in continuous time. Although hardware realizations of DMMs have been previously suggested, their implementation would require materials and devices that are not so easy to integrate with traditional electronics. Addressing this, our study introduces a novel hardware design for DMMs, utilizing readily available electronic components. This approach not only significantly boosts computational speed compared to current models but also exhibits remarkable robustness against additive noise. Crucially, it circumvents the limitations imposed by numerical noise, ensuring enhanced stability and reliability during extended operations. This paves a new path for tackling increasingly complex problems, leveraging the inherent advantages of DMMs in a more practical and accessible framework.</description>

      <title>Emergence and long-term maintenance of modularity in plastic networks of spiking neurons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18587v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the last three decades it has become clear that cortical regions, interconnected via white-matter fibers, form a modular and hierarchical network. This organization, which has also been seen at the microscopic level in the form of interconnected neural assemblies, is believed to support the coexistence of segregation (specialization) and integration (binding) of information. A fundamental open question is to understand how this complex structure can emerge in the brain. Here, we made a first step to address this question and propose that adaptation to various inputs could be the key driving mechanism for the formation of structural assemblies. To test this idea, we develop a model of quadratic integrate-and-fire spiking neurons, trained to stimuli targetting distinct sub-populations. The model is designed to satisfy several biologically plausible constraints: (i) the network contains excitatory and inhibitory neurons with Hebbian and anti-Hebbian STDP; and (ii) neither the neuronal activity nor the synaptic weights are frozen after the learning phase. Instead, the network continues firing spontaneously while synaptic plasticity remains active. We find that only the combination of the two inhibitory STDP sub-populations allows for the formation of stable modular organization in the network, with each sub-population playing a distinct role. The Hebbian sub-population controls for the firing rate and the anti-Hebbian mediates pattern selectivity. After the learning phase, the network activity settles into an asynchronous irregular resting-state, resembling the behaviour typically observed in-vivo in the cortex. This post-learning activity also displays spontaneous memory recalls, which are fundamental for the long-term consolidation of the learned memory items. The model introduced represents a starting point for the joint investigation of neural dynamics, connectivity and plasticity.</description>
