      <title>Finite-Sample Convergence Bounds for Trust Region Policy Optimization in Mean-Field Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce Mean-Field Trust Region Policy Optimization (MF-TRPO), a novel algorithm designed to compute approximate Nash equilibria for ergodic Mean-Field Games (MFG) in finite state-action spaces. Building on the well-established performance of TRPO in the reinforcement learning (RL) setting, we extend its methodology to the MFG framework, leveraging its stability and robustness in policy optimization. Under standard assumptions in the MFG literature, we provide a rigorous analysis of MF-TRPO, establishing theoretical guarantees on its convergence. Our results cover both the exact formulation of the algorithm and its sample-based counterpart, where we derive high-probability guarantees and finite sample complexity. This work advances MFG optimization by bridging RL techniques with mean-field decision-making, offering a theoretically grounded approach to solving complex multi-agent problems.</description>

      <title>Highly Efficient and Effective LLMs with Multi-Boolean Architectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22811v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Weight binarization has emerged as a promising strategy to drastically reduce the complexity of large language models (LLMs). It is mainly classified into two approaches: post-training binarization and finetuning with training-aware binarization methods. The first approach, while having low complexity, leads to significant loss of information from the original LLMs, resulting in poor performance. The second approach, on the other hand, relies heavily on full-precision latent weights for gradient approximation of binary weights, which not only remains suboptimal but also introduces substantial complexity. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework that effectively transforms LLMs into multi-kernel Boolean parameters, for the first time, finetunes them directly in the Boolean domain, eliminating the need for expensive latent weights. This significantly reduces complexity during both finetuning and inference. Through extensive and insightful experiments across a wide range of LLMs, we demonstrate that our method outperforms recent ultra low-bit quantization and binarization methods.</description>

      <title>Theoretical Foundations of the Deep Copula Classifier: A Generative Approach to Modeling Dependent Features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22997v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional classifiers often assume feature independence or rely on overly simplistic relationships, leading to poor performance in settings where real-world dependencies matter. We introduce the Deep Copula Classifier (DCC), a generative model that separates the learning of each feature's marginal distribution from the modeling of their joint dependence structure via neural network-parameterized copulas. For each class, lightweight neural networks are used to flexibly and adaptively capture feature interactions, making DCC particularly effective when classification is driven by complex dependencies. We establish that DCC converges to the Bayes-optimal classifier under standard conditions and provide explicit convergence rates of O(n^{-r/(2r + d)}) for r-smooth copula densities. Beyond theoretical guarantees, we outline several practical extensions, including high-dimensional scalability through vine and factor copula architectures, semi-supervised learning via entropy regularization, and online adaptation using streaming gradient methods. By unifying statistical rigor with the representational power of neural networks, DCC offers a mathematically grounded and interpretable framework for dependency-aware classification.</description>

      <title>JAPAN: Joint Adaptive Prediction Areas with Normalising-Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conformal prediction provides a model-agnostic framework for uncertainty quantification with finite-sample validity guarantees, making it an attractive tool for constructing reliable prediction sets. However, existing approaches commonly rely on residual-based conformity scores, which impose geometric constraints and struggle when the underlying distribution is multimodal. In particular, they tend to produce overly conservative prediction areas centred around the mean, often failing to capture the true shape of complex predictive distributions. In this work, we introduce JAPAN (Joint Adaptive Prediction Areas with Normalising-Flows), a conformal prediction framework that uses density-based conformity scores. By leveraging flow-based models, JAPAN estimates the (predictive) density and constructs prediction areas by thresholding on the estimated density scores, enabling compact, potentially disjoint, and context-adaptive regions that retain finite-sample coverage guarantees. We theoretically motivate the efficiency of JAPAN and empirically validate it across multivariate regression and forecasting tasks, demonstrating good calibration and tighter prediction areas compared to existing baselines. We also provide several \emph{extensions} adding flexibility to our proposed framework.</description>

      <title>Stable Thompson Sampling: Valid Inference via Variance Inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23260v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of statistical inference when the data is collected via a Thompson Sampling-type algorithm. While Thompson Sampling (TS) is known to be both asymptotically optimal and empirically effective, its adaptive sampling scheme poses challenges for constructing confidence intervals for model parameters. We propose and analyze a variant of TS, called Stable Thompson Sampling, in which the posterior variance is inflated by a logarithmic factor. We show that this modification leads to asymptotically normal estimates of the arm means, despite the non-i.i.d. nature of the data. Importantly, this statistical benefit comes at a modest cost: the variance inflation increases regret by only a logarithmic factor compared to standard TS. Our results reveal a principled trade-off: by paying a small price in regret, one can enable valid statistical inference for adaptive decision-making algorithms.</description>

      <title>The Strong, Weak and Benign Goodhart's law. An independence-free and paradigm-agnostic formalisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23445v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Goodhart's law is a famous adage in policy-making that states that ``When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure''. As machine learning models and the optimisation capacity to train them grow, growing empirical evidence reinforced the belief in the validity of this law without however being formalised. Recently, a few attempts were made to formalise Goodhart's law, either by categorising variants of it, or by looking at how optimising a proxy metric affects the optimisation of an intended goal. In this work, we alleviate the simplifying independence assumption, made in previous works, and the assumption on the learning paradigm made in most of them, to study the effect of the coupling between the proxy metric and the intended goal on Goodhart's law. Our results show that in the case of light tailed goal and light tailed discrepancy, dependence does not change the nature of Goodhart's effect. However, in the light tailed goal and heavy tailed discrepancy case, we exhibit an example where over-optimisation occurs at a rate inversely proportional to the heavy tailedness of the discrepancy between the goal and the metric. %</description>

      <title>Learning Parametric Distributions from Samples and Preferences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23557v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in language modeling have underscored the role of preference feedback in enhancing model performance. This paper investigates the conditions under which preference feedback improves parameter estimation in classes of continuous parametric distributions. In our framework, the learner observes pairs of samples from an unknown distribution along with their relative preferences depending on the same unknown parameter. We show that preference-based M-estimators achieve a better asymptotic variance than sample-only M-estimators, further improved by deterministic preferences. Leveraging the hard constraints revealed by deterministic preferences, we propose an estimator achieving an estimation error scaling of $\mathcal{O}(1/n)$ -- a significant improvement over the $\Theta(1/\sqrt{n})$ rate attainable with samples alone. Next, we establish a lower bound that matches this accelerated rate; up to dimension and problem-dependent constants. While the assumptions underpinning our analysis are restrictive, they are satisfied by notable cases such as Gaussian or Laplace distributions for preferences based on the log-probability reward.</description>

      <title>Multilook Coherent Imaging: Theoretical Guarantees and Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multilook coherent imaging is a widely used technique in applications such as digital holography, ultrasound imaging, and synthetic aperture radar. A central challenge in these systems is the presence of multiplicative noise, commonly known as speckle, which degrades image quality. Despite the widespread use of coherent imaging systems, their theoretical foundations remain relatively underexplored. In this paper, we study both the theoretical and algorithmic aspects of likelihood-based approaches for multilook coherent imaging, providing a rigorous framework for analysis and method development. Our theoretical contributions include establishing the first theoretical upper bound on the Mean Squared Error (MSE) of the maximum likelihood estimator under the deep image prior hypothesis. Our results capture the dependence of MSE on the number of parameters in the deep image prior, the number of looks, the signal dimension, and the number of measurements per look. On the algorithmic side, we employ projected gradient descent (PGD) as an efficient method for computing the maximum likelihood solution. Furthermore, we introduce two key ideas to enhance the practical performance of PGD. First, we incorporate the Newton-Schulz algorithm to compute matrix inverses within the PGD iterations, significantly reducing computational complexity. Second, we develop a bagging strategy to mitigate projection errors introduced during PGD updates. We demonstrate that combining these techniques with PGD yields state-of-the-art performance. Our code is available at https://github.com/Computational-Imaging-RU/Bagged-DIP-Speckle.</description>

      <title>Instance-Optimality for Private KL Distribution Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23620v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the fundamental problem of estimating an unknown discrete distribution $p$ over $d$ symbols, given $n$ i.i.d. samples from the distribution. We are interested in minimizing the KL divergence between the true distribution and the algorithm's estimate. We first construct minimax optimal private estimators. Minimax optimality however fails to shed light on an algorithm's performance on individual (non-worst-case) instances $p$ and simple minimax-optimal DP estimators can have poor empirical performance on real distributions. We then study this problem from an instance-optimality viewpoint, where the algorithm's error on $p$ is compared to the minimum achievable estimation error over a small local neighborhood of $p$. Under natural notions of local neighborhood, we propose algorithms that achieve instance-optimality up to constant factors, with and without a differential privacy constraint. Our upper bounds rely on (private) variants of the Good-Turing estimator. Our lower bounds use additive local neighborhoods that more precisely captures the hardness of distribution estimation in KL divergence, compared to ones considered in prior works.</description>

      <title>On the Convergence Analysis of Muon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23737v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The majority of parameters in neural networks are naturally represented as matrices. However, most commonly used optimizers treat these matrix parameters as flattened vectors during optimization, potentially overlooking their inherent structural properties. Recently, an optimizer called Muon has been proposed, specifically designed to optimize matrix-structured parameters. Extensive empirical evidence shows that Muon can significantly outperform traditional optimizers when training neural networks. Nonetheless, the theoretical understanding of Muon's convergence behavior and the reasons behind its superior performance remain limited. In this work, we present a comprehensive convergence rate analysis of Muon and its comparison with Gradient Descent (GD). We further characterize the conditions under which Muon can outperform GD. Our theoretical results reveal that Muon can benefit from the low-rank and approximate blockwise diagonal structure of Hessian matrices -- phenomena widely observed in practical neural network training. Our experimental results support and corroborate the theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Investigating the effectiveness of multimodal data in forecasting SARS-COV-2 case surges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22688v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic response relied heavily on statistical and machine learning models to predict key outcomes such as case prevalence and fatality rates. These predictions were instrumental in enabling timely public health interventions that helped break transmission cycles. While most existing models are grounded in traditional epidemiological data, the potential of alternative datasets, such as those derived from genomic information and human behavior, remains underexplored. In the current study, we investigated the usefulness of diverse modalities of feature sets in predicting case surges. Our results highlight the relative effectiveness of biological (e.g., mutations), public health (e.g., case counts, policy interventions) and human behavioral features (e.g., mobility and social media conversations) in predicting country-level case surges. Importantly, we uncover considerable heterogeneity in predictive performance across countries and feature modalities, suggesting that surge prediction models may need to be tailored to specific national contexts and pandemic phases. Overall, our work highlights the value of integrating alternative data sources into existing disease surveillance frameworks to enhance the prediction of pandemic dynamics.</description>

      <title>Private Rate-Constrained Optimization with Applications to Fair Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22703v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many problems in trustworthy ML can be formulated as minimization of the model error under constraints on the prediction rates of the model for suitably-chosen marginals, including most group fairness constraints (demographic parity, equality of odds, etc.). In this work, we study such constrained minimization problems under differential privacy (DP). Standard DP optimization techniques like DP-SGD rely on the loss function's decomposability into per-sample contributions. However, rate constraints introduce inter-sample dependencies, violating the decomposability requirement. To address this, we develop RaCO-DP, a DP variant of the Stochastic Gradient Descent-Ascent (SGDA) algorithm which solves the Lagrangian formulation of rate constraint problems. We demonstrate that the additional privacy cost of incorporating these constraints reduces to privately estimating a histogram over the mini-batch at each optimization step. We prove the convergence of our algorithm through a novel analysis of SGDA that leverages the linear structure of the dual parameter. Finally, empirical results on learning under group fairness constraints demonstrate that our method Pareto-dominates existing private learning approaches in fairness-utility trade-offs.</description>

      <title>Kernel-Smoothed Scores for Denoising Diffusion: A Bias-Variance Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22841v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models now set the benchmark in high-fidelity generative sampling, yet they can, in principle, be prone to memorization. In this case, their learned score overfits the finite dataset so that the reverse-time SDE samples are mostly training points. In this paper, we interpret the empirical score as a noisy version of the true score and show that its covariance matrix is asymptotically a re-weighted data PCA. In large dimension, the small time limit makes the noise variance blow up while simultaneously reducing spatial correlation. To reduce this variance, we introduce a kernel-smoothed empirical score and analyze its bias-variance trade-off. We derive asymptotic bounds on the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the true distribution and the one generated by the modified reverse SDE. Regularization on the score has the same effect as increasing the size of the training dataset, and thus helps prevent memorization. A spectral decomposition of the forward diffusion suggests better variance control under some regularity conditions of the true data distribution. Reverse diffusion with kernel-smoothed empirical score can be reformulated as a gradient descent drifted toward a Log-Exponential Double-Kernel Density Estimator (LED-KDE). This perspective highlights two regularization mechanisms taking place in denoising diffusions: an initial Gaussian kernel first diffuses mass isotropically in the ambient space, while a second kernel applied in score space concentrates and spreads that mass along the data manifold. Hence, even a straightforward regularization-without any learning-already mitigates memorization and enhances generalization. Numerically, we illustrate our results with several experiments on synthetic and MNIST datasets.</description>

      <title>Forecasting Residential Heating and Electricity Demand with Scalable, High-Resolution, Open-Source Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22873v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel framework for high-resolution forecasting of residential heating and electricity demand using probabilistic deep learning models. We focus specifically on providing hourly building-level electricity and heating demand forecasts for the residential sector. Leveraging multimodal building-level information -- including data on building footprint areas, heights, nearby building density, nearby building size, land use patterns, and high-resolution weather data -- and probabilistic modeling, our methods provide granular insights into demand heterogeneity. Validation at the building level underscores a step change improvement in performance relative to NREL's ResStock model, which has emerged as a research community standard for residential heating and electricity demand characterization. In building-level heating and electricity estimation backtests, our probabilistic models respectively achieve RMSE scores 18.3\% and 35.1\% lower than those based on ResStock. By offering an open-source, scalable, high-resolution platform for demand estimation and forecasting, this research advances the tools available for policymakers and grid planners, contributing to the broader effort to decarbonize the U.S. building stock and meeting climate objectives.</description>

Abstract: We study an extension of contextual stochastic linear optimization (CSLO) that, in contrast to most of the existing literature, involves inequality constraints that depend on uncertain parameters predicted by a machine learning model. To handle the constraint uncertainty, we use contextual uncertainty sets constructed via methods like conformal prediction. Given a contextual uncertainty set method, we introduce the "Smart Predict-then-Optimize with Robust Constraints" (SPO-RC) loss, a feasibility-sensitive adaptation of the SPO loss that measures decision error of predicted objective parameters. We also introduce a convex surrogate, SPO-RC+, and prove Fisher consistency with SPO-RC. To enhance performance, we train on truncated datasets where true constraint parameters lie within the uncertainty sets, and we correct the induced sample selection bias using importance reweighting techniques. Through experiments on fractional knapsack and alloy production problem instances, we demonstrate that SPO-RC+ effectively handles uncertainty in constraints and that combining truncation with importance reweighting can further improve performance.</description>

      <title>Revisit CP Tensor Decomposition: Statistical Optimality and Fast Convergence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23046v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Canonical Polyadic (CP) tensor decomposition is a fundamental technique for analyzing high-dimensional tensor data. While the Alternating Least Squares (ALS) algorithm is widely used for computing CP decomposition due to its simplicity and empirical success, its theoretical foundation, particularly regarding statistical optimality and convergence behavior, remain underdeveloped, especially in noisy, non-orthogonal, and higher-rank settings.
  In this work, we revisit CP tensor decomposition from a statistical perspective and provide a comprehensive theoretical analysis of ALS under a signal-plus-noise model. We establish non-asymptotic, minimax-optimal error bounds for tensors of general order, dimensions, and rank, assuming suitable initialization. To enable such initialization, we propose Tucker-based Approximation with Simultaneous Diagonalization (TASD), a robust method that improves stability and accuracy in noisy regimes. Combined with ALS, TASD yields a statistically consistent estimator. We further analyze the convergence dynamics of ALS, identifying a two-phase pattern-initial quadratic convergence followed by linear refinement. We further show that in the rank-one setting, ALS with an appropriately chosen initialization attains optimal error within just one or two iterations.</description>

      <title>Improved Last-Iterate Convergence of Shuffling Gradient Methods for Nonsmooth Convex Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23056v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the convergence of the shuffling gradient method, a popular algorithm employed to minimize the finite-sum function with regularization, in which functions are passed to apply (Proximal) Gradient Descent (GD) one by one whose order is determined by a permutation on the indices of functions. In contrast to its easy implementation and effective performance in practice, the theoretical understanding remains limited. A recent advance by (Liu &amp; Zhou, 2024b) establishes the first last-iterate convergence results under various settings, especially proving the optimal rates for smooth (strongly) convex optimization. However, their bounds for nonsmooth (strongly) convex functions are only as fast as Proximal GD. In this work, we provide the first improved last-iterate analysis for the nonsmooth case demonstrating that the widely used Random Reshuffle ($\textsf{RR}$) and Single Shuffle ($\textsf{SS}$) strategies are both provably faster than Proximal GD, reflecting the benefit of randomness. As an important implication, we give the first (nearly) optimal convergence result for the suffix average under the $\textsf{RR}$ sampling scheme in the general convex case, matching the lower bound shown by (Koren et al., 2022).</description>

      <title>Gradient Methods with Online Scaling Part I. Theoretical Foundations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23081v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper establishes the theoretical foundations of the online scaled gradient methods (OSGM), a framework that utilizes online learning to adapt stepsizes and provably accelerate first-order methods. OSGM quantifies the effectiveness of a stepsize by a feedback function motivated from a convergence measure and uses the feedback to adjust the stepsize through an online learning algorithm. Consequently, instantiations of OSGM achieve convergence rates that are asymptotically no worse than the optimal stepsize. OSGM yields desirable convergence guarantees on smooth convex problems, including 1) trajectory-dependent global convergence on smooth convex objectives; 2) an improved complexity result on smooth strongly convex problems, and 3) local superlinear convergence. Notably, OSGM constitutes a new family of first-order methods with non-asymptotic superlinear convergence, joining the celebrated quasi-Newton methods. Finally, OSGM explains the empirical success of the popular hypergradient-descent heuristic in optimization for machine learning.</description>

      <title>Joint estimation of smooth graph signals from partial linear measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23240v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given an undirected and connected graph $G$ on $T$ vertices, suppose each vertex $t$ has a latent signal $x_t \in \mathbb{R}^n$ associated to it. Given partial linear measurements of the signals, for a potentially small subset of the vertices, our goal is to estimate $x_t$'s. Assuming that the signals are smooth w.r.t $G$, in the sense that the quadratic variation of the signals over the graph is small, we obtain non-asymptotic bounds on the mean squared error for jointly recovering $x_t$'s, for the smoothness penalized least squares estimator. In particular, this implies for certain choices of $G$ that this estimator is weakly consistent (as $T \rightarrow \infty$) under potentially very stringent sampling, where only one coordinate is measured per vertex for a vanishingly small fraction of the vertices. The results are extended to a ``multi-layer'' ranking problem where $x_t$ corresponds to the latent strengths of a collection of $n$ items, and noisy pairwise difference measurements are obtained at each ``layer'' $t$ via a measurement graph $G_t$. Weak consistency is established for certain choices of $G$ even when the individual $G_t$'s are very sparse and disconnected.</description>

      <title>Efficient Parameter Estimation for Bayesian Network Classifiers using Hierarchical Linear Smoothing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23320v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bayesian network classifiers (BNCs) possess a number of properties desirable for a modern classifier: They are easily interpretable, highly scalable, and offer adaptable complexity. However, traditional methods for learning BNCs have historically underperformed when compared to leading classification methods such as random forests. Recent parameter smoothing techniques using hierarchical Dirichlet processes (HDPs) have enabled BNCs to achieve performance competitive with random forests on categorical data, but these techniques are relatively inflexible, and require a complicated, specialized sampling process. In this paper, we introduce a novel method for parameter estimation that uses a log-linear regression to approximate the behaviour of HDPs. As a linear model, our method is remarkably flexible and simple to interpret, and can leverage the vast literature on learning linear models. Our experiments show that our method can outperform HDP smoothing while being orders of magnitude faster, remaining competitive with random forests on categorical data.</description>

      <title>Improved Learning via k-DTW: A Novel Dissimilarity Measure for Curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23431v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces $k$-Dynamic Time Warping ($k$-DTW), a novel dissimilarity measure for polygonal curves. $k$-DTW has stronger metric properties than Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) and is more robust to outliers than the Fr\'{e}chet distance, which are the two gold standards of dissimilarity measures for polygonal curves. We show interesting properties of $k$-DTW and give an exact algorithm as well as a $(1+\varepsilon)$-approximation algorithm for $k$-DTW by a parametric search for the $k$-th largest matched distance. We prove the first dimension-free learning bounds for curves and further learning theoretic results. $k$-DTW not only admits smaller sample size than DTW for the problem of learning the median of curves, where some factors depending on the curves' complexity $m$ are replaced by $k$, but we also show a surprising separation on the associated Rademacher and Gaussian complexities: $k$-DTW admits strictly smaller bounds than DTW, by a factor $\tilde\Omega(\sqrt{m})$ when $k\ll m$. We complement our theoretical findings with an experimental illustration of the benefits of using $k$-DTW for clustering and nearest neighbor classification.</description>

      <title>Epistemic Errors of Imperfect Multitask Learners When Distributions Shift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23496v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When data are noisy, a statistical learner's goal is to resolve epistemic uncertainty about the data it will encounter at test-time, i.e., to identify the distribution of test (target) data. Many real-world learning settings introduce sources of epistemic uncertainty that can not be resolved on the basis of training (source) data alone: The source data may arise from multiple tasks (multitask learning), the target data may differ systematically from the source data tasks (distribution shift), and/or the learner may not arrive at an accurate characterization of the source data (imperfect learning). We introduce a principled definition of epistemic error, and provide a generic, decompositional epistemic error bound. Our error bound is the first to (i) consider epistemic error specifically, (ii) accommodate all the sources of epistemic uncertainty above, and (iii) separately attribute the error to each of multiple aspects of the learning procedure and environment. As corollaries of the generic result, we provide (i) epistemic error bounds specialized to the settings of Bayesian transfer learning and distribution shift within $\epsilon$-neighborhoods, and (ii) a set of corresponding generalization bounds. Finally, we provide a novel definition of negative transfer, and validate its insights in a synthetic experimental setting.</description>

      <title>A Gibbs Sampler for Efficient Bayesian Inference in Sign-Identified SVARs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.23542v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a new algorithm for inference based on SVARs identified with sign restrictions. The key insight of our algorithm is to break apart from the accept-reject tradition associated with sign-identified SVARs. We show that embedding an elliptical slice sampling within a Gibbs sampler approach can deliver dramatic gains in speed and turn previously infeasible applications into feasible ones. We provide a tractable example to illustrate the power of the elliptical slice sampling applied to sign-identified SVARs. We demonstrate the usefulness of our algorithm by applying it to a well-known small-SVAR model of the oil market featuring a tight identified set as well as to large SVAR model with more than 100 sign restrictions.</description>

      <title>Going from a Representative Agent to Counterfactuals in Combinatorial Choice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23546v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study decision-making problems where data comprises points from a collection of binary polytopes, capturing aggregate information stemming from various combinatorial selection environments. We propose a nonparametric approach for counterfactual inference in this setting based on a representative agent model, where the available data is viewed as arising from maximizing separable concave utility functions over the respective binary polytopes. Our first contribution is to precisely characterize the selection probabilities representable under this model and show that verifying the consistency of any given aggregated selection dataset reduces to solving a polynomial-sized linear program. Building on this characterization, we develop a nonparametric method for counterfactual prediction. When data is inconsistent with the model, finding a best-fitting approximation for prediction reduces to solving a compact mixed-integer convex program. Numerical experiments based on synthetic data demonstrate the method's flexibility, predictive accuracy, and strong representational power even under model misspecification.</description>

      <title>On Transferring Transferability: Towards a Theory for Size Generalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23599v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many modern learning tasks require models that can take inputs of varying sizes. Consequently, dimension-independent architectures have been proposed for domains where the inputs are graphs, sets, and point clouds. Recent work on graph neural networks has explored whether a model trained on low-dimensional data can transfer its performance to higher-dimensional inputs. We extend this body of work by introducing a general framework for transferability across dimensions. We show that transferability corresponds precisely to continuity in a limit space formed by identifying small problem instances with equivalent large ones. This identification is driven by the data and the learning task. We instantiate our framework on existing architectures, and implement the necessary changes to ensure their transferability. Finally, we provide design principles for designing new transferable models. Numerical experiments support our findings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.23614v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Classical search algorithms have long underpinned modern artificial intelligence. In this work, we tackle the challenge of inference-time control in diffusion models -- adapting generated outputs to meet diverse test-time objectives -- using principles from classical search. We propose a general framework that orchestrates local and global search to efficiently navigate the generative space. It employs a theoretically grounded local search via annealed Langevin MCMC and performs compute-efficient global exploration using breadth-first and depth-first tree search. We evaluate our approach on a range of challenging domains, including planning, offline reinforcement learning, and image generation. Across all tasks, we observe significant gains in both performance and efficiency. These results show that classical search provides a principled and practical foundation for inference-time scaling in diffusion models.

      <title>COBRA: Contextual Bandit Algorithm for Ensuring Truthful Strategic Agents</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.23720v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper considers a contextual bandit problem involving multiple agents, where a learner sequentially observes the contexts and the agent's reported arms, and then selects the arm that maximizes the system's overall reward. Existing work in contextual bandits assumes that agents truthfully report their arms, which is unrealistic in many real-life applications. For instance, consider an online platform with multiple sellers; some sellers may misrepresent product quality to gain an advantage, such as having the platform preferentially recommend their products to online users. To address this challenge, we propose an algorithm, COBRA, for contextual bandit problems involving strategic agents that disincentivize their strategic behavior without using any monetary incentives, while having incentive compatibility and a sub-linear regret guarantee. Our experimental results also validate the different performance aspects of our proposed algorithm.</description>

Abstract: A/B testing has become the gold standard for policy evaluation in modern technological industries. Motivated by the widespread use of switchback experiments in A/B testing, this paper conducts a comprehensive comparative analysis of various switchback designs in Markovian environments. Unlike many existing works which derive the optimal design based on specific and relatively simple estimators, our analysis covers a range of state-of-the-art estimators developed in the reinforcement learning (RL) literature. It reveals that the effectiveness of different switchback designs depends crucially on (i) the size of the carryover effect and (ii) the auto-correlations among reward errors over time. Meanwhile, these findings are estimator-agnostic, i.e., they apply to most RL estimators. Based on these insights, we provide a workflow to offer guidelines for practitioners on designing switchback experiments in A/B testing.</description>

Abstract: We propose a novel Thompson sampling algorithm that learns linear quadratic regulators (LQR) with a Bayesian regret bound of $O(\sqrt{T})$. Our method leverages Langevin dynamics with a carefully designed preconditioner and incorporates a simple excitation mechanism. We show that the excitation signal drives the minimum eigenvalue of the preconditioner to grow over time, thereby accelerating the approximate posterior sampling process. Furthermore, we establish nontrivial concentration properties of the approximate posteriors generated by our algorithm. These properties enable us to bound the moments of the system state and attain an $O(\sqrt{T})$ regret bound without relying on the restrictive assumptions that are often used in the literature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06390v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Conformal prediction provides machine learning models with prediction sets that offer theoretical guarantees, but the underlying assumption of exchangeability limits its applicability to time series data. Furthermore, existing approaches struggle to handle multi-step ahead prediction tasks, where uncertainty estimates across multiple future time points are crucial. We propose JANET (Joint Adaptive predictioN-region Estimation for Time-series), a novel framework for constructing conformal prediction regions that are valid for both univariate and multivariate time series. JANET generalises the inductive conformal framework and efficiently produces joint prediction regions with controlled K-familywise error rates, enabling flexible adaptation to specific application needs. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates JANET's superior performance in multi-step prediction tasks across diverse time series datasets, highlighting its potential for reliable and interpretable uncertainty quantification in sequential data.</description>

      <title>Instance-dependent Convergence Theory for Diffusion Models</title>

Abstract: Score-based diffusion models have demonstrated outstanding empirical performance in machine learning and artificial intelligence, particularly in generating high-quality new samples from complex probability distributions. Improving the theoretical understanding of diffusion models, with a particular focus on the convergence analysis, has attracted significant attention. In this work, we develop a convergence rate that is adaptive to the smoothness of different target distributions, referred to as instance-dependent bound. Specifically, we establish an iteration complexity of $\min\{d,d^{2/3}L^{1/3},d^{1/3}L\}\varepsilon^{-2/3}$ (up to logarithmic factors), where $d$ denotes the data dimension, and $\varepsilon$ quantifies the output accuracy in terms of total variation (TV) distance. In addition, $L$ represents a relaxed Lipschitz constant, which, in the case of Gaussian mixture models, scales only logarithmically with the number of components, the dimension and iteration number, demonstrating broad applicability.</description>

      <title>Scalable Differentially Private Bayesian Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.06044v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, there has been much work on scaling Bayesian Optimization to high-dimensional problems, for example hyperparameter tuning in large machine learning models. These scalable methods have been successful, finding high objective values much more quickly than traditional global Bayesian Optimization or random search-based methods. At the same time, these large models often use sensitive data, but preservation of Differential Privacy has not scaled alongside these modern Bayesian Optimization procedures. Here we develop a method to privately optimize potentially high-dimensional parameter spaces using privatized Gradient Informative Bayesian Optimization. Our theoretical results show that under suitable conditions, our method converges exponentially fast to a locally optimal parameter configuration, up to a natural privacy error. Moreover, regardless of whether the assumptions are satisfied, we prove that our algorithm maintains privacy and empirically display superior performance to existing methods in the high-dimensional hyperparameter setting.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we provide a refined analysis of the UCBVI algorithm (Azar et al., 2017), improving both the bonus terms and the regret analysis. Additionally, we compare our version of UCBVI with both its original version and the state-of-the-art MVP algorithm. Our empirical validation demonstrates that improving the multiplicative constants in the bounds has significant positive effects on the empirical performance of the algorithms.</description>

      <title>A False Discovery Rate Control Method Using a Fully Connected Hidden Markov Random Field for Neuroimaging Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20688v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: False discovery rate (FDR) control methods are essential for voxel-wise multiple testing in neuroimaging data analysis, where hundreds of thousands or even millions of tests are conducted to detect brain regions associated with disease-related changes. Classical FDR control methods (e.g., BH, q-value, and LocalFDR) assume independence among tests and often lead to high false non-discovery rates (FNR). Although various spatial FDR control methods have been developed to improve power, they still fall short of jointly addressing three major challenges in neuroimaging applications: capturing complex spatial dependencies, maintaining low variability in both false discovery proportion (FDP) and false non-discovery proportion (FNP) across replications, and achieving computational scalability for high-resolution data. To address these challenges, we propose fcHMRF-LIS, a powerful, stable, and scalable spatial FDR control method for voxel-wise multiple testing. It integrates the local index of significance (LIS)-based testing procedure with a novel fully connected hidden Markov random field (fcHMRF) designed to model complex spatial structures using a parsimonious parameterization. We develop an efficient expectation-maximization algorithm incorporating mean-field approximation, the Conditional Random Fields as Recurrent Neural Networks (CRF-RNN) technique, and permutohedral lattice filtering, reducing the time complexity from quadratic to linear in the number of tests. Extensive simulations demonstrate that fcHMRF-LIS achieves accurate FDR control, lower FNR, reduced variability in FDP and FNP, and a higher number of true positives compared to existing methods. Applied to an FDG-PET dataset from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative, fcHMRF-LIS identifies neurobiologically relevant brain regions and offers notable advantages in computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>Minimal Sufficient Views: A DNN model making predictions with more evidence has higher accuracy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.01095v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) exhibit high performance in image recognition; however, the reasons for their strong generalization abilities remain unclear. A plausible hypothesis is that DNNs achieve robust and accurate predictions by identifying multiple pieces of evidence from images. Thus, to test this hypothesis, this study proposed minimal sufficient views (MSVs). MSVs is defined as a set of minimal regions within an input image that are sufficient to preserve the prediction of DNNs, thus representing the evidence discovered by the DNN. We empirically demonstrated a strong correlation between the number of MSVs (i.e., the number of pieces of evidence) and the generalization performance of the DNN models. Remarkably, this correlation was found to hold within a single DNN as well as between different DNNs, including convolutional and transformer models. This suggested that a DNN model that makes its prediction based on more evidence has a higher generalization performance. We proposed a metric based on MSVs for DNN model selection that did not require label information. Consequently, we empirically showed that the proposed metric was less dependent on the degree of overfitting, rendering it a more reliable indicator of model performance than existing metrics, such as average confidence.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14292v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a class of algorithms, termed proximal interacting particle Langevin algorithms (PIPLA), for inference and learning in latent variable models whose joint probability density is non-differentiable. Leveraging proximal Markov chain Monte Carlo techniques and interacting particle Langevin algorithms, we propose three algorithms tailored to the problem of estimating parameters in a non-differentiable statistical model. We prove nonasymptotic bounds for the parameter estimates produced by the different algorithms in the strongly log-concave setting and provide comprehensive numerical experiments on various models to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods. In particular, we demonstrate the utility of our family of algorithms for sparse Bayesian logistic regression, training of sparse Bayesian neural networks or neural networks with non-differentiable activation functions, image deblurring, and sparse matrix completion. Our theory and experiments together show that PIPLA family can be the de facto choice for parameter estimation problems in non-differentiable latent variable models.</description>

      <title>Keep Everyone Happy: Online Fair Division of Numerous Items with Few Copies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12845v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper considers a novel variant of the online fair division problem involving multiple agents in which a learner sequentially observes an indivisible item that has to be irrevocably allocated to one of the agents while satisfying a fairness and efficiency constraint. Existing algorithms assume a small number of items with a sufficiently large number of copies, which ensures a good utility estimation for all item-agent pairs from noisy bandit feedback. However, this assumption may not hold in many real-life applications, for example, an online platform that has a large number of users (items) who use the platform's service providers (agents) only a few times (a few copies of items), which makes it difficult to accurately estimate utilities for all item-agent pairs. To address this, we assume utility is an unknown function of item-agent features. We then propose algorithms that model online fair division as a contextual bandit problem, with sub-linear regret guarantees. Our experimental results further validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.</description>

      <title>On the Training Convergence of Transformers for In-Context Classification of Gaussian Mixtures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.11778v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Although transformers have demonstrated impressive capabilities for in-context learning (ICL) in practice, theoretical understanding of the underlying mechanism that allows transformers to perform ICL is still in its infancy. This work aims to theoretically study the training dynamics of transformers for in-context classification tasks. We demonstrate that, for in-context classification of Gaussian mixtures under certain assumptions, a single-layer transformer trained via gradient descent converges to a globally optimal model at a linear rate. We further quantify the impact of the training and testing prompt lengths on the ICL inference error of the trained transformer. We show that when the lengths of training and testing prompts are sufficiently large, the prediction of the trained transformer approaches the ground truth distribution of the labels. Experimental results corroborate the theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>One Model for One Graph: A New Perspective for Pretraining with Cross-domain Graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00315v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a powerful tool to capture intricate network patterns, achieving success across different domains. However, existing GNNs require careful domain-specific architecture designs and training from scratch on each dataset, leading to an expertise-intensive process with difficulty in generalizing across graphs from different domains. Therefore, it can be hard for practitioners to infer which GNN model can generalize well to graphs from their domains. To address this challenge, we propose a novel cross-domain pretraining framework, "one model for one graph," which overcomes the limitations of previous approaches that failed to use a single GNN to capture diverse graph patterns across domains with significant gaps. Specifically, we pretrain a bank of expert models, with each one corresponding to a specific dataset. When inferring to a new graph, gating functions choose a subset of experts to effectively integrate prior model knowledge while avoiding negative transfer. Extensive experiments consistently demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method on both link prediction and node classification tasks.</description>

      <title>Combinatorial Rising Bandit</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00798v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Combinatorial online learning is a fundamental task for selecting the optimal action (or super arm) as a combination of base arms in sequential interactions with systems providing stochastic rewards. It is applicable to diverse domains such as robotics, social advertising, network routing, and recommendation systems. In many real-world scenarios, we often encounter rising rewards, where playing a base arm not only provides an instantaneous reward but also contributes to the enhancement of future rewards, e.g., robots enhancing proficiency through practice and social influence strengthening in the history of successful recommendations. Moreover, the enhancement of a single base arm may affect multiple super arms that include it, introducing complex dependencies that are not captured by existing rising bandit models. To address this, we introduce the Combinatorial Rising Bandit (CRB) framework and propose a provably efficient algorithm, Combinatorial Rising Upper Confidence Bound (CRUCB). We establish an upper bound on regret CRUCB and show that it is nearly tight by deriving a matching lower bound. In addition, we empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of CRUCB not only in synthetic environments but also in realistic applications of deep reinforcement learning.</description>

      <title>Nonconvex Stochastic Optimization under Heavy-Tailed Noises: Optimal Convergence without Gradient Clipping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19529v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, the study of heavy-tailed noises in first-order nonconvex stochastic optimization has gotten a lot of attention since it was recognized as a more realistic condition as suggested by many empirical observations. Specifically, the stochastic noise (the difference between the stochastic and true gradient) is considered to have only a finite $\mathfrak{p}$-th moment where $\mathfrak{p}\in\left(1,2\right]$ instead of assuming it always satisfies the classical finite variance assumption. To deal with this more challenging setting, people have proposed different algorithms and proved them to converge at an optimal $\mathcal{O}(T^{\frac{1-\mathfrak{p}}{3\mathfrak{p}-2}})$ rate for smooth objectives after $T$ iterations. Notably, all these new-designed algorithms are based on the same technique - gradient clipping. Naturally, one may want to know whether the clipping method is a necessary ingredient and the only way to guarantee convergence under heavy-tailed noises. In this work, by revisiting the existing Batched Normalized Stochastic Gradient Descent with Momentum (Batched NSGDM) algorithm, we provide the first convergence result under heavy-tailed noises but without gradient clipping. Concretely, we prove that Batched NSGDM can achieve the optimal $\mathcal{O}(T^{\frac{1-\mathfrak{p}}{3\mathfrak{p}-2}})$ rate even under the relaxed smooth condition. More interestingly, we also establish the first $\mathcal{O}(T^{\frac{1-\mathfrak{p}}{2\mathfrak{p}}})$ convergence rate in the case where the tail index $\mathfrak{p}$ is unknown in advance, which is arguably the common scenario in practice.</description>

      <title>Federated Granger Causality Learning for Interdependent Clients with State Space Representation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.13890v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Advanced sensors and IoT devices have improved the monitoring and control of complex industrial enterprises. They have also created an interdependent fabric of geographically distributed process operations (clients) across these enterprises. Granger causality is an effective approach to detect and quantify interdependencies by examining how one client's state affects others over time. Understanding these interdependencies captures how localized events, such as faults and disruptions, can propagate throughout the system, possibly causing widespread operational impacts. However, the large volume and complexity of industrial data pose challenges in modeling these interdependencies. This paper develops a federated approach to learning Granger causality. We utilize a linear state space system framework that leverages low-dimensional state estimates to analyze interdependencies. This addresses bandwidth limitations and the computational burden commonly associated with centralized data processing. We propose augmenting the client models with the Granger causality information learned by the server through a Machine Learning (ML) function. We examine the co-dependence between the augmented client and server models and reformulate the framework as a standalone ML algorithm providing conditions for its sublinear and linear convergence rates. We also study the convergence of the framework to a centralized oracle model. Moreover, we include a differential privacy analysis to ensure data security while preserving causal insights. Using synthetic data, we conduct comprehensive experiments to demonstrate the robustness of our approach to perturbations in causality, the scalability to the size of communication, number of clients, and the dimensions of raw data. We also evaluate the performance on two real-world industrial control system datasets by reporting the volume of data saved by decentralization.</description>

      <title>Privacy Amplification by Structured Subsampling for Deep Differentially Private Time Series Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02410v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many forms of sensitive data, such as web traffic, mobility data, or hospital occupancy, are inherently sequential. The standard method for training machine learning models while ensuring privacy for units of sensitive information, such as individual hospital visits, is differentially private stochastic gradient descent (DP-SGD). However, we observe in this work that the formal guarantees of DP-SGD are incompatible with time-series-specific tasks like forecasting, since they rely on the privacy amplification attained by training on small, unstructured batches sampled from an unstructured dataset. In contrast, batches for forecasting are generated by (1) sampling sequentially structured time series from a dataset, (2) sampling contiguous subsequences from these series, and (3) partitioning them into context and ground-truth forecast windows. We theoretically analyze the privacy amplification attained by this structured subsampling to enable the training of forecasting models with sound and tight event- and user-level privacy guarantees. Towards more private models, we additionally prove how data augmentation amplifies privacy in self-supervised training of sequence models. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates that amplification by structured subsampling enables the training of forecasting models with strong formal privacy guarantees.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.02516v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the policy evaluation problem in an online multi-reward multi-policy discounted setting, where multiple reward functions must be evaluated simultaneously for different policies. We adopt an $(\epsilon,\delta)$-PAC perspective to achieve $\epsilon$-accurate estimates with high confidence across finite or convex sets of rewards, a setting that has not been investigated in the literature. Building on prior work on Multi-Reward Best Policy Identification, we adapt the MR-NaS exploration scheme to jointly minimize sample complexity for evaluating different policies across different reward sets. Our approach leverages an instance-specific lower bound revealing how the sample complexity scales with a measure of value deviation, guiding the design of an efficient exploration policy. Although computing this bound entails a hard non-convex optimization, we propose an efficient convex approximation that holds for both finite and convex reward sets. Experiments in tabular domains demonstrate the effectiveness of this adaptive exploration scheme.</description>

      <title>Toward universal steering and monitoring of AI models</title>

Abstract: Modern AI models contain much of human knowledge, yet understanding of their internal representation of this knowledge remains elusive. Characterizing the structure and properties of this representation will lead to improvements in model capabilities and development of effective safeguards. Building on recent advances in feature learning, we develop an effective, scalable approach for extracting linear representations of general concepts in large-scale AI models (language models, vision-language models, and reasoning models). We show how these representations enable model steering, through which we expose vulnerabilities, mitigate misaligned behaviors, and improve model capabilities. Additionally, we demonstrate that concept representations are remarkably transferable across human languages and combinable to enable multi-concept steering. Through quantitative analysis across hundreds of concepts, we find that newer, larger models are more steerable and steering can improve model capabilities beyond standard prompting. We show how concept representations are effective for monitoring misaligned content (hallucinations, toxic content). We demonstrate that predictive models built using concept representations are more accurate for monitoring misaligned content than using models that judge outputs directly. Together, our results illustrate the power of using internal representations to map the knowledge in AI models, advance AI safety, and improve model capabilities.</description>

      <title>Universal Sequence Preconditioning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06545v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of preconditioning in the setting of sequential prediction. From the theoretical lens of linear dynamical systems, we show that applying a convolution to the input sequence translates to applying a polynomial to the unknown transition matrix in the hidden space. With this insight, we develop a novel preconditioning method that convolves the input sequence with the coefficients of the Chebyshev or Legendre polynomials. We formally prove that this improves the regret of two distinct prediction methods. Moreover, using this preconditioning technique on either method gives the first sublinear regret bounds that are also hidden dimension independent (up to logarithmic factors) even when the hidden transition matrix is asymmetric. From rigorous experiments on synthetic data we show that our simple preconditioning method generalizes to both 1) settings where the data is not from a linear dynamical system and 2) a broad range of learning algorithms, including recurrent neural networks.</description>

      <title>Fundamental Bias in Inverting Random Sampling Matrices with Application to Sub-sampled Newton</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13583v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A substantial body of work in machine learning (ML) and randomized numerical linear algebra (RandNLA) has exploited various sorts of random sketching methodologies, including random sampling and random projection, with much of the analysis using Johnson--Lindenstrauss and subspace embedding techniques. Recent studies have identified the issue of inversion bias -- the phenomenon that inverses of random sketches are not unbiased, despite the unbiasedness of the sketches themselves. This bias presents challenges for the use of random sketches in various ML pipelines, such as fast stochastic optimization, scalable statistical estimators, and distributed optimization. In the context of random projection, the inversion bias can be easily corrected for dense Gaussian projections (which are, however, too expensive for many applications). Recent work has shown how the inversion bias can be corrected for sparse sub-gaussian projections. In this paper, we show how the inversion bias can be corrected for random sampling methods, both uniform and non-uniform leverage-based, as well as for structured random projections, including those based on the Hadamard transform. Using these results, we establish problem-independent local convergence rates for sub-sampled Newton methods.</description>

      <title>Optimal Recovery Meets Minimax Estimation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17671v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A fundamental problem in statistics and machine learning is to estimate a function $f$ from possibly noisy observations of its point samples. The goal is to design a numerical algorithm to construct an approximation $\hat f$ to $f$ in a prescribed norm that asymptotically achieves the best possible error (as a function of the number $m$ of observations and the variance $\sigma^2$ of the noise). This problem has received considerable attention in both nonparametric statistics (noisy observations) and optimal recovery (noiseless observations). Quantitative bounds require assumptions on $f$, known as model class assumptions. Classical results assume that $f$ is in the unit ball of a Besov space. In nonparametric statistics, the best possible performance of an algorithm for finding $\hat f$ is known as the minimax rate and has been studied in this setting under the assumption that the noise is Gaussian. In optimal recovery, the best possible performance of an algorithm is known as the optimal recovery rate and has also been determined in this setting. While one would expect that the minimax rate recovers the optimal recovery rate when the noise level $\sigma$ tends to zero, it turns out that the current results on minimax rates do not carefully determine the dependence on $\sigma$ and the limit cannot be taken. This paper handles this issue and determines the noise-level-aware (NLA) minimax rates for Besov classes when error is measured in an $L_q$-norm with matching upper and lower bounds. The end result is a reconciliation between minimax rates and optimal recovery rates. The NLA minimax rate continuously depends on the noise level and recovers the optimal recovery rate when $\sigma$ tends to zero.</description>

      <title>Entropy-regularized Gradient Estimators for Approximate Bayesian Inference</title>

Abstract: Effective uncertainty quantification is important for training modern predictive models with limited data, enhancing both accuracy and robustness. While Bayesian methods are effective for this purpose, they can be challenging to scale. When employing approximate Bayesian inference, ensuring the quality of samples from the posterior distribution in a computationally efficient manner is essential. This paper addresses the estimation of the Bayesian posterior to generate diverse samples by approximating the gradient flow of the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence and the cross entropy of the target approximation under the metric induced by the Stein Operator. It presents empirical evaluations on classification tasks to assess the method's performance and discuss its effectiveness for Model-Based Reinforcement Learning that uses uncertainty-aware network dynamics models.</description>

      <title>Optimal Bounds for Adversarial Constrained Online Convex Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13366v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Constrained Online Convex Optimization (COCO) can be seen as a generalization of the standard Online Convex Optimization (OCO) framework. At each round, a cost function and constraint function are revealed after a learner chooses an action. The goal is to minimize both the regret and cumulative constraint violation (CCV) against an adaptive adversary. We show for the first time that is possible to obtain the optimal $O(\sqrt{T})$ bound on both regret and CCV, improving the best known bounds of $O \left( \sqrt{T} \right)$ and $\tilde{O} \left( \sqrt{T} \right)$ for the regret and CCV, respectively. Based on a new surrogate loss function enforcing a minimum penalty on the constraint function, we demonstrate that both the Follow-the-Regularized-Leader and the Online Gradient Descent achieve the optimal bounds.</description>

      <title>Are Domain Generalization Benchmarks with Accuracy on the Line Misspecified?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00186v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spurious correlations are unstable statistical associations that hinder robust decision-making. Conventional wisdom suggests that models relying on such correlations will fail to generalize out-of-distribution (OOD), especially under strong distribution shifts. However, empirical evidence challenges this view as naive in-distribution empirical risk minimizers often achieve the best OOD accuracy across popular OOD generalization benchmarks. In light of these results, we propose a different perspective: many widely used benchmarks for evaluating robustness to spurious correlations are misspecified. Specifically, they fail to include shifts in spurious correlations that meaningfully impact OOD generalization, making them unsuitable for evaluating the benefit of removing such correlations. We establish conditions under which a distribution shift can reliably assess a model's reliance on spurious correlations. Crucially, under these conditions, we should not observe a strong positive correlation between in-distribution and OOD accuracy, often called "accuracy on the line." Yet, most state-of-the-art benchmarks exhibit this pattern, suggesting they do not effectively assess robustness. Our findings expose a key limitation in current benchmarks used to evaluate domain generalization algorithms, that is, models designed to avoid spurious correlations. We highlight the need to rethink how robustness to spurious correlations is assessed, identify well-specified benchmarks the field should prioritize, and enumerate strategies for designing future benchmarks that meaningfully reflect robustness under distribution shift.</description>

      <title>How Transformers Learn Regular Language Recognition: A Theoretical Study on Training Dynamics and Implicit Bias</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00926v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Language recognition tasks are fundamental in natural language processing (NLP) and have been widely used to benchmark the performance of large language models (LLMs). These tasks also play a crucial role in explaining the working mechanisms of transformers. In this work, we focus on two representative tasks in the category of regular language recognition, known as `even pairs' and `parity check', the aim of which is to determine whether the occurrences of certain subsequences in a given sequence are even. Our goal is to explore how a one-layer transformer, consisting of an attention layer followed by a linear layer, learns to solve these tasks by theoretically analyzing its training dynamics under gradient descent. While even pairs can be solved directly by a one-layer transformer, parity check need to be solved by integrating Chain-of-Thought (CoT), either into the inference stage of a transformer well-trained for the even pairs task, or into the training of a one-layer transformer. For both problems, our analysis shows that the joint training of attention and linear layers exhibits two distinct phases. In the first phase, the attention layer grows rapidly, mapping data sequences into separable vectors. In the second phase, the attention layer becomes stable, while the linear layer grows logarithmically and approaches in direction to a max-margin hyperplane that correctly separates the attention layer outputs into positive and negative samples, and the loss decreases at a rate of $O(1/t)$. Our experiments validate those theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Dequantified Diffusion-Schr{\"o}dinger Bridge for Density Ratio Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05034v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Density ratio estimation is fundamental to tasks involving f-divergences, yet existing methods often fail under significantly different distributions or inadequately overlapping supports -- the density-chasm and the support-chasm problems. Additionally, prior approaches yield divergent time scores near boundaries, leading to instability. We design $\textbf{D}^3\textbf{RE}$, a unified framework for robust, stable and efficient density ratio estimation. We propose the dequantified diffusion bridge interpolant (DDBI), which expands support coverage and stabilizes time scores via diffusion bridges and Gaussian dequantization. Building on DDBI, the proposed dequantified Schr{\"o}dinger bridge interpolant (DSBI) incorporates optimal transport to solve the Schr{\"o}dinger bridge problem, enhancing accuracy and efficiency. Our method offers uniform approximation and bounded time scores in theory, and outperforms baselines empirically in mutual information and density estimation tasks.</description>
