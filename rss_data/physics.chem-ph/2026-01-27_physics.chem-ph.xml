      <title>Unraveling Surface Chemistry of irreversible reduction of iron oxides through the Time-Resolved APXPS and Chemometrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17052v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents a study on the application of Time-Resolved Ambient Pressure X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (TR-APXPS) in association with chemometric techniques, specifically Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Multivariate Curve Resolution with Alternating Least Squares (MCR-ALS), to investigate the surface chemistry and dynamics of Fe2O3 reduction processes. The use of TR-APXPS allows for real-time monitoring of chemical changes at the surface of Iron oxides during reduction, providing valuable insights into the reaction mechanisms and kinetics involved. One key challenge in analyzing TR-APXPS data is the presence of overlapping peaks and complex spectral features, which can make accurate quantification and interpretation difficult. Traditional spectral fitting methods may struggle with these complexities and result in ambiguous or inaccurate results. However, the chemometric approaches are promising tools to overcome these challenges by extracting pure spectral profiles of individual chemical species and their temporal profiles from the complex and overlapping data. The results obtained from the TR-APXPS coupled with PCA and MCR-ALS analysis provide a detailed and precise understanding of the surface chemical changes during the Fe2O3 reduction. This includes identifying and following the formation of various intermediate species and their evolution over time, which permits later to establish correlations between surface chemistry and process conditions. The integration of both chemometric tools in TR-APXPS data analysis not only addresses the challenges associated with complex spectral features, but also contributes to a deeper understanding of the underlying chemical changes and their dynamics. The obtained results have significant implications for process optimization, material synthesis, and tailoring of material properties for specific applications.</description>

      <title>The Illusion of Simplicity: The Dramatic Failure of Koopmans Theorem for Antioxidants in Solvents -- The Ascorbic Acid Paradigm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17066v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Antioxidants operate in biological environments where solvent effects dramatically alter their redox properties. Using ascorbic acid (vitamin C) as a paradigmatic example, we present a comprehensive quantum-chemical investigation of its global chemical reactivity indices -- ionization potential, electron affinity, HOMO-LUMO gap, hardness, softness, electronegativity, electrophilicity, and electrodonating/accepting powers -- computed at the compound chemistry CBS-QB3 and various DFT levels in vacuo and across six solvents. The results demonstrate that solvation stabilizes charged species so strongly that reactivity indices shift by several electronvolts, following a roughly Born-like dependence on dielectric constant. Most importantly, we show unequivocally that Koopmans' theorem, often used to estimate these indices from orbital energies, fails catastrophically in solution: it predicts solvent-independent values that are qualitatively and quantitatively wrong, missing the essential physics of dielectric screening and geometric relaxation. We therefore conclude that Koopmans' theorem must be abandoned for antioxidant studies in condensed phases; adiabatic calculations with solvent are mandatory for meaningful predictions.</description>

      <title>ChemNavigator: Agentic AI Discovery of Design Rules for Organic Photocatalysts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17084v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discovery of high-performance organic photocatalysts for hydrogen evolution remains limited by the vastness of chemical space and the reliance on human intuition for molecular design. Here we present ChemNavigator, an agentic AI system that autonomously derives structure-property relationships through hypothesis-driven exploration of organic photocatalyst candidates. The system integrates large language model reasoning with density functional tight binding calculations in a multi-agent architecture that mirrors the scientific method: formulating hypotheses, designing experiments, executing calculations, and validating findings through rigorous statistical analysis. Through iterative discovery cycles encompassing 200 molecules, ChemNavigator autonomously identified six statistically significant design rules governing frontier orbital energies, including the effects of ether linkages, carbonyl groups, extended conjugation, cyano groups, halogen substituents, and amine groups. Importantly, these rules correspond to established principles of organic electronic structure (resonance donation, inductive withdrawal, $\pi$-delocalization), demonstrating that the system can independently derive chemical knowledge without explicit programming. Notably, autonomous agentic reasoning extracted these six validated rules from a molecular library where previous ML approaches identified only carbonyl effects. Furthermore, the quantified effect sizes provide a prioritized ranking for synthetic chemists, while feature interaction analysis revealed diminishing returns when combining strategies, challenging additive assumptions in molecular design. This work demonstrates that agentic AI systems can autonomously derive interpretable, chemically grounded design principles, establishing a framework for AI-assisted materials discovery that complements rather than replaces chemical intuition.</description>

      <title>General-order degenerate coupled-cluster theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A size-extensive, converging, black-box coupled-cluster ($\Delta$CC) ansatz is introduced that computes the energies and wave functions of stationary states from any degenerate or nondegenerate Slater-determinant references with any numbers of $\alpha$- and $\beta$-spin electrons, any patterns of orbital occupancy, any spin multiplicities, and any spatial symmetries. For a nondegenerate reference, it is identical to the single-reference, projection coupled-cluster ansatz. For degenerate references, it is a natural coupled-cluster extension of degenerate RS perturbation ($\Delta$MP) theory, and is closely related to, but distinct from Li and Paldus's state-universal multireference coupled-cluster (SUMRCC) theory. For ionized and electron-attached references, it can be viewed as a coupled-cluster Green's function, although the present theory is convergent toward the full-configuration-interaction (FCI) limits, while many-body Green's function (MBGF) theory generally is not. Its single-excitation instance is a projection (nonvariational) Hartree-Fock theory for a degenerate or nondegenerate reference as per the Thouless theorem, whose practical utility seems rather limited except for core ionizations, high-spin states, and possibly electron affinities. A determinant-based, general-order algorithm is implemented, generating $\Delta$CC energies through connected octuple excitations, which are compared with the results from CI, equation-of-motion coupled-cluster (EOM-CC), and SUMRCC theories up to the FCI limits as well as from $\Delta$MP and MBGF theories up to the 19th order. An algebraic, optimal-scaling, order-by-order algorithm is also computer-synthesized at the levels of single excitations only and of single and double excitations. The order of performance is: $\Delta$CC $&gt;$ EOM-CC $&gt;$ CI at the same order or $\Delta$CC $&gt;$ $\Delta$MP $&gt;$ MBGF at the same cost scaling.</description>

      <title>Quantum field theory approach for multistage chemical kinetics in liquids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17328v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reaction-diffusion processes play an important role in a variety of physical, chemical, and biological systems. Conventionally, the kinetics of these processes are described by the law of mass action. However, there are various cases where these equations are insufficient. A fundamental challenge lies in accurately accounting for the microscopic correlations that inevitably arise in bimolecular reactions. While approaches to describe microscopic correlations in many specific cases exist, no general theory for multistage reactions has been established. In this article, we apply the quantum field theory approach to derive kinetic equations for general multistage reactive systems termed CMET (complete modified encounter theory). CMET can be formulated as a set of coupled partial differential equations that can be easily integrated numerically, thereby serving as a versatile tool for investigating reaction-diffusion processes. Across multiple case studies, we demonstrated that CMET reproduces the kinetics predicted by many other theories within their respective scopes of applicability.</description>

      <title>cuGUGA: Operator-Direct Graphical Unitary Group Approach Accelerated with CUDA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17729v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present cuGUGA, an operator-direct graphical unitary group approach (GUGA) configuration interaction (CI) solver in a spin-adapted configuration state function (CSF) basis. Dynamic-programming walk counts provide constant-time CSF ranking/unranking, and pretabulated segment factors enable constant-time evaluation of coupling coefficients. Two-electron contributions are organized through an intermediate-weight formulation that separates sparse generator enumeration from integral contraction and supports both dense and density-fitted/Cholesky backends. We further map the same primitives to GPUs by implementing the irregular DRT traversal and accumulation in custom CUDA kernels while delegating contractions to CUDA libraries. The implementation reproduces reference energies at the 10^{-11} Eh level and matches CPU/GPU sigma-vectors to 10^{-14}. On an RTX 4090, the GPU backend provides up to ~10x speedup over the CPU backend for smaller active spaces and multifold speedups on representative CASCI kernels. Speedup decreases as the active space grows because the workload becomes increasingly dominated by FP64 GEMM, which is not strongly accelerated on consumer GPUs. In addition, the cuGUGA CPU backend generally delivers &gt;2x speedup over PySCF's determinant backend and &gt;4x speedup over PySCF CSF backend.</description>

      <title>Refinement and Performance Benchmark for Range-Separated Water Force Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In our previous work, we developed a CCSD(T)-level range-separated water force field that combines the power of physics-driven and machine learning models. However, it was found that expensive CCSD(T)/CBS calculations lead to limited number of QM data as well as the missing of force labels, both of which lead to training instability issues. Bulk properties show large variations that cannot be resolved by simply reducing the fitting error in small cluster QM dataset. Such instability in bulk phase simulation is a universal problem in the training of machine learning potentials (MLPs), and is particularly severe at CCSD(T) level of theory.In this work, using our range-separated water model as an example, we aim to overcome these limitations by developing a new training workflow. It is composed by several techniques including: 1. an active learning protocol that ensures more thorough sampling in different temperatures and densities; 2. an intermediate force label technique employing machine learning density functional; and 3. an ensemble knowledge distillation (EKD) method. These techniques significantly stabilize the resulting water model, consistently achieving sub-chemical accuracies in both cluster energies and experimental properties. Benchmarks are carried out for various properties including densities, radial distribution functions (RDFs), dielectric constants, diffusivity, and infrared spectra, all showing state-of-the-art (SOTA) performances and proving the effectiveness of the training protocol.</description>

      <title>Nucleophilic substitution at silicon under vibrational strong coupling: Refined insights from a high-level ab initio perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18540v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the bimolecular nucleophilic substitution (S$_\mathrm{N}$2) reaction of 1-phenyl-2-trimethylsilylacetylene (PTA) under vibrational strong coupling (VSC) from the perspective of high-level ab initio quantum and polaritonic chemistry. Specifically, we address conflicting mechanistic proposals, cavity-induced electronic corrections under VSC and the relevance of a previously debated Si-C-stretching motion of PTA for vibrational polariton formation. We first provide computational evidence for a two-step mechanism based on density functional theory and high-level coupled cluster results, identify new encounter and products complexes and illustrate the relevance of diffuse basis functions for a qualitatively correct description of anionic reactive systems. We subsequently show that cavity-induced dipole fluctuation corrections of electronic energies can be significant on the level of cavity Born-Oppenheimer coupled cluster theory and discuss their qualitative impact on the proposed two-step mechanism taking into account cavity-induced molecular reorientation. We finally show that the Si-C-stretching contribution to the experimentally relevant double-peak feature of PTA exhibits a dominant dipole character, which renders it central for linear IR response and vibrational polariton formation despite the presence of CH$_3$-rocking contributions. The dipole character along the cleaving Si-C-bond is eventually shown to rationalize Rabi splittings throughout the proposed two-step mechanism. Our work refines the microscopic perspective on the S$_\mathrm{N}$2 reaction of PTA under VSC and highlights recent developments in ab initio polaritonic chemistry for the VSC regime.</description>

      <title>Practical Considerations for Finite Concentrations Molecular Dynamics Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17244v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding concentrated electrolytes requires a theory that spans local hydration and mesoscale interfacial assembly. We present an integrated workflow-SCOPE-that combines (i) enhanced sampling focused on a single Li+ ion, (ii) reweighting of biased trajectories to recover equilibrium microstate probabilities, and (iii) a chemical-potential correction that accounts for the limited reservoir of free water in finite simulation boxes. Applied to LiCl(aq) across 0.5-26 M and 283-313 K, this approach reveals a simple organizing principle: solvated ions dominate at low concentration; contact ion pairs emerge at intermediate strength; and aggregated Li-xCl clusters become most stable at the solubility limit. The resulting free-energy trends predict temperature-dependent solubility in close agreement with experiment and clarify the role of interfacial nucleation in precipitation. Beyond the simple LiCl(aq) salt considered here, SCOPE offers a transferable strategy for characterizing speciation and phase behavior in concentrated liquid systems where collective coordinates and rare events dominate.</description>

      <title>Assessment of the synthetic feasibility of hypothetical zeolite-like materials based on ZeoNet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17253v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A suite of classifiers was developed to distinguish real, experimentally realized zeolites from computationally predicted zeolite like structures. Using 3D convolutional neural networks applied to volumetric distance grids, these classifiers achieve accuracies more than an order of magnitude higher than previous approaches based on geometric filters or other machine learning methods. The best-performing model differentiates among hypothetical zeolites and those that can be synthesized as silicates, as aluminophosphates, or as both. This four-class classifier attains a false negative rate of 3.4% and a false positive rate of 0.4%, misidentifying only 1,207 of over 330,000 hypothetical structures -- even though the hypothetical structures exhibit similar formation energies as real zeolites and chemically reasonable bond lengths and angles. We hypothesize that the ZeoNet representation captures essential structural features correlated with synthetic feasibility. In the absence of comprehensive physics-based criteria for synthesizability, the small subset of misclassified hypothetical structures likely represents promising candidates for future experimental synthesis.</description>

      <title>Non-monotonic roughness evolution in film growth on weakly interacting substrates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17487v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Thin film deposition on weakly interacting substrates exhibits a unique growth mode characterized by initially strong island formation and rapidly increasing roughness, which reaches a maximum and subsequently decreases as the film returns to a smooth morphology. Here we show this rough-to-smooth growth mode experimentally for two molecular systems with substantially different geometries, namely, the effectively spherical buckminsterfullerene (C$_{60}$) and the disk-like 1,4,5,8,9,11-hexaazatriphenylenehexacarbonitrile (HATCN). This growth mode is explained by a geometrical model that captures the basic mechanisms of multilayer island growth, island coalescence, and formation of a continuous film. Additionally, kinetic Monte Carlo simulations with minimal ingredients demonstrate that this mode generally occurs for weakly interacting substrates, providing quantitative estimates of parameters that characterize adsorbate-adsorbate and adsorbate-substrate interactions. Both the model and simulations accurately describe the experimental data and highlight the generic nature of the phenomenon, independently of the details of the interactions and the molecular flux, which opens up a path for controlling nanoscale film roughness.</description>

      <title>A Local Structural Basis to Resolve Amorphous Ices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17488v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Phases with distinct thermodynamic properties must differ in their underlying distributions of microscopic structures. While ordered phases are readily distinguished by unit cells and space groups, the local structural basis differentiating amorphous phases is less apparent. Here, using a new probabilistic data-driven framework applied to molecular simulation data on water, we identify local collective variables that discriminate low-density and high-density amorphous (LDA and HDA) ices and characterize pressure-induced transitions between these phases. As expected, descriptors related to local density capably distinguish LDA and HDA; however, phase identity is surprisingly encoded within the first coordination shell. Furthermore, LDA transitions to HDA by a simple redistribution of LDA- and HDA-like environments with no evident intermediate structures, in accordance with a first-order-like transition that contrasts with the gradual evolution observed in other amorphous systems such as metallic glasses. These findings are robust across force fields, which themselves exhibit structural differences, and exemplify how other systems lacking obvious distinguishing features can be characterized.</description>

      <title>Feedback-Based Quantum Control for Safe and Synergistic Drug Combination Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18082v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Drug-drug interactions (DDIs) strongly affect the safety and efficacy of combination therapies. Despite the availability of large DDI databases, selecting optimal multi-drug combinations that balance safety, therapeutic benefit, and regimen size remains a challenging combinatorial optimization problem. Here, we present a quantum-control-based framework for DDI-aware drug combination optimization, in which known harmful and synergistic interactions are encoded into Ising Hamiltonians as penalties and rewards, respectively. The optimization is performed using the feedback-based quantum algorithm FALQON, a gradient-free variational approach. We study two clinically motivated tasks: the Maximum Safe Subset problem and the Synergy-Constrained Optimization problem. Numerical simulations using interaction data from Drugs.com and SYNERGxDB demonstrate efficient convergence and high-quality solutions for clinically relevant drug sets, including COVID-19 case studies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.18318v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Water shows numerous thermodynamic, dynamic, and structural anomalies. Recent experiments [Eichler et al. Phys. Rev. Lett. 134, 134101 (2025)], based on measurements of shear and bulk viscosities of liquid water up to 1.6 GPa, have reported the existence of a minimum in the variation of the structural relaxation time {\tau}{\alpha} with pressure at room temperature. Here we investigate this and related properties with molecular dynamics simulations of the TIP4P/2005 water model, performed at extreme pressures commensurate with the experiments. Specifically, we compute dynamic (self-diffusion, shear and bulk viscosities, and structural relaxation time) and structural (oxygen-oxygen radial distribution function and structure factor, translational order parameter) properties down to 220 K and up to 2.7 GPa. We find good agreement with the experimental observations, and confirm the existence of a minimum in {\tau}{\alpha} . The microscopic information obtained from the simulations suggests that this anomaly is connected with the sudden reorganization of the hydrogen bond network induced by pressurization.</description>

      <title>A Low Cost Relativistic Algebraic Diagrammatic Construction Method Based on Cholesky Decomposition and Frozen Natural Spinors for Electronic Ionization, Attachment and Excitation Energy Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21640v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an efficient relativistic implementation of algebraic diagrammatic construction (ADC) theory up to third order for the treatment of electronic ionization potentials (IP), electron affinities (EA), and excitation energies (EE) in heavy-element systems using an exact two-component atomic mean-field (X2CAMF) Hamiltonian. The approach combines Cholesky decomposition (CD) of two-electron integrals with frozen natural spinors (FNS) to significantly reduce the computational cost without compromising accuracy. To improve the description of excited states, we have implemented a state-specific frozen natural spinor (SS-FNS) framework and applied it to both electron affinity and excitation energy calculations. In addition to the standard relativistic ADC(3) method, we investigate a semi-empirically scaled variant in which the third-order contribution to the ADC secular matrix is multiplied by a scaling factor (x), denoted as FNS/SS-FNS-[ADC(2)+(x)(3)]. This [ADC(2)+(x)(3)] approach shows systematic improvements over conventional ADC(3) in a variety of cases. Substantial computational savings are achieved through the use of FNS and SS-FNS schemes when compared to canonical calculations, resulting in significant speedups for ionization, attachment, and excitation energy computations. The current implementation accurately reproduces the canonical four-component ADC(3) results while significantly reducing computational cost. The efficiency and robustness of the method are demonstrated through applications to medium and large-sized molecular systems, including systems with 70 atoms and over 2600 basis functions.</description>

      <title>Clarifying NH2 + O(3P) Reaction Dynamics: A Full-Dimensional MRCI, Machine-Learned PES Unravels High-Temperature Kinetics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01040v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The NH2 + O reaction represents a critical oxidation pathway in ammonia and hydrazine combustion, yet significant discrepancies persist in reported kinetics. Here, we generate a full-dimensional ground-state potential energy surface (PES) for NH2O using high-level internally contracted multi-reference configuration interaction (ic-MRCI) calculations and the permutation invariant polynomial-neural network (PIP-NN) method. The PES encompasses all energetically accessible channels, including HNO + H, NH + OH, NO + H2, and HON + H. Quasi-classical trajectory calculations on this surface yield thermal rate coefficients and branching ratios over a wide temperature range, particularly extending into the high-temperature regime relevant to combustion. The results provide accurate first principles kinetic data essential for refining combustion models of nitrogen containing fuels.</description>

      <title>Analysis of the Rankine attraction term in an equation of state based on the London dispersion force</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14345v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The attraction term in an equation of state for gases, $-a c^2$, proposed by Rankine in 1854, is generally related to the London dispersion force via the equation for the second virial coefficient, $B_2$, given by $B_2 = 2\pi N_0 \int_0^\infty \left(1- \exp \left(-\omega / kT\right)\right) r^2 \text{d}r$, where $\omega$ is the attraction energy between two molecules in the gas. This equation works very well to describe $B_2$ and thus $a=B_2 RT$ as function of temperature, but the derivation is complicated. Here we present two other methods to derive $B_2$ and thus $a$ from the London equation, which have a more intuitive background. (The more simple of the two we expect must be available in literature.) We analyze these three models for the gas argon at temperatures between 150 and 900 K. All three methods fit the data quite closely while an analytical approximation fits data even better. The temperature dependence of $a$ is well described by a proportionality of $a$ with a term $1+T^*/T$ where $T^*$ is a constant that depends on the type of gas.</description>

      <title>Quantum-Enhanced Neural Exchange-Correlation Functionals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14258v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Kohn-Sham Density Functional Theory (KS-DFT) provides the exact ground state energy and electron density of a molecule, contingent on the as-yet-unknown universal exchange-correlation (XC) functional. Recent research has demonstrated that neural networks can efficiently learn to represent approximations to that functional, offering accurate generalizations to molecules not present during the training process. With the latest advancements in quantum-enhanced machine learning (ML), evidence is growing that Quantum Neural Network (QNN) models may offer advantages in ML applications. In this work, we explore the use of QNNs for representing XC functionals, enhancing and comparing them to classical ML techniques. We present QNNs based on differentiable quantum circuits (DQCs) as quantum (hybrid) models for XC in KS-DFT, implemented across various architectures. We assess their performance on 1D and 3D systems. To that end, we expand existing differentiable KS-DFT frameworks and propose strategies for efficient training of such functionals, highlighting the importance of fractional orbital occupation for accurate results. Our best QNN-based XC functional yields energy profiles of the H$_2$ and planar H$_4$ molecules that deviate by no more than 1 mHa from the reference DMRG and FCI/6-31G results, respectively. Moreover, they reach chemical precision on a system, H$_2$H$_2$, not present in the training dataset, using only a few variational parameters. This work lays the foundation for the integration of quantum models in KS-DFT, thereby opening new avenues for expressing XC functionals in a differentiable way and facilitating computations of various properties.</description>

      <title>Universal Negative Energetic Elasticity in Polymer Chains: Crossovers among Random, Self-Avoiding, and Neighbor-Avoiding Walks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14992v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Negative energetic elasticity in gels challenges the conventional understanding of gel elasticity; despite extensive research, a concise explanation remains elusive. In this study, we use the weakly self-avoiding walk (the Domb-Joyce model; DJ model) and interacting self-avoiding walk (ISAW) to investigate the emergence of negative energetic elasticity in polymer chains. Using exact enumeration, we show that both the DJ model and ISAW exhibit negative energetic elasticity, which is caused by effective soft-repulsive interactions between polymer segments. Moreover, we find that a universal scaling law for the internal energy of both models, with a common exponent of $7/4$, holds consistently across both random-walk-self-avoiding-walk and self-avoiding-walk-neighbor-avoiding-walk crossovers. These findings suggest that negative energetic elasticity is a fundamental and universal property of polymer networks and chains.</description>

      <title>ELECTRA: A Cartesian Network for 3D Charge Density Prediction with Floating Orbitals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08305v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the Electronic Tensor Reconstruction Algorithm (ELECTRA) - an equivariant model for predicting electronic charge densities using floating orbitals. Floating orbitals are a long-standing concept in the quantum chemistry community that promises more compact and accurate representations by placing orbitals freely in space, as opposed to centering all orbitals at the position of atoms. Finding the ideal placement of these orbitals requires extensive domain knowledge, though, which thus far has prevented widespread adoption. We solve this in a data-driven manner by training a Cartesian tensor network to predict the orbital positions along with orbital coefficients. This is made possible through a symmetry-breaking mechanism that is used to learn position displacements with lower symmetry than the input molecule while preserving the rotation equivariance of the charge density itself. Inspired by recent successes of Gaussian Splatting in representing densities in space, we are using Gaussian orbitals and predicting their weights and covariance matrices. Our method achieves a state-of-the-art balance between computational efficiency and predictive accuracy on established benchmarks. Furthermore, ELECTRA is able to lower the compute time required to arrive at converged DFT solutions - initializing calculations using our predicted densities yields an average 50.72 % reduction in self-consistent field (SCF) iterations on unseen molecules.</description>
