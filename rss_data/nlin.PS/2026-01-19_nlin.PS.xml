      <title>Non-equilibrium geometric forces steer spiral waves on folded surfaces</title>

Abstract: Spiral waves are ubiquitous signatures of non equilibrium dynamics, appearing across chemical, biological, and active systems. Yet, in many living systems these waves unfold on curved and folded surfaces whose geometry has rarely been treated as a dynamical factor. Here we show that surface curvature fundamentally shapes spiral wave behavior and can contribute to the organization of neural activity in the brain. Via analytical theory and simulations of the complex Ginzburg Landau equation (CGLE) on curved surfaces, we demonstrate that curvature enters through the Laplace Beltrami operator as a spatial modulation of effective diffusion. Gradients of this effective diffusion generate a geometric force on spiral defects, and the complex nature of the CGLE produces a complex mobility that leads to non central and non reciprocal responses. Applied to realistic cortical surfaces of the human brain, the model predicts that the pattern of cortical folding stabilizes and localizes spiral waves, while progressive smoothing of the surface erases these non equilibrium structures. This reveals that brain geometry is not a passive scaffold but an active physical constraint that shapes neural dynamics. More broadly, the same geometric mechanism provides a universal route by which curvature and topology control pattern formation across oscillatory, chemical, and active matter systems.</description>

      <title>Generalized Thermodynamics of Solitonic Event Horizons in Dispersive Field Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05156v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The realization of Hawking radiation in optical analogs has historically focused on kinematic observables, such as the effective temperature determined by the horizon's surface gravity. A complete thermodynamic description, however, necessitates a rigorous definition of entropy and irreversibility, which has remained elusive in Hamiltonian optical systems. In this work, we bridge this gap by introducing an operational entropy for solitonic event horizons, derived from the spectral partitioning of the optical field into coherent solitonic and incoherent radiative subsystems. We demonstrate that the emission of resonant radiation -- mediated by the breaking of soliton integrability due to higher-order dispersion -- serves as a fundamental mechanism for entropy production. Numerical simulations of the generalized nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation confirm that this process satisfies a generalized second law, $\Delta S_{\mathrm{tot}} \ge 0$. These results establish event horizons in dispersive field theories as consistent nonequilibrium thermodynamic systems, offering a new pathway to explore the information-theoretic aspects of analog gravity in laboratory settings.</description>
