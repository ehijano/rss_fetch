      <title>Counting the number of stationary solutions of Partial Differential Equations via infinite dimensional sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07390v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with the problem of counting solutions of stationary nonlinear Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) when the PDE is known to admit more than one solution. We suggest tackling the problem via a sampling-based approach. We test our proposed methodology on the McKean-Vlasov PDE, more precisely on the problem of determining the number of stationary solutions of the McKean-Vlasov (or porous medium) equation.</description>

      <title>Coupled Wasserstein Gradient Flows for Min-Max and Cooperative Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07403v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a framework for two-player infinite-dimensional games with cooperative or competitive structure. These games take the form of coupled partial differential equations in which players optimize over a space of measures, driven by either a gradient descent or gradient descent-ascent in Wasserstein-2 space. We characterize the properties of the Nash equilibrium of the system, and relate it to the steady state of the dynamics. In the min-max setting, we show, under sufficient convexity conditions, that solutions converge exponentially fast and with explicit rate to the unique Nash equilibrium. Similar results are obtained for the cooperative setting. We apply this framework to distribution shift induced by interactions among a strategic population of agents and an algorithm, proving additional convergence results in the timescale-separated setting. We illustrate the performance of our model on (i) real data from an economics study on Colombia census data, (ii) feature modification in loan applications, and (iii) performative prediction. The numerical experiments demonstrate the importance of distribution-level, rather than moment-level, modeling.</description>

      <title>Stable determination of the first order perturbation of the biharmonic operator from partial data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider an inverse boundary value problem for the biharmonic operator with the first order perturbation in a bounded domain of dimension three or higher. Assuming that the first and the zeroth order perturbations are known in a neighborhood of the boundary, we establish log-type stability estimates for these perturbations from a partial Dirichlet-to-Neumann map. Specifically, measurements are taken only on an arbitrarily small open subsets of the boundary.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07437v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This note establishes sharp time-asymptotic algebraic rate bounds for the classical evolution problem of Fujita, but with sublinear rather than superlinear exponent. A transitional stability exponent is identified, which has a simple reciprocity relation with the classical Fujita critical blow-up exponent.</description>

Abstract: We construct a long-time asymptotic profile to the initial value problem of the n-dimensional heat equation. Specifically, we present a modified heat kernel as a long-time asymptotic profile which changes the mass, the center of mass and the variance of the n-dimensional heat kernel in accordance with the moments of the initial data.</description>

      <title>Desingularization of vortices for the incompressible Euler equation on a sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07645v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we construct a family of global solutions to the incompressible Euler equation on a standard 2-sphere. These solutions are odd-symmetric with respect to the equatorial plane and rotate with a constant angular speed around the polar axis. More importantly, these solutions ``converges" to a pair of point vortices with equal strength and opposite signs. The construction is achieved by maximizing the energy-impulse functional relative to a family of suitable rearrangement classes and analyzing the asymptotic behavior of the maximizers. Based on their variational characterization, we also prove the stability of these rotating solutions with respect to odd-symmetric perturbations.</description>

      <title>On non-local almost minimal sets and an application to the non-local Massari's Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a fractional Plateau's problem dealing with sets with prescribed non-local mean curvature. This problem can be seen as a non-local counterpart of the classical Massari's Problem. We obtain existence and regularity results, relying on a suitable version of the non-local theory for almost minimal sets. In this framework, the fractional curvature term in the energy functional can be interpreted as a perturbation of the fractional perimeter. In addition, we also discuss stickiness phenomena for non-local almost minimal sets.</description>

For very general classes of star-shaped domains, we show that there are at most finitely many wavenumbers such that Herglotz incident waves with a fixed density function are non-scattering.</description>

      <title>A variational approach to the stability in the homogenization of some Hamilton-Jacobi equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07756v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the stability with respect to homogenization of classes of integrals arising in the control-theoretic interpretation of some Hamilton-Jacobi equations. The prototypical case is the homogenization of energies with a Lagrangian consisting of the sum of a kinetic term and a highly oscillatory potential $V =V_{\rm per}+ W$, where $V_{\rm per}$ is periodic and $W$ is a nonnegative perturbation thereof. We assume that $W$ has zero average in tubular domains oriented along a dense set of directions. Stability then holds true; that is, the resulting homogenized functional is identical to that for $W= 0$. We consider various extensions of this case. As a consequence of our results, we obtain stability for the homogenization of some steady-state and time-dependent, first-order Hamilton-Jacobi equations with convex Hamiltonians and perturbed periodic potentials. Finally, we show with an example that, for negative $W$, stability may not hold. Our study revisits and, depending on the different assumptions, complements results obtained by P.-L. Lions and collaborators using PDE techniques.</description>

      <title>A realtivistic Hardy-type inequality with minimisers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove a sharp, weighted Hardy-type inequality for the Dirac operator. A key feature of our result is that the inequality is not only sharp but also attained, and we construct explicit minimizers that satisfy the equality case. This extends previous work on the spectral properties of Dirac operators, especially in the context of relativistic quantum mechanics and Coulomb-like potentials.</description>

      <title>Two-scale density of almost smooth functions in sphere-valued Sobolev spaces: A high-contrast extension of the Bethuel-Zheng theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07838v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we prove a strong two-scale approximation result for sphere-valued maps in $L^2(\Omega;W^{1,2}_0(Q_0;\mathbb{S}^2))$, where $\Omega\subset \mathbb{R}^3$ is an open domain and $Q_0\subset Q$ an open subset of the unit cube $Q=(0,1)^3$. The proof relies on a generalization of the seminal argument by F. Bethuel and X.M. Zheng to the two-scale setting. We then present an application to a variational problem in high-contrast micromagnetics.</description>

      <title>Blowing-up solutions to competitive critical systems in dimension 3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the critical system of $m\geq 2$ equations \begin{equation*} -\Delta u_i = u_i^5 + \sum_{j = 1,\,j\neq i}^m \beta_{ij} u_i^2 u_j^3\,, \quad u_i \gneqq 0 \quad \mbox{in } \mathbb{R}^3\,, \quad i \in \{1, \ldots, m\}\,, \end{equation*} where $\beta_{\kappa\ell} =\alpha\in\mathbb{R}$ if $\kappa\neq\ell$, and $\beta_{\ell m}=\beta_{m \kappa} =\beta&lt;0$, for $ \kappa, \ell \in \{1,\ldots, m-1\}$. We construct solutions to this system in the case where $\beta\to-\infty$ by means of a Ljapunov-Schmidt reduction argument. This allows us to identify the explicit form of the solution at main order: $u_1$ will look like a perturbation of the standard radial positive solution to the Yamabe equation, while $u_2$ will blow-up at the $k$ vertices of a regular planar polygon. The solutions to the other equations will replicate the blowing-up structure under an appropriate rotation that ensures $u_i\neq u_j$ for $i\neq j$. The result provides the first almost-explicit example of non-synchronized solutions to competitive critical systems in dimension 3.</description>

      <title>Rigidity of Asymptotically Hyperboloidal Initial Data Sets with Vanishing Mass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07357v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In Special Relativity, massless objects are characterized as either vacuum states or as radiation propagating at the speed of light. This distinction extends to General Relativity for asymptotically flat initial data sets (IDS) \((M^n, g, k)\), where vacuum is represented by slices of Minkowski space, and radiation is modeled by slices of \(pp\)-wave spacetimes. In contrast, we demonstrate that asymptotically hyperboloidal IDS with zero mass must embed isometrically into Minkowski space, with no possible IDS configurations modeling radiation in this setting. Our result holds under the most general assumptions. The proof relies on precise decay estimates for spinors on level sets of spacetime harmonic functions and works in all dimensions.</description>

      <title>Hessian estimates for Lagrangian mean curvature equation with Lipschitz critical and supercritical phases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07511v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop a new strategy to study Lagrangain mean curvature equation on open sets of $\mathbb{R}^{n}(n\geq2)$. By establishing an Allard-type regularity theorem, we obtain an interior Hessian estimate of solutions to this equation with prescribed Lipschitz critical and supercritical phases. Here, our condition on the phases is sharp. The proof heavily relies on geometric measure theory, geometry of Lagrangian graphs, and De Giorgi-Nash-Moser iteration. We expect that the techniques and ideas developed here can be used in some other equations.</description>

      <title>Energy solutions of singular SPDEs on Hilbert spaces with applications to domains with boundary conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07680v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we extend the theory of energy solutions for singular SPDEs, focusing on equations driven by highly irregular noise with bilinear nonlinearities, including scaling critical examples. By introducing Gelfand triples and leveraging infinite-dimensional analysis in Hilbert spaces together with an integration by parts formula under the invariant measure, we largely eliminate the need for Fourier series and chaos expansions. This approach broadens the applicability of energy solutions to a wider class of SPDEs, offering a unified treatment of various domains and boundary conditions. Our examples are motivated by recent work on scaling limits of interacting particle systems.</description>

Abstract: We prove that $\alpha$-dissipative solutions to the Cauchy problem of the Hunter-Saxton equation, where $\alpha \in W^{1, \infty}(\mathbb{R}, [0, 1))$, can be computed numerically with order $\mathcal{O}(\Delta x^{{1}/{8}}+\Delta x^{{\beta}/{4}})$ in $L^{\infty}(\mathbb{R})$, provided there exist constants $C &gt; 0$ and $\beta \in (0, 1]$ such that the initial spatial derivative $\bar{u}_{x}$ satisfies $\|\bar{u}_x(\cdot + h) - \bar{u}_x(\cdot)\|_2 \leq Ch^{\beta}$ for all $h \in (0, 2]$. The derived convergence rate is exemplified by a number of numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Central limit theorem for the focusing $\Phi^4$-measure in the infinite volume limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07840v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the fluctuations of the focusing $\Phi^4$-measure on the one-dimensional torus, in the infinite volume limit. This measure is the invariant Gibbs measure for the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation. It had previously been shown by Rider that the measure is strongly concentrated around a family of minimizers of the Hamiltonian associated with the measure, known as the soliton manifold. These exhibit increasingly sharp spatial concentration, resulting in a trivial limit to first order. We study the fluctuations around this soliton manifold. Our results show that the scaled field under the Gibbs measure converges to white noise in the limit, identifying the next order fluctuations predicted by Rider.</description>

      <title>On asymptotically almost periodic mild solutions for Navier-Stokes equations on non-compact Riemannian manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.14137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.14137v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the existence, uniqueness and asymptotic behaviour of almost periodic and asymptotically almost periodic mild solutions to the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations on $d$-dimensional non-compact manifold $(\mathcal{M},g)$ which satisfies some bounded conditions on curvature tensors. First, we use the $L^p-L^q$-dipsersive and smoothing estimates of the Stokes semigroup to prove Massera-type principles which guarantees the well-posedness of almost periodic and asymptotically almost periodic mild solutions for the inhomogeneous Stokes equations. Then, by using fixed point arguments and Gronwall's inequality we establish the well-posedness and exponential decay for global-in-time of such solutions of Navier-Stokes equations. Our results extend the previous ones \cite{Xuan2022,Xuan2023} to the generalized non-compact Riemannian manifolds.</description>

      <title>Bifurcation domains from any high eigenvalue for an overdetermined elliptic problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.11441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.11441v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the following overdetermined eigenvalue problem on an unbounded domain $\Omega\subset\mathbb{R}^{N+1}$ with $N\geq1$ \begin{equation} \left\{ \begin{array}{ll} -\Delta u=\lambda u\,\, &amp;\text{in}\,\, \Omega,\\ u=0 &amp;\text{on}\,\, \partial \Omega,\\ \partial_\nu u=\text{const} &amp;\text{on}\,\, \partial \Omega. \end{array} \right.\nonumber \end{equation} Let $\lambda_k$ be the $k$-th eigenvalue of the zero-Dirichlet Laplacian on the unit ball for any $k\in \mathbb{N^+}$ with $k\geq 3$. We can construct $k$ smooth families of nontrivial unbounded domains $\Omega$, bifurcating from the straight cylinder, which admit a nonsymmetric solution with changing the sign by $k-1$ times to the overdetermined problem. While the existence of such domains for $k=1,2$ has been well-known, to the best of our knowledge this is the first construction for any positive integer $k\geq 3$. Due to the complexity of studying high eigenvalue problem, our proof involves some novel analytic ingredients. These results can be regarded as counterexamples to the Berenstein conjecture on unbounded domain.</description>

      <title>Continuity of the solution map of some active scalar equations in H\"older and Zygmund spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19057v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that the solution map for a family of non-linear transport equations in $\mathbb{R}^n$, with a velocity field given by the convolution of the density with a kernel that is smooth away from the origin and homogeneous of degree $-(n-1)$, is continuous in both the little H\"older class and the little Zygmund class. For particular choices of the kernel, one recovers well-known equations such as the 2D Euler or the 3D quasi-geostrophic equations.</description>

      <title>Deterministic particle method for nonlinear nonlocal scalar balance equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07148v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a deterministic particle scheme to solve a scalar balance equation with nonlocal interaction and nonlinear mobility used to model congested dynamics. The main novelty with respect to "Radici-Stra [SIAM J. Math. Anal. 55.3 (2023)]" is the presence of a source term; this causes the solutions to no longer be probability measures, thus requiring a suitable adaptation of the numerical scheme and of the estimates leading to compactness.</description>

      <title>Sharp Gaussian upper bounds for Schr\"odinger semigroups on the half-line</title>

      <description>arXiv:2209.12211v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In 1998, V. Liskevich and Y. Semenov showed sharp Gaussian upper bounds for Schr\"odinger semigroups on $\mathbb R^3$ with potentials satisfying a global Kato class condition. Using similar basic ideas we show sharp Gaussian upper bounds for Schr\"odinger semigroups on the half-line, also assuming a suitable global Kato class condition. Our proof strategy includes a new technique of weighted ultracontractivity estimates.</description>

      <title>Weak Diffusive Stability of Roll Solutions at the Zigzag Boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.12365v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Roll solutions at the zigzag boundary, typically selected by patterns and defects in numerical simulations, are shown to be nonlinearly stable. This result also serves as an example that linear decay weaker than the classical diffusive decay, together with quadratic nonlinearity, still gives nonlinear stability of spatially periodic patterns. Linear analysis reveals that, instead of the classical $t^{-1}$ diffusive decay rate, small perturbations of roll solutions at the zigzag boundary decay with a $t^{-3/4}$ rate along with time, due to the degeneracy of the quadratic term of the continuation of the translational mode of the linearized operator in the Bloch-Fourier spaces. The nonlinear stability proof is based on a decomposition of the neutral translational mode and the faster decaying modes in the Bloch-Fourier space, and a fixed-point argument, demonstrating the irrelevancy of the nonlinear terms.</description>

      <title>On the Multiplicity One Conjecture for Mean Curvature Flows of surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.02106v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove the Multiplicity One Conjecture for mean curvature flows of surfaces in $\mathbb{R}^3$. Specifically, we show that any blow-up limit of such mean curvature flows has multiplicity one. This has several applications. First, combining our work with results of Brendle and Choi-Haslhofer-Hershkovits-White, we show that any level set flow starting from an embedded surface diffeomorphic to a 2-spheres does not fatten. In fact, we obtain that the problem of evolving embedded 2-spheres via the mean curvature flow equation is well-posed within a natural class of singular solutions. Second, we use our result to remove an additional condition in recent work of Chodosh-Choi-Mantoulidis-Schulze. This shows that mean curvature flows starting from any generic embedded surface only incur cylindrical or spherical singularities. Third, our approach offers a new regularity theory for solutions of mean curvature flows that flow through singularities. Among other things, this theory also applies to the innermost and outermost flow of any embedded surface and shows that all singularity models of such flows must have multiplicity one. It also establishes equality of the fattening time with the discrepancy time. Lastly, we obtain a number of further results characterizing a separation phenomenon of mean curvature flows of surfaces.</description>

      <title>On the relativistic quantum mechanics of a photon between two electrons in 1+1 dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.06019v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A Lorentz-covariant system of wave equations is formulated for a quantum-mechanical three-body system in one space dimension, comprised of one photon and two identical massive spin one-half Dirac particles, which can be thought of as two electrons (or alternatively, two positrons). Manifest covariance is achieved using Dirac's formalism of multi-time wave functions, i.e, wave functions $\Psi(\textbf{x}_{\text{ph}},\textbf{x}_{\text{e}_1},\textbf{x}_{\text{e}_2})$ where $\textbf{x}_{\text{ph}},\textbf{x}_{\text{e}_1},\textbf{x}_{\text{e}_2}$ are generic spacetime events of the photon and two electrons respectively. Their interaction is implemented via a Lorentz-invariant no-crossing-of-paths boundary condition at the coincidence submanifolds $\{\textbf{x}_{\text{ph}}=\textbf{x}_{\text{e}_1}\}$ and $\{\textbf{x}_{\text{ph}}=\textbf{x}_{\text{e}_2}\}$ compatible with conservation of probability current. The corresponding initial-boundary value problem is shown to be well-posed, and it is shown that the unique solution can be represented by a convergent infinite sum of Feynman-like diagrams, each one corresponding to the photon bouncing between the two electrons a fixed number of times.</description>

      <title>A Mathematical Theory of Integer Quantum Hall Effect in Photonics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17200v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates interface modes in a square lattice of photonic crystal composed of gyromagnetic particles with $C_{4v}$ point group symmetry. The study shows that Dirac or linear degenerate points cannot occur at the three high-symmetry points in the Brillouin zone where two Bloch bands touch. Instead, a touch point at the M-point has a quadratic degeneracy in the generic case. It is further proved that when a magnetic field is applied to the two sides of an interface in opposite directions, two interface modes supported along that interface can bifurcate from the quadratic degenerate point. These results provide a mathematical foundation for the first experimental realization of the integer quantum Hall effect in the context of photonics.</description>

      <title>A dual-pairing summation-by-parts finite difference framework for nonlinear conservation laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06629v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Robust and stable high order numerical methods for solving partial differential equations are attractive because they are efficient on modern and next generation hardware architectures. However, the design of provably stable numerical methods for nonlinear hyperbolic conservation laws pose a significant challenge. We present the dual-pairing (DP) and upwind summation-by-parts (SBP) finite difference (FD) framework for accurate and robust numerical approximations of nonlinear conservation laws. The framework has an inbuilt "limiter" whose goal is to detect and effectively resolve regions where the solution is poorly resolved and/or discontinuities are found. The DP SBP FD operators are a dual-pair of backward and forward FD stencils, which together preserve the SBP property. In addition, the DP SBP FD operators are designed to be upwind, that is they come with some innate dissipation everywhere, as opposed to traditional SBP and collocated discontinuous Galerkin spectral element methods which can only induce dissipation through numerical fluxes acting at element interfaces. We combine the DP SBP operators together with skew-symmetric and upwind flux splitting of nonlinear hyperbolic conservation laws. Our semi-discrete approximation is provably entropy-stable for arbitrary nonlinear hyperbolic conservation laws. The framework is high order accurate, provably entropy-stable, convergent, and avoids several pitfalls of current state-of-the-art high order methods. We give specific examples using the in-viscid Burger's equation, nonlinear shallow water equations and compressible Euler equations of gas dynamics. Numerical experiments are presented to verify accuracy and demonstrate the robustness of our numerical framework.</description>
