      <title>The Power of Perturbation under Sampling in Solving Extensive-Form Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16600v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates how perturbation does and does not improve the Follow-the-Regularized-Leader (FTRL) algorithm in imperfect-information extensive-form games. Perturbing the expected payoffs guarantees that the FTRL dynamics reach an approximate equilibrium, and proper adjustments of the magnitude of the perturbation lead to a Nash equilibrium (\textit{last-iterate convergence}). This approach is robust even when payoffs are estimated using sampling -- as is the case for large games -- while the optimistic approach often becomes unstable. Building upon those insights, we first develop a general framework for perturbed FTRL algorithms under \textit{sampling}. We then empirically show that in the last-iterate sense, the perturbed FTRL consistently outperforms the non-perturbed FTRL. We further identify a divergence function that reduces the variance of the estimates for perturbed payoffs, with which it significantly outperforms the prior algorithms on Leduc poker (whose structure is more asymmetric in a sense than that of the other benchmark games) and consistently performs smooth convergence behavior on all the benchmark games.</description>

      <title>Artificial Intelligence Clones</title>

Abstract: Large language models, trained on personal data, may soon be able to mimic individual personalities. This would potentially transform search across human candidates, including for marriage and jobs -- indeed, several dating platforms have already begun experimenting with training "AI clones" to represent users. This paper presents a theoretical framework to study the tradeoff between the substantially expanded search capacity of AI clones and their imperfect representation of humans. Individuals are modeled as points in $k$-dimensional Euclidean space, and their AI clones are modeled as noisy approximations. I compare two search regimes: an "in-person regime" -- where each person randomly meets some number of individuals and matches to the most compatible among them -- against an "AI representation regime" -- in which individuals match to the person whose AI clone is most compatible with their AI clone. I show that a finite number of in-person encounters exceeds the expected payoff from search over infinite AI clones. Moreover, when the dimensionality of personality is large, simply meeting two people in person produces a higher expected match quality than entrusting the process to an AI platform, regardless of the size of its candidate pool.</description>

      <title>Learning Mean Field Control on Sparse Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17079v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large agent networks are abundant in applications and nature and pose difficult challenges in the field of multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) due to their computational and theoretical complexity. While graphon mean field games and their extensions provide efficient learning algorithms for dense and moderately sparse agent networks, the case of realistic sparser graphs remains largely unsolved. Thus, we propose a novel mean field control model inspired by local weak convergence to include sparse graphs such as power law networks with coefficients above two. Besides a theoretical analysis, we design scalable learning algorithms which apply to the challenging class of graph sequences with finite first moment. We compare our model and algorithms for various examples on synthetic and real world networks with mean field algorithms based on Lp graphons and graphexes. As it turns out, our approach outperforms existing methods in many examples and on various networks due to the special design aiming at an important, but so far hard to solve class of MARL problems.</description>

      <title>Learning to Mitigate Externalities: the Coase Theorem with Hindsight Rationality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19824v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In economic theory, the concept of externality refers to any indirect effect resulting from an interaction between players that affects the social welfare. Most of the models within which externality has been studied assume that agents have perfect knowledge of their environment and preferences. This is a major hindrance to the practical implementation of many proposed solutions. To address this issue, we consider a two-player bandit setting where the actions of one of the players affect the other player and we extend the Coase theorem [Coase, 1960]. This result shows that the optimal approach for maximizing the social welfare in the presence of externality is to establish property rights, i.e., enable transfers and bargaining between the players. Our work removes the classical assumption that bargainers possess perfect knowledge of the underlying game. We first demonstrate that in the absence of property rights, the social welfare breaks down. We then design a policy for the players which allows them to learn a bargaining strategy which maximizes the total welfare, recovering the Coase theorem under uncertainty.</description>

      <title>Decentralized Convergence to Equilibrium Prices in Trading Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13972v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a decentralized market model in which agents can negotiate bilateral contracts. This builds on a similar, but centralized, model of trading networks introduced by Hatfield et al. in 2013. Prior work has established that fully-substitutable preferences guarantee the existence of competitive equilibria which can be centrally computed. Our motivation comes from the fact that prices in markets such as over-the-counter markets and used car markets arise from decentralized negotiation among agents, which has left open an important question as to whether equilibrium prices can emerge from agent-to-agent bilateral negotiations. We design a best response dynamic intended to capture such negotiations between market participants. We assume fully substitutable preferences for market participants. In this setting, we provide proofs of convergence for sparse markets (covering many real world markets of interest), and experimental results for more general cases, demonstrating that prices indeed reach equilibrium, quickly, via bilateral negotiations. Our best response dynamic, and its convergence behavior, forms an important first step in understanding how decentralized markets reach, and retain, equilibrium.</description>

      <title>Preferences Evolve And So Should Your Bandits: Bandits with Evolving States for Online Platforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.11655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.11655v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a model for learning with bandit feedback while accounting for deterministically evolving and unobservable states that we call Bandits with Deterministically Evolving States ($B$-$DES$). The workhorse applications of our model are learning for recommendation systems and learning for online ads. In both cases, the reward that the algorithm obtains at each round is a function of the short-term reward of the action chosen and how "healthy" the system is (i.e., as measured by its state). For example, in recommendation systems, the reward that the platform obtains from a user's engagement with a particular type of content depends not only on the inherent features of the specific content, but also on how the user's preferences have evolved as a result of interacting with other types of content on the platform. Our general model accounts for the different rate $\lambda \in [0,1]$ at which the state evolves (e.g., how fast a user's preferences shift as a result of previous content consumption) and encompasses standard multi-armed bandits as a special case. The goal of the algorithm is to minimize a notion of regret against the best-fixed sequence of arms pulled, which is significantly harder to attain compared to standard benchmark of the best-fixed action in hindsight. We present online learning algorithms for any possible value of the evolution rate $\lambda$ and we show the robustness of our results to various model misspecifications.</description>
