      <title>ARGscape: A modular, interactive tool for manipulation of spatiotemporal ancestral recombination graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07255v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ancestral recombination graphs (ARGs) encode the complete genealogical history of a population of recombining lineages. ARGs, and their succinct representation, tree sequences, are increasingly central to modern population genetics methods, yet building an intuition for ARGs remains challenging. This is particularly true when analyzing ancestry in a geographic context, as there is a critical lack of dedicated, interactive tools capable of visualizing ARGs as spatiotemporal objects. To address this gap, we introduce ARGscape, an interactive platform for simulating, analyzing, and visualizing ARGs across space and time. ARGscape provides a user-friendly graphical interface featuring dynamic 2- and 3-dimensional visualizations to explore ARGs through space and time, as well as a novel "spatial diff" visualization for quantitative comparison of geographic inference methods. ARGscape is an innovative, unified framework that seamlessly integrates leading command-line, Python, and R-based tools for ARG simulation, manipulation, and use in spatiotemporal inference into both graphical and command-line interfaces. By integrating these various functionalities, ARGscape facilitates novel data exploration and hypothesis generation, while lowering the barrier to entry for spatiotemporal ARG analysis in both research and education use-cases. ARGscape is built with a Python FastAPI backend and a React/TypeScript frontend. It is freely available as a live demo at https://www.argscape.com and as a Python package on PyPI (pip install argscape). The source code and documentation are available on GitHub at https://github.com/chris-a-talbot/argscape.</description>

      <title>Entropy and diffusion characterize mutation accumulation and biological information loss</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aging is a universal consequence of life, yet researchers have identified no universal theme. This manuscript considers aging from the perspective of entropy, wherein things fall apart. We first examine biological information change as a mutational distance, analogous to physical distance. In this model, informational change over time is fitted to an advection-diffusion equation, a normal distribution with a time component. The solution of the advection-diffusion equation provides a means of measuring the entropy of diverse biological systems. The binomial distribution is also sufficient to demonstrate that entropy increases as mutations or epimutations accumulate. As modeled, entropy scales with lifespans across the tree of life. This perspective provides potential mechanistic insights and testable hypotheses as to how evolution has attained enhanced longevity: entropy management. We find entropy is an inclusive rather than exclusive aging theory.</description>

      <title>Space, time and altruism in pandemics and the climate emergency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06236v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Climate change is a global emergency, as was the COVID-19 pandemic. Why was our collective response to COVID-19 so much stronger than our response to the climate emergency, to date? We hypothesize that the answer has to do with the scale of the systems, and not just spatial and temporal scales but also the `altruistic scale' that measures whether an action must rely upon altruistic motives for it to be adopted. We treat COVID-19 and climate change as common pool resource problems that exemplify coupled human-environment systems. We introduce a framework that captures regimes of containment, mitigation, and failure to control. As parameters governing these three scales are varied, it is possible to shift from a COVID-like system to a climate-like system. The framework replicates both inaction in the case of climate change mitigation, as well as the faster response that we exhibited to COVID-19. Our cross-system comparison also suggests actionable ways that cooperation can be improved in large-scale common pool resources problems, like climate change. More broadly, we argue that considering scale and incorporating human-natural system feedbacks are not just interesting special cases within non-cooperative game theory, but rather should be the starting point for the study of altruism and human cooperation.</description>

      <title>Coupled opinion-environmental dynamics in polarized and prejudiced populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06237v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Public opinion on environmental issues remains polarized in many countries, posing a significant barrier to the implementation of effective policies. Behind this polarization, empirical studies have identified social susceptibility, personal prejudice, and personal experience as dominant factors in opinion formation on environmental issues. However, current coupled human-environment models have not yet incorporated all three factors in polarized populations. We developed a stylized coupled human-environment model to investigate how social susceptibility, personal prejudice, and personal experience shape opinion formation and the environment in polarized populations. Using analytical and numerical methods, we characterized the conditions under which polarization, consensus, opinion changes, and cyclic dynamics emerge depending on the costs of mitigation, environmental damage, and the factors influencing opinion formation. Our model shows that prejudice is the key driver of persistent polarization, with even slightly prejudiced populations maintaining indefinite polarization independent of their level of objectivity. We predict that polarization can be reduced by decreasing the role of prejudice or increasing the willingness to consider opposing opinions. Finally, our model shows that cost reduction methods are less effective at reducing environmental impact in prejudiced populations. Our model generates thresholds for when reducing costs or emissions is more useful depending on the factors which influence the population's opinion formation. Overall, our model provides a framework for investigating the importance of cognitive and social structures in determining human-environment dynamics.</description>

      <title>Emergent predictability in microbial ecosystems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19372v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Microbial ecosystems exhibit a surprising amount of functionally relevant diversity at all levels of taxonomic resolution, presenting a significant challenge for most modeling frameworks. A long-standing hope of theoretical ecology is that some patterns might persist despite community complexity -- or perhaps even emerge because of it. A deeper understanding of such "emergent simplicity" could enable new approaches for predicting the behaviors of the complex ecosystems in nature. However, the concept remains partly intuitive with no consistent definition, and most empirical examples described so far afford limited predictive power. Here, we propose an information-theoretic framework for defining and quantifying emergent simplicity in empirical data based on the ability of coarsened descriptions to predict community-level functional properties. Applying this framework to two published datasets, we demonstrate that all five properties measured across both experiments exhibit robust evidence of what we define as "emergent predictability": surprisingly, as community richness increases, simple compositional descriptions become more predictive. We show that standard theoretical models of high-diversity ecosystems fail to recapitulate this behavior. This is in contrast to simple self-averaging, which is well-understood and generic across models. We propose that, counterintuitively, emergent predictability arises when physiological or environmental feedbacks _oppose_ statistical self-averaging along some axes of community variation. As a result, these axes of variation become increasingly predictive of community function at high richness. We demonstrate this mechanism in a minimal model, and argue that explaining and leveraging emergent predictability will require integrating large-N theoretical models with a minimal notion of physiology, which the dominant modeling frameworks currently omit.</description>

      <title>Defining and Estimating Outcomes Directly Averted by a Vaccination Program when Rollout Occurs Over Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05508v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: During the COVID-19 pandemic, estimating the total deaths averted by vaccination has been of great public health interest. Instead of estimating total deaths averted by vaccination among both vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals, some studies empirically estimated only "directly averted" deaths among vaccinated individuals, typically suggesting that vaccines prevented more deaths overall than directly due to the indirect effect. Here, we define the causal estimand to quantify outcomes "directly averted" by vaccination$\unicode{x2014}$i.e., the impact of vaccination for vaccinated individuals, holding vaccination coverage fixed$\unicode{x2014}$for vaccination at multiple time points, and show that this estimand is a lower bound on the total outcomes averted when the indirect effect is non-negative. We develop an unbiased estimator for the causal estimand in a one-stage randomized controlled trial (RCT) and explore the bias of a popular "hazard difference" estimator frequently used in empirical studies. We show that even in an RCT, the hazard difference estimator is biased if vaccination has a non-null effect, as it fails to incorporate the greater depletion of susceptibles among the unvaccinated individuals. In simulations, the overestimation is small for averted deaths when infection-fatality rate is low, as for many important pathogens. However, the overestimation can be large for averted infections given a high basic reproduction number. Additionally, we define and compare estimand and estimators for avertible outcomes (i.e., outcomes that could have been averted by vaccination, but were not due to failure to vaccinate). Future studies can explore the identifiability of the causal estimand in observational settings.</description>
