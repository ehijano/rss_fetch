      <title>Ratchet current and scaling properties in a nontwist mapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06175v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the transport of particles in the chaotic component of phase space for a two-dimensional, area-preserving nontwist map. The survival probability for particles within the chaotic sea is described by an exponential decay for regions in phase space predominantly chaotic and it is scaling invariant in this case. Alternatively, when considering mixed chaotic and regular regions, there is a deviation from the exponential decay, characterized by a power law tail for long times, a signature of the stickiness effect. Furthermore, due to the asymmetry of the chaotic component of phase space with respect to the line $I = 0$, there is an unbalanced stickiness which generates a ratchet current in phase space. Finally, we perform a phenomenological description of the diffusion of chaotic particles by identifying three scaling hypotheses, and obtaining the critical exponents via extensive numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Input Driven Synchronization of Chaotic Neural Networks with Analyticaly Determined Conditional Lyapunov Exponents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06491v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) with random, but sufficiently strong and balanced coupling display a well known high-dimensional chaotic dynamics. Here, we investigate if externally applied inputs to these RNNs can stabilize globally synchronous, input-dependent solutions, in spite of the strong chaos-inducing coupling. We find that when the balance between excitation and inhibition is exact, that is when the row-sum of the weights is constant and 0, a globally applied input can readily synchronize all neurons onto a synchronous solution. The stability of the synchronous solution is analytically explored in this work with a master stability function. For any synchronous solution to the network dynamics, the conditional Lyapunov spectrum can be readily determined, with the stability of the synchronous solution critically dependent on the largest real eigenvalue component of the RNN weight matrix. We find that the smaller the maximum real component of the weight matrix eigenvalues, the more readily the network synchronizes. Further, the conditional Lyapunov exponents are easily computed numerically for any synchronization signal without simulating the RNN. Finally, for certain oscillatory synchronization signals, the conditional Lyapunov exponents can be determined analytically.</description>

      <title>Time-series-analysis-based detection of critical transitions in real-world non-autonomous systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05195v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Real-world non-autonomous systems are open, out-of-equilibrium systems that evolve in and are driven by temporally varying environments. Such systems can show multiple timescale and transient dynamics together with transitions to very different and, at times, even disastrous dynamical regimes. Since such critical transitions disrupt the systems' intended or desired functionality, it is crucial to understand the underlying mechanisms, to identify precursors of such transitions and to reliably detect them in time series of suitable system observables to enable forecasts. This review critically assesses the various steps of investigation involved in time-series-analysis-based detection of critical transitions in real-world non-autonomous systems: from the data recording to evaluating the reliability of offline and online detections. It will highlight pros and cons to stimulate further developments, which would be necessary to advance understanding and forecasting nonlinear behavior such as critical transitions in complex systems.</description>

      <title>Chaotic magnetization dynamics driven by feedback magnetic field</title>

Abstract: An excitation of highly nonlinear, complex magnetization dynamics in a ferromagnet, for example chaos, is a new research target in spintronics. This technology is applied to practical applications such as random number generator and information processing systems. One way to induce complex dynamics is applying feedback effect to the ferromagnet. The role of the feedback electric current on the magnetization dynamics was studied in the past. However, there is another way to apply feedback effect to the ferromagnet, namely feedback magnetic field. In this paper, we developed both numerical and theoretical analyses on the role of the feedback magnetic field causing complex magnetization dynamics. The numerical simulation indicates the change of the dynamical behavior from a simple oscillation with a unique frequency to complex dynamics such as amplitude modulation and chaos. The theoretical analyses on the equation of motion qualitatively explain several features found in the numerical simulations, exemplified as an appearance of multipeak structure in the Fourier spectra. The difference of the role of the feedback electric current and magnetic field is also revealed from the theoretical analyses.</description>

      <title>Elasticity of fibres prefers the chaos of turbulence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06033v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dynamics of fibres, modelled as a sequence of inertial beads linked via elastic springs, in turbulent flows is dictated by a non-trivial interplay of their inertia and elasticity. Such elastic, inertial fibres preferentially sample a three-dimensional turbulent flow in a manner qualitatively similar to that in two-dimensions [Singh et al., Phys. Rev. E 101, 053105 (2020)]. Inertia and elasticity have competing effects on fibre dynamics: Inertia drives fibres away from vortices while elasticity tends to trap them inside. However, both these effects are reversed at large values. A large inertia makes the fibres sample the flow more uniformly while a very large elasticity facilitates the sampling of straining regions. This complex sampling behaviour is further corroborated by quantifying the chaotic nature of sampled flow regions. This is achieved by evaluating the maximal Lagrangian Lyapunov Exponents associated with the flow along fibre trajectories.</description>

      <title>The entanglement membrane in exactly solvable lattice models</title>

Abstract: Entanglement membrane theory is an effective coarse-grained description of entanglement dynamics and operator growth in chaotic quantum many-body systems. The fundamental quantity characterizing the membrane is the entanglement line tension. However, determining the entanglement line tension for microscopic models is in general exponentially difficult. We compute the entanglement line tension in a recently introduced class of exactly solvable yet chaotic unitary circuits, so-called generalized dual-unitary circuits, obtaining a non-trivial form that gives rise to a hierarchy of velocity scales with $v_E&lt;v_B$. For the lowest level of the hierarchy, $\bar{\mathcal{L}}_{2}$ circuits, the entanglement line tension can be computed entirely, while for the higher levels the solvability is reduced to certain regions in spacetime. This partial solvability enables us to place bounds on the entanglement velocity. We find that $\bar{\mathcal{L}}_{2}$ circuits saturate certain bounds on entanglement growth that are also saturated in holographic models. Furthermore, we relate the entanglement line tension to temporal entanglement and correlation functions. We also develop new methods of constructing generalized dual-unitary gates, including constructions based on complex Hadamard matrices that exhibit additional solvability properties and constructions that display behavior unique to local dimension greater than or equal to three. Our results shed light on entanglement membrane theory in microscopic Floquet lattice models and enable us to perform non-trivial checks on the validity of its predictions by comparison to exact and numerical calculations. Moreover, they demonstrate that generalized dual-unitary circuits display a more generic form of information dynamics than dual-unitary circuits.</description>

      <title>Phase reduction explains chimera shape: when multi-body interaction matters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.05366v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an extension of the Kuramoto-Sakaguchi model for networks, deriving the second-order phase approximation for a paradigmatic model of oscillatory networks - an ensemble of non-identical Stuart-Landau oscillators coupled pairwisely via an arbitrary coupling matrix. We explicitly demonstrate how this matrix translates into the coupling structure in the phase equations. To illustrate the power of our approach and the crucial importance of high-order phase reduction, we tackle a trendy setup of non-locally coupled oscillators exhibiting a chimera state. We reveal that our second-order phase model reproduces the dependence of the chimera shape on the coupling strength that is not captured by the typically used first-order Kuramoto-like model. Our derivation contributes to a better understanding of complex networks' dynamics, establishing a relation between the coupling matrix and multi-body interaction terms in the high-order phase model.</description>

      <title>Out-of-Domain Generalization in Dynamical Systems Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18377v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In science we are interested in finding the governing equations, the dynamical rules, underlying empirical phenomena. While traditionally scientific models are derived through cycles of human insight and experimentation, recently deep learning (DL) techniques have been advanced to reconstruct dynamical systems (DS) directly from time series data. State-of-the-art dynamical systems reconstruction (DSR) methods show promise in capturing invariant and long-term properties of observed DS, but their ability to generalize to unobserved domains remains an open challenge. Yet, this is a crucial property we would expect from any viable scientific theory. In this work, we provide a formal framework that addresses generalization in DSR. We explain why and how out-of-domain (OOD) generalization (OODG) in DSR profoundly differs from OODG considered elsewhere in machine learning. We introduce mathematical notions based on topological concepts and ergodic theory to formalize the idea of learnability of a DSR model. We formally prove that black-box DL techniques, without adequate structural priors, generally will not be able to learn a generalizing DSR model. We also show this empirically, considering major classes of DSR algorithms proposed so far, and illustrate where and why they fail to generalize across the whole phase space. Our study provides the first comprehensive mathematical treatment of OODG in DSR, and gives a deeper conceptual understanding of where the fundamental problems in OODG lie and how they could possibly be addressed in practice.</description>

      <title>Impact of ageostrophic dynamics on the predictability of Lagrangian trajectories in surface-ocean turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03915v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Turbulent flows at the surface of the ocean deviate from geostrophic equilibrium on scales smaller than about 10 km. These scales are associated with important vertical transport of active and passive tracers, and should play a prominent role in the heat transport at climatic scales and for plankton dynamics. Measuring velocity fields on such small scales is notoriously difficult but new, high-resolution satellite altimetry is starting to reveal them. However, the satellite-derived velocities essentially represent the geostrophic flow component, and the impact of unresolved ageostrophic motions on particle dispersion needs to be understood to properly characterize transport properties. Here, we investigate ocean fine-scale turbulence using a model that represents some of the processes due to ageostrophic dynamics. We take a Lagrangian approach and focus on the predictability of the particle dynamics, comparing trajectories advected by either the full flow or by its geostrophic component only. Our results indicate that, over long times, relative dispersion is marginally affected by the filtering of the ageostrophic component. Nevertheless, advection by the filtered flow leads to an overestimation of the typical pair-separation rate, and to a bias on trajectories (in terms of displacement from the actual ones), whose importance grows with the Rossby number. We further explore the intensity of the transient particle clustering induced by ageostrophic motions and find that it can be significant, even for small flow compressibility. Indeed, we show that clustering is here due to the interplay between compressibility and persistent flow structures that trap particles, enhancing their aggregation.</description>
