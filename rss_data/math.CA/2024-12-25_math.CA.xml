      <title>Pinned Dot Product Set Estimates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17985v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a variant of the Falconer distance problem for dot products. In particular, for fractal subsets $A\subset \mathbb{R}^n$ and $a,x\in \mathbb{R}^n$, we study sets of the form \[ \Pi_x^a(A) := \{\alpha \in \mathbb{R} : (a-x)\cdot y= \alpha, \text{ for some $y\in A$}\}. \] We discuss some of what is already known to give a picture of the current state of the art, as well as prove some new results and special cases. We obtain lower bounds on the Hausdorff dimension of $A$ to guarantee that $\Pi^a_x(A)$ is large in some quantitative sense for some $a\in A$ (i.e. $\Pi_x^a(A)$ has large Hausdorff dimension, positive measure, or nonempty interior). Our approach to all three senses of "size" is the same, and we make use of both classical and recent results on projection theory.</description>

      <title>On Tiling and Spectral Sets in $\mathbb Z_{p^2}\times\mathbb Z_{p^2}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $p$ be a prime number, it is shown that tiling and spectral sets coincide in $\mathbb Z_{p^2}\times\mathbb Z_{p^2}$ by considering equivalently symplectic spectral pairs. Symplectic structures appear naturally in time-frequency analysis and provides a perspective to reveal patterns that may not be so evident in the Euclidean setting. The main approach here is however still to count the size of the zero set and analyze its contents.</description>

      <title>Spread Furstenberg Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We obtain new bounds for (a variant of) the Furstenberg set problem for high dimensional flats over $\mathbb{R}^n$. In particular, let $F\subset \mathbb{R}^n$, $1\leq k \leq n-1$, $s\in (0,k]$, and $t\in (0,k(n-k)]$. We say that $F$ is a $(s,t;k)$-spread Furstenberg set if there exists a $t$-dimensional set of subspaces $\mathcal P \subset \mathcal G(n,k)$ such that for all $P\in \mathcal P$, there exists a translation vector $a_P \in \mathbb{R}^n$ such that $\dim(F\cap (P + a_P)) \geq s$. We show that given $k \geq k_0 +1$ (where $k_0:= k_0(n)$ is sufficiently large) and $s&gt;k_0$, every $(s,t;k)$-spread Furstenberg set $F$ in $\mathbb{R}^n$ satisfies \[ \dim F \geq n-k + s - \frac{k(n-k) - t}{\lceil s\rceil - k_0 +1 }. \] Our methodology is motivated by the work of the second author, Dvir, and Lund over finite fields.</description>

      <title>Local smoothing estimates for Schr\"odinger equations in modulation spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18363v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by a recent work of Schippa (2022), we consider local smoothing estimates for Schr\"{o}dinger equations in modulation spaces. By using the C\'{o}rdoba-Fefferman type reverse square function inequality and the bilinear Strichartz estimate, we can refine the summability exponent of modulation spaces. Next, we will also discuss a new type of randomized Strichartz estimate in modulation spaces. Finally, we will show that the reverse function estimate implies the Strichartz estimates in modulation spaces. From this implication, we obtain the reverse square function estimate of critical order.</description>

      <title>On solvability of linear differential equations in finite terms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18062v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of solvability of linear differential equations over a differential field~$K$. We introduce a class of special differential field extensions, which widely generalizes the classical class of extensions of differential fields by integrals and by exponentials of integrals and which has similar properties. We announce the following result: if a linear differential equation over $K$ can not be solved by generalized quadratures, then no special extension can help solve it. In the paper we prove a weaker version of this result in which we consider only pure transcendental extensions of $K$. Our paper is self-contained and understandable for beginners. It demonstrates the power of Liouville's original approach to problems of solvability of equations in finite terms.</description>

      <title>Global Bifurcation Curve for Fourth-Order MEMS/NEMS Models with Clamped Boundary Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18427v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Global solution curve and exact multiplicity of positive solutions for a class of fourth-order equations with doubly clamped boundary conditions are established. The results extend a theorem of P. Korman (2004) by allowing the presence of a singularity in the nonlinearity. The paper also provides a global a priori bound for $C^3$-norm of positive solutions, which is optimal in terms of regularity. Examples arising in MEMS/NEMS models are presented to illustrate applications of the main results.</description>

      <title>Fundamental solutions for parabolic equations and systems: universal existence, uniqueness, representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18436v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop a universal, conceptually simple and systematic method to prove well-posedness to Cauchy problems for weak solutions of parabolic equations with non-smooth, time-dependent, elliptic part having a variational definition. Our classes of weak solutions are taken with minimal assumptions. We prove the existence and uniqueness of a fundamental solution which seems new in this generality: it is shown to always coincide with the associated evolution family for the initial value problem with zero source and it yields representation of all weak solutions. Our strategy is a variational approach avoiding density arguments, a priori regularity of weak solutions or regularization by smooth operators. One of our main tools are embedding results which yield time continuity of our weak solutions going beyond the celebrated Lions regularity theorem and that is addressing a variety of source terms. We illustrate our results with three concrete applications : second order uniformly elliptic part with Dirichlet boundary condition on domains, integro-differential elliptic part, and second order degenerate elliptic part.</description>

      <title>Representation Theorem for Multivariable Totally Symmetric Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.15958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.15958v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we establish a representation theorem for multivariable totally symmetric functions: a multisymmetric continuous function must be the composition of a continuous function and a set of generators of the multisymmetric polynomials. We then study the singularity and geometry of the generators, and show that the regularity may become worse after applying the decomposition.</description>

      <title>The exact dimension of Liouville numbers: The Fourier side</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04148v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article we study the generalized Fourier dimension of the set of Liouville numbers $\mathbb{L}$. Being a set of zero Hausdorff dimension, the analysis has to be done at the level of functions with a slow decay at infinity acting as control for the Fourier transform of (Rajchman) measures supported on $\mathbb{L}$. We give an almost complete characterization of admissible decays for this set in terms of comparison to power-like functions. This work can be seen as the ``Fourier side'' of the analysis made by Olsen and Renfro regarding the generalized Hausdorff dimension using gauge functions. We also provide an approach to deal with the problem of classifying oscillating candidates for a Fourier decay for $\mathbb{L}$ relying on its translation invariance property.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.08994v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While port-Hamiltonian descriptor systems are known to be stable and passive, they may not be asymptotically stable or strictly passive. Necessary and sufficient conditions are presented when these properties as well as the regularity and the index one property can be achieved via state feedback while preserving the port-Hamiltonian structure.</description>
