      <title>How to quantify the coherence of a set of beliefs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02777v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given conflicting probability estimates for a set of events, how can we quantify how much they conflict? How can we find a single probability distribution that best encapsulates the given estimates? One approach is to minimize a loss function such as binary KL-divergence that quantifies the dissimilarity between the given estimates and the candidate probability distribution. Given a set of events, we characterize the facets of the polytope of coherent probability estimates about those events. We explore two applications of these ideas: eliciting the beliefs of large language models, and merging expert forecasts into a single coherent forecast.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02948v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study properties of causal couplings for probability measures on the space of continuous functions. We first provide a characterization of bicausal couplings between weak solutions of stochastic differential equations. We then provide a complete description of all such bicausal Monge couplings. In particular, we show that bicausal Monge couplings of $d$-dimensional Wiener measures are induced by stochastic integrals of rotation-valued integrands. As an application, we give necessary and sufficient conditions for bicausal couplings to be induced by Monge maps and show that such bicausal Monge transports are dense in the set of bicausal couplings between laws of SDEs with regular coefficients.</description>

      <title>Geodesic Trees and Exceptional Directions in FPP on Hyperbolic Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We continue the study of the geometry of infinite geodesics in first passage percolation (FPP) on Gromov-hyperbolic groups G, initiated by Benjamini-Tessera and developed further by the authors. It was shown earlier by the authors that, given any fixed direction $\xi\in \partial G$, and under mild conditions on the passage time distribution, there exists almost surely a unique semi-infinite FPP geodesic from each $v\in G$ to $\xi$. Also, these geodesics coalesce to form a tree. Our main topic of study is the set of (random) exceptional directions for which uniqueness or coalescence fails. We study these directions in the context of two random geodesics trees: one formed by the union of all geodesics starting at a given base point, and the other formed by the union of all semi-infinite geodesics in a given direction $\xi\in \partial G$. We show that, under mild conditions, the set of exceptional directions almost surely has a strictly smaller Hausdorff dimension than the boundary, and hence has measure zero with respect to the Patterson-Sullivan measure. We also establish an upper bound on the maximum number of disjoint geodesics in the same direction. For groups that are not virtually free, we show that almost surely exceptional directions exist and are dense in $\partial G$. When the topological dimension of $\partial G$ is greater than one, we establish the existence of uncountably many exceptional directions. When the topological dimension of $\partial G$ is $n$, we prove the existence of directions $\xi$ with at least $(n+1)$ disjoint geodesics. The questions answered here have been considered before for FPP on euclidean lattices, but have only been satisfactorily answered for planar exactly solvable models of last passage percolation. Our results exhibit new features in higher dimensions.</description>

      <title>Large deviation principle at speed $n$ for the random metric in first-passage percolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03320v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider standard first-passage percolation on $\mathbb Z^d$. We study the lower-tail large deviations of the rescaled random metric $\widehat{\mathbf T}_n$ restricted to a box. If all exponential moments are finite, we prove that $\widehat{\mathbf T}_n$ follows the large deviation principle at speed $n$ with a rate function $J$, in a suitable space of metrics. Moreover, we give three expressions for $J(D)$. The first two involve the metric derivative with respect to $D$ of Lipschitz paths and the lower-tail rate function for the point-point passage time. The third is an integral against the $1$-dimensional Hausdorff measure of a local cost. Under a much weaker moment assumption, we give an estimate for the probability of events of the type $\{\widehat{\mathbf T}_n \le D \}$.</description>

      <title>Functional limit theorem for branching processes in nearly degenerate varying environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03325v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate branching processes in nearly degenerate varying environment, where the offspring distribution converges to the degenerate distribution at 1. Such processes die out almost surely, therefore, we condition on non-extinction or add inhomogeneous immigration. Extending our one-dimensional limit results we derive functional limit theorems. In the former case, the limiting process is a time-changed simple birth-and-death process on $(-\infty, 0]$ conditioned on survival at $0$, while in the latter, it is a time-changed stationary continuous time branching process with immigration.</description>

      <title>Regularity of Weighted Tensorized Fractional Brownian Fields and associated function spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03366v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a new class of self-similar fractional Brownian fields, called Weighted Tensorized Fractional Brownian Fields (WTFBS). These fields, introduced in the companion paper \cite{ELLV}, generalize the well-known fractional Brownian sheet (FBs) by relaxing its tensor-product structure, resulting in new self-similar Gaussian fields with stationary rectangular increments that differ from the FBs. We analyze the local regularity properties of these fields and introduce a new concept of regularity through the definition of Weighted Tensorized Besov Spaces. These spaces combine aspects of mixed dominating smoothness spaces and hyperbolic Besov spaces, which are similar in structure to classical Besov spaces. We provide a detailed characterization of these spaces using Littlewood-Paley theory and hyperbolic wavelet analysis.</description>

      <title>TASEP with a general initial condition and a deterministically moving wall</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the totally asymmetric simple exclusion process (TASEP) on $\mathbb{Z}$ with a general initial condition and a deterministically moving wall in front of the particles. Using colour-position symmetry, we express the one-point distributions in terms of particle positions in a TASEP with step initial condition along a space-like path.
  Based on this formula, we analyse the large-time asymptotics of the model under various scenarios. For initial conditions other than the step initial condition, we identify a distinct asymptotic behaviour at the boundary of the region influenced by the wall, differing from the observations made in [Borodin-Bufetov-Ferrari'24] and [Ferrari-Gernholt'24]. Furthermore, we demonstrate that product limit distributions are associated with shocks in the macroscopic empirical density.
  As a special case of our starting formula, we derive a variational expression for the one-point distributions of TASEP with arbitrary initial data. Focusing on non-random initial conditions, such as periodic ones with an arbitrary density, we leverage our analytical tools to characterise the limit distribution within the framework of particle positions.</description>

      <title>Critical first passage percolation on random graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1999, Zhang proved that, for first passage percolation on the square lattice $\mathbb{Z}^2$ with i.i.d. non-negative edge weights, if the probability that the passage time distribution of an edge $P(t_e = 0) =1/2 $, the critical value for bond percolation on $\mathbb{Z}^2$, then the passage time from the origin $0$ to the boundary of $[-n,n]^2$ may converge to $\infty$ or stay bounded depending on the nature of the distribution of $t_e$ close to zero. In 2017, Damron, Lam, and Wang gave an easily checkable necessary and sufficient condition for the passage time to remain bounded. Concurrently, there has been tremendous growth in the study of weak and strong disorder on random graph models. Standard first passage percolation with strictly positive edge weights provides insight in the weak disorder regime. Critical percolation on such graphs provides information on the strong disorder (namely the minimal spanning tree) regime.
  Here we consider the analogous problem of Zhang but now for a sequence of random graphs $\{G_n:n\geq 1\}$ generated by a supercritical configuration model with a fixed degree distribution. Let $p_c$ denote the associated critical percolation parameter, and suppose each edge $e\in E(G_n)$ has weight $t_e \sim p_c \delta_0 +(1-p_c)\delta_{F_\zeta}$ where $F_\zeta$ is the cdf of a random variable $\zeta$ supported on $(0,\infty)$. The main question of interest is: when does the passage time between two randomly chosen vertices have a limit in distribution in the large network $n\to \infty$ limit? There are interesting similarities between the answers on $\mathbb{Z}^2$ and on random graphs, but it is easier for the passage times on random graphs to stay bounded.</description>

      <title>On intermediate levels of nested occupancy scheme in random environment generated by stick-breaking: the case of heavy tails</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03450v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a nested balls-in-boxes scheme in a random environment. The boxes follow a nested hierarchy, with infinitely many boxes in each level, and the hitting probabilities of boxes are random and obtained by iterated fragmentation of a unit mass. The hitting probabilities of the first-level boxes are given by a stick-breaking model $P_k = W_1 W_2\cdot \ldots\cdot W_{k-1}(1- W_k)$ for $k \in \mathbb{N}$, where $W_1$, $W_2,\ldots$ are independent copies of a random variable $W$ taking values in $(0,1)$. The infinite balls-in-boxes scheme in the first level is known as a Bernoulli sieve. We assume that the mean of $|\log W|$ is infinite and the distribution tail of $|\log W|$ is regularly varying at $\infty$. Denote by $K_n(j)$ the number of occupied boxes in the $j$th level provided that there are $n$ balls and call the level $j$ intermediate, if $j = j_n \to \infty$ and $j_n = o((\log n)^a)$ as $n \to \infty$ for appropriate $a&gt;0$. We prove that, for some intermediate levels $j$, finite-dimensional distributions of the process $(K_n(\lfloor j_n u\rfloor))_{u&gt;0}$, properly normalized, converge weakly as $n\to\infty$ to those of a pathwise Lebesgue-Stieltjes integral, with the integrand being an exponential function and the integrator being an inverse stable subordinator. The present paper continues the line of investigation initiated in the articles Buraczewski, Dovgay and Iksanov (2020) and Iksanov, Marynych and Samoilenko (2022) in which the random variable $|\log W|$ has a finite second moment, and Iksanov, Marynych and Rashytov (2022) in which $|\log W|$ has a finite mean and an infinite second moment.</description>

      <title>Near-optimal shattering in the Ising pure p-spin and rarity of solutions returned by stable algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03511v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that in the Ising pure $p$-spin model of spin glasses, shattering takes place at all inverse temperatures $\beta \in (\sqrt{(2 \log p)/p}, \sqrt{2\log 2})$ when $p$ is sufficiently large as a function of $\beta$. Of special interest is the lower boundary of this interval which matches the large $p$ asymptotics of the inverse temperature marking the hypothetical dynamical transition predicted in statistical physics. We show this as a consequence of a `soft' version of the overlap gap property which asserts the existence of a distance gap of points of typical energy from a typical sample from the Gibbs measure. We further show that this latter property implies that stable algorithms seeking to return a point of at least typical energy are confined to an exponentially rare subset of that super-level set, provided that their success probability is not vanishingly small.</description>

      <title>On ergodic properties of stochastic PDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note we review several situations in which stochastic PDEs exhibit ergodic properties. We begin with the basic dissipative conditions, as stated by Da Prato and Zabczyk in their classical monograph. Then we describe the singular case of SPDEs with reflection. Next we move to some degenerate (and thus more demanding) settings. Namely we recall some results obtained around 2006, concerning stochastic Navier-Stokes equations with a very degenerate noise. We finish the article by handling some cases with degenerate coefficients. This includes a new result about the parabolic Anderson model in dimension $d\ge 3$, driven by a general class of noises and fairly general initial conditions. In this context, a phase transition is observed, expressed in terms of the noise intensity.</description>

      <title>Non-asymptotic entropic bounds for non-linear kinetic Langevin sampler with second-order splitting scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03560v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The problem of sampling according to the probability distribution minimizing a given free energy, using interacting particles unadjusted kinetic Langevin Monte Carlo, is addressed. In this setting, three sources of error arise, related to three parameters: the number of particles $N$, the discretization step size $h$, and the length of the trajectory $n$. The main result of the present work is a quantitative estimate of strong convergence in relative entropy, implying non-asymptotic bounds for the quadratic risk of Monte Carlo estimators for bounded observables. The numerical discretization scheme considered here is a second-order splitting method, as commonly used in practice. In addition to $N,h,n$, the dependency in the ambient dimension $d$ of the problem is also made explicit, under suitable conditions. The main results are proven under general conditions (regularity, moments, log-Sobolev inequality), for which tractable conditions are then provided. In particular, a Lyapunov analysis is conducted under more general conditions than previous works; the nonlinearity may not be small and it may not be convex along linear interpolations between measures.</description>

      <title>Harnessing Multiple Correlated Networks for Exact Community Recovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02796v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of learning latent community structure from multiple correlated networks, focusing on edge-correlated stochastic block models with two balanced communities. Recent work of Gaudio, R\'acz, and Sridhar (COLT 2022) determined the precise information-theoretic threshold for exact community recovery using two correlated graphs; in particular, this showcased the subtle interplay between community recovery and graph matching. Here we study the natural setting of more than two graphs. The main challenge lies in understanding how to aggregate information across several graphs when none of the pairwise latent vertex correspondences can be exactly recovered. Our main result derives the precise information-theoretic threshold for exact community recovery using any constant number of correlated graphs, answering a question of Gaudio, R\'acz, and Sridhar (COLT 2022). In particular, for every $K \geq 3$ we uncover and characterize a region of the parameter space where exact community recovery is possible using $K$ correlated graphs, even though (1) this is information-theoretically impossible using any $K-1$ of them and (2) none of the latent matchings can be exactly recovered.</description>

      <title>Quantitative convergence of trained quantum neural networks to a Gaussian process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03182v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study quantum neural networks where the generated function is the expectation value of the sum of single-qubit observables across all qubits. In [Girardi \emph{et al.}, arXiv:2402.08726], it is proven that the probability distributions of such generated functions converge in distribution to a Gaussian process in the limit of infinite width for both untrained networks with randomly initialized parameters and trained networks. In this paper, we provide a quantitative proof of this convergence in terms of the Wasserstein distance of order $1$. First, we establish an upper bound on the distance between the probability distribution of the function generated by any untrained network with finite width and the Gaussian process with the same covariance. This proof utilizes Stein's method to estimate the Wasserstein distance of order $1$. Next, we analyze the training dynamics of the network via gradient flow, proving an upper bound on the distance between the probability distribution of the function generated by the trained network and the corresponding Gaussian process. This proof is based on a quantitative upper bound on the maximum variation of a parameter during training. This bound implies that for sufficiently large widths, training occurs in the lazy regime, \emph{i.e.}, each parameter changes only by a small amount.

      <title>Nonparametric Filtering, Estimation and Classification using Neural Jump ODEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03271v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural Jump ODEs model the conditional expectation between observations by neural ODEs and jump at arrival of new observations. They have demonstrated effectiveness for fully data-driven online forecasting in settings with irregular and partial observations, operating under weak regularity assumptions. This work extends the framework to input-output systems, enabling direct applications in online filtering and classification. We establish theoretical convergence guarantees for this approach, providing a robust solution to $L^2$-optimal filtering. Empirical experiments highlight the model's superior performance over classical parametric methods, particularly in scenarios with complex underlying distributions. These results emphasise the approach's potential in time-sensitive domains such as finance and health monitoring, where real-time accuracy is crucial.</description>

      <title>Turnover of investment portfolio via covariance matrix of returns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03305v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An investment portfolio consists of $n$ algorithmic trading strategies, which generate vectors of positions in trading assets. Sign opposite trades (buy/sell) cross each other as strategies are combined in a portfolio. Then portfolio turnover becomes a non linear function of strategies turnover. It rises a problem of effective (quick and precise) portfolio turnover estimation. Kakushadze and Liew (2014) shows how to estimate turnover via covariance matrix of returns. We build a mathematical model for such estimations; prove a theorem which gives a necessary condition for model applicability; suggest new turnover estimations; check numerically the preciseness of turnover estimations for algorithmic strategies on USA equity market.</description>

      <title>Multi-Action Restless Bandits with Weakly Coupled Constraints: Simultaneous Learning and Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03326v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a system with finitely many groups of multi-action bandit processes, each of which is a Markov decision process (MDP) with finite state and action spaces and potentially different transition matrices when taking different actions. The bandit processes of the same group share the same state and action spaces and, given the same action that is taken, the same transition matrix. All the bandit processes across various groups are subject to multiple weakly coupled constraints over their state and action variables. Unlike the past studies that focused on the offline case, we consider the online case without assuming full knowledge of transition matrices and reward functions a priori and propose an effective scheme that enables simultaneous learning and control. We prove the convergence of the relevant processes in both the timeline and the number of the bandit processes, referred to as the convergence in the time and the magnitude dimensions. Moreover, we prove that the relevant processes converge exponentially fast in the magnitude dimension, leading to exponentially diminishing performance deviation between the proposed online algorithms and offline optimality.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03380v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider a general partially observed diffusion model with periodic coefficients and with non-degenerate diffusion component. The coefficients of such a model depend on an unknown (static and deterministic) parameter which needs to be estimated based on the observed component of the diffusion process. We show that, under a minimal assumption of identifiability, and given enough regularity of the diffusion coefficients, a maximum likelihood estimator of the unknown parameter converges to the true parameter value as the sample size grows to infinity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03405v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by dynamic risk measures and conditional $g$-expectations, in this work we propose a numerical method to approximate the solution operator given by a Backward Stochastic Differential Equation (BSDE). The main ingredients for this are the Wiener chaos decomposition and the classical Euler scheme for BSDEs. We show convergence of this scheme under very mild assumptions, and provide a rate of convergence in more restrictive cases. We then implement it using neural networks, and we present several numerical examples where we can check the accuracy of the method.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03469v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the scattering for the energy-subcritical stochastic nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation (SNLS) with additive noise. In particular, we examine the long-time behavior of solutions associated with the noise $\phi(x)g(t,\omega)dB(t,\omega)$ formed by a Schwartz function $\phi$, and an adapted process $g(t,\omega)$ satisfying certain decay. Essentially, the aim of the current paper is to prove almost sure scattering in the spaces $L^2$ and the pseudo-conformal space $\Sigma$ for an initial data in $\Sigma$; also in $H^1$ for an initial data in $H^1$.</description>

      <title>A sharp version of Talagrand's selector process conjecture and an application to rounding fractional covers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03540v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Expectation thresholds arise from a class of integer linear programs (LPs) that are fundamental to the study of thresholds in large random systems. An avenue towards estimating expectation thresholds comes from the fractional relaxation of these integer LPs, which yield the fractional expectation thresholds. Regarding the gap between the integer LPs and their fractional relaxations, Talagrand made a bold conjecture, that the integral and fractional expectation thresholds are within a constant factor of each other. In other words, any small fractional solution can be ``rounded''.
  In this paper, we prove a strong upper bound on the expectation threshold starting from a fractional solution supported on sets with small size. In particular, this resolves Talagrand's conjecture for fractional solutions supported on sets with bounded size. Our key input for rounding the fractional solutions is a sharp version of Talagrand's selector process conjecture that is of independent interest.</description>

      <title>On a particle approximation to the Dean-Kawasaki type equation with logarithmic interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.11309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.11309v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Following the idea of intrinsic constructions of Brownian motions on the Wasserstein space, we construct a class of particle models whose fluctuating hydrodynamic limits, denoted as $p_t^\beta$, are solutions to the martingale problems of a class of Dean-Kawasaki type equations on $\mathbb{T}$ with logarithmic repulsive interactions depending on the inverse temperature $\beta$ and a new spectral approximation to the noise part, which approximately features Otto's metric in $\mathbb{P}(\mathbb{T})$. Specifically, we give a quantitative convergence rate of the particle approximation using the convexity of the logarithmic interaction. This allows us to identify a unique limit distribution only depending on $\beta$.
  As the inverse temperature rises, the regularizing effect of repulsive interactions becomes stronger. We prove that there exists three thresholds $0&lt;\lambda_0&lt;\lambda_1&lt;\lambda_2$ depending on the noise such that, when $\beta&gt;\lambda_0$, $p_t^\beta$ is a non-atomic measure process in $\mathbb{P}(\mathbb{T})$; when $\beta&gt;\lambda_1$, $p_t^\beta$ is absolutely continuous with respect to Lebesgue measure almost surely; when $\beta&gt;\lambda_2$, the expectation of the R\'enyi entropy of $p_t^\beta$ satisfies an exponential decay estimate.</description>

      <title>Local weak limit of dynamical inhomogeneous random graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.17437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.17437v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider dynamical graphs, namely graphs that evolve over time, and investigate a notion of local weak convergence that extends naturally the usual Benjamini-Schramm local weak convergence for static graphs. One of the well-known results of Benjamini-Schramm local weak convergence is that of the inhomogeneous random graph $IRG_n(\kappa)$ on $n$ vertices with connection kernel $\kappa$. When the kernel satisfies the mild technical condition of being a graphical kernel, the $IRG_n(\kappa)$ converges locally in probability to the unimodular multi-type Poisson-Galton-Watson tree $MPGW(\kappa)$, see the book of van der Hofstad for a recent detailed exposure of this result. We extend this to dynamical settings, by introducing the dynamical inhomogeneous random graph $DIRG_n(\kappa,\beta)$, with connection kernel $\kappa$ and updating kernel $\beta$, and its limit the growth-and-segmentation multi-type Poisson-Galton-Watson tree $GSMPGW(\kappa,\beta)$. We obtain similarly the local limit of variation of our model, namely the vertex updating inhomogeneous random graph. Our framework provides a natural tool for the study of processes defined on these graphs, that evolve simultaneously as the graph itself and with local dynamics. We discuss briefly the case of the contact process, where we obtain a slight reinforcement of the results of Jacob, Linker and M\"{o}rters (see arXiv:1807.09863 and arXiv:2206.01073).</description>

      <title>First passage percolation, local uniqueness for interlacements and capacity of random walk</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.03880v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The study of first passage percolation (FPP) for the random interlacements model has been initiated in arXiv:2112.12096, where it is shown that on $\mathbb{Z}^d$, $d\geq 3$, the FPP distance is comparable to the graph distance with high probability. In this article, we give an asymptotically sharp lower bound on this last probability, which additionally holds on a large class of transient graphs with polynomial volume growth and polynomial decay of the Green function. When considering the interlacement set in the low-intensity regime, the previous bound is in fact valid throughout the near-critical phase. In low dimension, we also present two applications of this FPP result: sharp large deviation bounds on local uniqueness of random interlacements, and on the capacity of a random walk in a ball.</description>

Abstract: We establish a large deviation principle for the normalized excursion and bridge of an $\alpha$-stable L\'evy process without negative jumps, with $1&lt;\alpha&lt;2$. Based on this, we derive precise asymptotics for the tail distributions of functionals of the normalized excursion and bridge, in particular, the area and maximum functionals. We advocate the use of the Skorokhod M1 topology, rather than the more usual J1 topology, as we believe it is better suited to large deviation principles for L\'evy processes in general.</description>

      <title>Lozenge Tilings of a Hexagon and q-Racah Ensembles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.13407v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the limiting behavior of random lozenge tilings of the hexagon with a q-Racah weight as the size of the hexagon grows large. Based on the asymptotic behavior of the recurrence coefficients of the q-Racah polynomials, we give a new proof for the fact that that the height function for a random tiling concentrates near a deterministic limit shape and that the global fluctuations are described by the Gaussian Free Field. These results were recently proved using (dynamic) loop equation techniques. In this paper we extend the recurrence coefficient approach that was developed for (dynamic) orthogonal polynomial ensembles to the setting of q-orthogonal polynomials. An interesting feature is that the complex structure is easily found from the limiting behavior of the (explicitly known) recurrence coefficients. A particular motivation for studying this model is that the variational characterization of the limiting height function has an inhomogeneous term. The study of the regularity properties of the minimizer for general variation problems with such inhomogeuous terms is a challenging open problem. We show that, in a general setup, the variational problem gives rise to a natural complex structure that is associated to the same Beltrami equation as in the homogeneous situation. We also derive a relation between the complex structure and the complex slope. In case of the q-Racah weighting of lozenge tilings of the hexagon, our representation of the limit shape and their fluctuations in terms of the recurrence coefficients allows us to verify this relation explicitly.</description>

      <title>The random periodic solutions for McKean-Vlasov stochastic differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17242v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study well-posedness of random periodic solutions of stochastic differential equations (SDEs) of McKean-Vlasov type driven by a two-sided Brownian motion, where the random periodic behaviour is characterised by the equations' long-time behaviour. Given the well-known connection between McKean-Vlasov SDEs and interacting particle systems, we show propagation of chaos and that the key properties of the interacting particle systems recover those of the McKean-Vlasov SDEs in the particle limit. All results in the present work are shown under two settings: fully and partially dissipative case. Each setting has its challenges and limitations. For instance, weakening full dissipativity to partial dissipativity demands stronger structural assumptions on the equations' dynamics and yields random periodic behaviour in the weak sense instead of pathwise sense (as in the full dissipativity case). The proof mechanisms are close but fundamentally different.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.16903v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a spatiotemporal self-exciting point process $(N_t(x))$, boundedly finite both over time $[0,\infty)$ and space $\mathscr X$, with excitation structure determined by a graphon $W$ on $\mathscr{X}^2$. This graphon Hawkes process generalizes both the multivariate Hawkes process and the Hawkes process on a countable network, and despite being infinite-dimensional, it is surprisingly tractable. After proving existence, uniqueness and stability results, we show, both in the annealed and in the quenched case, that for compact, Euclidean $\mathscr X\subset\mathbb R^m$, any graphon Hawkes process can be obtained as the suitable limit of $d$-dimensional Hawkes processes $\tilde N^d$, as $d\to\infty$. Furthermore, in the stable regime, we establish an FLLN and an FCLT for our infinite-dimensional process on compact $\mathscr X\subset\mathbb R^m$, while in the unstable regime we prove divergence of $N_T(\mathscr X)/T$, as $T\to\infty$. Finally, we exploit a cluster representation to derive fixed-point equations for the Laplace functional of $N$, for which we set up a recursive approximation procedure. We apply these results to show that, starting with multivariate Hawkes processes $\tilde N^d_t$ converging to stable graphon Hawkes processes, the limits $d\to\infty$ and $t\to\infty$ commute.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18614v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we employ probabilistic techniques to derive sharp, explicit two-sided estimates for the heat kernel of the nonlocal kinetic operator $$ \Delta^{\alpha/2}_v + v \cdot \nabla_x, \quad \alpha \in (0, 2),\ (x,v)\in {\mathbb R}^{d}\times{\mathbb R}^d,$$ where $ \Delta^{\alpha/2}_v $ represents the fractional Laplacian acting on the velocity variable $v$. Additionally, we establish logarithmic gradient estimates with respect to both the spatial variable $x$ and the velocity variable $v$. In fact, the estimates are developed for more general non-symmetric stable-like operators, demonstrating explicit dependence on the lower and upper bounds of the kernel functions. These results, in particular, provide a solution to a fundamental problem in the study of \emph{nonlocal} kinetic operators.</description>

Abstract: For random compositions of independent and identically distributed measurable maps on a Polish space, we study the existence and finitude of absolutely continuous ergodic stationary probability measures (which are, in particular, physical measures) whose basins of attraction cover the whole space almost everywhere. We characterize and hierarchize such random maps in terms of their associated Markov operators, as well as show the difference between classes in the hierarchy by plenty of examples, including additive noise, multiplicative noise, and iterated function systems. We also provide sufficient practical conditions for a random map to belong to these classes. For instance, we establish that any continuous random map on a compact Riemannian manifold with absolutely continuous transition probability has finitely many physical measures whose basins of attraction cover Lebesgue almost all the manifold.</description>

Abstract: Since the famous paper written by Kaplan and Meier in 1958, survival analysis has become one of the most important fields in statistics. Nowadays it is one of the most important statistical tools in analyzing epidemiological and clinical data including COVID-19 pandemic. This article reviews some of the most celebrated and important results and methods, including consistency, asymptotic normality, bias and variance estimation, in survival analysis and the treatment is parallel to the monograph Statistical Models Based on Counting Processes. Other models and results such as semi-Markov models and the Turnbull's estimator that jump out of the classical counting process martingale framework are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Consistent least squares estimation in population-size-dependent branching processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.10898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.10898v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive the first conditionally consistent estimators for a class of parametric Markov population models with logistic growth, which are suitable for modelling endangered populations in restricted habitats with a carrying capacity. We focus on discrete-time parametric population-size-dependent branching processes, for which we propose a new class of weighted least-squares estimators based on a single trajectory of population size counts. We establish the consistency and asymptotic normality of our estimators, conditional on non-extinction up to time $n$, as $n\to\infty$. Since Markov population models with a carrying capacity become extinct almost surely under general conditions, our proofs rely on arguments distinct from those in the existing literature.
  Our results are motivated by conservation biology, where endangered populations are often studied precisely because they are still alive, leading to an observation bias. Through simulated examples, we show that our conditionally consistent estimators generally reduce this bias for key quantities such as a habitat's carrying capacity. We apply our methodology to estimate the carrying capacity of the Chatham Island black robin, a population reduced to a single breeding female in the 1970's, which has since recovered but has yet to reach the island's carrying capacity.</description>

      <title>First-order Sobolev spaces, self-similar energies and energy measures on the Sierpi\'{n}ski carpet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.06232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.06232v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct and investigate $(1, p)$-Sobolev space, $p$-energy, and the corresponding $p$-energy measures on the planar Sierpi\'{n}ski carpet for all $p \in (1, \infty)$. Our method is based on the idea of Kusuoka and Zhou [Probab. Theory Related Fields $\textbf{93}$ (1992), no. 2, 169--196], where Brownian motion (the case $p = 2$) on self-similar sets including the planar Sierpi\'{n}ski carpet were constructed. Similar to this earlier work, we use a sequence of discrete graph approximations and the corresponding discrete $p$-energies to define the Sobolev space and $p$-energies. However, we need a new approach to ensure that our $(1, p)$-Sobolev space has a dense set of continuous functions when $p$ is less than the Ahlfors regular conformal dimension. The new ingredients are the use of Loewner type estimates on combinatorial modulus to obtain Poincar\'e inequality and elliptic Harnack inequality on a sequence of approximating graphs. An important feature of our Sobolev space is the self-similarity of our $p$-energy, which allows us to define corresponding $p$-energy measures on the planar Sierpi\'{n}ski carpet. We show that our Sobolev space can also be viewed as a Korevaar-Schoen type space. We apply our results to the attainment problem for Ahlfors regular conformal dimension of the Sierpi\'{n}ski carpet. In particular, we show that if the Ahlfors regular conformal dimension, say $\dim_{\mathrm{ARC}}$, is attained, then any optimal measure which attains $\dim_{\mathrm{ARC}}$ should be comparable with the $\dim_{\mathrm{ARC}}$-energy measure of some function in our $(1, \dim_{\mathrm{ARC}})$-Sobolev space up to a multiplicative constant. In this case, we also prove that the Newton-Sobolev space corresponding to any optimal measure and metric can be identified as our self-similar $(1, \dim_{\mathrm{ARC}})$-Sobolev space.</description>

      <title>Longest subsequence for certain repeated up/down patterns in random permutations avoiding a pattern of length three</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11482v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $S_n$ denote the set of permutations of $[n]$ and let $\sigma=\sigma_1\cdots\sigma_n\in S_n$. For a subsequence $\{\sigma_{i_j}\}_{j=1}^k$ of $\{\sigma_i\}_{i=1}^n$ of length $k\ge2$, construct
  the ``up/down'' sequence $V_1\cdots V_{k-1}$ defined by $$ V_j=\begin{cases} U,\ \text{if}\ \sigma_{i_j+1}-\sigma_{i_j}&gt;0;\\ D,\ \text{if}\ \sigma_{i_j+1}-\sigma_{i_j}&lt;0.\end{cases} $$ Consider now a fixed up/down pattern: $V_1\cdots V_l$, where $l\in\mathbb{N}$ and $V_j\in\{U, D\},\ j\in[l]$. Given a permutation $\sigma\in S_n$, consider the length of the longest subsequence of $\sigma$ that repeats this pattern.
  For example, consider $l=3$ and $V_1V_2V_3=UUD$. Then for the permutation $342617985\in S_9$, the length of the longest subsequence that repeats the pattern $UUD$ is 7; it is obtained by 3461798 and 3461785.
  The above framework includes two well-known cases. The pattern $U$ is the celebrated case of the longest increasing subsequence. The pattern $UD$ (or $DU$) is the case of the longest alternating subsequence. These have been studied both under the uniform distribution on $S_n$ as well as under the uniform distribution on those permutations in $S_n$ which avoid a particular pattern of length three.
  In this paper, we consider the patterns $UUD$ and $UUUD$ under the uniform distribution on those permutations in $S_n$ which avoid the pattern $132$. We prove that the expected value of the longest increasing subsequence following the pattern $UUD$ is asymptotic to $\frac37n$ and the expected value of the longest increasing subsequence following the pattern $UUUD$ is asymptotic to $\frac4{11}n$. (For $UD$ (alternating subsequences) it is known to be $\frac12n$.) This leads directly to appropriate corresponding results for permutations avoiding any particular pattern of length three.</description>

      <title>Finding the nonnegative minimal solutions of Cauchy PDEs in a volatility-stabilized market</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13558v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The strong relative arbitrage problem in Stochastic Portfolio Theory seeks to generate an investment strategy that almost surely outperforms a benchmark portfolio at the end of a given time horizon. The highest relative return in relative arbitrage opportunities is characterized by the smallest nonnegative continuous solution of a Cauchy problem for a partial differential equation (PDE). However, solving this type of PDE poses analytical and numerical challenges, due to the high dimensionality and its non-unique solutions. In this paper, we discuss numerical methods to address the relative arbitrage problem and the associated PDE in a volatility-stabilized market, using time-changed Bessel bridges. We present a practical algorithm and demonstrate numerical results through an example in volatility-stabilized markets.</description>
