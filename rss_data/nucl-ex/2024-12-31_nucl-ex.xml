      <title>QCD sum rule approach to Okamoto-Nolen-Schiffer anomaly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19851v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A new framework is introduced to connect between a charge symmetry breaking (CSB) energy density functional (EDF) and the low-energy constants derived from quantum chromodynamics (QCD). By constructing a QCD-based CSB EDF, this method provides new insights into the Okamoto-Nolen-Schiffer anomaly, a long-standing puzzle in the energy differences of mirror nuclei that lacks a robust microscopic explanation. Using examples such as $ {}^{17} \mathrm{F} $-$ {}^{17} \mathrm{O} $, $ {}^{15} \mathrm{O} $-$ {}^{15} \mathrm{N} $, $ {}^{41} \mathrm{Sc} $-$ {}^{41} \mathrm{Ca} $, and $ {}^{39} \mathrm{Ca} $-$ {}^{39} \mathrm{K} $, we demonstrate that the proposed interaction effectively resolves the anomaly within the range of theoretical uncertainties.</description>

      <title>Comparison study of counting and fitting methods in search for neutrinoless double beta decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19859v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the search for neutrinoless double beta decay ($0\nu\beta\beta$) experiments, common methods for sensitivity calculations include the counting method and the spectrum fitting method. This research compares their difference in sensitivity under various energy resolutions. Additionally, the performance of high and low Q-value $0\nu\beta\beta$ isotopes is compared. The results of this research could provide guidance on the choice of methods for sensitivity calculations, energy resolution and $0\nu\beta\beta$ isotopes for future $0\nu\beta\beta$ experiments.</description>

      <title>Moments to All Orders from Lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19862v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the traditional moments approach in lattice QCD, based on operator product expansion (OPE), can be realized in a way that avoids power divergent mixings, and thus allows to extract moments order by order, to all orders in principle. We propose to use momentum instead of distance as a leverage to extract moments at a given order. Moreover, by utilizing symmetry of the lattice matrix elements, we can determine the even and odd moments separately. As a demonstrative example, we determine the first three moments beyond the tensor charge gT of the isovector quark transversity distribution in the nucleon.</description>

      <title>The Felsenkeller shallow-underground laboratory for nuclear astrophysics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19874v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the Felsenkeller shallow-underground site, protected from cosmic muons by a 45 m thick rock overburden, a research laboratory including a 5 MV Pelletron ion accelerator and a number of radioactivity-measurement setups is located. The laboratory and its installations are described in detail. The background radiation has been studied, finding suppression factors of 40 for cosmic-ray muons, 200 for ambient neutrons, and 100 for the background in germanium $\gamma$-ray detectors. Using an additional active muon veto, typically the background is just twice as high as in very deep underground laboratories. The properties of the accelerator including its external and internal ion sources and beam line are given. For the radioactivity counting setup, detection limits in the 10$^{-4}$ Bq range have been obtained. Practical aspects for the usage of the laboratory by outside scientific users are discussed.</description>

      <title>Pion fragmentation functions from a quark-jet model in a functional approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19907v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The elementary fragmentation function that describes the process $q\to \pi$ is predicted applying crossing and charge symmetry to the cut diagram of the pion valence quark distribution function. This elementary probability distribution defines the ladder-kernel of a quark jet fragmentation equation, which is solved self-consistently to obtain the full pion fragmentation function. The hadronization into a pion employs the complete Poincar\'e invariant Bethe-Salpeter wave function, though the overwhelming contribution to the fragmentation function is due the leading Bethe-Salpeter amplitude. Compared to a Nambu--Jona-Lasinio model prediction, the fragmentation function we obtain is enhanced in the range $z \lesssim 0.8$ but otherwise in good qualitative agreement. The full pion fragmentation function is overall greater than the elementary fragmentation function below $z\lesssim 0.6$.</description>

      <title>Machine learning orbital-free density functional theory: taming quantum shell effects in deformed nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20739v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate description of deformed atomic nuclei by the orbital-free density functional theory has been a longstanding textbook challenge, due to the difficulty in accounting for the intricate quantum shell effects that are present in such systems. Orbital-free density functional theory is, in principle, capable of describing all effects of nuclear systems, as guaranteed by the Hohenberg-Kohn theorem. However, from a microscopic perspective, shell and deformation effects are believed to be intrinsically connected to single-orbital structures, posing a significant challenge for orbital-free approaches. Here, we develop a machine learning approach to the orbital-free density functional theory, which is capable of achieving a high level of accuracy in describing the ground-state properties and potential energy curves for both spherical $^{16}$O and deformed $^{20}$Ne nuclei. This is the inaugural instance where a fully orbital-free energy density functional has succeeded in taming the complex shell effects in deformed nuclei. It demonstrates that the orbital-free energy density functional, which is directly based on the Hohenberg-Kohn theorem, is not only a theoretical concept but also a practical one for nuclear systems.</description>

      <title>Time modulation of weak nuclear decays as a probe of axion dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20932v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the time modulation of weak nuclear decays as a method to probe axion dark matter. To this end, we develop a theoretical framework to compute the $\theta$-dependence of weak nuclear decays, including electron capture and $\beta$ decay, which enables us to predict the time variation of weak radioactivity in response to an oscillating axion dark matter background. As an application, we recast old data sets, from the weak nuclear decays of ${^{40}\text{K}}$ and ${^{137}\text{Cs}}$ taken at the underground Gran Sasso Laboratory, in order to set constraints on the axion decay constant, specifically in the axion mass range from few $10^{-23}\;$eV up to $10^{-19}\;$eV. We finally propose a new measurement at the Gran Sasso Laboratory, based on the weak nuclear decay of ${^{40}\text{K}}$ via electron capture, in order to explore even shorter timescales, thus reaching sensitivities to axion masses up to $10^{-9}\;$eV.</description>

      <title>A Novel Approach to Neutrino-Hydrogen Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.08752</link>
      <description>arXiv:1809.08752v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The limited statistics of the available (anti)neutrino-hydrogen (H) interactions has been a longstanding impediment for high-energy neutrino physics. We discuss a practical way to achieve accurate (anti)neutrino-hydrogen measurements, addressing the principal limitations of earlier experiments. Interactions on hydrogen are extracted by subtracting measurements on thin dedicated graphite (pure C) and polypropylene (CH$_2$) targets within a highly segmented low-density detector. A kinematic selection is used to increase the purities to 80-95\% before subtraction. A statistics of ${\cal O}(10^6)$ can be realistically achieved in modern neutrino beams for the various $\nu(\bar \nu)$-H event topologies. The availability of such samples would allow a precise determination of neutrino and antineutrino fluxes, as well as to directly constrain nuclear effects from a comparison with corresponding measurements on heavy materials within the same detector. The (anti)neutrino fluxes and the nuclear smearing are typically the leading sources of systematic uncertainties in long-baseline oscillation experiments. (Anti)neutrino-hydrogen interactions also provide an ideal tool for a wide range of precision tests of fundamental interactions.</description>

      <title>Estimating Longitudinal Polarization of $\Lambda$ and $\bar{\Lambda}$ Hyperons at Relativistic Energies using Hydrodynamic and Transport models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15138v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The global and local polarization measurements of $\Lambda$ ($\bar{\Lambda}$) hyperons by STAR and ALICE Collaborations open up an immense interest in investigating the polarization dynamics in heavy-ion collisions. Recent studies suggest the transverse component of the vorticity field is responsible for the global spin polarization, while the longitudinal component of the vorticity field accounts for the local polarization. The local polarization of $\Lambda$-hyperons arises due to the anisotropic flows in the transverse plane, indicating a quadrupole pattern of the longitudinal vorticity along the beam direction. We derive a simple solution relating the longitudinal mean spin vector with the second-order anisotropic flow coefficient due to the thermal shear for an ideal uncharged fluid in a longitudinal boost invariant scenario. The present study focuses on the local (longitudinal) polarization of $\Lambda$ and $\bar{\Lambda}$ in Au$+$Au and Pb$+$Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV and 5.02 TeV, respectively. Further, we explore the azimuthal angle, centrality, and transverse momentum ($p_{\rm T}$) dependence study of longitudinal polarization using hydrodynamic and transport models. All these models predict a maximum longitudinal polarization in mid-central collisions around 30-50 \% centrality at $p_{\rm T} \approx$ 2.0 - 3.0 GeV/c. These findings on longitudinal polarization advocate the existence of a thermal medium in non-central heavy-ion collisions.</description>

      <title>Chiral perturbation theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21912v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the limit of vanishing up, down and strange quark masses, QCD exhibits a chiral symmetry. This symmetry is broken spontaneously to its vector subgroup, giving rise to Goldstone bosons. These acquire a small mass through the explicit chiral symmetry breaking for non-vanishing quark masses. The consequences of these broken symmetries can be investigated in a suitably tailored effective field theory called chiral pertubation theory. It admits a perturbative expansion in the external momenta and the Goldstone boson masses and can be systematically analyzed in terms of a loop expansion. The appearing ultraviolet divergences in loop diagrams can be dealt with order-by-order through the Goldstone boson contact interactions. Matter fields like the lowest-lying baryons can also included, leading to a rich and testable phenomenology of low-energy QCD.</description>
