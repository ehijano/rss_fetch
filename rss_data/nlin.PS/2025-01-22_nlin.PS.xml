      <title>Variational approach to multimode nonlinear optical fibers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the spatiotemporal solitary waves of a graded-index multimode optical fiber with a parabolic transverse index profile. Using the nonpolynomial Schr\"odinger equation approach, we derive an effective one-dimensional Lagrangian associated with the Laguerre-Gauss modes with a generic radial mode number p and azimuthal index m. We show that the form of the equations of motion for any Laguerre-Gauss mode is particularly simple, and we derive the critical power for the collapse for every mode. By solving the nonpolynomial Schr\"odinger equation, we provide a comparison of the stationary mode profiles in the radial and temporal coordinates.</description>

      <title>Localized stem structures in quasi-resonant solutions of the Kadomtsev-Petviashvili equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11287v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When the phase shift of X-shaped solutions before and after interaction is finite but approaches infinity, the vertices of the two V-shaped structures become separated due to the phase shift and are connected by a localized structure. This special type of elastic collision is known as a quasi-resonant collision, and the localized structure is referred to as the stem structure. This study investigates quasi-resonant solutions and the associated localized stem structures in the context of the KPII and KPI equations. For the KPII equation, we classify quasi-resonant 2-solitons into weakly and strongly types, depending on whether the parameter \(a_{12} \approx 0\) or \(+\infty\). We analyze their asymptotic forms to detail the trajectories, amplitudes, velocities, and lengths of their stem structures. These results of quasi-resonant 2-solitons are used to to provide analytical descriptions of interesting patterns of the water waves observed on Venice Beach. Similarly, for the KPI equation, we construct quasi-resonant breather-soliton solutions and classify them into weakly and strongly types, based on whether the parameters \(\alpha_1^2 + \beta_1^2 \approx 0\) or \(+\infty\) (equivalent to \(a_{13} \approx 0\) or \(+\infty\)). We compare the similarities and differences between the stem structures in the quasi-resonant soliton and the quasi-resonant breather-soliton. Additionally, we provide a comprehensive and rigorous analysis of their asymptotic forms and stem structures. Our results indicate that the resonant solution, i.e. resonant breather-soliton of the KPI and soliton for the KPII, represents the limiting case of the quasi-resonant solution as \(\epsilon \to 0\).</description>

      <title>Localized stem structures in soliton reconnection of the asymmetric Nizhnik-Novikov-Veselov system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11285v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The reconnection processes of 3-solitons with 2-resonance can produce distinct local structures that initially connect two pairs of V-shaped branches, then disappear, and later re-emerge as new forms. We call such local structures as stem structures. In this paper, we investigate the variable-length stem structures during the soliton reconnection of the asymmetric Nizhnik-Novikov-Veselov system. We consider two scenarios: weak 2-resonances (i.e., $a_{12}=a_{13}=0,\,0&lt;a_{23}&lt;+\infty$) and strong 2-resonances (i.e., $a_{12}=a_{13}=+\infty,\,0&lt;a_{23}&lt;+\infty$). We determine the asymptotic forms of the four arms and their corresponding stem structures using two-variable asymptotic analysis method which is involved simultaneously with one space variable $y$ (or $x$) and one temporal variable $t$. Different from known studies, our findings reveal that the asymptotic forms of the arms $S_2$ and $S_3$ differ by a phase shift as $t\to\pm\infty$. Building on these asymptotic forms, we perform a detailed analysis of the trajectories, amplitudes, and velocities of the soliton arms and stem structures. Subsequently, we discuss the localization of the stem structures, focusing on their endpoints, lengths, and extreme points in both weak and strong 2-resonance scenarios.</description>

      <title>Explosive opinion spreading with polarization and depolarization via asymmetric perception</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11863v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Polarization significantly influences societal divisions across economic, political, religious, and ideological lines. Understanding these mechanisms is key to devising strategies to mitigate such divisions and promote depolarization. Our study examines how asymmetric opinion perception, modeled through nonlinear incidence terms, affects polarization and depolarization within structured communities. We demonstrate that such asymmetry leads to explosive polarization and causes a hysteresis effect responsible for abrupt depolarization. We develop a mean-field approximation to explain how nonlinear incidence results in first-order phase transitions and the nature of bifurcations. This approach also helps in understanding how opinions polarize according to underlying social network communities and how these phenomena intertwine with the nature of such transitions. Numerical simulations corroborate the analytical findings.</description>

      <title>Topological and nonlinearity-induced thermalization in a PT-symmetric split-Langevin bath</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.06744</link>
      <description>arXiv:1807.06744v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Open classical systems with balanced, separated gain and loss, called PT-symmetric systems, have been extensively studied over the past decade. Here, we investigate the properties of a uniform, harmonic chain with spatially separated viscous loss and stochastic gain that are only statistically balanced. We show that such a "split Langevin" bath leads to either the absence of thermalization or non-equilibrium steady states with inhomogeneous temperature profile, both of which are understood in terms of normal modes of the chain. With a Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) chain, a canonical model with topological edge modes, we show that the steady-state properties reflect the topological phase of the underlying chain. We also show that nonlinearity stabilizes the amplifying modes in a harmonic chain, thereby leading to thermalization irrespective of the gain and loss locations. Our results expand the pool of possible realizations of non-Hermitian models to the stochastic domain.</description>

      <title>Influence of density-dependent diffusion on pattern formation in a refuge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.11638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.11638v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate a nonlocal generalization of the Fisher-KPP equation, which incorporates logistic growth and diffusion, for a single species population in a viable patch (refuge). In this framework, diffusion plays an homogenizing role, while nonlocal interactions can destabilize the spatially uniform state, leading to the emergence of spontaneous patterns. Notably, even when the uniform state is stable, spatial perturbations, such as the presence of a refuge, can still induce patterns. These phenomena are well known for environments with constant diffusivity. Our goal is to investigate how the formation of winkles in the population distribution is affected when the diffusivity is density-dependent. Then, we explore scenarios in which diffusivity is sensitive to either rarefaction or overcrowding. We find that state-dependent diffusivity affects the shape and stability of the patterns, potentially leading to either explosive growth or fragmentation of the population distribution, depending on how diffusion reacts to changes in density.</description>

      <title>Gradient dynamics approach to reactive thin-film hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10295v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Wetting and dewetting dynamics of simple and complex liquids is described by kinetic equations in gradient dynamics form that incorporates the various coupled dissipative processes in a fully thermodynamically consistent manner. After briefly reviewing this, we also review how chemical reactions can be captured by a related gradient dynamics description, assuming detailed balanced mass action type kinetics. Then, we bring both aspects together and discuss mesoscopic reactive thin-film hydrodynamics illustrated by two examples, namely, models for reactive wetting and reactive surfactants. These models can describe the approach to equilibrium but may also be employed to study out-of-equilibrium chemo-mechanical dynamics. In the latter case, one breaks the gradient dynamics form by chemostatting to obtain active systems. In this way, for reactive wetting we recover running drops that are driven by chemically sustained wettability gradients and for drops covered by autocatalytic reactive surfactants we find complex forms of self-propulsion and self-excited oscillations.</description>
