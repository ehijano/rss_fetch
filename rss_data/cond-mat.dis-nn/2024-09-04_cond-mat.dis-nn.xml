      <title>Statistical mechanics for networks of real neurons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Perceptions and actions, thoughts and memories result from coordinated activity in hundreds or even thousands of neurons in the brain. It is an old dream of the physics community to provide a statistical mechanics description for these and other emergent phenomena of life. These aspirations appear in a new light because of developments in our ability to measure the electrical activity of the brain, sampling thousands of individual neurons simultaneously over hours or days. We review the progress that has been made in bringing theory and experiment together, focusing on maximum entropy methods and a phenomenological renormalization group. These approaches have uncovered new, quantitatively reproducible collective behaviors in networks of real neurons, and provide examples of rich parameter--free predictions that agree in detail with experiment.</description>

      <title>Localization at irrational fillings in the Aubry-Andr\'{e} model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We calculate the phase diagram of the Aubry-Andr\'{e} model as a function of filling and potential strength ($W$). We apply periodic boundary conditions and calculate the geometric Binder cumulant to determine the transition between the extended and localized phases. For rational fillings the phase transition occurs at $W=2t$ ($t$ denotes the hopping parameter), but spikes occur in the phase diagram at fillings which correspond to ratios of Fibonacci numbers. In the thermodynamic limit these ratios tend to specific irrational numbers, and $W \rightarrow 0$ at these fillings. We also calculate the phase diagram of an extended Aubry-Andr\'{e} model with second nearest neighbor hoppings. In addition to spikes, this phase diagram also exhibits discontinuities (jumps) at some of the irrational fillings at which the spikes occur.</description>

      <title>Random matrix ensemble for the covariance matrix of Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes with heterogeneous temperatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01262v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a random matrix model for the stationary covariance of multivariate Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes with heterogeneous temperatures, where the covariance is constrained by the Sylvester-Lyapunov equation. Using the replica method, we compute the spectral density of the equal-time covariance matrix characterizing the stationary states, demonstrating that this model undergoes a transition between stable and unstable states. In the stable regime, the spectral density has a finite and positive support, whereas negative eigenvalues emerge in the unstable regime. We determine the critical line separating these regimes and show that the spectral density exhibits a power-law tail at marginal stability, with an exponent independent of the temperature distribution. Additionally, we compute the spectral density of the lagged covariance matrix characterizing the stationary states of linear transformations of the original dynamical variables. Our random-matrix model is potentially interesting to understand the spectral properties of empirical correlation matrices appearing in the study of complex systems.</description>

      <title>Percolation in semicontinuum geometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00699v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study percolation problems of overlapping objects where the underlying geometry is such that in D-dimensions, a subset of the directions has a lattice structure, while the remaining directions have a continuum structure. The resulting semicontinuum problem describes the percolation of overlapping shapes in parallel layers or lanes with positional constraints for the placement of the objects along the discrete directions. Several semicontinuum percolation systems are analyzed like hypercuboids with a particular focus on 2D and 3D cases, disks, and parallelograms. Adapting the excluded volume arguments to the semicontinuum setting, we show that for the semicontinuum problem of hypercuboids, for fixed side-lengths of the hypercuboids along the directions in which a lattice structure is maintained, the percolation threshold is always independent of the side-lengths along the continuum directions. The result holds even when there is a distribution for the side-lengths along the continuum directions. Trends in the variation of the thresholds, as we vary the linear measure of the shapes along the continuum directions, are obtained for other semicontinuum models like disks and parallelograms in 2D. The results are compared with those of corresponding continuum and lattice models. For the 2D and 3D models considered, using Monte Carlo simulations, we verify the excluded volume predictions for the trends and numerical values of the percolation thresholds. Very good agreement is seen between the predicted numerical values and the simulation results. The semicontinuum setting also allows us to establish a connection between the percolation problem of overlapping shapes in 2D continuum and triangular lattice. We also verify that the isotropy of the threshold for anisotropic shapes and standard percolation universality class is maintained in the semicontinuum setting.</description>

      <title>The square lattice Ising model with quenched surface disorder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01434v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using exact enumeration, the Casimir amplitude and the Casimir force are calculated for the square lattice Ising model with quenched surface disorder on one surface in cylinder geometry at criticality. The system shape is characterized by the aspect ratio $\rho=L/M$, where the cylinder length $L$ can take arbitrary values, while the circumference $M$ is varied from $M=4$ to $M=54$, resulting in up to $2^{54}$ numerically exact free energy calculations. A careful $M\to\infty$ extrapolation shows that quenched surface disorder is irrelevant in two dimensions, but gives rise to logarithmic corrections.</description>

      <title>Can Geometric Quantum Machine Learning Lead to Advantage in Barcode Classification?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01496v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of distinguishing two vectors (visualized as images or barcodes) and learning if they are related to one another. For this, we develop a geometric quantum machine learning (GQML) approach with embedded symmetries that allows for the classification of similar and dissimilar pairs based on global correlations, and enables generalization from just a few samples. Unlike GQML algorithms developed to date, we propose to focus on symmetry-aware measurement adaptation that outperforms unitary parametrizations. We compare GQML for similarity testing against classical deep neural networks and convolutional neural networks with Siamese architectures. We show that quantum networks largely outperform their classical counterparts. We explain this difference in performance by analyzing correlated distributions used for composing our dataset. We relate the similarity testing with problems that showcase a proven maximal separation between the BQP complexity class and the polynomial hierarchy. While the ability to achieve advantage largely depends on how data are loaded, we discuss how similar problems can benefit from quantum machine learning.</description>

      <title>Connectivity structure and dynamics of nonlinear recurrent neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01969v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a theory to analyze how structure in connectivity shapes the high-dimensional, internally generated activity of nonlinear recurrent neural networks. Using two complementary methods -- a path-integral calculation of fluctuations around the saddle point, and a recently introduced two-site cavity approach -- we derive analytic expressions that characterize important features of collective activity, including its dimensionality and temporal correlations. To model structure in the coupling matrices of real neural circuits, such as synaptic connectomes obtained through electron microscopy, we introduce the random-mode model, which parameterizes a coupling matrix using random input and output modes and a specified spectrum. This model enables systematic study of the effects of low-dimensional structure in connectivity on neural activity. These effects manifest in features of collective activity, that we calculate, and can be undetectable when analyzing only single-neuron activities. We derive a relation between the effective rank of the coupling matrix and the dimension of activity. By extending the random-mode model, we compare the effects of single-neuron heterogeneity and low-dimensional connectivity. We also investigate the impact of structured overlaps between input and output modes, a feature of biological coupling matrices. Our theory provides tools to relate neural-network architecture and collective dynamics in artificial and biological systems.</description>

      <title>Improving Electrolyte Performance for Target Cathode Loading Using Interpretable Data-Driven Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01989v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Higher loading of active electrode materials is desired in batteries, especially those based on conversion reactions, for enhanced energy density and cost efficiency. However, increasing active material loading in electrodes can cause significant performance depreciation due to internal resistance, shuttling, and parasitic side reactions, which can be alleviated to a certain extent by a compatible design of electrolytes. In this work, a data-driven approach is leveraged to find a high-performing electrolyte formulation for a novel interhalogen battery custom to the target cathode loading. An electrolyte design consisting of 4 solvents and 4 salts is experimentally devised for a novel interhalogen battery based on a multi-electron redox reaction. The experimental dataset with variable electrolyte compositions and active cathode loading, is used to train a graph-based deep learning model mapping changing variables in the battery's material design to its specific capacity. The trained model is used to further optimize the electrolyte formulation compositions for enhancing the battery capacity at a target cathode loading by a two-fold approach: large-scale screening and interpreting electrolyte design principles for different cathode loadings. The data-driven approach is demonstrated to bring about an additional 20% increment in the specific capacity of the battery over capacities obtained from the experimental optimization.</description>

      <title>Highly complex novel critical behavior from the intrinsic randomness of quantum mechanical measurements on critical ground states -- a controlled renormalization group analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02107v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the effects of weak measurements on the quantum critical ground state of the one-dimensional (a) tricritical and (b) critical quantum Ising model, by measuring in (a) the local energy and in (b) the local spin operator in a lattice formulation. By employing a controlled renormalization group (RG) analysis we find that each problem exhibits highly complex novel scaling behavior, arising from the intrinsically indeterministic ('random') nature of quantum mechanical measurements, which is governed by a measurement-dominated RG fixed point that we study within an $\epsilon$ expansion. In the tricritical Ising case (a) we find (i): multifractal scaling behavior of energy and spin correlations in the measured groundstate, corresponding to an infinite hierarchy of independent critical exponents and, equivalently, to a continuum of universal scaling exponents for each of these correlations; (ii): the presence of logarithmic factors multiplying powerlaws in correlation functions, a hallmark of 'logarithmic conformal field theories' (CFT); (iii): universal 'effective central charges' $c^{({\rm eff})}_n$ for the prefactors of the logarithm of subsystem size of the $n$th R\'enyi entropies, which are independent of each other for different $n$, in contrast to the unmeasured critical ground state, and (iv): a universal ("Affleck-Ludwig") 'effective boundary entropy' $S_{\rm{eff}}$ which we show, quite generally, to be related to the system-size independent part of the Shannon entropy of the measurement record, computed explicitly here to 1-loop order. - A subset of these results have so-far also been obtained within the $\epsilon$ expansion for the measurement-dominated critical point in the critical Ising case (b).</description>

      <title>Honeybee-like collective decision making in a kilobot swarm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.15592v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Drawing inspiration from honeybee swarms' nest-site selection process, we assess the ability of a kilobot robot swarm to replicate this captivating example of collective decision-making. Honeybees locate the optimal site for their new nest by aggregating information about potential locations and exchanging it through their waggle-dance. The complexity and elegance of solving this problem relies on two key abilities of scout honeybees: self-discovery and imitation, symbolizing independence and interdependence, respectively. We employ a mathematical model to represent this nest-site selection problem and program our kilobots to follow its rules. Our experiments demonstrate that the kilobot swarm can collectively reach consensus decisions in a decentralized manner, akin to honeybees. However, the strength of this consensus depends not only on the interplay between independence and interdependence but also on critical factors such as swarm density and the motion of kilobots. These factors enable the formation of a percolated communication network, through which each robot can receive information beyond its immediate vicinity. By shedding light on this crucial layer of complexity --the crowding and mobility conditions during the decision-making--, we emphasize the significance of factors typically overlooked but essential to living systems and life itself.</description>

      <title>Exact finite-size scaling of the maximum likelihood spectra in the quenched and annealed Sherrington-Kirkpatrick spin glass</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14215v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fine resolution of the discrete eigenvalues at the spectral edge of an $N\times N$ random matrix is required in many applications. Starting from a finite-size scaling ansatz for the Stieltjes transform of the maximum likelihood spectrum, we demonstrate that the scaling function satisfies a first-order ODE of the Riccati type. Further transformation yields a linear second-order ODE for the characteristic function, whose nodes determine leading eigenvalues. Using this technique, we examine in detail the spectral crossover of the annealed Sherrington-Kirkpatrick (SK) spin glass model, where a gap develops below a critical temperature. Our analysis provides analytic predictions for the finite-size scaling of the spin condensation phenomenon in the annealed SK model, validated by Monte Carlo simulations. Deviation of scaling amplitudes from their predicted values is observed in the critical region due to eigenvalue fluctuations. More generally, rescaling the spectral axis, adjusted to the distance of neighboring eigenvalues, offers a powerful approach to handling singularities in the infinite size limit.</description>

      <title>Mechanisms underlying the response of mouse cortical networks to optogenetic manipulation</title>

      <description>arXiv:1907.00816v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: GABAergic interneurons can be subdivided into three subclasses: parvalbumin positive (PV), somatostatin positive (SOM) and serotonin positive neurons. With principal cells (PCs) they form complex networks. We examine PCs and PV responses in mouse anterior lateral motor cortex (ALM) and barrel cortex (S1) upon PV photostimulation in vivo. In layer 5, the PV response is paradoxical: photoexcitation reduces their activity. This is not the case in ALM layer 2/3. We combine analytical calculations and numerical simulations to investigate how these results constrain the architecture. Two-population models cannot account for the results. Networks with three inhibitory populations and V1-like architecture account for the data in ALM layer 2/3. Our data in layer 5 can be accounted for if SOM neurons receive inputs only from PCs and PV neurons. In both four-population models, the paradoxical effect implies not too strong recurrent excitation. It is not evidence for stabilization by inhibition.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2102.04368v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Complex networks are abundant in nature and many share an important structural property: they contain a few nodes that are abnormally highly connected (hubs). Some of these hubs are called influencers because they couple strongly to the network and play fundamental dynamical and structural roles. Strikingly, despite the abundance of networks with influencers, little is known about their response to stochastic forcing. Here, for oscillatory dynamics on influencer networks, we show that subjecting influencers to an optimal intensity of noise can result in enhanced network synchronization. This new network dynamical effect, which we call coherence resonance in influencer networks, emerges from a synergy between network structure and stochasticity and is highly nonlinear, vanishing when the noise is too weak or too strong. Our results reveal that the influencer backbone can sharply increase the dynamical response in complex systems of coupled oscillators.</description>

      <title>Controlling noise with self-organized resetting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.09307v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Biological systems often consist of a small number of constituents and are therefore inherently noisy. To function effectively, these systems must employ mechanisms to constrain the accumulation of noise. Such mechanisms have been extensively studied and comprise the constraint by external forces, nonlinear interactions, or the resetting of the system to a predefined state. Here, we propose a fourth paradigm for noise constraint: self-organized resetting, where the resetting rate and position emerge from self-organization through time-discrete interactions. We study general properties of self-organized resetting systems using the paradigmatic example of cooperative resetting, where random pairs of Brownian particles are reset to their respective average. We demonstrate that such systems undergo a delocalization phase transition, separating regimes of constrained and unconstrained noise accumulation. Additionally, we show that systems with self-organized resetting can adapt to external forces and optimize search behavior for reaching target values. Self-organized resetting has various applications in nature and technology, which we demonstrate in the context of sexual interactions in fungi and spatial dispersion in shared mobility services. This work opens routes into the application of self-organized resetting across various systems in biology and technology.</description>

      <title>Noise-induced phase transitions in hybrid quantum circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16631</link>

Abstract: The presence of quantum noises inherent to real physical systems can strongly impact the physics in hybrid quantum circuits with local random unitaries and mid-circuit measurements. The quantum noises with a size-independent occurring probability can lead to the disappearance of a measurement-induced entanglement phase transition and the emergence of a single area-law phase. In this work, we investigate the effects of quantum noises with size-dependent probabilities $q=p/L^{\alpha}$ where $\alpha$ represents the scaling exponent. We have identified a noise-induced entanglement phase transition from a volume law to a power (area) law in the presence (absence) of measurements as $p$ increases when $\alpha=1$. With the help of an effective statistical model, we reveal that the phase transition is of first-order arising from the competition between two types of spin configurations and shares the same analytical understanding as the noise-induced coding transition. This unified picture further deepens the understanding of the connection between entanglement behavior and the capacity of information protection. When $\alpha \neq 1$, one spin configuration always dominates regardless of $p$ and thus the phase transition disappears. Moreover, we highlight the difference between the effects of size-dependent bulk noise and boundary noises. We validate our analytical predictions with extensive numerical results from stabilizer circuit simulations.</description>

      <title>Interplay of network structure and talent configuration on wealth dynamics</title>

Abstract: The economic success of individuals is often determined by a combination of talent, luck, and assistance from others. We introduce a new agent-based model that simultaneously considers talent, luck, and social interaction. This model allows us to explore how network structure (how agents interact) and talent distribution among agents affect the dynamics of capital accumulation through analytical and numerical methods. We identify a phenomenon as ``talent configuration effect", which refers to the influence of how talent is allocated to individuals (nodes) in the network. We analyze this effect through two key properties: talent assortativity (TA) and talent-degree correlation (TD). In particular, we focus on three economic indicators: growth rate ($n_{\rm rate}$), Gini coefficient (inequality: $n_{\rm Gini}$), and meritocratic fairness ($n_{LT}$). This investigation helps us understand the interplay between talent configuration and network structure on capital dynamics. We find that, in the short term, positive correlations exist between TA and TD for all three economic indicators. Furthermore, the dominant factor influencing capital dynamics depends on the network topology. In scale-free networks, TD has a stronger influence on the economic indices than TA. Conversely, in lattice-like networks, TA plays a more significant role. Our findings address that high socioeconomic homophily can create a dilemma between growth and equality, and that hub monopolization by few highly talented agents makes economic growth strongly dependent on their performances.</description>

      <title>Towards a theory of how the structure of language is acquired by deep neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00048v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: How much data is required to learn the structure of a language via next-token prediction? We study this question for synthetic datasets generated via a Probabilistic Context-Free Grammar (PCFG) -- a tree-like generative model that captures many of the hierarchical structures found in natural languages. We determine token-token correlations analytically in our model and show that they can be used to build a representation of the grammar's hidden variables, the longer the range the deeper the variable. In addition, a finite training set limits the resolution of correlations to an effective range, whose size grows with that of the training set. As a result, a Language Model trained with increasingly many examples can build a deeper representation of the grammar's structure, thus reaching good performance despite the high dimensionality of the problem. We conjecture that the relationship between training set size and effective range of correlations holds beyond our synthetic datasets. In particular, our conjecture predicts how the scaling law for the test loss behaviour with training set size depends on the length of the context window, which we confirm empirically in Shakespeare's plays and Wikipedia articles.</description>

      <title>Networks with many structural scales: a Renormalization Group perspective</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19104v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Scale invariance profoundly influences the dynamics and structure of complex systems, spanning from critical phenomena to network architecture. Here, we propose a precise definition of scale-invariant networks by leveraging the concept of a constant entropy loss rate across scales in a renormalization-group coarse-graining setting. This framework enables us to differentiate between scale-free and scale-invariant networks, revealing distinct characteristics within each class. Furthermore, we offer a comprehensive inventory of genuinely scale-invariant networks, both natural and artificially constructed, demonstrating, e.g., that the human connectome exhibits notable features of scale invariance. Our findings open new avenues for exploring the scale-invariant structural properties crucial in biological and socio-technological systems.</description>

      <title>Distributions of consecutive level spacings of Gaussian unitary ensemble and their ratio: ab initio derivation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15704v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent studies of many-body localization in nonintegrable quantum systems, the distribution of the ratio of two consecutive energy level spacings, $r_n=(E_{n+1}-E_n)/(E_{n}-E_{n-1})$ or $\tilde{r}_n=\min(r_n,r_n^{-1})$, has been used as a measure to quantify the chaoticity, alternative to the more conventional distribution of the level spacings, $s_n=\bar{\rho}(E_n)(E_{n+1}-E_n)$, as the former makes unnecessary the unfolding required for the latter. Based on our previous work on the Tracy-Widom approach to the Janossy densities, we present analytic expressions for the joint probability distribution of two consecutive eigenvalue spacings and the distribution of their ratio for the Gaussian unitary ensemble (GUE) of random Hermitian $N\times N$ matrices at $N\to \infty$, in terms of a system of differential equations. As a showcase of the efficacy of our results for characterizing an approach to quantum chaoticity, we contrast them to arguably the most ideal of all quantum-chaotic spectra: the zeroes of the Riemann $\zeta$ function on the critical line at increasing heights.</description>

      <title>Machine learning for characterizing uncertain elastic properties of fused filament fabricated materials for topology optimization applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05850v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The layering approach used in fused filament fabrication (FFF) enables creation of complex designs generated by topology optimization. Defects associated with the layer-by-layer process, introduce considerable random variability to the local elastic modulus of the print. The elastic modulus along the fusion layers connecting bulk materials differs from that of the bulk areas. Accurate quantitative measurements of variations in both areas are essential to achieve robust optimized designs. This study aims to quantify the parameters of the random distributions given the surface strain field of the print measured by digital image correlation (DIC). Two statistical properties, mean and standard deviation, are sufficient to characterize the stochastic elastic modulus fields in each region. An efficient neural network model is developed to estimate spatial variations in the local elastic modulus within both bulk and fusion layers. This model is trained on a dataset of synthetic strain fields with known distributions in the elastic modulus fields. It performs well in correlating the elastic modulus with the input strain, as long as the standard deviation is below 60% of the mean of the random field. The predictive accuracy of the model on testing data, measured by the R2 score, is 0.99 and 0.95 for mean and standard deviation in the fusion material. The scores for the bulk material are 0.97 each. The trained model is implemented to predict the elastic modulus distribution of an FFF-printed material at a print speed of 30 mm/s and an extrusion temperature of 493.15 K, based on its DIC-measured surface strain data. The model predicts a mean and standard deviation of 1.2 GPa and 1 GPa for the bulk material and 400 MPa and 430 MPa for the fusion region. Validation of predictions confirms the reliability of this approach in measuring uncertainty in the local properties of the prints.</description>
