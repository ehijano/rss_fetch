      <title>The Wasserstein Bipolarization Index: A New Measure of Public Opinion Polarization, with an Application to Cross-Country Attitudes toward COVID-19 Vaccination Mandates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03331v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although the topic of opinion polarization receives much attention from the media, public opinion researchers and political scientists, the phenomenon itself has not been adequately characterized in either the lay or academic literature. To study opinion polarization among the public, researchers compare the distributions of respondents to survey questions or track the distribution of responses to a question over time using ad-hoc methods and measures such as visual comparisons, variances, and bimodality coefficients. To remedy this situation, we build on the axiomatic approach in the economics literature on income bipolarization, specifying key properties a measure of bipolarization should satisfy: in particular, it should increase as the distribution spreads away from a center toward the poles and/or as clustering below or above this center increases. We then show that measures of bipolarization used in public opinion research fail to satisfy one or more of these axioms. Next, we propose a $p$-Wasserstein polarization index that satisfies the axioms we set forth. Our index measures the dissimilarity between an observed distribution and a distribution with all the mass clustered on the lower and upper endpoints of the scale. We use our index to examine bipolarization in attitudes toward governmental COVID-19 vaccine mandates across 11 countries, finding the U.S and U.K are most polarized, China, France and India the least polarized, while the others (Brazil, Australia, Colombia, Canada, Italy, Spain) occupy an intermediate position.</description>

      <title>Eliminating Bias in Pedestrian Density Estimation: A Voronoi Cell Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For pedestrians moving without spatial constraints, extensive research has been devoted to develop methods of density estimation. In this paper we present a new approach based on Voronoi cells, offering a means to estimate density for individuals in small, unbounded pedestrian groups. A thorough evaluation of existing methods, encompassing both Lagrangian and Eulerian approaches employed in similar contexts, reveals notable limitations. Specifically, these methods turn out to be ill-defined for realistic density estimation along a pedestrian's trajectory, exhibiting systematic biases and fluctuations that depend on the choice of parameters. There is thus a need for a parameter-independent method to eliminate this bias. We propose a modification of the widely used Voronoi-cell based density estimate to accommodate pedestrian groups, irrespective of their size. The advantages of this modified Voronoi method are that it is an instantaneous method that requires only knowledge of the pedestrians' positions at a give time, does not depend on the choice of parameter values, gives us a realistic estimate of density in an individual's neighborhood, and has appropriate physical meaning for both small and large human crowds in a wide variety of situations. We conclude with general remarks about the meaning of density measurements for small groups of pedestrians.</description>

      <title>Geographical Isolation as a Driver of Political Violence in African Cities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03755v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Violence is commonly linked with large urban areas, and as a social phenomenon, it is presumed to scale super-linearly with population size. This study explores the hypothesis that smaller, isolated cities in Africa may experience a heightened intensity of violence against civilians. It aims to investigate the correlation between the risk of experiencing violence with a city's size and its geographical isolation. Over a 20-year period, the incidence of civilian casualties has been analysed to assess lethality in relation to varying degrees of isolation and city sizes. African cities are categorised by isolation (number of highway connections) and centrality (the estimated frequency of journeys). Findings suggest that violence against civilians exhibits a sub-linear pattern, with larger cities witnessing fewer casualties per 100,000 inhabitants. Remarkably, individuals in isolated cities face a quadrupled risk of a casualty compared to those in more connected cities.</description>

      <title>A universal framework for inclusive 15-minute cities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03794v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Proximity-based cities have attracted much attention in recent years. The 15-minute city, in particular, heralded a new vision for cities where essential services must be easily accessible. Despite its undoubted merit in stimulating discussion on new organisations of cities, the 15-minute city cannot be applicable everywhere, and its very definition raises a few concerns. Here, we tackle the feasibility and practicability of the '15-minute city' model in many cities worldwide. We provide a worldwide quantification of how close cities are to the ideal of the 15-minute city. To this end, we measure the accessibility times to resources and services, and we reveal strong heterogeneity of accessibility within and across cities, with a significant role played by local population densities. We provide an online platform (\href{whatif.sonycsl.it/15mincity}{whatif.sonycsl.it/15mincity}) to access and visualise accessibility scores for virtually all cities worldwide. The heterogeneity of accessibility within cities is one of the sources of inequality. We thus simulate how much a better redistribution of resources and services could heal inequity by keeping the same resources and services or by allowing for virtually infinite resources. We highlight pronounced discrepancies among cities in the minimum number of additional services needed to comply with the 15-minute city concept. We conclude that the proximity-based paradigm must be generalised to work on a wide range of local population densities. Finally, socio-economic and cultural factors should be included to shift from time-based to value-based cities.</description>

      <title>Transit Rider Heat Stress in Atlanta, GA under Current and Future Climate Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03457v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transit is a crucial mode of transportation, especially in urban areas and for urban and rural disadvantaged communities. Because extreme temperatures often pose threats to the elderly, members of the disability community, and other vulnerable populations, this study seeks to understand the level of influence that extreme temperatures may have on transit users across different demographic groups. In this case study for Atlanta, GA, heat stress is predicted for 2019 transit riders (using transit rider activity survey data) and for three future climate scenarios, SSP245, SSP370, and SSP585, into the year 2100. The HeatPath Analyzer and TransitSim 4.0 models were applied to predict cumulative heat exposure and trip-level risk for 35,999 trip equivalents for an average Atlanta area weekday in the summer of 2019. The analyses show that under 2019 weather conditions, 8.33% of summer trips were estimated to be conducted under extreme heat. With the projected future climate conditions, the percentage of trips under extreme heat risk grows steadily. By 2100, 37.1%, 56.1%, and 76.4% are projected to be under extreme heat risk for scenarios SSP245, SSP370, and SSP585, respectively. Under current weather conditions, Atlanta transit riders that own no vehicles and transit riders that are African American are disproportionately influenced by extreme heat. The disparity between these two groups and other groups of transit riders becomes wider as climate change continues to exacerbate. The findings of the study highlight an urgent need to implement heat mitigation and adaptation strategies in urban transit networks.</description>

      <title>The Face of Populism: Examining Differences in Facial Emotional Expressions of Political Leaders Using Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.09914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.09914v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Populist rhetoric employed on online media is characterized as deeply impassioned and often imbued with strong emotions. The aim of this paper is to empirically investigate the differences in affective nonverbal communication of political leaders. We use a deep-learning approach to process a sample of 220 YouTube videos of political leaders from 15 different countries, analyze their facial expressions of emotion and then examine differences in average emotion scores representing the relative presence of 6 emotional states (anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, and surprise) and a neutral expression for each frame of the YouTube video. Based on a sample of manually coded images, we find that this deep-learning approach has 53-60\% agreement with human labels. We observe statistically significant differences in the average score of negative emotions between groups of leaders with varying degrees of populist rhetoric.</description>

      <title>Networks And Productivity -- A Study In Economic Scholars During COVID-19</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18980v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted traditional academic collaboration patterns, offering a unique opportunity to analyze the influence of peer effects and collaboration dynamics on research productivity. Using a novel network dataset, this paper investigates the role of peer effects on the productivity of economists, as measured by their publication count, during both pre-pandemic and pandemic periods. The results indicate that peer effects were significant in the pre-pandemic period but not during the pandemic. Additionally, the study sheds light on gender and race differences. These findings enhance our understanding of how research collaboration impacts knowledge production and provide insights that may inform policies aimed at promoting collaboration and boosting research productivity within the academic community.</description>
