      <title>Parabolic cut pairs in boundaries of relatively hyperbolic groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11900v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Parabolic cut pairs in the boundaries of relatively hyperbolic group are a new and previously unexplored phenomenon. In this paper, we give a way to create examples of relatively hyperbolic groups with parabolic cut pairs on their boundary via a combination theorem, which states that a group $G$, splitting as a graph of relatively hyperbolic groups with certain conditions, is relatively hyperbolic with inseparable parabolic cut pairs on the boundary $\partial(G,\mathcal{P})$. We also prove that all relatively hyperbolic groups with inseparable parabolic cut pairs in their boundaries arise via this combination theorem.
  \'Swi\k{a}tkowski gives a topological description of combining boundaries of vertex groups. Unfortunately, his method cannot be applied for fundamental reasons in this setting. We instead give two explicit topological descriptions of the boundary in terms of boundaries of the vertex groups.</description>

      <title>The commuting graph and a graph associated with centralizers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11926v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a $p$-group. We begin to consider the relationship between the structure of the commuting graph and $|G:Z(G)|$. We also build a family of groups whose commuting graphs have more than one connected component whose diameter is at least $2$. For this, we introduce another graph related to the commuting graph that is associated with centralizers.</description>

      <title>Realizing wedges of Moore spaces as classifying spaces of finite semigroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12657v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fiedorowicz suggested that it was likely that every finite simply connected CW complex is homotopy equivalent to the classifying space of a finite semigroup. We prove that every finite wedge of simply connected Moore spaces of finitely generated abelian groups is homotopy equivalent to the classifying space of a finite semigroup. Consequently, homology groups alone cannot preclude a finite simply connected CW complex from being homotopy equivalent to the classifying space of a finite semigroup.</description>

      <title>$m$-partite oriented semiregular representation of valency 3 for finite groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a finite group and $m \geq 2$ a positive integer. We say that $G$ admits an \emph{oriented $m$-semiregular representation} (abbreviated as OmSR) if there exists a $m$-Cayley digraph $\Gamma$ over $G$ such that $\Gamma$ is oriented and $\mathrm{Aut}(\Gamma) \cong G$. In \cite{xu1}, we classified finite groups generated by at most two elements that admit an OmSR of valency 3 for $m \geq 2$ and $G \ncong \mathbb{Z}_1$. In this article, we consider $m$-partite digraphs.We say a finite group $G$ admits an \emph{$m$-partite oriented semiregular representation} ($m$-partite digraphical representation), abbreviated as \emph{$m$-POSR} (\emph{$m$-PDR}), if there exists an \emph{oriented} $m$-partite Cayley digraph (\emph{$m$-partite Cayley digraph}) $\Gamma$ with $\mathrm{Aut}(\Gamma) \cong G$. In this paper, we classify finite groups generated by at most two elements that admit $m$-POSR. Since if $G$ admits an $m$-POSR, then $G$ must also admit an $m$-PDR (while the converse does not hold), as a natural consequence, we also provide a complete classification for groups $G=\langle x,y\rangle$ that admit $m$-PDR of valency 3. This complements the results in \cite{xu1}.</description>

      <title>Positivity and Non-commutativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12771v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article we revisit a new notion of positivity in real semisimple Lie groups that at the same time generalizes total positivity in split real Lie groups as well as positive Lie semigroups in Hermitian Lie groups of tube type. We shortly discuss the relationship with higher rank Teichm\"uller spaces, and then focus on describing different aspects of positivity as well as open questions. In the second part we describe a non-commutative perspective on Hermitian Lie groups of tube type that is suggested by positivity and leads to interesting applications, such as non-commutative generalizations of Markov numbers.</description>

      <title>Classification of Fixed Subgroups of Endomorphisms in Free-abelian Times Surface Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12871v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we first study the endomorphisms of free-abelian times surface groups and give a characterization of when they are injective and surjective. Then, we see that free-abelian times hyperbolic groups are Hopfian but not co-Hopfian. Moreover, we give a complete classification of fixed subgroups of endomorphisms in free-abelian times surface groups, which extends that of automorphisms. Finally, we study the endomorphisms of free-abelian times non-elementary torsion-free hyperbolic groups and give an equivalent condition for them to contain, up to isomorphism, finitely many end-fixed subgroups.</description>

      <title>Biggs tree groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13292v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Biggs gave an explicit construction, using finite colored trees, of finite permutation groups whose Cayley graphs have valence $C$ and girth tending to infinity as the radius $R$ of the tree tends to infinity. We show that for each $C&gt;2$ there are infinitely many choices of $R$, including all $R\leq 12$ and all $R$ such that $2R+1$ is prime, such that the group so presented contains the full alternating group on the vertices of the tree.
  This gives, for each $C&gt;2$, an infinite family of pairs $(G_{C,R},S_{C,R})$ such that $G_{C,R}$ is an alternating or symmetric group, $S_{C,R}$ is a generating set of $G_{C,R}$ of size $C$ with an explicit permutation description of its generators, and such that the girth of the Cayley graph of $G_{C,R}$ with respect to $S_{C,R}$ tends to infinity as $R$ tends to infinity.</description>

      <title>On the deep commuting graph of a finite group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13303v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a finite group and let $\tilde{G}$ be a Schur cover of $G$. The deep commuting graph $\Delta_D(G)$ of $G$ is a simple graph with vertex set $G$, where two distinct vertices are adjacent if their pre-images commute in $\tilde{G}$. The deep commuting graph of a finite group was first introduced in [P. J. Cameron and B. Kuzma, Between the enhanced power graph and the commuting graph, {\it J. Graph Theory} {\bf 102} (2023), no. 2, 295--303], where the authors have shown that $\Delta_D(G)$ is fixed irrespective of the choice of the Schur cover $\tilde{G}$. In this paper, we first prove that $\Delta_D(G)$ is complete if and only if $G$ is cyclic. Also, we classify finite simple groups, symmetric groups and alternating groups, for which $\Delta_D(G)$ is perfect. In addition, explore several other properties of $\Delta_D(G)$ like Eulerianess, universality and connectedness of reduced deep commuting graphs.
  Next, we classify the finite abelian groups for which deep commuting graphs coincide with enhance power graphs. We also characterize the dominant vertices for the deep commuting graphs of finite abelian groups and examine the connectedness of the associated reduced deep commuting graphs. These properties of the deep commuting graphs for the non abelian groups like symmetric groups, alternating groups, dihedral groups, generalized quaternion group and Heisenberg groups are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Presenting the Zassenhaus Lie algebra by the Magnus Lie algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is shown that the Zassenhaus restricted $\mathbb F_p$-Lie algebra of a (pro-p) group G can be presented by the Magnus Lie algebra of G. For the class of (pro-p) groups for which the terms of the lower central series are torsion-free, the Zassenhaus restricted $\mathbb F_p$-Lie algebra can be explicitly computed from the Magnus Lie algebra. These results apply to orientable surface groups, right-angled Artin groups, pure braid groups, fundamental groups of supersolvable hyperplane arrangements and fundamental groups of strictly supersolvable toric arrangements.</description>

      <title>Symmetric harmoniousness of odd-order groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13430v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that every odd-order group is symmetric harmonious: there exists a permutation $g_0,g_1,\ldots, g_{\ell-1}$ of elements of $G$ such that the consecutive products $g_0g_1,g_1g_2,\ldots, g_{\ell-1}g_0$ also form a permutation of elements of $G$ and $g_{\ell-i}=g_i^{-1}$ for all $1\leq i \leq \ell-1$. We apply this result to obtain new examples of R*-sequenceable groups.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.11841v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article we establish certain variants of the Inverse Cluster Size problem. We introduce the notion of primitive extensions and establish the Primitive variant of the problem. Precisely, we prove the existence of primitive extensions over number fields of any given degree and cluster size less than the degree. We also introduce the notions of Strong and Weak General Magnification and the notion of general primitive extensions. We establish some interesting cases of the General primitive variant of the problem.</description>

      <title>On the classification of quantum symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11923v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that, in order to classify Hopf algebra (co)actions on a given finite dimensional algebra up to equivalence, one should start with the classification of the possible cosupports (i.e. the sets of linear operators by which $H^*$ is acting) of Hopf algebra coactions and then consider dual Hopf algebra actions. As an application, we classify quantum symmetries of the set of two points and the algebra of dual numbers. In addition, we show that the straight line does not admit an (ungraded) universal coacting Manin Hopf algebra. Moreover, we prove that for $n\geqslant 14$ the full matrix algebra $M_n(\mathbb k)$ admits a nontrivial Hopf algebra coaction such that all Hopf algebra actions with the same restriction on the cosupport are trivial, i.e. the cosupport may reduce under the dualization and a finite dimensional algebra may have less equivalence classes of actions than coactions. Simultaneously, for any $n\geqslant 14$, we define an elementary grading on $M_n(\mathbb k)$ by an infinite group that cannot be regraded by any finite group. (The previously known lower bound was $n\geqslant 349$.)</description>

      <title>Cyclic Subgroup Lattices as Universal Sources of Power-Type Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12374v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Power-type graphs, such as the power graph, the directed power graph, the enhanced power graph and the difference graph, encode significant information about the internal structure of a finite group. Despite substantial investigation in recent years, the precise relationship between these graphs and the subgroup lattice of the underlying group has remained only partially understood. In this paper we establish a complete, explicit, and purely combinatorial correspondence between the enhanced power graph and the lattice of cyclic subgroups $\mathcal{L}_c(G)$ of a finite group $G$. We prove that these two objects determine each other uniquely: an unlabeled enhanced power graph suffices to reconstruct $\mathcal{L}_c(G)$, and conversely, the labeled enhanced power graph can be reconstructed directly from $\mathcal{L}_c(G)$. Exploiting this duality, we demonstrate that the reconstruction principle applies equally to the power graph, the directed power graph, and the difference graph, which may all be derived solely from the cyclic subgroup lattice, independent of the group operation.
  This bidirectional correspondence yields a combinatorial equivalence between power-type graphs and the cyclic subgroup lattice, providing a new framework for analyzing finite groups through graph-theoretic and lattice-theoretic data, free from algebraic complexity.</description>

      <title>Word Length Formulae and Normal Forms of Conjugacy Classes in Surface Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12862v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we primarily investigate the following symmetric presentation of the surface group $\pi_1(\Sigma_g)=\left\langle c_1,\dots, c_{2g}\mid c_1\cdots c_{2g}c_1^{-1}\cdots c_{2g}^{-1}\right\rangle$. For every nontrivial element $x\in \pi_1(\Sigma_g)$, we obtain a uniform representation of the normal forms of $x^k$ under the length-lexicographical order. Based on this, we find a new relation among these normal forms, and then derive the following three formulae related to the word length: $|x^2|&gt;|x|$; $|x^k|=(k-1)(|x^2|-|x|)+|x|$; $\lim_{k\to\infty}\frac{|x^k|}{k}=|x^2|-|x|$. Moreover, we extend these results to obtain analogous but less precise formulae for every minimal geometric presentation. Finally, we define the normal forms of conjugacy classes in $\pi_1(\Sigma_g)$ and give a criterion for determining the conjugacy of elements. As a consequence, we give efficient algorithms for solving the root-finding and conjugacy problems.</description>

      <title>Embeddings of trees of hyperbolic spaces and Cannon--Thurston maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12883v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Suppose $G_1$ and $G_2$ are hyperbolic groups with a common quasiconvex subgroup $H$, and the free product with amalgamation $G = G_1 *_H G_2$ is hyperbolic. Let $K_i &lt; G_i$, $i = 1,2$, be quasiconvex subgroups containing $H$, and let $K = K_1 *_H K_2$. It follows from the work of Bestvina and Feighn that $K$ is hyperbolic, and it follows from the work of the second named author with M. Kapovich that the inclusion $K \to G$ extends continuously to the (Gromov) boundary.
  The present paper arose from the question of whether the same conclusion holds when $K_i &lt; G_i$ are no longer quasiconvex but merely hyperbolic. As an application of the main result of this paper, we answer this question affirmatively, provided each inclusion $K_i \to G_i$ extends continuously to the boundary.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.13304v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An orientation-preserving mapping is not always defined by how it acts on triples of elements. Although this fact is simple and well-known, it sometimes gets overlooked, resulting in wrong statements in publications. Automated proof assistants are a technology that is supposed to ensure that proofs exactly match the results, thus pre-empting mistakes. In this paper we successfully formalise the definition of orientation-preserving mappings in proof assistant software Lean and construct a computer-verified proof of the above fact.</description>

      <title>Finite $p$-groups of class $2$ as central extensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.10970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2008.10970v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Finite $p$-groups of nilpotency class 2 are treated from the perspective of central extensions.
  Given finite abelian groups $G,A$, we derive an explicit formula for cocycles representing elements of $H^2(G,A)$, compute $H^2(G,A)$, and describe the actions of ${\rm End}(G)$ and ${\rm End}(A)$ on $H^2(G,A)$. These are used to provide an efficient criterion for lifting endomorphisms of $G$ to homomorphisms between two central extensions. Subsequently, we present two applications to illustrate the usefulness of this approach, in the case $p&gt;2$.
  First, we recover the classification of two-generator $p$-groups of class $2$ up to isomorphism, and compute the order of the automorphism group for each isomorphism class. Second, we construct a family of nonabelian $p$-groups of order $p^7$ whose automorphism groups are abelian.</description>

      <title>Entropy rigidity for cusped Hitchin representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.04859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2201.04859v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish an entropy rigidity theorem for Hitchin representations of all geometrically finite Fuchsian groups which generalizes a theorem of Potrie and Sambarino for Hitchin representations of closed surface groups. In the process, we introduce the class of (1,1,2)-hypertransverse groups and show for such a group that the Hausdorff dimension of its conical limit set agrees with its (first) simple root entropy, providing a common generalization of results of Bishop and Jones, for Kleinian groups, and Pozzetti, Sambarino and Wienhard, for Anosov groups. We also introduce the theory of transverse representations of projectively visible groups as a tool for studying discrete subgroups of linear groups which are not necessarily Anosov or relatively Anosov.</description>

      <title>Parabolic subgroups of complex braid groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.11938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.11938v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we introduce a class of `parabolic' subgroups for the generalized braid group associated to an arbitrary irreducible complex reflection group, which maps onto the collection of parabolic subgroups of the reflection group. Except for one case, which is proven separately elsewhere, we prove that this collection forms a lattice, so that intersections of parabolic subgroups are parabolic subgroups. In particular, every element admits a parabolic closure, which is the smallest parabolic subgroup containing it. We furthermore prove that it provides a simplicial complex which generalizes the curve complex of the usual braid group. In the case of real reflection groups, this complex generalizes the one previously introduced by Cumplido, Gebhardt, Gonz\'alez-Meneses and Wiest for Artin groups of spherical type. We show that it shares similar properties, and similarly conjecture its hyperbolicity, with a few additional results in this direction.</description>

      <title>Sharp Uncertainty Principle for Transitive $G$-Sets over Arbitrary Fields and Finite Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.11204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.11204v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For any finite group $G$, any transitive $G$-set $X$ and any field ${\Bbb F}$, we consider the vector space ${\Bbb F}^X$ of all functions from $X$ to ${\Bbb F}$, which is a $G$-space isomorphic to the permutation ${\Bbb F} G$-module ${\Bbb F} X$. When the group algebra ${\Bbb F} G$ is semisimple and split, we find a specific basis $\widehat X$ of ${\Bbb F}^X$ and, for $f\in{\Bbb F}^X$, construct the Fourier transform $\widehat f\in{\Bbb F}^{\widehat X}$. We define the rank support $\mbox{rk-supp}(\widehat f)$ and prove that $\mbox{rk-supp}(\widehat f)=\dim {\Bbb F} G f$, where ${\Bbb F} G f$ is the submodule of ${\Bbb F} X$ generated by the element $f=\sum_{x\in X}f(x)x$. Next, we extend and strengthen the sharpened uncertainty principle for finite abelian groups, established by Feng, Hollmann, and Xiang in 2019, to a broader framework and a sharp version. For $0\ne f\in{\Bbb F}^X$, we construct a block $X_{{\rm supp}(f)}$ of $X$ and a subset ${\mathscr S}'^{-\!1}$ of $G$ determined by the support ${\rm supp}(f)$ of $f$, and show that $\dim{\Bbb F} Gf-\dim{\Bbb F}{\mathscr S}'^{-\!1}\!f\ge 1$ and $$
  |{\rm supp}(f)|\cdot \dim{\Bbb F} Gf
  \ge |X|+ (\!\dim{\Bbb F} Gf-\dim{\Bbb F}{\mathscr S}'^{-1}f)
  \cdot|{\rm supp}(f)| -|X_{{\rm supp}(f)}|, $$ where ${\Bbb F}{\mathscr S}'^{-1}f$ denotes the subspace of ${\Bbb F}X$ spanned by the subset ${\mathscr S}'^{-1}f=\{\alpha f\,|\,\alpha\in{\mathscr S}'^{-1}\}\subseteq{\Bbb F} X$. We provide necessary and sufficient conditions for the above inequality to achieve equality. As corollaries, we derive many sharpened or classical versions of the finite-dimensional uncertainty principle, address an open question posed by Feng, Hollmann, and Xiang. When $|G|$ is a prime and $X=G$, we give a lower bound on $\dim {\Bbb F}Gf$ that recovers Tao's 2005 strong uncertainty principle, along with a precise characterization of the equality case.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.09873v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Action operads and cloning systems are, respectively, the main ingredients in two approaches for axiomatically constructing Thompson-like groups due to Thumann and Witzel-Zaremsky. In this paper, we prove that action operads are equivalent to cloning systems that admit a certain extra structure, and which we call bilateral cloning systems. In addition, we describe their relation with crossed interval groups and product categories.</description>

      <title>Context-free graphs and their transition groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13070v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Starting from context-free inverse graphs, we introduce a new class of groups and study their structural properties. We establish closure properties, show that their co-word problems are context-free, analyze torsion elements, and realize them as subgroups of the asynchronous rational group. Context-freeness is preserved under a generalized free product of graphs, and using this construction we provide examples of groups that are not residually finite or not poly-context-free, making them relevant for testing the Lehnert and Brough conjectures. Moreover, we investigate how small local modifications of a graph affect the global structure of the transition group, showing that for locally quasi-transitive graphs with infinite orbits, the transition group decomposes into a highly structured quotient by a bounded torsion subgroup, showing strong global constraints induced by local graph properties.</description>

      <title>On $L^1$-approximation of groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17392v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A longstanding open problem in the intersection of group theory and operator algebras is whether all groups are MF, that is, approximated by asymptotic representations with respect to the operator norm. More generally, for $1 \leq p \leq \infty$, it has been asked by Thom in his ICM address whether there exist groups which are not approximated with respect to the Schatten $p$-norm. The cases of $1 &lt; p &lt; \infty$ were addressed in previous works. We settle the case $p=1$, solving a question left open by Lubotzky and Oppenheim.</description>

      <title>Jensen's Functional Equation on Involution-Generated Groups: An ($\mathrm{SR}_2$) Criterion and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02870v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the Jensen functional equations on a group $G$ with values in an abelian group $H$: \begin{align} \tag{J1}\label{eq:J1} f(xy)+f(xy^{-1})&amp;=2f(x)\qquad(\forall\,x,y\in G),\\ \tag{J2}\label{eq:J2} f(xy)+f(x^{-1}y)&amp;=2f(y)\qquad(\forall\,x,y\in G), \end{align} with the normalization $f(e)=0.$ Building on techniques for the symmetric groups $S_n$, we isolate a structural criterion on $G$ -- phrased purely in terms of involutions and square roots -- under which every solution to \eqref{eq:J1} must also satisfy \eqref{eq:J2} and is automatically a group homomorphism. Our new criterion, denoted $(\mathrm{SR}_2)$, implies that $S_1(G,H) = S_{1,2}(G,H) = \mathrm{Hom}(G,H)$, applies to many reflection-generated groups and, in particular, recovers the full solution on $S_n.$ Furthermore, we give a transparent description of the solution space in terms of the abelianization $G/[G,G],$ and we treat dihedral groups $D_m$ in detail, separating the cases $m$ odd and even. The approach is independent of division by 2 in $H$ and complements the classical complex-valued theory that reduces \eqref{eq:J1} to functions on $G/[G,[G,G]].$</description>

      <title>The Dual Burnside Process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25202v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Burnside process is a classical Markov chain for sampling uniformly from group orbits. We introduce the dual Burnside process, obtained by interchanging the roles of group elements and states. This dual chain has stationary law $\pi(g)\propto |X_g|$, is reversible, and admits a matrix factorization $Q=AB$, $K=BA$ with the classical Burnside kernel $K$. As a consequence the two chains share all nonzero eigenvalues and have mixing times that differ by at most one step. We further establish universal Doeblin floors, orbit and conjugacy-class lumpings, and transfer principles between $Q$ and $K$. We analyze explicit examples: the value-permutation model $S_k$ acting on $[k]^n$ and the coordinate-permutation model $S_n$ acting on $[k]^n$. These results show that the dual chain provides both a conceptual mirror to the classical Burnside process and practical advantages for symmetry-aware Markov chain Monte Carlo.</description>
