      <title>Testing Mechanisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11739v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Economists are often interested in the mechanisms by which a treatment affects an outcome. We develop tests for the "sharp null of full mediation" that a treatment $D$ affects an outcome $Y$ only through a particular mechanism (or set of mechanisms) $M$. Our approach exploits connections between mediation analysis and the econometric literature on testing instrument validity. We also provide tools for quantifying the magnitude of alternative mechanisms when the sharp null is rejected: we derive sharp lower bounds on the fraction of individuals whose outcome is affected by the treatment despite having the same value of $M$ under both treatments (``always-takers''), as well as sharp bounds on the average effect of the treatment for such always-takers. An advantage of our approach relative to existing tools for mediation analysis is that it does not require stringent assumptions about how $M$ is assigned. We illustrate our methodology in two empirical applications.</description>

      <title>Empirical Bayes shrinkage (mostly) does not correct the measurement error in regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19095v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the value-added literature, it is often claimed that regressing on empirical Bayes shrinkage estimates corrects for the measurement error problem in linear regression. We clarify the conditions needed; we argue that these conditions are stronger than the those needed for classical measurement error correction, which we advocate for instead. Moreover, we show that the classical estimator cannot be improved without stronger assumptions. We extend these results to regressions on nonlinear transformations of the latent attribute and find generically slow minimax estimation rates.</description>

      <title>Forecasting Oil Volatility through Network Models with GARCH-Informed Correlation Weights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15046v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study addresses the computational challenges of forecasting volatility in high-dimensional commodity markets. Building on the Network log-ARCH framework, we introduce a novel class of network topologies from GARCH-informed correlation weights, obtained from conditional covariance estimates of multivariate GARCH models, rather than relying on the heuristic distance measures commonly used in clustering methods. We evaluate the proposed models forecasting performance through a rolling-window exercise using a panel of OPEC members crude oil prices. The results identify network volatility models incorporating these new GARCH-informed weights as the statistically superior specifications. Remarkably, the proposed framework matches standard DCC-GARCH predictive accuracy while delivering up to 62,000-fold computational gains. By explicitly modeling contemporaneous spillovers through interpretable spatial ARCH-like lags estimated via GMM, the proposed approach offers an optimal trade-off between parsimony, interpretability, and performance. The findings establish GARCH-informed network models as robust, scalable alternatives for systemic risk measurement and volatility forecasting in interconnected financial markets.</description>

      <title>The purpose of an estimator is what it does: Misspecification, estimands, and over-identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13076v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In over-identified models, misspecification -- the norm rather than exception -- fundamentally changes what estimators estimate. Different estimators imply different estimands rather than different efficiency for the same target. A review of recent applications of generalized method of moments in the American Economic Review suggests widespread acceptance of this fact: There is little formal specification testing and widespread use of estimators that would be inefficient were the model correct, including the use of "hand-selected" moments and weighting matrices. Motivated by these observations, we review and synthesize recent results on estimation under model misspecification, providing guidelines for transparent and robust empirical research. We also provide a new theoretical result, showing that Hansen's J-statistic measures, asymptotically, the range of estimates achievable at a given standard error. Given the widespread use of inefficient estimators and the resulting researcher degrees of freedom, we thus particularly recommend the broader reporting of J-statistics.</description>

      <title>Concentration Inequalities for Suprema of Empirical Processes with Dependent Data via Generic Chaining with Applications to Statistical Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00597v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper develops a general concentration inequality for the suprema of empirical processes with dependent data. The concentration inequality is obtained by combining generic chaining with a coupling-based strategy. Our framework accommodates high-dimensional and heavy-tailed (sub-Weibull) data. We demonstrate the usefulness of our result by deriving non-asymptotic predictive performance guarantees for empirical risk minimization in regression problems with dependent data. In particular, we establish an oracle inequality for a broad class of nonlinear regression models and, as a special case, a single-layer neural network model. Our results show that empirical risk minimzaton with dependent data attains a prediction accuracy comparable to that in the i.i.d. setting for a wide range of nonlinear regression models.</description>

      <title>Nonparametric Identification of Demand without Exogenous Product Characteristics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23211v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study identification of differentiated product demand from market-level data when product characteristics can be endogenous. Past work suggests nonparametric identification may be impossible: that is, in addition to standard price instruments, exogenous characteristic-based instruments are essentially necessary to identify sufficiently flexible demand models with standard index restrictions. We show, however, that price counterfactuals are nonparametrically identified using recentered instruments -- which combine exogenous price instruments with possibly endogenous product characteristics -- under a weaker index restriction and a new condition we term faithfulness. We argue that faithfulness, like the usual completeness condition for nonparametric instrumental variable identification, is best viewed as a technical requirement on the strength of identifying variation rather than a substantive economic or statistical restriction. We show the two conditions are closely related, though generally distinct. We conclude with several practical implications for the parametric estimation of demand counterfactuals.</description>

      <title>Income Inequality and Economic Growth: A Meta-Analytic Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15690v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The empirical literature on the relationship between income inequality and economic growth has produced highly heterogeneous and often conflicting results. This paper investigates the sources of this heterogeneity using a meta-analytic approach that systematically combines and analyzes evidence from relevant studies published between 1994 and 2025. We find an economically small but statistically significant negative average effect of income inequality on subsequent economic growth, together with strong evidence of substantial heterogeneity and selective publication based on statistical significance, but no evidence of systematic directional bias. To explain the observed heterogeneity, we estimate a meta-regression. The results indicate that both real-world characteristics and research design choices shape reported effect sizes. In particular, inequality measured net of taxes and transfers is associated with more negative growth effects, and the adverse impact of inequality is weaker - or even reversed - in high-income economies relative to developing countries. Methodological choices also matter: cross-sectional studies tend to report more negative estimates, while fixed-effects, instrumental-variable, and GMM estimators are associated with more positive estimates in panel settings.</description>
