      <title>Determination of electron screening potential of 6 Li(p,{\alpha})3 He reaction using MultiLayer Perceptron based neural network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background: Understanding the nuclear reactions between light charged nuclei at sub-coulomb energy region holds significant importance in several astrophysical processes. Determination of the precise reaction cross-section within the astrophysically important Gamow range is difficult because of electron screening. Various polynomial fits, R-Matrix and Indirect Trojan horse method estimate much higher electron screening energies as compared to the adiabatic limit. Purpose: Obtain the bare astrophysical S-factor of 6 Li(p,{\alpha})3 He using Multi-Layer Perceptron based Artificial Neural Network based analysis and extract the electron screening energies. Methods: Experimental S-factor of 6 Li(p,{\alpha})3 He, available in literature, are reanalyzed using the Multi-LayerPerceptron based Artificial Neural Network based algorithm to obtain the energy dependent astrophysical S-factor. Bare astrophysical S-factor is also calculated using the same Feed-forward Artificial Neural Network from the data range above 60 keV where the electron screening effect is expected to be negligible. Electron screening potential is then obtained by taking the ratio of total shielded S-factor with the bare S-factor. Results and Conclusions: The electron screening potential obtained from the Present work through the Artificial Neural network based algorithm is found to be 220 eV. The extracted electron screening potential through the present analysis indicates that the Artificial Neural Network might be an alternative tools for estimation the electron screening potential involving light nuclei.</description>

      <title>Investigating the crust of neutron stars with neural-network quantum states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21207v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An accurate description of low-density nuclear matter is crucial for explaining the physics of neutron star crusts. In the density range between approximately 0.01 fm$^{-3}$ and 0.1 fm$^{-3}$, matter transitions from neutron-rich nuclei to various higher-density pasta shapes, before ultimately reaching a uniform liquid. In this work, we introduce a variational Monte Carlo method based on a neural Pfaffian-Jastrow quantum state, which allows us to model the transition from the liquid phase to neutron-rich nuclei microscopically. At low densities, nuclear clusters dynamically emerge from the microscopic interactions among protons and neutrons, which we model based on pionless effective field theory. Our variational Monte Carlo approach represents a significant improvement over the state-of-the-art auxiliary-field diffusion Monte Carlo method, which is severely hindered by the fermion-sign problem in this low-density regime and cannot capture the onset of clusters. In addition to computing the energy per particle of symmetric nuclear matter and pure neutron matter, we analyze an intermediate isospin-asymmetry configuration to elucidate the formation of nuclear clusters. We also provide evidence that the presence of such nuclear clusters influences the amount of protons in the crust compared to protons in beta-equilibrated, neutrino-transparent matter.</description>

      <title>Considerations on measuring spin-spin correlation of hyeprons in heavy-ion experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The significant global spin alignment observed for $\phi$ mesons in heavy-ion collisions has sparked intense discussions about its origin and implications. One explanation suggests that fluctuations in the strong force field may introduce strong spin correlations between strange ($s$) and anti-strange ($\bar{s}$) quarks, leading to the global spin alignment of $\phi$ mesons. Extending this line of research, the theoretical community has proposed studying the spin correlation between $\Lambda$ and $\bar{\Lambda}$ hyperons. In this paper, we construct experimental observables and make connections between them and the theoretical proposed quantities.</description>

      <title>Neutrino and antineutrino charged-current multi-nucleon cross sections revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21587v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we improve on several aspects of the computation of the (anti-)neutrino charged-current multi-nucleon cross section carried out in Phys.Rev.C 83 (2011) 045501 and Phys.Rev.C 102 (2020) 024601. Most importantly, we implement a consistent treatment of the nucleon self-energy in the $W^\pm N\to N'\pi$ amplitude entering the definition of the two-particle two-hole (2p2h) cross-section, and estimate the source of uncertainty of our model due to a simplified treatment of the $\Delta$ self-energy. Our new predictions are around $20-40\%$ higher than previously. We show comparisons for the inclusive lepton double-differential cross sections, with no pions in the final state, measured by MiniBooNE on carbon and by T2K on carbon and oxygen. In all cases, we find an excellent reproduction of the experiments, and in particular, the neutrino MiniBooNE data is now well described without requiring a global $90\%$ re-scaling of the flux. In addition, we take the opportunity of this revision to discuss in detail several important issues of the calculation of the 2p2h cross section, delving into the microscopic dynamics of the multi-nucleon mechanisms. The improved treatment presented in this work provides realistic first-step emitted two-nucleon final state momentum configurations, beyond the approximation of phase-space distributions.</description>

      <title>Weak rates in strongly coupled cold quark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rates of flavor-changing weak processes are crucial in determining the conditions of beta equilibrium in neutron stars and mergers, influencing the damping of oscillations, the stability of rotating pulsars, and the emission of gravitational waves. We derive a formula for these rates at nonzero temperature, to leading order in the Fermi coupling and exact in the QCD coupling. Utilizing a simple phenomenological holographic model dual to QCD, we study massless unpaired quark matter at high densities. We numerically compute the rate for small deviations from beta equilibrium and derive an analytic approximation for small temperatures. Our findings reveal that, compared to the perturbative result, the rate is suppressed by logarithmic factors of the temperature.</description>

      <title>The Fox-Wolfram Moment of jet production in relativistic heavy ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20680v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first theoretical investigation of Fox-Wolfram moments (FWMs) for multi-jet production in relativistic heavy ion collisions. In this work, jet productions in p+p collisions are computed with a Monte Carlo event generator SHERPA, while the Linear Boltzmann Transport model is utilized to simulate the multiple scattering of energetic partons in the hot and dense QCD matter. The event-normalized distributions of the lower-order FWM, $H_1^T$ in p+p and Pb+Pb collisions are calculated. It is found that for events with jet number $n_\text{jet} = 2$ the $H_1^T$ distribution in Pb+Pb is suppressed at small $H_1^T$ while enhanced at large $H_1^T$ region as compared to p+p. For events with $n_\text{jet}&gt;2$, the jet number reduction effect due to jet quenching in the QGP decreases the $H_1^T$ distribution at large $H_1^T$ in Pb+Pb relative to p+p. The medium modification of the Fox-Wolfram moment $H_1^T$ for events with $n_\text{jet}\ge 2$ are also presented, which resemble those of events with $n_\text{jet} = 2$. Its reason is revealed through the relative contribution fractions of events with different final-state jet numbers to $H_1^T$.</description>

      <title>Gravitational form factors of pion from top-down holographic QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21113v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The gravitational form factors (GFFs) of pions has been calculated from a top-down holographic QCD approach with momentum transfer dependence for the first time. It is important because the GFFs of hadrons have information on the internal stress distribution that may provide insight into the mechanism of how QCD forms hadrons. The forward limit value of this GFFs, i.e. the D-term, was also obtained. Furthermore, in this approach, we observe the so-called glueball dominance, in which pions have gravitational interactions via infinite glueball spectra.</description>

      <title>A framework for semi-universality: Semi-universality of 3-qudit SU(d)-invariant gates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21249v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum circuits with symmetry-respecting gates have attracted broad interest in quantum information science. While recent work has developed a theory for circuits with Abelian symmetries, revealing important distinctions between Abelian and non-Abelian cases, a comprehensive framework for non-Abelian symmetries has been lacking. In this work, we develop novel techniques and a powerful framework that is particularly useful for understanding circuits with non-Abelian symmetries. Using this framework we settle an open question on quantum circuits with SU(d) symmetry. We show that 3-qudit SU(d)-invariant gates are semi-universal, i.e., generate all SU(d)-invariant unitaries, up to certain constraints on the relative phases between sectors with inequivalent representation of symmetry. Furthermore, we prove that these gates achieve full universality when supplemented with 3 ancilla qudits. Interestingly, we find that studying circuits with 3-qudit gates is also useful for a better understanding of circuits with 2-qudit gates. In particular, we establish that even though 2-qudit SU(d)-invariant gates are not themselves semi-universal, they become universal with at most 11 ancilla qudits. Additionally, we investigate the statistical properties of circuits composed of random SU(d)-invariant gates. Our findings reveal that while circuits with 2-qudit gates do not form a 2-design for the Haar measure over SU(d)-invariant unitaries, circuits with 3-qudit gates generate a t-design, with t that is quadratic in the number of qudits.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic $|G_E/G_M|$ ratios of hyperons at large timelike $q^2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21397v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, it has become possible to measure not only the magnitude of the electric ($G_E$) and magnetic ($G_M$) form factors of spin $\frac{1}{2}$ baryons, but also to measure the relative phases of those quantities in the timelike kinematic region. Aiming to interpret present $|G_E/G_M|$ data on hyperons of the baryon octet, as well as to predict future data, we present model calculations of that ratio for large invariant 4-momentum square $q^2$ in the timelike region ($q^2&gt;0$). Without any further parameter fitting, we extend to the timelike region a covariant quark model previously developed to describe the kinematic spacelike region ($q^2 \le 0$) of the baryon octet form factors. The model takes into account both the effects of valence quarks and the excitations of the meson cloud which dresses the baryons. We report here that our results are in good agreement with very recent data from BESIII, within the uncertainty limits of our model. We also make new predictions which may be tested in the near future, when the range of the present measurements is expanded to the 20--50 GeV$^2$ region.</description>

      <title>Real-time chiral dynamics at finite temperature from quantum simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21496v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we explore the real-time dynamics of the chiral magnetic effect (CME) at a finite temperature in the (1+1)-dimensional QED, the massive Schwinger model. By introducing a chiral chemical potential $\mu_5$ through a quench process, we drive the system out of equilibrium and analyze the induced vector currents and their evolution over time. The Hamiltonian is modified to include the time-dependent chiral chemical potential, thus allowing the investigation of the CME within a quantum computing framework. We employ the quantum imaginary time evolution (QITE) algorithm to study the thermal states, and utilize the Suzuki-Trotter decomposition for the real-time evolution. This study provides insights into the quantum simulation capabilities for modeling the CME and offers a pathway for studying chiral dynamics in low-dimensional quantum field theories.</description>

      <title>A simple high-accuracy method for solving bound-state equations with the Cornell potential in momentum space</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.21789v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a simple, high-accuracy method for solving bound-state integral equations in momentum space with singular kernels. For the case of the linear-confining potential, the associated Cauchy-principal-value singularity is removed by subtraction. Derivatives of the wave function that appear as a result of the subtraction technique are approximated by means of interpolating functions. The resulting non-singular integral equation is solved using the Nystr\"om method. The results show excellent agreement with exactly known energy eigenvalues. By further increasing the number of integration points and the order of the Lagrange interpolation, results with extremely high accuracy can be achieved.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the two-proton ($2p$) emission from $^{16}$Ne with the time-dependent $^{14}$O$+p+p$ three-body calculations. By evaluating the survival probability, a deviation from the exponential decay is obtained, because of the interference of the $0^{+}_1$ and the $0^+_2$ resonances. For the $0^+_1$ resonance, the true emission of the spatially localized two protons is dominant if the single-particle $s_{1/2}$ resonance locates above the $2p$ energy. The $0^+_2$ resonance is predicted at $\cong 2.4$ MeV from the $2p$ threshold.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we present an updated model for nuclear $\pi^0$ photoproduction, which incorporates pion second-order rescattering on intermediate excited nuclear states. Our approach is based on the distorted wave impulse approximation in momentum space. The many-body medium effects are incorporated in the complex effective $\Delta$ self-energy, employing the results of the recently developed second-order pion-nucleus scattering potential. The experimental data for ${}^{12}$C and ${}^{40}$Ca are successfully described without the need to fit the model parameters of the photoproduction amplitude as a result of incorporating the second-order part of nuclear photoproduction potential, which involves intermediate nucleon spin-flip and charge exchange.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a new framework for the low-energy nuclear structure calculations, which describes the single-particle wave function as a superposition of localized Gaussians. It is a hybrid of the Hartree-Fock and antisymmetrized molecular dynamics models. In the numerical calculations of oxygen, calcium isotopes and 100Sn, the framework shows its potential by significantly improving upon AMD and yielding the results consistent with or even better than Hartree-Fock(-Bogoliubov) calculations based on harmonic oscillator expansions. In addition to the basic equations, general form of the matrix elements is also given.</description>

      <title>Hadronic scattering effects on $\Lambda$ polarization in relativistic heavy ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15890v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The $\Lambda$ hyperon spin flip and non-flip cross sections are calculated in a simple hadronic model by including both the $s$-channel process involving the spin 3/2, positive parity $\Sigma^*(1358)$ resonance and the $t$-channel process via the exchange of a scalar $\sigma$ meson. Because of its large mass, the $\Lambda$ spin flip to non-flip cross sections is negligibly small in the $t$-channel process compared to the constant value of 1/3.5 in the $s$-channel process. With the $s-$channel $\Lambda-\pi$ spin-dependent cross sections included in a schematic kinetic model, the effects of hadronic scatterings on the $\Lambda$ spin polarization in Au-Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=7.7$ GeV are studied. It is found that the $\Lambda$ spin polarization only decreases by 7-12\% during the hadronic stage of these collisions, which justifies the assumption in theoretical studies that compare the $\Lambda$ polarization calculated at the chemical freezeout to the measured one at the kinetic freezeout.</description>

      <title>The DIS 1-Jettiness Event Shape at N$^3$LL+${\cal O}(\alpha_s^2)$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.01941v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present results for the $\tau_1$ and $\tau_{1a}$ 1-Jettiness global event shape distributions, for Deep Inelastic Scattering (DIS), at the N$^3$LL + ${\cal O}(\alpha_s^2)$ level of accuracy. These event-shape distributions quantify and characterize the pattern of final state radiation in electron-nucleus collisions. They can be used as a probe of nuclear structure functions, nuclear medium effects in jet production, and for a precision extraction of the QCD strong coupling. The results presented here, along with the corresponding numerical codes, can be used for analyses with HERA data, in EIC simulation studies, and for eventual comparison with real EIC data.</description>

      <title>Orbital Angular Momentum Small-$x$ Evolution: Exact Results in the Large-$N_c$ Limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.05508v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct an exact solution to the revised small-$x$ orbital angular momentum (OAM) evolution equations derived recently, based on an earlier work. These equations are derived in the double logarithmic approximation (summing powers of $\alpha_s \ln^2(1/x)$ with $\alpha_s$ the strong coupling constant and $x$ the Bjorken $x$ variable) and the large-$N_c$ limit, with $N_c$ the number of quark colors. From our solution, we extract the small-$x$, large-$N_c$ expressions of the quark and gluon OAM distributions. Additionally, we determine the large-$N_c$ small-$x$ asymptotics of the OAM distributions to be
  \begin{align}
  \notag
  L_{q+\bar{q}}(x,Q^2) \sim L_G(x,Q^2) \sim \Delta \Sigma (x,Q^2) \sim \Delta G(x,Q^2) \sim \left(\frac{1}{x} \right)^{\alpha_h},
  \end{align} with the intercept $\alpha_h$ the same as obtained in the small-$x$ helicity evolution, which can be approximated as $\alpha_h \approx 3.66074 \sqrt{\frac{\alpha_s N_c}{2\pi}}$. This result is in complete agreement with the literature. Additionally, we calculate the ratio of the quark and gluon OAM distributions to the flavor-singlet quark and gluon helicity parton distribution functions respectively in the small-$x$ region.</description>

      <title>Parametric Matrix Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.11694v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a general class of machine learning algorithms called parametric matrix models. In contrast with most existing machine learning models that imitate the biology of neurons, parametric matrix models use matrix equations that emulate the physics of quantum systems. Similar to how physics problems are usually solved, parametric matrix models learn the governing equations that lead to the desired outputs. Parametric matrix models can be efficiently trained from empirical data, and the equations may use algebraic, differential, or integral relations. While originally designed for scientific computing, we prove that parametric matrix models are universal function approximators that can be applied to general machine learning problems. After introducing the underlying theory, we apply parametric matrix models to a series of different challenges that show their performance for a wide range of problems. For all the challenges tested here, parametric matrix models produce accurate results within an efficient and interpretable computational framework that allows for input feature extrapolation.</description>

      <title>Dual chiral density wave induced oscillating Casimir effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.17638v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Casimir effect is known to be induced from photon fields confined by a small volume, and also its fermionic counterpart has been predicted in a wide range of quantum systems. Here, we investigate what types of Casimir effects can occur from quark fields in dense and thin quark matter. In particular, in the dual chiral density wave, which is a possible ground state of dense quark matter, we find that the Casimir energy oscillates as a function of the thickness of matter. This oscillating Casimir effect is regarded as an analog of that in Weyl semimetals and is attributed to the Weyl points in the momentum space of quark fields. In addition, we show that an oscillation is also induced from the quark Fermi sea, and the total Casimir energy is composed of multiple oscillations.</description>

      <title>Anomalous thresholds in $B\to (P,V)\gamma^*$ form factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14608v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the effects of anomalous thresholds on the non-local form factors describing the hadronization of the light-quark contribution to $B\to(P,V)\gamma^*$ transitions. Starting from a comprehensive discussion of anomalous thresholds in the triangle loop function for different mass configurations, we detail how the dispersion relation for $\pi\pi$ intermediate states is affected by contour deformations mandated by the anomalous branch points. Phenomenological estimates of the size of the anomalous contributions to the form factors are provided with couplings determined from measured branching fractions and Dalitz plot distributions. Our key finding is that anomalous effects are suppressed on the $\rho(770)$ resonance, while off-peak the effects can become as large as $\mathcal{O}(10\%)$ of the full (light-quark-loop induced) non-local form factors. We comment on future generalizations towards higher intermediate states and the charm loop, outlining how the dispersive framework established in this work could help improve the non-local form factors needed as input for a robust interpretation of $B\to (P,V)\ell^+\ell^-$ decays.</description>

      <title>The neutron star mass, distance, and inclination from precision timing of the brilliant millisecond pulsar J0437$-$4715</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07132v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The observation of neutron stars enables the otherwise impossible study of fundamental physical processes. The timing of binary radio pulsars is particularly powerful, as it enables precise characterization of their (three-dimensional) positions and orbits. PSR~J0437$-$4715 is an important millisecond pulsar for timing array experiments and is also a primary target for the Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer (NICER). The main aim of the NICER mission is to constrain the neutron star equation of state by inferring the compactness ($M_p/R$) of the star. Direct measurements of the mass $M_p$ from pulsar timing therefore substantially improve constraints on the radius $R$ and the equation of state. Here we use observations spanning 26 years from Murriyang, the 64-m Parkes radio telescope, to improve the timing model for this pulsar. Among the new precise measurements are the pulsar mass $M_p=1.418\pm 0.044$ $M_{\odot}$, distance $D=156.96 \pm 0.11$ pc, and orbital inclination angle $i=137.506 \pm 0.016^\circ$, which can be used to inform the X-ray pulse profile models inferred from NICER observations. We demonstrate that these results are consistent between multiple data sets from the Parkes Pulsar Timing Array (PPTA), each modeled with different noise assumptions. Using the longest available PPTA data set, we measure an apparent second derivative of the pulsar spin frequency and discuss how this can be explained either by kinematic effects due to the proper motion and radial velocity of the pulsar or excess low-frequency noise such as a gravitational-wave background.</description>
