      <title>Online Trajectory Optimization for Persistent Monitoring Problems in Partitioned Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19769v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of using an autonomous agent to persistently monitor a collection of dynamic targets distributed in an environment. We generalize existing work by allowing the agent's dynamics to vary throughout the environment, leading to a hybrid dynamical system. This introduces an additional layer of complexity towards the planning portion of the problem: we must not only identify in which order to visit the points of interest, but also in which order to traverse the regions. We design an offline high-level sequence planner together with an online trajectory optimizer realizing the computed visiting sequence. We provide numerical experiments to illustrate the performance of our approach.</description>

      <title>Online Feedback Optimization over Networks: A Distributed Model-free Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19834v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Online feedback optimization (OFO) enables optimal steady-state operations of a physical system by employing an iterative optimization algorithm as a dynamic feedback controller. When the plant consists of several interconnected sub-systems, centralized implementations become impractical due to the heavy computational burden and the need to pre-compute system-wide sensitivities, which may not be easily accessible in practice. Motivated by these challenges, we develop a fully distributed model-free OFO controller, featuring consensus-based tracking of the global objective value and local iterative (projected) updates that use stochastic gradient estimates. We characterize how the closed-loop performance depends on the size of the network, the number of iterations, and the level of accuracy of consensus. Numerical simulations on a voltage control problem in a direct current power grid corroborate the theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Constraint relaxation for the Discrete Ordered Median Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19869v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper compares different exact approaches to solve the Discrete Ordered Median Problem (DOMP). In recent years, DOMP has been formulated using set packing constraints giving rise to one of its most promising formulations. The use of this family of constraints, known as strong order constraints (SOC), has been validated in the literature by its theoretical properties and because their linear relaxation provides very good lower bounds. Furthermore, embedded in branch-and-cut or branch-price-and-cut procedures as valid inequalities, they allow one to improve computational aspects of solution methods such as CPU time and use of memory. In spite of that, the above mentioned formulations require to include another family of order constraints, e.g., the weak order constraints (WOC), which leads to coefficient matrices with elements other than {0,1}. In this work, we develop a new approach that does not consider extra families of order constraints and furthermore relaxes SOC -- in a branch-and-cut procedure that does not start with a complete formulation -- to add them iteratively using row generation techniques to certify feasibility and optimality. Exhaustive computational experiments show that it is advisable to use row generation techniques in order to only consider {0,1}-coefficient matrices modeling the DOMP. Moreover, we test how to exploit the problem structure. Implementing an efficient separation of SOC using callbacks improves the solution performance. This allows us to deal with bigger instances than using fixed cuts/constraints pools automatically added by the solver in the branch-and-cut for SOC, concerning both the formulation based on WOC and the row generation procedure.</description>

      <title>Towards Efficient Aggregation of Storage Flexibilities in Power Grids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing penetration of volatile renewables combined with increasing demands poses a challenge to modern power grids. Furthermore, distributed energy resources and flexible devices (electric vehicles, PV generation, ...) are becoming more widespread, making their aggregate usage for ancillary services interesting. However, accurately quantifying the aggregate flexibility of numerous flexible devices is known to be limited by the curse of dimensionality, i.e., it does not scale well computationally. This has led to the development of various approximation algorithms. In this study, we improve upon our previously proposed vertex-based inner approximation, extending it to more general storage devices. We demonstrate the efficacy and accuracy of the proposed method in a case study comparing our approach with an exact centralized control framework, where the flexibility of numerous electric vehicles is combined to reduce the peak load in a residential area.</description>

      <title>Computational Shape Derivatives in Heat Conduction: An Optimization Approach for Enhanced Thermal Performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20181v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze an optimization problem of the conductivity in a composite material arising in a heat conduction energy storage problem. The model is described by the heat equation that specifies the heat exchange between two types of materials with different conductive properties with Dirichlet-Neumann boundary conditions on the external part of the domain, and on the interface characterized by the resisting coefficient between the highly conductive material and the less conductive material. The main purpose of the paper is to compute a shape gradient of an optimization functional in order to accurately determine the optimal location of the conductive material using a classical shape optimization strategy. We also present some numerical experiments to illustrate the efficiency of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Approximation Proximal Subgradient Method for Stochastic Convex-Concave Minimax Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20205v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a stochastic approximation proximal subgradient (SAPS) method for stochastic convex-concave minimax optimization. By accessing unbiased and variance bounded approximate subgradients, we show that this algorithm exhibits ${\rm O}(N^{-1/2})$ expected convergence rate of the minimax optimality measure if the parameters in the algorithm are properly chosen, where $N$ denotes the number of iterations. Moreover, we show that the algorithm has ${\rm O}(\log(N)N^{-1/2})$ minimax optimality measure bound with high probability. Further we study a specific stochastic convex-concave minimax optimization problems arising from stochastic convex conic optimization problems, which the the bounded subgradient condition is fail. To overcome the lack of the bounded subgradient conditions in convex-concave minimax problems, we propose a linearized stochastic approximation augmented Lagrange (LSAAL) method and prove that this algorithm exhibits ${\rm O}(N^{-1/2})$ expected convergence rate for the minimax optimality measure and ${\rm O}(\log^2(N)N^{-1/2})$ minimax optimality measure bound with high probability as well. Preliminary numerical results demonstrate the effect of the SAPS and LSAAL methods.</description>

      <title>An ordinary differential equation for entropic optimal transport and its linearly constrained variants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We characterize the solution to the entropically regularized optimal transport problem by a well-posed ordinary differential equation (ODE). Our approach works for discrete marginals and general cost functions, and in addition to two marginal problems, applies to multi-marginal problems and those with additional linear constraints. Solving the ODE gives a new numerical method to solve the optimal transport problem, which has the advantage of yielding the solution for all intermediate values of the ODE parameter (which is equivalent to the usual regularization parameter). We illustrate this method with several numerical simulations. The formulation of the ODE also allows one to compute derivatives of the optimal cost when the ODE parameter is $0$, corresponding to the fully regularized limit problem in which only the entropy is minimized.</description>

      <title>Risk-Aware Fixed-Time Stabilization of Stochastic Systems under Measurement Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20258v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of risk-aware fixed-time stabilization of a class of uncertain, output-feedback nonlinear systems modeled via stochastic differential equations. First, novel classes of certificate functions, namely risk-aware fixed-time- and risk-aware path-integral-control Lyapunov functions, are introduced. Then, it is shown how the use of either for control design certifies that a system is both stable in probability and probabilistically fixed-time convergent (for a given probability) to a goal set. That is, the system trajectories probabilistically reach the set within a finite time, independent of the initial condition, despite the additional presence of measurement noise. These methods represent an improvement over the state-of-the-art in stochastic fixed-time stabilization, which presently offers bounds on the settling-time function in expectation only. The theoretical results are verified by an empirical study on an illustrative, stochastic, nonlinear system and the proposed controllers are evaluated against an existing method. Finally, the methods are demonstrated via a simulated fixed-wing aerial robot on a reach-avoid scenario to highlight their ability to certify the probability that a system safely reaches its goal.</description>

      <title>Monotone inclusion methods for a class of second-order non-potential mean-field games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a monotone splitting algorithm for solving a class of second-order non-potential mean-field games. Following [Achdou, Capuzzo-Dolcetta, "Mean Field Games: Numerical Methods," SINUM (2010)], we introduce a finite-difference scheme and observe that the scheme represents first-order optimality conditions for a primal-dual pair of monotone inclusions. Based on this observation, we prove that the finite-difference system obtains a solution that can be provably recovered by an extension of the celebrated primal-dual hybrid gradient (PDHG) algorithm.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.20292v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note, based on the recent remarkable results of Dufour and Prieto-Rumeau, we deduce that for an absorbing MDP with a given initial state, under a standard compactness-continuity condition, the space of occupation measures has the same convergent sequences, when it is endowed with the weak topology and with the weak-strong topology. We provided two examples demonstrating that imposed condition cannot be replaced with its popular alternative, and the above assertion does not hold for the space of marginals of occupation measures on the state space. Moreover, the examples also clarify some results in the previous literature.</description>

      <title>Invertibility of Discrete-Time Linear Systems with Sparse Inputs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20294v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the fundamental problems of interest for discrete-time linear systems is whether its input sequence may be recovered given its output sequence, a.k.a. the left inversion problem. Many conditions on the state space geometry, dynamics, and spectral structure of a system have been used to characterize the well-posedness of this problem, without assumptions on the inputs. However, certain structural assumptions, such as input sparsity, have been shown to translate to practical gains in the performance of inversion algorithms, surpassing classical guarantees. Establishing necessary and sufficient conditions for left invertibility of systems with sparse inputs is therefore a crucial step toward understanding the performance limits of system inversion under structured input assumptions. In this work, we provide the first necessary and sufficient characterizations of left invertibility for linear systems with sparse inputs, echoing classic characterizations for standard linear systems. The key insight in deriving these results is in establishing the existence of two novel geometric invariants unique to the sparse-input setting, the weakly unobservable and strongly reachable subspace arrangements. By means of a concrete example, we demonstrate the utility of these characterizations. We conclude by discussing extensions and applications of this framework to several related problems in sparse control.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19847v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We examine how monetary shocks spread throughout an economic model characterized by sticky prices and general equilibrium, where the pricing strategies of firms are interlinked, fostering a mutually beneficial relationship. In this dynamic equilibrium, pricing choices of firms are influenced by overall economic factors, which are themselves affected by these decisions. We approach this situation using a path integral control method, yielding several important insights. We confirm the presence and uniqueness of the equilibrium and scrutinize the impulse response function (IRF) of output subsequent to a shock affecting the entire economy.</description>

      <title>Towards Stable Machine Learning Model Retraining via Slowly Varying Sequences</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19871v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Retraining machine learning models remains an important task for real-world machine learning model deployment. Existing methods focus largely on greedy approaches to find the best-performing model without considering the stability of trained model structures across different retraining evolutions. In this study, we develop a mixed integer optimization algorithm that holistically considers the problem of retraining machine learning models across different data batch updates. Our method focuses on retaining consistent analytical insights - which is important to model interpretability, ease of implementation, and fostering trust with users - by using custom-defined distance metrics that can be directly incorporated into the optimization problem. Importantly, our method shows stronger stability than greedily trained models with a small, controllable sacrifice in model performance in a real-world production case study. Finally, important analytical insights, as demonstrated using SHAP feature importance, are shown to be consistent across retraining iterations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19966v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using single-task deep learning methods to reconstruct Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) data acquired with different imaging sequences is inherently challenging. The trained deep learning model typically lacks generalizability, and the dissimilarity among image datasets with different types of contrast leads to suboptimal learning performance. This paper proposes a meta-learning approach to efficiently learn image features from multiple MR image datasets. Our algorithm can perform multi-task learning to simultaneously reconstruct MR images acquired using different imaging sequences with different image contrasts. The experiment results demonstrate the ability of our new meta-learning reconstruction method to successfully reconstruct highly-undersampled k-space data from multiple MRI datasets simultaneously, outperforming other compelling reconstruction methods previously developed for single-task learning.</description>

      <title>Gate generation for open quantum systems via a monotonic algorithm with time optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20028v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a monotonic numerical algorithm including time optimization for generating quantum gates for open systems. Such systems are assumed to be governed by Lindblad master equations for the density operators on a large Hilbert-space whereas the quantum gates are relative to a sub-space of small dimension. Starting from an initial seed of the control input, this algorithm consists in the repetition of the following two steps producing a new control input: (A) backwards integration of adjoint Lindblad-Master equations (in the Heisenberg-picture) from a set of final conditions encoding the quantum gate to generate; (B) forward integration of Lindblad-Master equations in closed-loop where a Lyapunov based control produced the new control input. The numerical stability is ensured by the stability of both the open-loop adjoint backward system and the forward closed-loop system. A clock-control input can be added to the usual control input. The obtained monotonic algorithm allows then to optimise not only the shape of the control imput, but also the gate time. Preliminary numerical implementations indicate that this algorithm is well suited for cat-qubit gates, where Hilbert-space dimensions (2 for the Z-gate and 4 for the CNOT-gate) are much smaller than the dimension of the physical Hilbert-space involving mainly Fock-states (typically 20 or larger for a single cat-qubit). This monotonic algorithm, based on Lyapunov control techniques, is shown to have a straightforward interpretation in terms of optimal control: its stationary conditions coincides with the first-order optimality conditions for a cost depending linearly on the final values of the quantum states.</description>

      <title>Simple inverse kinematics computation considering joint motion efficiency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20128v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inverse kinematics is an important and challenging problem in the operation of industrial manipulators. This study proposes a simple inverse kinematics calculation scheme for an industrial serial manipulator. The proposed technique can calculate appropriate values of the joint variables to realize the desired end-effector position and orientation while considering the motion costs of each joint. Two scalar functions are defined for the joint variables: one is to evaluate the end-effector position and orientation, whereas the other is to evaluate the motion efficiency of the joints. By combining the two scalar functions, the inverse kinematics calculation of the manipulator is formulated as a numerical optimization problem. Furthermore, a simple algorithm for solving the inverse kinematics via the aforementioned optimization is constructed on the basis of the simultaneous perturbation stochastic approximation with a norm-limited update vector (NLSPSA). The proposed scheme considers not only the accuracy of the position and orientation of the end-effector but also the efficiency of the robot movement. Therefore, it yields a practical result of the inverse problem. Moreover, the proposed algorithm is simple and easy to implement owing to the high calculation efficiency of NLSPSA. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is verified through numerical examples using a redundant manipulator.</description>

      <title>Relationships between Global and Local Monotonicity of Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20227v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The paper is devoted to establishing relationships between global and local monotonicity, as well as their maximality versions, for single-valued and set-valued mappings between finite-dimensional and infinite-dimensional spaces. We first show that for single-valued operators with convex domains in locally convex topological spaces, their continuity ensures that their global monotonicity agrees with the local one around any point of the graph. This also holds for set-valued mappings defined on the real line under a certain connectedness condition. The situation is different for set-valued operators in multidimensional spaces as demonstrated by an example of locally monotone operator on the plane that is not globally monotone. Finally, we invoke coderivative criteria from variational analysis to characterize both global and local maximal monotonicity of set-valued operators in Hilbert spaces to verify the equivalence between these monotonicity properties under the closed-graph and global hypomonotonicity assumptions.</description>

      <title>Implicit Tracking-Based Distributed Constraint-Coupled Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2201.07627v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A class of distributed optimization problem with a globally coupled equality constraint and local constrained sets is studied in this paper. For its special case where local constrained sets are absent, an augmented primal-dual gradient dynamics is proposed and analyzed, but it cannot be implemented distributedly since the violation of the coupled constraint needs to be used. Benefiting from the brand-new comprehending of a classical distributed unconstrained optimization algorithm, the novel implicit tracking approach is proposed to track the violation distributedly, which leads to the birth of the \underline{i}mplicit tracking-based \underline{d}istribut\underline{e}d \underline{a}ugmented primal-dual gradient dynamics (IDEA). A projected variant of IDEA, i.e., Proj-IDEA, is further designed to deal with the general case where local constrained sets exist. With the aid of the Lyapunov stability theory, the convergences of IDEA and Pro-IDEA over undigraphs and digraphs are analyzed respectively. As far as we know, Proj-IDEA is the first constant step-size distributed algorithm which can solve the studied problem without the need of the strict convexity of local cost functions. Besides, if local cost functions are strongly convex and smooth, IDEA can achieve exponential convergence with a weaker condition about the coupled constraint. Finally, numerical experiments are taken to corroborate our theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Square Root LASSO: Well-posedness, Lipschitz stability and the tuning trade off</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.15588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.15588v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies well-posedness and parameter sensitivity of the Square Root LASSO (SR-LASSO), an optimization model for recovering sparse solutions to linear inverse problems in finite dimension. An advantage of the SR-LASSO (e.g., over the standard LASSO) is that the optimal tuning of the regularization parameter is robust with respect to measurement noise. This paper provides three point-based regularity conditions at a solution of the SR-LASSO: the weak, intermediate, and strong assumptions. It is shown that the weak assumption implies uniqueness of the solution in question. The intermediate assumption yields a directionally differentiable and locally Lipschitz solution map (with explicit Lipschitz bounds), whereas the strong assumption gives continuous differentiability of said map around the point in question. Our analysis leads to new theoretical insights on the comparison between SR-LASSO and LASSO from the viewpoint of tuning parameter sensitivity: noise-robust optimal parameter choice for SR-LASSO comes at the "price" of elevated tuning parameter sensitivity. Numerical results support and showcase the theoretical findings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.09408v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Online feedback optimization is a controller design paradigm for optimizing the steady-state behavior of a dynamical system. It employs an optimization algorithm as a dynamic feedback controller and utilizes real-time measurements to bypass knowing exact plant dynamics and disturbances. Different from existing centralized settings, we present a fully decentralized feedback optimization controller for networked systems to lift the communication burden and improve scalability. We approximate the overall input-output sensitivity matrix through its diagonal elements, which capture local model information. For the closed-loop behavior, we characterize the stability and bound the sub-optimality due to decentralization. We prove that the proposed decentralized controller yields solutions that correspond to the Nash equilibria of a non-cooperative game.</description>

Abstract: The safe control of multi-robot swarms is a challenging and active field of research, where common goals include maintaining group cohesion while simultaneously avoiding obstacles and inter-agent collision. Building off our previously developed theory for distributed collaborative safety-critical control for networked dynamic systems, we propose a distributed algorithm for the formation control of robot swarms given individual agent dynamics, induced formation dynamics, and local neighborhood position and velocity information within a defined sensing radius for each agent. Individual safety guarantees for each agent are obtained using rounds of communication between neighbors to restrict unsafe control actions among cooperating agents through safety conditions derived from high-order control barrier functions. We provide conditions under which a swarm is guaranteed to achieve collective safety with respect to multiple obstacles using a modified collaborative safety algorithm. We demonstrate the performance of our distributed algorithm via simulation in a simplified physics-based environment.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11557v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper considers a distributed stochastic non-convex optimization problem, where the nodes in a network cooperatively minimize a sum of $L$-smooth local cost functions with sparse gradients. By adaptively adjusting the stepsizes according to the historical (possibly sparse) gradients, a distributed adaptive gradient algorithm is proposed, in which a gradient tracking estimator is used to handle the heterogeneity between different local cost functions. We establish an upper bound on the optimality gap, which indicates that our proposed algorithm can reach a first-order stationary solution dependent on the upper bound on the variance of the stochastic gradients. Finally, numerical examples are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the algorithm.</description>

Abstract: This paper investigates the application of reachability analysis to the re-entry problem faced by vehicles entering Earth's atmosphere. The study delves into the time evolution of reachable sets for the system, particularly when subject to nonlinear implicit controls, given the potential damage from the intense heat generated during hypersonic re-entry. Our proposed methodology leverages zonotopes and constrained zonotopes to ensure compliance with safety specifications. Furthermore, we utilize Model Predictive Control for detailed trajectory planning. To substantiate our methodology, we provide detailed simulations that not only tackle nonlinear re-entry scenarios but also illustrate trajectory planning using MPC.</description>

      <title>Doubly Optimal No-Regret Online Learning in Strongly Monotone Games with Bandit Feedback</title>

      <description>arXiv:2112.02856v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider online no-regret learning in unknown games with bandit feedback, where each player can only observe its reward at each time -- determined by all players' current joint action -- rather than its gradient. We focus on the class of \textit{smooth and strongly monotone} games and study optimal no-regret learning therein. Leveraging self-concordant barrier functions, we first construct a new bandit learning algorithm and show that it achieves the single-agent optimal regret of $\tilde{\Theta}(n\sqrt{T})$ under smooth and strongly concave reward functions ($n \geq 1$ is the problem dimension). We then show that if each player applies this no-regret learning algorithm in strongly monotone games, the joint action converges in the \textit{last iterate} to the unique Nash equilibrium at a rate of $\tilde{\Theta}(nT^{-1/2})$. Prior to our work, the best-known convergence rate in the same class of games is $\tilde{O}(n^{2/3}T^{-1/3})$ (achieved by a different algorithm), thus leaving open the problem of optimal no-regret learning algorithms (since the known lower bound is $\Omega(nT^{-1/2})$). Our results thus settle this open problem and contribute to the broad landscape of bandit game-theoretical learning by identifying the first doubly optimal bandit learning algorithm, in that it achieves (up to log factors) both optimal regret in the single-agent learning and optimal last-iterate convergence rate in the multi-agent learning. We also present preliminary numerical results on several application problems to demonstrate the efficacy of our algorithm in terms of iteration count.</description>

      <title>Online learning for robust voltage control under uncertain grid topology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.16674v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Voltage control generally requires accurate information about the grid's topology in order to guarantee network stability. However, accurate topology identification is challenging for existing methods, especially as the grid is subject to increasingly frequent reconfiguration due to the adoption of renewable energy. In this work, we combine a nested convex body chasing algorithm with a robust predictive controller to achieve provably finite-time convergence to safe voltage limits in the online setting where there is uncertainty in both the network topology as well as load and generation variations. In an online fashion, our algorithm narrows down the set of possible grid models that are consistent with observations and adjusts reactive power generation accordingly to keep voltages within desired safety limits. Our approach can also incorporate existing partial knowledge of the network to improve voltage control performance. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in a case study on a Southern California Edison 56-bus distribution system. Our experiments show that in practical settings, the controller is indeed able to narrow the set of consistent topologies quickly enough to make control decisions that ensure stability in both linearized and realistic non-linear models of the distribution grid.</description>

Abstract: This work is concerned with the recovery of piecewise constant images from noisy linear measurements. We study the noise robustness of a variational reconstruction method, which is based on total (gradient) variation regularization. We show that, if the unknown image is the superposition of a few simple shapes, and if a non-degenerate source condition holds, then, in the low noise regime, the reconstructed images have the same structure: they are the superposition of the same number of shapes, each a smooth deformation of one of the unknown shapes. Moreover, the reconstructed shapes and the associated intensities converge to the unknown ones as the noise goes to zero.</description>

      <title>A multiobjective continuation method to compute the regularization path of deep neural networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.12044v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sparsity is a highly desired feature in deep neural networks (DNNs) since it ensures numerical efficiency, improves the interpretability of models (due to the smaller number of relevant features), and robustness. For linear models, it is well known that there exists a \emph{regularization path} connecting the sparsest solution in terms of the $\ell^1$ norm, i.e., zero weights and the non-regularized solution. Very recently, there was a first attempt to extend the concept of regularization paths to DNNs by means of treating the empirical loss and sparsity ($\ell^1$ norm) as two conflicting criteria and solving the resulting multiobjective optimization problem for low-dimensional DNN. However, due to the non-smoothness of the $\ell^1$ norm and the high number of parameters, this approach is not very efficient from a computational perspective for high-dimensional DNNs. To overcome this limitation, we present an algorithm that allows for the approximation of the entire Pareto front for the above-mentioned objectives in a very efficient manner for high-dimensional DNNs with millions of parameters. We present numerical examples using both deterministic and stochastic gradients. We furthermore demonstrate that knowledge of the regularization path allows for a well-generalizing network parametrization. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first algorithm to compute the regularization path for non-convex multiobjective optimization problems (MOPs) with millions of degrees of freedom.</description>

      <title>Adaptive, Doubly Optimal No-Regret Learning in Strongly Monotone and Exp-Concave Games with Gradient Feedback</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.14085v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Online gradient descent (OGD) is well known to be doubly optimal under strong convexity or monotonicity assumptions: (1) in the single-agent setting, it achieves an optimal regret of $\Theta(\log T)$ for strongly convex cost functions; and (2) in the multi-agent setting of strongly monotone games, with each agent employing OGD, we obtain last-iterate convergence of the joint action to a unique Nash equilibrium at an optimal rate of $\Theta(\frac{1}{T})$. While these finite-time guarantees highlight its merits, OGD has the drawback that it requires knowing the strong convexity/monotonicity parameters. In this paper, we design a fully adaptive OGD algorithm, \textsf{AdaOGD}, that does not require a priori knowledge of these parameters. In the single-agent setting, our algorithm achieves $O(\log^2(T))$ regret under strong convexity, which is optimal up to a log factor. Further, if each agent employs \textsf{AdaOGD} in strongly monotone games, the joint action converges in a last-iterate sense to a unique Nash equilibrium at a rate of $O(\frac{\log^3 T}{T})$, again optimal up to log factors. We illustrate our algorithms in a learning version of the classical newsvendor problem, where due to lost sales, only (noisy) gradient feedback can be observed. Our results immediately yield the first feasible and near-optimal algorithm for both the single-retailer and multi-retailer settings. We also extend our results to the more general setting of exp-concave cost functions and games, using the online Newton step (ONS) algorithm.</description>

      <title>Optimal Hospital Capacity Management During Demand Surges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15738v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Effective hospital capacity management is pivotal for enhancing patient care quality, operational efficiency, and healthcare system resilience, notably during demand spikes like those seen in the COVID-19 pandemic. However, devising optimal capacity strategies is complicated by fluctuating demand, conflicting objectives, and multifaceted practical constraints. This study presents a data-driven framework to optimize capacity management decisions within hospital systems during surge events. Two key decisions are optimized over a tactical planning horizon: allocating dedicated capacity to surge patients and transferring incoming patients between emergency departments (EDs) of hospitals to better distribute demand. The optimization models are formulated as robust mixed-integer linear programs, enabling efficient computation of optimal decisions that are robust against demand uncertainty. The models incorporate practical constraints and costs, including setup times and costs for adding surge capacity, restrictions on ED patient transfers, and relative costs of different decisions that reflect impacts on care quality and operational efficiency. The methodology is evaluated retrospectively in a hospital system during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic to demonstrate the potential impact of the recommended decisions. The results show that optimally allocating beds and transferring just 32 patients over a 63 day period around the peak, about one transfer every two days, could have reduced the need for surge capacity in the hospital system by nearly 90%. Overall, this work introduces a practical tool to transform capacity management decision-making, enabling proactive planning and the use of data-driven recommendations to improve outcomes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.17247v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a setting in which $N$ agents aim to speedup a common Stochastic Approximation (SA) problem by acting in parallel and communicating with a central server. We assume that the up-link transmissions to the server are subject to asynchronous and potentially unbounded time-varying delays. To mitigate the effect of delays and stragglers while reaping the benefits of distributed computation, we propose \texttt{DASA}, a Delay-Adaptive algorithm for multi-agent Stochastic Approximation. We provide a finite-time analysis of \texttt{DASA} assuming that the agents' stochastic observation processes are independent Markov chains. Significantly advancing existing results, \texttt{DASA} is the first algorithm whose convergence rate depends only on the mixing time $\tau_{mix}$ and on the average delay $\tau_{avg}$ while jointly achieving an $N$-fold convergence speedup under Markovian sampling. Our work is relevant for various SA applications, including multi-agent and distributed temporal difference (TD) learning, Q-learning and stochastic optimization with correlated data.</description>
