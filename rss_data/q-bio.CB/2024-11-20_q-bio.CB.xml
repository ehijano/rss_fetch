      <title>Optimisation of locally advanced MSI-H/dMMR colorectal cancer treatment with neoadjuvant pembrolizumab using data-driven delay integro-differential equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Colorectal cancer (CRC) poses a major public health challenge, with it being the third most commonly diagnosed cancer and the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide as of 2024. Microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) CRC and deficient mismatch repair (dMMR) CRC comprise $15\%$ of all CRC and have shown remarkable response to immunotherapy, especially with PD-1 inhibitors. Mathematical models are a promising avenue for treatment optimisation, and we use delay integro-differential equations to model the interactions and dynamics of various cell types, immune checkpoints, damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), and cytokines. We note that many of these species are being modelled deterministically for the first time in cancer, paving the way for a deeper understanding of the complex underlying immune dynamics. We consider two compartments: the tumour site and the tumour-draining lymph node (TDLN), taking into account phenomena such as DC migration, T cell proliferation, acquired resistance to pembrolizumab, and CD8+ T cell exhaustion and reinvigoration. The parameter values and initial conditions for the model are estimated from experimental data, incorporating various pharmacokinetic, bioanalytical, and radiographic studies, as well as deconvolution of bulk RNA-sequencing data from the TCGA COADREAD database. We finally optimise CRC treatment with neoadjuvant pembrolizumab $\unicode{x2014}$ one of the most used PD-1 inhibitors. We maximise treatment efficacy and efficiency in locally advanced MSI-H/dMMR CRC patients whilst accounting for toxicity, and improve upon currently FDA-approved therapeutic regimens for metastatic MSI-H/dMMR CRC. We demonstrate that a single medium-to-high dose of pembrolizumab is sufficient for durable tumour eradication, whilst being efficient, safe and practical.</description>

      <title>Silanization Strategies for Tailoring Peptide Functionalization on Silicon Surfaces: Implications for Enhancing Stem Cell Adhesion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Biomaterial surface engineering and integrating cell-adhesive ligands are crucial in biological research and biotechnological applications. The interplay between cells and their microenvironment, influenced by chemical and physical cues, impacts cellular behavior. Surface modification of biomaterials profoundly affects cellular responses, especially at the cell-surface interface. This work focuses on enhancing cellular activities through material manipulation, emphasizing silanization for further functionalization with bioactive molecules like RGD peptides to improve cell adhesion. The grafting of three distinct silanes onto silicon wafers using both spin coating and immersion methods was investigated. This study sheds light on the effects of different alkyl chain lengths and protecting groups on cellular behavior, providing valuable insights into optimizing silane-based self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) before peptide or protein grafting for the first time. Specifically, it challenges the common use of APTES molecules in this context. These findings advance our understanding of surface modification strategies, paving the way for tailoring biomaterial surfaces to modulate cellular behavior for diverse biotechnological applications.</description>
