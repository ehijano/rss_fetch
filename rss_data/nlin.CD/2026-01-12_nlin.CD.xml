      <title>Thermodynamics of driven systems via the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05389v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine the differences between the driven turbulence described by the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky (KS) equation and the second law of thermodynamics. A general velocity and entropy density system is analyzed with the unified thermodynamic algorithm of metriplectic dynamics, and we show that the positive spectra of the KS equation due to an external energy source prevent its metriplectic description. A variant of the KS equation is produced that monotonically generates an entropy, but the only equilibria of this variant system are spatially constant. Numerical experiments are performed comparing the evolution of the KS equation and its thermodynamic variant. The entropy of this thermodynamic system is increased further by the driving effects of the KS equation, reconciling the generation of entropy with the energy source of the KS equation. Further numerical experiments restrict the positive spectra in the KS equation to determine the effect on the system time evolution. While rescaling the growth rates of instabilities reproduces similar behavior on a slower time scale, introduction of individual positive spectra reproduces the formation of equilibria, relative equilibria, and a transition to chaos.</description>

      <title>Exploring Chaotic Motion of a Particle in the Centre of a Galaxy with a Prolate Halo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05760v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The majority of galaxies are known to have supermassive black holes (SMBHs) at their core, which have a tremendous gravitational pull on the objects around them. When embedded within extended matter distributions such as prolate, shell-like halos, they give rise to complex gravitational fields that often drive nearby particles into chaotic orbits. The inherently nonlinear nature of such motion, shaped by general relativity, makes direct analysis highly challenging. To overcome this, pseudo-Newtonian potentials are used to approximate relativistic effects within a Newtonian framework. In this study, we model the central SMBH using the Artemova-Bjornsson-Novikov (1996) potential to mimic the rotational effects of a Kerr-like black hole. The surrounding prolate halo is treated as an axisymmetric, shell-like mass distribution, represented through a multipole expansion including dipole and quadrupole components. Poincare sections and the Maximum Lyapunov Exponent (MLE) reveal how the SMBH-halo system drives both order and chaos, with the SMBH spin modulating the dynamics by enhancing or suppressing chaos depending on its direction and magnitude.</description>

      <title>Coherence properties of collective modes in ensembles of oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05963v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Synchronization transition in oscillatory networks manifests itself as the appearance of a periodic global mode. While perfect in the thermodynamic limit, this mode fluctuates for finite ensembles. We characterize the coherence of this mode in terms of the phase diffusion constant. In several examples, we always observed normal diffusion, but the dependence of the diffusion constant on the system size $D\sim N^{-\mu}$ depends on the nature of coupled units: for coupled chaotic systems $\mu=1$, while for coupled periodic oscillators we observe, depending on the particular model, $\mu=2$ and $\mu=2.5$. These large values of the power index are attributed to the size-dependence of collective chaos in the finite ensemble, which disappears in the thermodynamic limit. We also show that in the standard Kuramoto model for a symmetric set of frequencies, there is an additional transition to a symmetric chaotic state with vanishing diffusion of the global phase.</description>

      <title>Covariant Lyapunov vectors as global solutions of a partial differential equation on the phase space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.12543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.12543v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As a new tool to describe the behaviour of a dynamical system, we introduce the concept of "covariant Lyapunov field", i.e. a field which assigns all the components of covariant Lyapunov vectors at almost all points of the phase space. We focus on the case in which these fields are overall continuous and also differentiable along individual trajectories. We show that in ergodic systems such fields can be characterized as the global solutions of a differential equation on the phase space. Due to the arbitrariness in the choice of a multiplicative scalar factor for the Lyapunov vector at each point of the phase space, this differential equation exhibits a gauge invariance that is formally analogous to that of quantum electrodynamics. Under the hypothesis that the covariant Lyapunov field is overall differentiable, we give a geometric interpretation of our result: each 2-dimensional foliation of the space that contains whole trajectories is univocally associated with a Lyapunov exponent, and the corresponding covariant Lyapunov field is one of the generators of the foliation. In order to show with an example how this new approach can be applied to the study of concrete dynamical systems, we display an explicit solution of the differential equations that we have obtained for the covariant Lyapunov fields in a model involving a geodesic flow.</description>

      <title>Insights on structure and influence from the adjacency and Laplacian eigenspectra of intersecting ring networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21294v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A network's community structure commonly impacts its functions. For instance, networks seeking synchronisation will see this process follow the topology's hierarchical and community structuring. Herein, the interplay of network adjacency and Laplacian eigenspectra is shown to uncover hierarchical influence and community structure. Ring networks embedded with hubs of high connectivity are first analysed to characterise the differing insights of the adjacency and Laplacian eigenspectra. This understanding is then transferred to the case study of satellite networks composed of intersecting rings. From these scenarios, it is found that where the adjacency reflects a network's structure, the Laplacian detects nodes' influence profiles. The adjacency identifies the number and relative sizes of salient network structures, for example hubs of high connectivity. In contrast, the Laplacian decomposes these structures in sets of nodes with equivalent influence profiles, where influences emerges due to variations in nodes' connectivity.</description>

      <title>Exact diagonalization study of energy level statistics in harmonically confined interacting bosons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01729v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an exact diagonalization study of the spectral properties of bosons harmonically confined in a quasi-2D plane and interacting via repulsive Gaussian potential. We consider the lowest $100$ energy levels for systems of $N=12, 16$ and $20$ bosons in two distinct regimes: (a) when the interaction energy is small compared to the trap energy (moderate interaction) and (b) when the interaction energy is comparable to the trap energy (strong interaction), for the non-rotating ($L_{z}=0$) as well as the rotating single-vortex state ($L_{z}=N$). For higher angular momenta, $L_{z}=2N$ and $L_{z}=3N$, only the strong interaction regime is considered. While the nearest-neighbor spacing distribution (NNSD) $P(s)$ and the ratios of consecutive level spacings distribution $P(r)$ are used to study the short-range correlations, the Dyson-Mehta $\Delta_3$ statistic and the level number variance $\Sigma^2(L)$ are used to examine the long-range correlations. In the moderate interaction regime, the non-rotating system exhibits Poisson distribution, a characteristic of the regular energy spectra. In the strong interaction regime, the non-rotating system exhibits chaotic behavior signified by GOE distribution. Furthermore, in the rotating case for the single-vortex state ($L_{z} = N$) in the moderate interaction regime, the system exhibits signatures of weak chaos with some degree of regularity in the energy-level spectra. However, in the strong interaction regime for the rotating case with $L_{z} = N$, $2N$ and $3N$, the system exhibits strong chaotic behavior. The rotation is found to contribute to enhancement of chaotic behavior in the system for both the moderate and the strong interaction regimes. Our results of NNSD analysis are supported by the analysis of the ratios of consecutive level spacings distribution $P(r)$, which does not involve unfolding.</description>
