      <title>Mid-Infrared Thermal Radiation Harvesting using Uncooled Narrow Bandgap GeSn Thermophotovoltaic cell</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermophotovoltaic (TPV) cells are increasingly attractive for applications in industrial waste heat harvesting, aerospace energy management, and compact power generation. Deploying midwave-infrared (MWIR) TPV in practical applications requires narrow-bandgap semiconductors that not only absorb low-energy photons but also integrate with scalable, low-cost platforms. Although high-performance TPV devices have been demonstrated using III-V materials such as InAs, GaSb, and InGaAs(P), their use remains limited by cost and substrate size. With this perspective, narrow bandgap GeSn alloys are a promising alternative that extend group-IV absorption into the MWIR while being silicon-compatible. Although the potential of GeSn TPV cells has been predicted, no experimental demonstration has been reported. Here, proof-of-concept Ge$_{0.91}$Sn$_{0.09}$ p-i-n TPV diodes (1 mm diameter) grown on silicon were fabricated and their performance was benchmarked against commercial InAs and extended-InGaAs devices. Measurements at 300 K under 2.33 $\mu$m laser and $\sim$1500 K SiC Globar illumination revealed peak responsivity of $\sim$ 0.2 A/W at $\sim$ 1.7 $\mu$m, and an output power of $\sim$ 0.41 mW/cm$^2$. These devices show trends comparable to those of the InAs diode under identical conditions, although at reduced absolute levels. To assess the intrinsic performance potential, Poisson-drift-diffusion modeling incorporating experimentally calibrated emitter emissivity predicts power densities exceeding 1 W/cm$^2$ under moderate MWIR thermal illumination, indicating that the present devices operate far below their fundamental limits and are primarily constrained by defect-assisted recombination and transport losses. These results establish GeSn as a scalable, silicon-compatible MWIR TPV platform and highlight a larger performance potential achievable through material and device optimization.</description>

      <title>Size-Dependent Properties of Miura-ori Tessellations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the size-dependent behavior of Miura-ori-based origami tessellations by changing the number of origami unit cells. For large tessellations, the Miura-ori sheet generally exhibits a negative in-plane Poisson's ratio, whereas if the size of the Miura-ori tessellations becomes small, the transition between positive and negative Poisson's ratio emerges in the middle of the folding process. Here, we show that such a transitioning point, i.e., zero Poisson's ratio, yields a kinematic locking state. We also experimentally demonstrate the tunable locking behavior altered by tessellation sizes. Extending the analysis to three-dimensional origami tessellations, we find that the direction of kinematic locking changes depending on the tessellation size. Varying tessellation size thus enables control over both the onset and the direction of locking in origami metamaterials.</description>

      <title>Non-reciprocal electrooptic intermodal scattering with momentum engineered RF waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21527v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spatiotemporal modulation approaches have been often employed as alternatives for producing optical non-reciprocity without magneto-optic materials. Unidirectional inter-modal scattering, enabled by either acousto-optic or electro-optic (EO) modulation, is a promising method in this category as it can directly modify optical dispersions and even enables linear non-reciprocal photonic devices in the strong coupling limit. While EO approaches are often preferred for their practicality, it is challenging to generate the large spatiotemporal momentum required for inter-modal phase matching without EO drive schemes involving multiple drive stimuli. Here, we demonstrate highly selective non-reciprocal inter-modal EO scattering enabled by a single high-index radiofrequency (RF) traveling wave stimulus. Our experimental demonstration is performed on a thin-film lithium niobate integrated photonics platform, in which we engineer a slow-wave radiofrequency (SWRF) transmission line with an effective RF index &gt; 9 that natively generates the required RF momentum while simultaneously maintaining strong RF-optical mode overlap. By additionally engineering the interaction length, we achieve a directional ~20 dB non-reciprocal scattering contrast. The SWRF architecture provides a scalable route to magnetic-free non-reciprocity and establishes momentum-engineered RF waves as a powerful tool for next-generation, fully integrated non-reciprocal photonic systems.</description>

      <title>Solderable Microcontroller-Integrated E-Textiles using UV-Tape-Assisted Laser Patterning Technique</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21732v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we developed a UV-tape-assisted laser patterning (UT-Laser) technique that enables the simple transfer-based formation of wiring with line widths below 200 $\mu$m onto textile substrates. With the rapid advancement of wearable devices capable of acquiring various types of physiological and environmental information, research on electronic textiles (e-textiles)-in which electronic components are integrated into fabrics and clothing-has progressed considerably. However, integrating high-performance, rigid electronic components onto textiles remains challenging: the diameter of textile fibers limits the formation of fine wiring, making reliable mounting of such components difficult. To address these challenges, we devised the UT-Laser technique, in which thin foil or film materials are laser vector-cut on UV tape, and the adhesive strength is controlled through UV exposure. The unnecessary portions are selectively and collectively peeled away to form fine wiring, which is subsequently transferred onto the textile substrate. This approach enables facile fabrication of fine wiring with line widths below 200 $\mu$m on textiles. Furthermore, by forming fine wiring from a flexible copper clad laminate and transferring it onto heat-resistant glass cloth, electronic components can be soldered directly, allowing the fabrication of e-textile devices capable of withstanding more than 10,000 bending cycles. The prototype e-textile device fabricated using the proposed method integrates a microcontroller, USB connector, battery holder, flash memory, inertial measurement unit, and environmental sensors, and successfully acquires data related to stair climbing, respiration, and changes in body temperature during sleep.</description>

      <title>Deep squeezing or cooling the fluctuations of a parametric resonator using feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21847v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Here we analyze ways to achieve deep subthreshold parametric squeezing or cooling of a single degree-of-freedom parametric resonator enhanced by a lock-in amplifier feedback loop. Due to the feedback, the dynamics of the parametric resonator becomes more complex and a Hopf bifurcation at the instability threshold can occur. Initially, we calculate the phase-dependent gain of parametric amplification with feedback of an added ac signal. In one approach, we obtain the amplification gain approximately using two independent approaches: the averaging method and the harmonic balance method. We also obtain this gain more exactly using Floquet theory and Green's functions methods. The Hopf bifurcation was predicted by the harmonic balance method and by Floquet theory, but not by the averaging method. In our analysis of fluctuations, we Fourier analyze the response of the parametric resonator with feedback to an added white noise. We were able to calculate, in addition to the noise spectral density, the squeezing of fluctuations in this resonator with feedback. Very strong squeezing or cooling can occur. Deamplification and cooling occur near the Hopf bifurcation, whereas squeezing occurs near a saddle-node bifurcation.</description>

      <title>A Bayesian approach to out-of-sample network reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21869v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Networks underpin systems that range from finance to biology, yet their structure is often only partially observed. Current reconstruction methods typically fit the parameters of a model anew to each snapshot, thus offering no guidance to predict future configurations. Here, we develop a Bayesian approach that uses the information about past network snapshots to inform a prior and predict the subsequent ones, while quantifying uncertainty. Instantiated with a single-parameter fitness model, our method infers link probabilities from node strengths and carries information forward in time. When applied to the Electronic Market for Interbank Deposit across the years 1999-2012, our method accurately recovers the number of connections per bank at subsequent times, outperforming probabilistic benchmarks designed for analogous, link prediction tasks. Notably, each predicted snapshot serves as a reliable prior for the next one, thus enabling self-sustained, out-of-sample reconstruction of evolving networks with a minimal amount of additional data.</description>

      <title>Spatiotemporal Thermal Modulation and Patterning using a Programmable 1024 Element Microheater Array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22138v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Programmable microheater arrays are essential for a variety of applications including gas sensing, microfluidic lab on a chip devices, 3D printers, and biosensors that rely on DNA amplification. Increasing the density and number of heating elements directly correlates with the precision with which spatiotemporal heat profiles can be delivered. However, large arrays have thus far not been realized. One challenge is that as the number of elements in an array increases, the complexity of connecting them grows. Here, we show that row-column addressing provides a promising architecture for the efficient operation of a large micro-heater array. We introduce a programmable 32 x 32 microheater array consisting of individually addressable robust platinum (Pt)-based Joule heating elements- each smaller than 300 micrometer. We show that combining high-voltage multiplexed electronics and sequential addressing controlled by a high frequency clock, allows the independent operation of the 1024 microheater elements. We demonstrate the generation of heat images and the patterning of metallic structures formed from the liquid metal Gallium. Our work demonstrates new capabilities for on-chip thermal devices, and opens the possibility to realize novel heat-controlled microactuation systems.</description>

      <title>Realistic Threat Models for Fiber and Free-Space Continuous-Variable Quantum Key Distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06971v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Future global quantum communication networks, or quantum Internet, will realize high-rate secure communication and entanglement distribution for large-scale users over long distances. Continuous variable (CV) quantum key distribution (QKD) provides a powerful setting for secure quantum communications, thanks to the use of room-temperature off-the-shelf optical devices and the potential to reach high rates. However, the achievable performance of CV-QKD protocols is fundamentally limited by the fact that they appear to be fragile to both loss and noise. In this study, we provide a general framework for analyzing the composable finite-size security of CV-QKD with Gaussian-modulated coherent-state protocol (GMCS) under various levels of trust for the loss and noise experienced by the users of the protocol. Our work is comprehensive of several practical scenarios, encompassing both active and passive eavesdropping configurations, with both wired (i.e., fiber-based) and wireless (i.e., free-space and satellite-based) quantum communication channels. Our numerical results evaluate the robustness of the GMCS protocol under varying levels of trust and demonstrate that it is difficult for a practical protocol to remain robust against untrusted loss at the transmitter. In the wireless case, we analyze a scenario with a sun-synchronous satellite, showing that its key distribution rate, even with the worst level of trust, can outperform a ground chain of ideal quantum repeaters. Our results indicate that, when it comes to engineering and optimizing quantum-safe networks, it is essential to mitigate the shortcomings caused by critical trade-offs between rate performance, trust level, system noise, and communication distance.</description>
