      <title>Quantum fractional revival on unitary Cayley graphs over finite commutative rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03644v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the existence of quantum fractional revival in unitary Cayley graphs over finite commutative rings with identity. We characterize all finite local rings that permit quantum fractional revival in their unitary Cayley graphs. Additionally, we present results for the case of finite commutative rings, as they can be expressed as products of finite local rings.</description>

      <title>Bialgebra theory and $\mathcal O$-operators of admissible Hom-Poisson algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03645v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present and explore several key concepts within the framework of Hom-Poisson algebras. Specifically, we introduce the notions of admissible Hom-Poisson algebras, along with the related ideas of matched pairs and Manin triples for such algebras. We then define the concept of a purely admissible Hom-Poisson bialgebra, placing particular emphasis on its compatibility with the Manin triple structure associated with a nondegenerate symmetric bilinear form. This compatibility is crucial for understanding the structural interplay between these algebraic objects. Additionally, we investigate the notion of Hom-$ \mathcal O$-operators acting on admissible Hom-Poisson algebras. We analyze their properties and establish a connection with admissible Hom-pre-Poisson algebras, shedding light on the relationship between these two structures.</description>

      <title>Third-order Jacobsthal $3$-Parameter Generalized Quaternions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03646v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The purpose of this article is to bring together the third-order Jacobsthal numbers and 3-parameter generalized quaternions, which are a general form of the quaternion algebra according to 3-parameters. With this purpose, we introduce and examine a new type of quite big special numbers system, which is called third-order Jacobsthal 3-parameter generalized quaternions (shortly, third-order Jacobsthal 3PGQs). Further, we compute both some new equations and classical well-known equations such as: linear recurrence, Binet formulas, generating function, sum formulas, Cassini identity and d'Ocagne identity.</description>

      <title>Regular linear time varying DAEs are equivalent to DAEs in strong standard canonical form</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The relationship between solvability of linear diffential-algebraic equations (DAEs) and their transformability into canonical forms has been investigated for more than forty years.
  After a comparative analysis of numerous DAE frameworks the notions regularity and almost regularity were established only recently. Regular DAEs resulted to be equivalently transformable into so-called standard canonical forms (SCF) with block-structured nilpotent matrix functions featuring certain rank properties.
  In this paper we prove that for regular DAEs, even a transformation into a strong standard canonical form (SSCF) is possible, i.e. a SCF with a constant nilpotent matrix. We start from block-structured SCF and give a constructive proof.</description>

      <title>On some admissible lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03659v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores applications of the so-called Freese's technique, a classical approach to study the congruence variety of a given algebra. We leverage this tool to investigate lattices that are admissible as congruence sublattice of a given algebra. In particular, we present a novel characterization of congruence modular varieties, Taylor varieties, and varieties satisfying a non-trivial congruence identity by means of lattice omission.</description>

      <title>Anti-commutative anti-associative algebras. Acaa-algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04092v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $(A,\mu)$ be a nonassociative algebra over a field of characteristic zero. The polarization process allows us to associate two other algebras, and this correspondence is one-one, one commutative, the other anti-commutative. Assume that $\mu$ satisfies a quadratic identity $\sum_{\sigma \in \Sigma_3} a_{\sigma}\mu(\mu(x_{\sigma(i)},x_{\sigma(j)}),x_{\sigma(k)}-a_{\sigma}\mu(x_{\sigma(i)},\mu(x_{\sigma(j)},x_{\sigma(k)})=0.$ Under certain conditions, the polarization of such a multiplication determines an anticommutative multiplication also verifying a quadratic identity. Now only two identities are possible, the first is the Jacobi identity which makes this anticommutative multiplication a Lie algebra and the multiplication $\mu$ is Lie admissible, the second, less classical is given by $[[x,y],z]=[[y,z],x]=[[z,x],y].$ Such a multiplication is here called Acaa for Anticommutative and Antiassociative. We establish some properties of this type of algebras.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.04146v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article focuses on approximately prime rings and approximately prime ideals in proximal relator spaces, especially in descriptive proximity spaces. In particular, we define some binary operations, including the product of two approximately prime ideals and the direct product of approximately prime rings, and study the approximately principle prime ideals. Moreover, we introduce some fundamental properties of these approximately algebraic structures.</description>

      <title>Profinite Direct Sums with Applications to Profinite Groups of Type $\Phi_R$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05182v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the "profinite direct sum" is a good notion of infinite direct sums for profinite modules having properties similar to direct sums of abstract modules. For example, the profinite direct sum of projective modules is projective, and there is a Mackey's Formula for profinite modules described using these sums. As an application, we prove that the class of profinite groups of type $\Phi_R$ is closed under subgroups.</description>

      <title>Existence and characterizations of hyper-dual group inverse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05264v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the recent work of Xiao and Zhong [AIMS Math. 9 (2024), 35125--35150: MR4840882], we propose a generalized inverse for a hyper-dual matrix called hyper-dual group generalized inverse (HDGGI). Under certain necessary and sufficient conditions, we establish the existence of the HDGGI of a hyper-dual matrix. We then show that the HDGGI is unique (whenever exists). The HDGGI is then used to solve a linear hyper-dual system. We also exploit some sufficient conditions under which the reverse and forward-order laws for a particular form of the HDGGI and HDMPGI hold. We also discuss the least-squares properties of hyper-dual group inverse. Using the definition of dual matrix of order $n$, we finally establish necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of the group inverse of a dual matrix of order $n$.</description>

      <title>The rationality problem for multinorm one tori</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.04078v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the rationality problem for multinorm one tori, a natural generalization of norm one tori. We give a necessary and sufficient condition for the multinorm one tori to be stably rational and retract rational in the case that split over finite Galois extensions with nilpotent Galois groups. This generalizes the result of Endo in 2011 on the rationality problem for norm one tori. To accomplish it, we develop the technique of Endo in 2001, and construct some reduction methods for an investigation of the rationality problem for arbitrary multinorm one tori.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.04481v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Extending Sparks's theorem, we determine the cardinality of the lattice of $(C_1,C_2)$-clonoids of Boolean functions for certain pairs $(C_1,C_2)$ of clones of Boolean functions. Namely, when $C_1$ is a subclone (a proper subclone, resp.) of the clone of all linear (affine) functions and $C_2$ is a subclone of the clone generated by a semilattice operation and constants (a subclone of the clone of all $0$- or $1$-separating functions, resp.), then the lattice of $(C_1,C_2)$-clonoids is uncountable.</description>

      <title>Renormalisation in the flow approach for singular SPDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04885v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we study the renormalisation of singular SPDEs in the flow approach recently developed by Duch using a bottom-up setting. We introduce a general ansatz based on decorated trees for the solution of the flow equation. The ansatz is renormalised in a recursive way, in the sense of the trees, via local extractions introduced for regularity structures. We derive the renormalised equation from this ansatz and show that the renormalisation scheme is identical to that appearing in the context of regularity structures, thus matching the BPHZ renormalisation.</description>

      <title>Partially compactified quantum cluster algebras and coordinate rings of simple algebraic groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.05134v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The construction of partially compactified cluster algebras on coordinate rings is handled by using codimension 2 arguments on cluster covers. An analog of this in the quantum situation is highly desirable but has not been found yet. In this paper, we present a general method for the construction of partially compactified quantum cluster algebra structures on quantized coordinate rings from that of quantum cluster algebra structures on localizations. As an application, we construct a partially compactified quantum cluster algebra structure on the quantized coordinate ring of every connected, simply connected complex simple algebraic group. Along the way, we also prove that the Berenstein--Zelevinsky seeds on a quantum double Bruhat cell associated to arbitrary unshuffled signed words can be obtained from each other by successive mutations.</description>

      <title>Classification of Leavitt Path Algebras with Gelfand-Kirillov Dimension &lt;4 up to Morita Equivalence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.06357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.06357v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Leavitt path algebras are associated to di(rected )graphs and there is a combinatorial procedure (the reduction algorithm) making the digraph smaller while preserving the Morita type. We can recover the vertices and most of the arrows of the completely reduced digraph from the module category of a Leavitt path algebra of polynomial growth. We give an explicit classification of all irreducible representations of when the coefficients are a commutative ring with 1. We define a Morita invariant filtration of the module category by Serre subcategories and as a consequence we obtain a Morita invariant (the weighted Hasse diagram of the digraph) which captures the poset of the sinks and the cycles of $\Gamma$, the Gelfand-Kirillov dimension and more. When the Gelfand-Kirillov dimension of the Leavitt path algebra is less than 4, the weighted Hasse diagram (equivalently, the complete reduction of the digraph) is a complete Morita invariant.</description>

In the present paper, we associate semilinear clannish algebras to the (colored) triangulations of a surface with marked points and orbifold points, and exhibit a Morita equivalence between these algebras and the Jacobian algebras constructed a few years ago by Geuenich and the second author.</description>

      <title>Remarks on some Limit Geometric Properties related to an Idempotent and Non-Associative Algebraic Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.07317v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article analyzes the geometric properties of an idempotent, non-associative algebraic structure that extends the Max-Times semiring. This algebraic structure is useful for studying systems of Max-Times and Max-Plus equations, employing an appropriate notion of a non-associative determinant. We consider a connected ultrametric distance and demonstrate that it implies, among other properties, an analogue of the Pythagorean relation. To this end, we introduce a suitable notion of a right angle between two vectors and investigate a trigonometric concept associated with the Chebyshev unit ball. Following this approach, we explore the potential implications of these properties in the complex plane.
  We provide an algebraic definition of a line passing through two points, which corresponds to the Painlev\'e-Peano-Kuratowski limit of a sequence of generalized lines. We establish that this definition leads to distinctive geometric properties; in particular, two distinct parallel lines may share an infinite number of points.</description>

Abstract: The present article is devoted to study the categorical relationships between the categories of Hopf trusses, weak twisted post-Hopf algebras and weak twisted relative Rota-Baxter operators. The latter objects are a generalisation of relative Rota-Baxter operators where the Rota-Baxter condition is modified through a cocycle. Under certain conditions, this work shows that the three aforementioned categories are equivalent.</description>

      <title>A Tale Of Two Modules: Tight Meet Essentially Tight</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12410v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tight and essentially tight modules generalize weakly injective modules. Essential tightness requires embeddings to be essential. This restriction makes the two notions totally different. In this note, we investigate cases when those two notions are the same. Moreover, we look at the cases when essentiallity is imposed only on one of the embeddings rather than both. This allows defining a special class of tight and essentially tight modules and a generalization of both.</description>

      <title>Enriched coverages and sheaves under change of base</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19529v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate how change of enriching base category via a faithful, conservative right adjoint functor interacts with enriched coverages and sheaves on a given enriched category. We prove that change of base via such a functor gives rise both to an injective mapping on subobjects in enriched presheaf categories, and to an injective mapping on enriched coverages. In case the base change functor is also full, the enriched associated sheaf construction on a presheaf category commutes with base change.</description>

      <title>Injective generation for graded rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19574v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we investigate injective generation for graded rings. We first examine the relation between injective generation and graded injective generation for graded rings. We then reduce the study of injective generation for graded rings to the study of injective generation for certain Morita context rings and we provide sufficient conditions for injective generation of the latter. We then provide necessary and sufficient conditions so that injectives generate for tensor rings and for trivial extension rings. We provide two proofs for the class of tensor rings, the one uses covering theory and the other uses the framework of cleft extensions of module categories. We finally prove injective generation for twisted tensor products of finite dimensional algebras.</description>

      <title>$q$-deformation of chromatic polynomials and graphical arrangements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08290v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We first observe a mysterious similarity between the braid arrangement and the arrangement of all hyperplanes in a vector space over the finite field $\mathbb{F}_q$. These two arrangements are defined by the determinants of the Vandermonde and the Moore matrix, respectively. These two matrices are transformed to each other by replacing a natural number $n$ with $q^n$ ($q$-deformation).
  In this paper, we introduce the notion of ``$q$-deformation of graphical arrangements'' as certain subarrangements of the arrangement of all hyperplanes over $\mathbb{F}_q$. This new class of arrangements extends the relationship between the Vandermonde and Moore matrices to graphical arrangements. We show that many invariants of the ``$q$-deformation'' behave as ``$q$-deformation'' of invariants of the graphical arrangements. Such invariants include the characteristic (chromatic) polynomial, the Stirling number of the second kind, freeness, exponents, basis of logarithmic vector fields, etc.</description>
