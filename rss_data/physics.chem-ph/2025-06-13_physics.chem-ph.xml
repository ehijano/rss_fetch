      <title>Laser Guided Microbubble Lithography for Multilayer Biophotonic Heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10320v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The fabrication of multilayered heterostructures is essential for advancing microelectronic and biosensing technologies. Conventional top-down manufacturing techniques are often cost-prohibitive and unsuitable for biomedical applications. Here, we present a bottom-up fabrication method, termed microbubble lithography, which enables the in situ construction of multilayered microstructures through layer-by-layer self-assembly. This technique allows diverse materials to be integrated into coherent heterostructures. We demonstrate the platform's utility by successfully patterning a biomarker and a reporter protein, highlighting its potential for cost-effective and environmentally sustainable sensing applications.</description>

      <title>Transcorrelated Theory for Transition Metal Atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10429v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We benchmark ionisation and excitation energies of transition-metal atoms Sc-Zn with a transcorrelated Hamiltonian combined with pseudopotentials. The similarity transformed Hamiltonian provides compact TC wave functions in affordable aug-cc-pVTZ and aug-cc-pVQZ Gaussian bases and eliminates the need for complete basis set extrapolations. The use of Douglas-Kroll-Hess theory is omitted because scalar relativistic effects are included in the pseudopotentials. Treating the full semicore (3s 3p) valence and freezing only 1s-2p shells, we reach chemical accuracy for all atoms and properties with coupled cluster and full configuration interaction quantum Monte Carlo. Consistent total energies across disparate orbital sets and correlation solvers highlights the robustness of the TC workflow. Our study pushes benchmark-quality quantum chemistry into the 3d block without large-scale basis sets and opens a practical route for transcorrelation to strongly correlated molecules and materials hosting heavier transition metals.</description>

      <title>Machine learning accelerated finite-field simulations for electrochemical interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electrochemical interfaces are of fundamental importance in electrocatalysis, batteries, and metal corrosion. Finite-field methods are one of most reliable approaches for modeling electrochemical interfaces in complete cells under realistic constant-potential conditions. However, previous finite-field studies have been limited to either expensive ab initio molecular dynamics or less accurate classical descriptions of electrodes and electrolytes. To overcome these limitations, we present a machine learning-based finite-field approach that combines two neural network models: one predicts atomic forces under applied electric fields, while the other describes the corresponding charge response. Both models are trained entirely on first-principles data without employing any classical approximations. As a proof-of-concept demonstration in a prototypical Au(100)/NaCl(aq) system, this approach not only dramatically accelerates fully first-principles finite-field simulations but also successfully extrapolates to cell potentials beyond the training range while accurately predicting key electrochemical properties. Interestingly, we reveal a turnover of both density and orientation distributions of interfacial water molecules at the anode, arising from competing interactions between the positively charged anode and adsorbed Cl$^-$ ions with water molecules as the applied potential increases. This novel computational scheme shows great promise in efficient first-principles modelling of large-scale electrochemical interfaces under potential control.</description>

      <title>Zero-energy band observation in an interfacial chalcogen-organic network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Structurally-defined molecule-based lattices such as covalent organic or metal-organic networks on substrates, have emerged as highly tunable, modular platforms for two-dimensional band structure engineering. The ability to grow molecule-based lattices on diverse platforms, such as metal dichalcogenides, would further enable band structure tuning and alignment to the Fermi level, which is crucial for the exploration and design of quantum matter. In this work, we study the emergence of a zero-energy band in a triarylamine-based network on semiconducting 1T-TiSe2 at low temperatures, by means of scanning probe microscopy and photoemission spectroscopy, together with density-functional theory. Hybridization between the position-selective nitrogens and selenium p-states results in CN-Se interfacial coordination motifs, leading to a hybrid molecule-semiconductor band at the Fermi level. Our findings introduce chalcogen-organic networks and showcase an approach for the engineering of organic-inorganic quantum matter.</description>

      <title>Time-dependent Gaussian basis sets for many-body systems using Rothe's method: A mean-field study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10701v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A challenge in modeling time-dependent strong-field processes such as high-harmonic generation for many-body systems, is how to effectively represent the electronic continuum. We apply Rothe's method to the time-dependent Hartree-Fock (TDHF) and density functional theory (TDDFT) equations of motion for the orbitals, which reformulates them as an optimization problem. We show that thawed, complex-valued Gaussian basis sets can be propagated efficiently for these orbital-based approaches, removing the need for grids. In particular, we illustrate that qualitatively correct results can often be obtained by using just a few fully flexible Gaussians that describe the unbound dynamics for both TDHF and TDDFT. Grid calculations can be reproduced quantitatively using $30$--$100$ Gaussians for intensities up to $4\times10^{14}$ W/cm$^2$ for the one-dimensional molecular systems considered in this work.</description>

      <title>Slimmer Geminals For Accurate F12 Electronic Structure Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10780v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Slater-type F12 geminal lengthscales originally tuned for the second-order M{\o}ller-Plesset F12 method are too large for higher-order F12 methods formulated using the SP (diagonal fixed-coefficient spin-adapted) F12 ansatz. The new geminal parameters reported herein reduce the basis set incompleteness errors (BSIE) of absolute coupled-cluster singles and doubles F12 correlation energies by a significant - and increasing with the cardinal number of the basis - margin. The effect of geminal reoptimization is especially pronounced for the cc-pVXZ-F12 basis sets (specifically designed for use with F12 methods) relative to their conventional aug-cc-pVXZ counterparts. The BSIEs of relative energies are less affected but substantial reductions can be obtained, especially for atomization energies and ionization potentials with the cc-pVXZ-F12 basis sets. The new geminal parameters are therefore recommended for all applications of high-order F12 methods, such as the coupled-cluster F12 methods and the transcorrelated F12 methods.</description>

      <title>Deep Potential-Driven Molecular Dynamics of CO Ice Analogues: Investigating Desorption Following Vibrational Excitation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10882v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new deep learning-based machine learning potential (MLP) for molecular dynamics simulations of solid carbon monoxide (CO), capable of accurately describing CO vibrations both in the fundamental state and in highly excited vibrational states, up to approximately v = 40. The MLP is based on the combination of high-dimensional neural network atomic potentials using the DeePMD-kit package, trained on prior ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) data, with selective treatment of the excited molecule allowing us to capture complex energy redistribution dynamics in condensed-phase environments. In particular, the MLP is capable of accurately describing the desorption process of a single CO molecule within an aggregate of 50 CO molecules, in excellent agreement with both previous theoretical predictions and experimental measurements. The MLP provides a much finer description of the translational and rotational energy distributions, capturing their character with high fidelity and allowing a more detailed comparison with experimental results. Furthermore, the analysis of the rotational energy, resolved over specific translational energies, revealed new insights into the coupling between translational and rotational degrees of freedom during the photodesorption process. This novel approach opens new perspectives for extensive statistical studies on desorption energies and detailed investigations of surface molecule excitations and the exploration of larger-scale models incorporating periodic boundary conditions to simulate more realistic CO aggregates.</description>

      <title>Coupled Lindblad pseudomode theory for simulating open quantum systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10308v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Coupled Lindblad pseudomode theory is a promising approach for simulating non-Markovian quantum dynamics on both classical and quantum platforms, with dynamics that can be realized as a quantum channel. We provide theoretical evidence that the number of coupled pseudomodes only needs to scale as $\mathrm{polylog}(T/\varepsilon)$ in the simulation time $T$ and precision $\varepsilon$. Inspired by the realization problem in control theory, we also develop a robust numerical algorithm for constructing the coupled modes that avoids the non-convex optimization required by existing approaches. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method by computing population dynamics and absorption spectra for the spin-boson model. This work provides a significant theoretical and computational improvement to the coupled Lindblad framework, which impacts a broad range of applications from classical simulations of quantum impurity problems to quantum simulations on near-term quantum platforms.</description>

      <title>Exact series expansion for even frequency moments of the dynamic structure factor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10410v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An exact series representation of the even frequency moments of the dynamic structure factor is derived. Truncations are proposed that allow to evaluate the explicitly unknown second, fourth and fifth frequency moments for the finite temperature uniform electron gas. Their applicability range in terms of degeneracy parameter and wavenumber is determined by exploiting the non-interacting limit and by comparing with the quasi-exact results of path integral Monte Carlo simulations.</description>

      <title>Dipole-quadrupole coupling in triplet exciton-polaron quenching in a phosphorescent OLED emission layer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10794v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Improving the efficiency and stability of organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) will further expand their present success in display applications. Triplet exciton-polaron quenching (TPQ) is an important cause of limited efficiency and stability in modern phosphorescent OLEDs, where triplet excitons are the emitting species. Lack of understanding of the TPQ mechanism in these OLEDs impedes the development of more efficient and stable OLEDs. We investigate the TPQ mechanism for triplet excitons on a phosphorescent guest interacting with hole polarons on a host. Our quantum-chemical calculations show that at distances relevant for TPQ the F\"orster approximation for the TPQ rate fails and that dipole-quadrupole coupling is dominant. This resolves a discrepancy between estimates of the TPQ rate obtained from an OLED device study and from the overlap between the emission spectrum of the emitter and absorption spectrum of the charged host. Equivalently to the F\"orster radius for dipole-dipole TPQ, the dipole-quadrupole TPQ rate can be quantified by a dipole-quadrupole radius obtained from the overlap between the emission spectrum of the emitter and the quadrupolar absorption spectrum of the charged host. The findings of this work are expected to have a broad relevance and to be useful in developing phosphorescent emitter-host combinations with reduced TPQ.</description>

      <title>High-resolution spectroscopy of barium monofluoride: Odd isotopologues, hyperfine structure and isotope shifts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10940v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Barium monofluoride (BaF) is a promising molecular species for precision tests of fundamental symmetries and interactions. We present a combined theoretical and experimental study of BaF spectra and isotope shifts, focusing in particular on the poorly understood odd isotopologues 137BaF and 135BaF. By comparing state-of-the-art ab initio calculations with high-resolution fluorescence and absorption spectroscopy data, we provide a benchmark for electronic structure theory and disentangle the hyperfine and rovibrational spectra of the five most abundant isotopologues, from 138BaF to 134BaF. The comprehensive knowledge gained enables a King plot analysis of the isotope shifts that reveals the odd-even staggering of the barium nuclear charge radii. It also paths the way for improved laser cooling of rare BaF isotopologues and crucially supports future measurements of nuclear anapole and Schiff moments.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10944v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding and controlling the atomistic-level reactions governing the formation of the solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI) is crucial for the viability of next-generation solid state batteries. However, challenges persist due to difficulties in experimentally characterizing buried interfaces and limits in simulation speed and accuracy. We conduct large-scale explicit reactive simulations with quantum accuracy for a symmetric battery cell, {\symcell}, enabled by active learning and deep equivariant neural network interatomic potentials. To automatically characterize the coupled reactions and interdiffusion at the interface, we formulate and use unsupervised classification techniques based on clustering in the space of local atomic environments. Our analysis reveals the formation of a previously unreported crystalline disordered phase, Li$_2$S$_{0.72}$P$_{0.14}$Cl$_{0.14}$, in the SEI, that evaded previous predictions based purely on thermodynamics, underscoring the importance of explicit modeling of full reaction and transport kinetics. Our simulations agree with and explain experimental observations of the SEI formations and elucidate the Li creep mechanisms, critical to dendrite initiation, characterized by significant Li motion along the interface. Our approach is to crease a digital twin from first principles, without adjustable parameters fitted to experiment. As such, it offers capabilities to gain insights into atomistic dynamics governing complex heterogeneous processes in solid-state synthesis and electrochemistry.</description>

      <title>Learning Radical Excited States from Sparse Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.10149v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Emissive organic radicals are currently of great interest for their potential use in the next generation of highly efficient organic light emitting diode (OLED) devices and as molecular qubits. However, simulating their optoelectronic properties is challenging, largely due to spin-contamination and the multireference character of their excited states. Here we present a data-driven approach where, for the first time, the excited electronic states of organic radicals are learned directly from experimental excited state data, using a much smaller amount of data than typically required by Machine Learning. We adopt ExROPPP, a fast and spin-pure semiempirical method for calculation of the excited states of radicals, as a surrogate physical model for which we learn the optimal set of parameters. To achieve this we compile the largest known database of organic radical geometries and their UV-vis data, which we use to train our model. Our trained model gives Root Mean Square (RMS) and mean absolute errors for excited state energies of 0.24 and 0.16 eV respectively, improving hugely over ExROPPP with literature parameters. Four new organic radicals are synthesised and we test the model on their spectra, finding even lower errors and similar correlation as for the testing set. This model paves the way for the high throughput discovery of next generation radical-based optoelectronics.</description>

      <title>Refining Coarse-Grained Molecular Topologies: A Bayesian Optimization Approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.02707v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations are essential for accurately predicting the physical and chemical properties of large molecular systems across various pressure and temperature ensembles. However, the high computational costs associated with All-Atom (AA) MD simulations have led to the development of Coarse-Grained Molecular Dynamics (CGMD), providing a lower-dimensional compression of the AA structure into representative CG beads, offering reduced computational expense at the cost of predictive accuracy. Existing CGMD methods, such as CG-Martini (calibrated against experimental data), aim to generate an embedding of a topology that sufficiently generalizes across a range of structures. Detrimentally, in attempting to specify parameterization with applicability across molecular classes, it is unable to specialize to domain-specific applications, where sufficient accuracy and computational speed are critical. This work presents a novel approach to optimize derived results from CGMD simulations by refining the general-purpose Martini3 topologies specifically the bonded interaction parameters within a given coarse-grained mapping - for domain-specific applications using Bayesian Optimization methodologies. We have developed and validated a CG potential applicable to any degree of polymerization, representing a significant advancement in the field. Our optimized CG potential, based on the Martini3 framework, aims to achieve accuracy comparable to AAMD while maintaining the computational efficiency of CGMD. This approach bridges the gap between efficiency and accuracy in multiscale molecular simulations, potentially enabling more rapid and cost-effective molecular discovery across various scientific and technological domains.</description>

Abstract: Quantum simulation of materials is a promising application area of quantum computers. To practically realize this promise, we must reduce quantum resources while maintaining accuracy. In electronic structure calculations on classical computers, resource reduction has been achieved by using the projector augmented-wave method (PAW) and plane wave basis sets. However, the PAW method generalized for many-body states introduces non-orthogonality effects which impede its direct application to quantum computing. In this work, we develop a unitary variant of the PAW (UPAW) that preserves the orthogonality constraints. We provide a linear-combination-of-unitaries decomposition of the UPAW Hamiltonian to enable ground state estimation using qubitized quantum phase estimation. Additionally, we further improve algorithmic efficiency by extending classical down-sampling techniques into the quantum setting. We then estimate quantum resources for crystalline solids to estimate the energy within chemical accuracy with respect to the full basis set limit, and also consider a supercell approach which is more suitable for calculations of defect states. We provide the quantum resources for energy estimation of a nitrogen-vacancy defect centre in diamond which is a challenging system for classical algorithms and a quintessential problem in the studies of quantum point defects.</description>

      <title>Tailoring the Electronic Configurations of YPc$_2$ on Cu(111): Decoupling Strategies for Molecular Spin Qubits Platforms</title>

Abstract: Among the potential spin qubit candidates, yttrium phthalocyanine double-decker (YPc$_2$) features a diamagnetic metal ion core that stabilizes the molecular structure, while its magnetic properties arise primarily from an unpaired electron (S=1/2) delocalized over the two phthalocyanine (Pc) ligands. Understanding its properties in the proximity of metal electrodes is crucial to assess its potential use in molecular spin qubits architectures. Here, we investigated the morphology and electronic structure of this molecule adsorbed on Cu(111) surface using scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). On Cu(111), YPc$_2$ adsorbs flat, with isolated molecules showing a preferred orientation along the &lt;111&gt; crystal axes. Moreover, we observed two different types of self-assembly molecular packing when growing molecular patches. For YPc$_2$ in direct contact with Cu(111), STM revealed a widely separated highest occupied and lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (HOMO/LUMO), suggesting the quenching of the unpaired spin. Conversely, when YPc$_2$ is separated from the metal substrate by a few-layer thick diamagnetic zinc phthalocyanine (ZnPc) layer, we found the HOMO to split into singly occupied and singly unoccupied molecular orbitals (SOMO/SUMO). We observed that more than 2 layers of ZnPc are needed to avoid intermixing between the two molecules and spin quenching in YPc2. Density functional theory (DFT) reveals the spin quenching is due to the hybridization between YPc$_2$ and Cu(111) states, confirming the importance of using suitable decoupling layers to preserve the unpaired molecular spin. Our results suggest the potential of YPc$_2$/ZnPc heterostructures as a stable and effective molecular spin qubit platform and validate the possibility of integrating this molecular spin qubit candidate in future quantum logic devices.</description>
