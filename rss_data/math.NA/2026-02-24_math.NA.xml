      <title>Sparse Dictionary-Based Solution of Dynamic Inverse Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In ill-posed dynamic inverse problems expected spatial features and temporal correlation between frames can be leveraged to improve the quality of the computed solution, in particular when the available data are limited and the dimensionality of the unknown is large. One way to take advantage of the spatial and temporal traits believed to characterize the solution is to encode them into the entries of a dictionary, and to seek the solution as a sparse linear combination of the dictionary atoms. To promote a vector of coefficients with mostly vanishing entries, we consider a stochastic extension of the dictionary coding problem model with a random hierarchical sparsity promoting prior. We compute the Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) estimate of the coefficient vector using the Iterative Alternating Sequential Algorithm (IAS), which has been demonstrated to efficiently solve inverse problems with minimal need for parameter tuning. The proposed methodology is tested on real-world dynamic Computed Tomography and MRI datasets, where it is compared to the popular Alternating Direction Method of Minimizers (ADMM). The computed examples show the that proposed methodology is competitive with the ADMM for compressed sensing, with a significantly lower sensitivity to hyper-parameter selection.</description>

      <title>Discretization in Multilayered Media with High Contrasts: Is It All About the Boundaries?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18629v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wave propagation in multilayered media with high material contrasts poses significant numerical challenges, as large variations in wavenumbers lead to strong reflections and complex transmission of the incoming wave field. To address these difficulties, we employ a boundary integral formulation thereby avoiding volumetric discretization. In this framework, the accuracy of the numerical solution depends strongly on how the material interfaces are discretized. In this work, we demonstrate that standard meshing strategies based on resolving the maximum wavenumber across the domain become computationally inefficient in multilayered configurations, where high wavenumbers are confined to localized subdomains. Through a systematic study of multilayer transmission problems, we show that no simple discretization rule based on the maximum wavenumber or material contrasts emerges. Instead, the wavenumber of the background (exterior) medium plays a dominant role in determining the optimal boundary resolution. Building on these insights, we propose an adaptive approach that achieves uniform accuracy and efficient computation across multiple layers. Numerical experiments for a range of multilayer configurations demonstrate the scalability and robustness of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>From an Elementary Proof of Error Representation for Hermite Quadrature to a Rediscovery of Legendre Polynomials and Rodrigues Formula</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We generalize two-point interpolatory Hermite quadrature to functions with available values and the first (n-1) derivatives at both end points. Armed with integration by parts in the reverse form we provide an elementary derivation of an exact error represenation of Hermite quadrature rule. This approach possesses several advantages over the classical approaches: i) Only integration by parts is needed for the derivation; ii) the error representation requires much milder regularity, namely the existence of nth-order derivative rather than a (2n)th-order derivative of the function under consideration. As a result, our error formula is valid for less regular functions for which the classical ones are not valid; iii) our approach rediscovers Legendre polynomials and more interestingly it provides a surprisingly elegant relation between Legendre polynomial and Hermite interpolation. In particular, Legendre polynomials are precisely the error kernels for interpolatory Hermite quadrature rules; and iv) We also rediscover the Rodrigues formula for Legendre polynomials as part of our findings. For those who are interested in a different proof of the exact error representation for Hermite quadrature rule, we provide an alternative proof using the Peano kernel theorem. We also provide a composite interpolatory Hermite quadrature rule for practical applications.</description>

      <title>Constructive discretization and approximation in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18719v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We generalize the sparsification algorithm of Batson, Spielman and Srivastava, making one part of the result dimension-independent. In particular, we recover discretization inequalities in $L_2$- and sup-norms on general finite-dimensional subspaces, prove a suitable infinite-dimensional variant, and discuss the implications for the error of least-squares approximation based on samples. This gives a more constructive version of several recently established approximation bounds, some of which relied on the stronger and less constructive result of Marcus, Spielman and Srivastava. We also improve the constants and oversampling factors in these results.</description>

      <title>Finite element methods for isometric embedding of Riemannian manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18722v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The isometric embedding problem for Riemannian manifolds, which connects intrinsic and extrinsic geometry, is a central question in differential geometry with deep theoretical significance and wide-ranging applications. Despite extensive analytical progress, the nonlinear and degenerate nature of this problem has hindered the development of rigorous numerical analysis in this area. As the first step toward addressing this gap, we study the numerical approximation of Weyl's problem, i.e., the isometric embedding of two-dimensional Riemannian manifolds with positive Gaussian curvature into $\mathbb{R}^3$, by establishing a new weak formulation that naturally leads to a numerical scheme well suited for high-order finite element discretization, and conducting a systematic analysis to prove the well-posedness of this weak formulation, the existence and uniqueness of its numerical solution, as well as its convergence with error estimates. This provides a foundational framework for computing isometric embeddings of Riemannian manifolds into Euclidean space, with the goal of extending it to a broader range of cases and applications in the future. Our framework also extends naturally to the isometric embedding of the Ricci flow, with rigorous error estimates, enabling the visualization of geometric evolutions in intrinsic curvature flows. Numerical experiments support the theoretical analysis by demonstrating the convergence of the method and its effectiveness in simulating isometric embeddings of given Riemannian manifolds as well as Ricci flows.</description>

      <title>Structure-preserving Krylov Subspace Approximations for the Matrix Exponential of Hamiltonian Matrices: A Comparative Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18937v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study structure-preserving Krylov subspace methods for approximating the matrix-vector products f(H)b, where H is a large Hamiltonian matrix and f denotes either the matrix exponential or the related phi-function. Such computations are central to exponential integrators for Hamiltonian systems. Standard Krylov methods generally destroy the Hamiltonian structure under projection, motivating the use of Krylov bases with J-orthogonal columns that yield Hamiltonian projected matrices and symplectic reduced exponentials. We compare several such structure-preserving Krylov methods on representative Hamiltonian test problems, focusing on accuracy, efficiency, and structure preservation, and briefly discuss adaptive strategies for selecting the Krylov subspace dimension.</description>

      <title>Computing the SVD efficiently with photonic chips</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18950v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In light of today's massive data processing, digital computers are reaching fundamental performance limits due to physical limitations and energy consumption. For specific applications, tailored analog systems offer promising alternatives to digital processors. In this work, we investigate the potential of linear photonic chips for accelerating the computation of the singular value decomposition (SVD) of a matrix. The SVD is a key primitive in linear algebra and forms a crucial component of various modern data processing algorithms. Our main insights are twofold: first, hybrid systems of digital controller and photonic chip asymptotically perform on par with large-scale CPU/GPU systems in terms of runtime. Second, such hybrid systems clearly outperform digital systems in terms of energy consumption.</description>

      <title>On the convergence of explicit formulas for $L^2$ solutions to the Benjamin-Ono and continuum Calogero-Moser equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19046v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By developing discrete counterparts to recent advances in nonlinear integrability, and in particular to the discovery of explicit formulas, we design and analyze fully-discrete approximations to the Benjamin-Ono (BO) and continuum Calogero-Moser (CCM) equations on the torus. We build on the key observation that discretizing such explicit formulas yields schemes that are exact in time (requiring only spatial discretization) and have a computational cost independent of the final time $T$. In this work, we first generalize the fully-discrete schemes of arXiv:2412.13480 to include numerical approximations with better structure preservation properties, including the conservation of mass and momentum in the case of the (BO) equation. Secondly, building on recent analyses of the corresponding Lax operators, we extend the convergence results to this class of schemes for rough solutions $u(t)$ merely belonging to $L^2(\mathbb{T})$ for (BO) and $L^2_{+}(\mathbb{T})$ for (CCM), the latter of which is precisely the scaling-critical regularity. Our main theorem states that the $L^2(\mathbb{T})$-norm of the error goes to zero as the truncation parameters go to infinity, uniformly on any bounded time interval $[-T,T]$. As an example, we apply our scheme to the (BO) equation with a square-wave initial profile, and obtain the first numerical evidence of the Talbot effect for (BO) supported by a rigorous convergence result.</description>

      <title>Forward Error-Oriented Iterative Refinement for Eigenvectors of a Real Symmetric Matrix</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we discuss numerical methods for the eigenvalue decomposition of real symmetric matrices. While many existing methods can compute approximate eigenpairs with sufficiently small backward errors, the magnitude of the resulting forward errors is often unknown. Consequently, when high-precision numerical solutions are required, the computational cost tends to increase significantly because backward errors must be reduced to an excessive degree. To address this issue, we propose an efficient approximation algorithm that aims to achieve a prescribed forward error, together with a high-accuracy numerical algorithm based on the Ozaki scheme -- an emulation technique for matrix multiplication -- adapted to this problem. Since the proposed method is not primarily focused on reducing backward errors, the computational cost can be significantly reduced. Finally, we present numerical experiments to evaluate the efficiency of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>A median-filter-based framework for interface optimal design problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a robust and efficient numerical framework based on a median filter scheme for solving a broad class of interface-related optimization problems, from image segmentation to topology optimization. A key innovation of our work is the extension of the binary scheme into a continuous level-set scheme via a weighted quantile interpretation. Unlike traditional binary iterative convolution-thresholding method (ICTM), this continuous median filter scheme effectively overcomes the pinning effect caused by spatial discretization, achieving accurate interface evolution even with small time steps. We also provide a rigorous theoretical analysis, proving the unconditional energy stability of the iterative scheme. Furthermore, we prove that for a wide class of data fidelity terms, the convex relaxation inherently enforces a binary solution, justifying the effectiveness of the method without explicit penalization. Numerical experiments on the Chan--Vese model, the local intensity fitting (LIF) model, and topology optimization in Stokes flow demonstrate that the proposed efficient continuous framework effectively eliminates the pinning effect, guarantees unconditional energy stability, and accurately converges to binary solutions.</description>

      <title>Parametric charge-conservative mixed finite element method for 3D incompressible inductionless MHD equations on curved domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19375v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper develops a charge-conservative mixed finite element method with optimal convergence rates for the stationary incompressible inductionless MHD equations on three-dimensional curved domains. The discretization employs the isoparametric Taylor-Hood elements with grad-div stabilization for the velocity-pressure pair, and parametric Brezzi-Douglas-Marini elements for the current density. Utilizing the Piola's transformation, the discrete current density is exactly divergence-free. By employing suitable extensions and projections, optimal a priori error estimates are derived in both the energy norm and the $L^2$-norm. Numerical experiments are presented to confirm the theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Dekker's floating point number system and compensated summation algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19452v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent hardware trend towards reduced precision computing has reignited the interest in numerical techniques that can be used to enhance the accuracy of floating point operations beyond what is natively supported for basic arithmetic operations on the hardware. In this work, we study the behavior of various compensated summation techniques, which can be used to enhance the accuracy for the summation operation, particularly in situations when the addends are not known a priori. Complete descriptions of the error behavior are provided for these techniques. In particular, the relationship between the intermediate results at two consecutive summing steps is provided, which is used to identify the operation that limits accuracy and guide the design of more nuanced techniques. The analysis relies on the work of Dekker [Numerische Mathematik, 1971], which uses a special floating point number system that does not require uniqueness in the number representation. Despite this seemingly strange attribute, Dekker's system is very convenient for the analysis here and allows general statements to be expressed succinctly compared to a number system that requires uniqueness. To prepare the foundation for discussion, we start by giving a thorough exhibition of Dekker's number system and supply the details that were omitted in Dekker [Numerische Mathematik, 1971]. Numerical examples are designed to explain the inner workings of these compensated summation techniques, illustrate their efficacy, and empirically verify the analytical results derived. Discussions are also given on application scenarios where these techniques can be beneficial.</description>

      <title>Optimal Error Estimates of a new Multiphysic Finite Element Method for Nonlinear Poroelasticity model with Hencky-Mises Stress Tensor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19457v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop a new multiphysics finite element method for a nonlinear poroelastic model with Hencky-Mises stress tensor. By introducing some new notations, we reformulate the original model into a fluid-fluid coupling problem, which is viewed as a generalized nonlinear Stokes sub-problem combined with a reaction-diffusion sub-problem. Then, we establish the existence and uniqueness of the weak solution for the reformulated problem, and propose a stable, fully discrete multiphysics finite element method which employs Lagrangian finite element pairs for spatial discretization and a backward Euler scheme for temporal discretization. By ensuring the parameters $\kappa_1$ and $\kappa_3$ remain bounded and non-zero even as $\lambda$ tends to infinity, the proposed method maintains stability for a wide range of Lagrangian element pairs. Based on the continuity and monotonicity of the nonlinear term $\mathcal{N}(\varepsilon(\mathbf{u}_h^{n}))$, we give the stability analysis and derive optimal error estimates for the displacement vector $\mathbf{u}$ and the pressure $p$ in both $L^2$-norm and $H^1$-norm. In particular, the $L^2$-norm error estimate for the displacement $\mathbf{u}$, which was not present in previous literature, is established here through an auxiliary problem and a Poincar$\acute{e}$ inequality. Also, we present numerical tests to verify the theoretical analysis, and the results confirm the optimal convergence rates. Finally, we draw conclusions to summarize the work.</description>

      <title>Extreme $L_p$ discrepancy, numerical integration and the curse of dimensionality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19760v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The classical notion of extreme $L_p$ discrepancy is a quantitative measure for the irregularity of distribution of finite point sets in the $d$-dimensinal unit cube. In this paper we find a dual integration problem whose worst-case error is exactly the extreme $L_p$ discrepancy of the underlying integration nodes. Studying this integration problem we show that the extreme $L_p$ discrepancy suffers from the curse of dimensionality for all $p \in (1,\infty)$. It is known that the problem is tractable for $p=\infty$; the case $p=1$ stays open.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19854v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we derive an optimal $L^2$-norm error estimate of the multiphysics finite element method for the poroelasticity model by introducing an auxiliary problem. We show some numerical tests to verify the theoretical result and apply the multiphysics finite element method to simulate the brain edema which caused by abnormal accumulation of cerebrospinal fluid in injured areas. And we investigate the effects of the key physical parameters on brain edema and observed that the permeability $K$ has the biggest influence on intracranial pressure and tissue deformation, Young's modulus $E$ and Poisson ratio $\nu$ have little effect on the maximum value of intracranial pressure, but have great effect on the tissue deformation and the developing speed of brain edema.</description>

      <title>An new polar factor retraction on the Stiefel manifold with closed-form inverse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Retractions are the workhorse in Riemannian computing applications, where computational efficiency is of the essence. This work introduces a new retraction on the compact Stiefel manifold of orthogonal frames. The retraction is second-order accurate under the Euclidean metric and features a closed-form inverse that can be efficiently computed. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first Stiefel retraction with both these properties. A variety of retractions is known on the Stiefel manifold, including the Riemannian exponential map, the polar factor retraction, the QR-retraction and the Cayley retraction, but none of them features a closed-form inverse. The only Stiefel retraction with closed-form inverse that we are aware of is based on quasi-geodesics, but this one is of first order.</description>

      <title>On the Spectral Properties of Van Leer and AUSM Flux-Vector Splitting Schemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19963v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The flux-vector splitting scheme of Van Leer is a cornerstone of computational fluid dynamics, yet its original proof of the eigenvalue sign condition was presented in a condensed form. In this work, we provide a detailed and rigorous analysis of the eigenvalues of the Jacobian matrices associated with the Van Leer splitting for the one-dimensional Euler equations. By constructing the Sturm sequence of the discriminant, we prove that for the admissible parameter range $1 \le \gamma \le 3$, $|M|&lt;1$, and $a&gt;0$, the Jacobian $\partial F^+/\partial U$ has one zero eigenvalue and two positive real eigenvalues, confirming Van Leer's original claim. Furthermore, we extend our analysis to two variants of the original AUSM scheme (Advection Upstream Splitting Method) proposed by Liou and Steffen, considering both linear and second-order pressure splittings. For the linear pressure splitting we show that the eigenvalues are not all of the same sign, while for the second-order pressure splitting we prove that all coefficients of the characteristic equation are positive. Numerical experiments reported in the appendix confirm the non-negativity of the discriminant for the AUSM with the second-order pressure splitting, implying that its eigenvalues are real and positive.</description>

      <title>Thin Plate Spline Surface Reconstruction via the Method of Matched Sections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19182v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper further develops the Method of Matched Sections (MMS), a robust numerical framework for the solution of boundary value problems governed by partial differential equations, specifically for surface modeling. While originating in mechanics, the method addresses critical challenges in isogeometric analysis and computer graphics by bridging the gap between physical accuracy and geometric continuity. By decomposing the domain into an assembly of 1D directional components matched along their entire boundaries, the method inherently enforces the continuity of all variational parameters, including second-order (curvature) and third-order (shear) derivatives. We demonstrate the method's advanced capabilities in high-fidelity surface reconstruction and blending, showing that it consistently generates energetically optimal, fair surfaces even from complex boundary conditions or sparse internal points. By advancing the application of MMS, this research establishes it as a powerful, physics-informed geometric tool that satisfies the dual demands of rigorous numerical analysis and aesthetic computer-aided design.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.19381v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish a regularity theorem for second-order elliptic PDEs on $\mathbb{R}^{d}$ in spectral Barron spaces. Under mild ellipticity and smallness assumptions, the solution gains two additional orders of Barron regularity. As a corollary, we identify a class of PDEs whose solutions can be approximated by two-layer neural networks with cosine activation functions, where the width of the neural network is independent of the spatial dimension.</description>

      <title>Smoothness Adaptivity in Constant-Depth Neural Networks: Optimal Rates via Smooth Activations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19691v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Smooth activation functions are ubiquitous in modern deep learning, yet their theoretical advantages over non-smooth counterparts remain poorly understood. In this work, we characterize both approximation and statistical properties of neural networks with smooth activations over the Sobolev space $W^{s,\infty}([0,1]^d)$ for arbitrary smoothness $s&gt;0$. We prove that constant-depth networks equipped with smooth activations automatically exploit arbitrarily high orders of target function smoothness, achieving the minimax-optimal approximation and estimation error rates (up to logarithmic factors). In sharp contrast, networks with non-smooth activations, such as ReLU, lack this adaptivity: their attainable approximation order is strictly limited by depth, and capturing higher-order smoothness requires proportional depth growth. These results identify activation smoothness as a fundamental mechanism, alternative to depth, for attaining statistical optimality. Technically, our results are established via a constructive approximation framework that produces explicit neural network approximators with carefully controlled parameter norms and model size. This complexity control ensures statistical learnability under empirical risk minimization (ERM) and removes the impractical sparsity constraints commonly required in prior analyses.</description>

      <title>Discretization and regularization for the reconstruction of inhomogeneities by scattering measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19970v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the inverse problem of reconstructing inhomogeneities by performing a finite number of scattering measurements of acoustic type in the time-harmonic setting. We set up the reconstruction as a fully discrete variational problem with regularization. Such a problem depends on a variety of parameters, that is, the number of measurements, the regularization parameter and the discretization parameter, namely the size of the mesh on which we discretize the unknown coefficients of the Helmholtz type equation modelling our physical system. We show, through a convergence analysis, that one can carefully choose these parameters in such a way that the solution to this discrete regularized minimum problem is a good approximation of the looked-for solution to the inverse problem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.19982v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vision Transformers have achieved state-of-the-art performance in a wide range
  of computer vision tasks, but their practical deployment is limited by high
  computational and memory costs. In this paper, we introduce a novel tensor-based
  framework for Vision Transformers built upon the Tensor Cosine Product
  (Cproduct). By exploiting multilinear structures inherent in image data and the
  orthogonality of cosine transforms, the proposed approach enables efficient
  attention mechanisms and structured feature representations. We develop the
  theoretical foundations of the tensor cosine product, analyze its algebraic
  properties, and integrate it into a new Cproduct-based Vision Transformer
  architecture (TCP-ViT). Numerical experiments on standard classification and
  segmentation benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed method achieves a uniform
  1/C parameter reduction (where C is the number of channels) while
  maintaining competitive accuracy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.11271v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We describe and analyze a hybrid finite element/neural network method for predicting solutions of partial differential equations. The methodology is designed for obtaining fine scale fluctuations from neural networks in a local manner. The network is capable of locally correcting a coarse finite element solution towards a fine solution taking the source term and the coarse approximation as input. Key observation is the dependency between quality of predictions and the size of training set which consists of different source terms and corresponding fine &amp; coarse solutions. We provide the a priori error analysis of the method together with the stability analysis of the neural network. The numerical experiments confirm the capability of the network predicting fine finite element solutions. We also illustrate the generalization of the method to problems where test and training domains differ from each other.</description>

      <title>Stable Volume Dissipation for High-Order Finite-Difference and Spectral-Element Methods with the Summation-by-Parts Property</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12670v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The construction of stable, conservative, and accurate volume dissipation is extended to discretizations that possess a generalized summation-by-parts (SBP) property within a tensor-product framework. The dissipation operators can be applied to any finite-difference or spectral-element scheme that uses the SBP framework, including high-order entropy-stable schemes. Additionally, we clarify the incorporation of a variable coefficient within the operator structure and analyze the impact of a boundary correction matrix on operator structure and accuracy. Following the theoretical development and construction of novel dissipation operators, we relate the presented volume dissipation to the use of upwind SBP operators. When applied to spectral-element methods, the presented approach yields unique dissipation operators that can also be derived through alternative approaches involving orthogonal polynomials. Numerical examples featuring the linear convection, Burgers, and Euler equations verify the properties of the constructed dissipation operators and assess their performance compared to existing upwind SBP schemes, including linear stability behaviour. When applied to entropy-stable schemes, the presented approach results in accurate and robust methods that can solve a broader range of problems where comparable existing methods fail.</description>

      <title>Optimal alignment of Lorentz orientation and generalization to matrix Lie groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14994v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There exist elegant methods of aligning point clouds in $\mathbb R^3$. Unfortunately, these methods fail to generalize to the case of Minkowski space, as we will show. Instead, we propose two solutions to the following problem: given inertial reference frames $A$ and $B$, and given (possibly noisy) measurements of a set of 4-vectors $\{v_i\}$ made in those reference frames with components $\{v_{A,i}\}$ and $\{v_{B,i}\}$, find the optimal Lorentz transformation $\Lambda$ such that $\Lambda v_{A,i}=v_{B,i}$. The first method is direct least squares optimization through a parametrization of $SO(3,1)_+$ in terms of the familiar boost and rotation vectors. The second method takes a detour through the Lorentz algebra; in addition to being conceptually simple and possessing a computational advantage over the first method, it can easily be generalized to the alignment of vector representations in other matrix Lie groups.</description>

      <title>$\boldsymbol{H}(\textbf{curl})$-reconstruction of piecewise polynomial fields with application to $hp$-a posteriori nonconforming error analysis for Maxwell's equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12904v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We devise and analyse a novel $\boldsymbol{H}(\textbf{curl})$-reconstruction operator for piecewise polynomial fields on shape-regular simplicial meshes. The (non-polynomial) reconstruction is devised over the mesh vertex patches using the partition of unity induced by hat basis functions in combination with local Helmholtz decompositions. Our main focus is on homogeneous tangential boundary conditions. We prove that the difference between the reconstructed $\boldsymbol{H}_0(\textbf{curl})$-field and the original, piecewise polynomial field, measured in the broken curl norm and in the $\boldsymbol{L}^2$-norm, can be bounded in terms of suitable jump norms of the original field. The bounds are always $h$-optimal, and $p$-suboptimal by $\frac12$-order for the broken curl norm and by $\frac32$-order for the $\boldsymbol{L}^2$-norm. An auxiliary result of independent interest is a novel broken-curl, divergence-preserving Poincar\'{e} inequality on vertex patches. Moreover, the $\boldsymbol{L}^2$-norm estimate can be improved to $\frac12$-order suboptimality under a (reasonable) assumption on the uniform elliptic regularity pickup for a Poisson problem with Neumann conditions over the vertex patches. We also discuss extensions of the $\boldsymbol{H}_0(\textbf{curl})$-reconstruction operator to the prescription of mixed boundary conditions, to agglomerated polytopal meshes, and to convex domains. Finally, we showcase an important application of the $\boldsymbol{H}(\textbf{curl})$-reconstruction operator to the $hp$-a posteriori nonconforming error analysis of Maxwell's equations. We focus on the (symmetric) interior penalty discontinuous Galerkin (dG) approximation of some simplified forms of Maxwell's equations.</description>

      <title>Global convergence of adaptive least-squares finite element methods for nonlinear PDEs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.01531v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Zarantonello fixed-point iteration is an established linearization scheme for quasilinear PDEs with strongly monotone and Lipschitz continuous nonlinearity in Hilbert spaces. This paper presents a weighted least-squares minimization for the computation of the update of this scheme. The resulting formulation allows for a conforming least-squares finite element discretization of the primal and dual variable of the PDE with arbitrary polynomial degree. The least-squares functional provides a built-in a posteriori discretization error estimator in each linearization step motivating an adaptive Uzawa-type algorithm with an outer linearization loop and an inner adaptive mesh-refinement loop. For quasilinear PDEs in divergence form satisfying a 2-growth condition, we prove global R-linear convergence of the computed linearization iterates for arbitrary initial guesses. Particular focus is on the role of the weights in the least-squares functional of the linearized problem and their influence on the robustness of the Zarantonello damping parameter. Numerical experiments illustrate the performance of the proposed algorithm.</description>

      <title>Preconditioned Truncated Single-Sample Estimators for Scalable Stochastic Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.24587v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many large-scale stochastic optimization algorithms involve repeated solutions of linear systems or evaluations of log-determinants. In these regimes, computing exact solutions is often unnecessary; it is more computationally efficient to construct unbiased stochastic estimators with controlled variance. However, classical iterative solvers incur truncation bias, whereas unbiased Krylov-based estimators typically exhibit high variance and numerical instability. To mitigate these issues, we introduce the Preconditioned Truncated Single-Sample (PTSS) estimators--a family of stochastic Krylov methods that integrate preconditioning with truncated Lanczos iterations. PTSS yields low-variance, stable estimators for linear system solutions, log-determinants, and their derivatives. We establish theoretical results on their mean, variance, and concentration properties, explicitly quantifying the variance reduction induced by preconditioning. Numerical experiments confirm that PTSS achieves superior stability and variance control compared with existing unbiased and biased alternatives, providing an efficient framework for stochastic optimization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.12298v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider an algebraic multigrid (AMG) scheme for the direct solution of complex-valued square linear systems based on a recursive $2\times 2$ block partitioning of the coefficient matrix and study the optimal choices of its components. In particular, we complement existing results that characterize optimal choices for a nonsymmetric-cycle methods by analyzing the spectral behavior of its symmetrized variant. We analyze the error propagation operator of the two-level symmetric-cycle method by calculating its invariant subspaces and its nonzero eigenvalues that govern the behavior of the error after a single cycle. We show that the error propagation operator can be studied separately for pairs of modes, working as bases of the invariant subspaces. The main result is an explicit choice of smoothing parameters that makes all the pairs of modes respond identically, forcing the nontrivial eigenvalues of the error propagation operator to collapse to a single, a priori known value, i.e., we give an explicit choice for the smoothing parameters so that the nonzero part of the spectrum of the error propagation operator collapses to a single, a priori known point on the real line. As a consequence, we give a closed-form formula for the inverse of a general square matrix that, to the best of our knowledge, is new in the literature. Additionally, the framework provides a clear, self-contained description of an ideal AMG W-cycle, offering a concrete target for the design of related schemes. We illustrate the theory with direct applications to general matrices and with analyses of representative matrices arising in numerical methods.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking stabilized and self-stabilized p-virtual element methods with variable coefficients</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.18943v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Standard Virtual Element Methods (VEM) are based on polynomial projections and require a stabilization term to evaluate the contribution of the non-polynomial component of the discrete space. However, the stabilization term is not uniquely defined by the underlying variational formulation and is typically introduced in an ad hoc manner, potentially affecting the numerical response. Stabilization-free and self-stabilized formulations have been proposed to overcome this issue, although their theoretical analysis is still less mature. This paper provides an in-depth numerical investigation into different stabilized and self-stabilized formulations for the p-version of VEM. The results show that self-stabilized and stabilization-free formulations achieve optimal accuracy while suffering from worse conditioning. Moreover, a new projection operator, which explicitly accounts for variable coefficients, is introduced within the framework of standard virtual element spaces. Numerical results show that this new approach is more robust than the existing ones for large values of p.</description>

Abstract: The present work addresses the Cauchy problem for an abstract nonlinear system of coupled hyperbolic equations associated with the Timoshenko model in a real Hilbert space. Our purpose is to develop and delve into a temporal discretization scheme for approximating a solution to this problem. To this end, we propose a symmetric three-layer semi-discrete time-stepping scheme in which the nonlinear term is evaluated at the temporal midpoint. As a result, at each time step, this approach reduces the original nonlinear problem to a linear one and enables parallel computation of its solution. Convergence is proved, and second-order accuracy with respect to the time-step size is established on a local temporal interval. The proposed scheme is then applied to a spatially one-dimensional nonlinear dynamic Timoshenko beam system, and the results obtained for the abstract nonlinear system are extended to this setting. A Legendre-Galerkin spectral approximation is employed for the spatial discretization. By taking differences of Legendre polynomials within the Galerkin framework, the resulting linear system is sparse and can be efficiently decoupled. The convergence of the method is also investigated. Finally, several numerical experiments on carefully chosen benchmark problems are conducted to validate the proposed approach and to confirm the theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Unconditionally Long-Time Stable Variable-Step Second-Order Exponential Time-Differencing Schemes for the Incompressible NSE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10268v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop an efficient, unconditionally stable, variable step second order exponential time differencing scheme for the incompressible Navier Stokes equations in two and three spatial dimensions under periodic boundary conditions, together with an embedded adaptive time stepping variant. The scheme is unconditionally uniform in time stable in the sense that the numerical solution admits a time uniform bound in Linfinity over time with values in L2 to the power d whenever the external forcing term is uniformly bounded in time in L2, for all Reynolds numbers and for arbitrary choices of time step sizes.
  At each time step, the method requires the solution of two time dependent Stokes problems, which can be evaluated explicitly in the periodic setting using Fourier techniques, along with the solution of a single scalar cubic algebraic equation. Beyond the standard exponential time differencing framework, the proposed scheme incorporates two recently developed ingredients. The first is a dynamic second order scalar auxiliary variable correction, which is essential for achieving second order temporal accuracy. The second is a mean reverting scalar auxiliary variable multistep formulation, which plays a central role in ensuring long time stability.
  The proposed methods overcome key limitations of existing approaches for the Navier Stokes equations. Classical Runge Kutta schemes generally lack provable long time stability, while IMEX and scalar auxiliary variable based BDF methods typically do not admit unconditional stability guarantees in the variable step setting. Numerical experiments in two spatial dimensions confirm second order temporal accuracy, uniform long time stability, and effective error control provided by the adaptive strategy. Rigorous convergence analysis and a systematic investigation of long time statistical properties will be pursued in future work.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of an Intra-host Diffusive Pathogen Infection Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.05058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2005.05058v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we first propose a diffusive pathogen infection model with general incidence rate which incorporates cell-to-cell transmission. By applying the theory of monotone dynamical systems, we prove that the model admits the global threshold dynamics in terms of the basic reproduction number ($\mathcal{R}_{0}$), which is defined by the spectral radius of the next generation operator. Then, we derive a discrete counterpart of the continuous model by nonstandard finite difference scheme. The results show that the discrete model preserves the positivity and boundedness of solutions in order to ensure the well-posedness of the problem. Moreover, this method preserves all equilibria of the original continuous model. By constructing appropriate Lyapunov functionals for both models, we show that the global threshold dynamics is completely determined by the basic reproduction number. Further, with the help of sensitivity analysis we also have identified the most sensitive parameters which effectively contribute to change the disease dynamics. Finally, we conclude the paper by an example and numerical simulations to improve and generalize some known results.</description>

      <title>Differential estimates for fast first-order multilevel nonconvex optimisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01481v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With a view on bilevel and PDE-constrained optimisation, we develop iterative estimates $\widetilde{F'}(x^k)$ of $F'(x^k)$ for composite functions $F :=J \circ S$, where $S$ is the solution mapping of the inner optimisation problem or PDE. The idea is to form a single-loop method by interweaving updates of the iterate $x^k$ by an outer optimisation method, with updates of the estimate by single steps of standard optimisation methods and linear system solvers. When the inner methods satisfy simple tracking inequalities, the differential estimates can almost directly be employed in standard convergence proofs for general forward-backward type methods. We adapt those proofs to a general inexact setting in normed spaces, that, besides our differential estimates, also covers mismatched adjoints and unreachable optimality conditions in measure spaces. As a side product of these efforts, we provide improved convergence results for nonconvex Primal-Dual Proximal Splitting (PDPS).</description>

      <title>Comparison of Lubrication Theory and Stokes Flow in Corner Geometries with Flow Separation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18575v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Reynolds equation from lubrication theory and the Stokes equations for zero Reynolds number flows are distinct models for an incompressible fluid with negligible inertia. Here we investigate the sensitivity of the Reynolds equation to large surface gradients, and explore flow recirculation in corner geometries in comparison to the Stokes equation. We compare the solutions for the Reynolds and Stokes equations in the backward facing step (BFS), the regularized BFS, and the lid-driven triangular cavity. For the BFS variations listed above, we compute the error in terms of the average pressure drop through the channel and show how the error increases with increasing expansion ratio and with increasing magnitude of surface gradients. We further investigate the phenomenology of corner flow recirculation that arises in the Stokes solutions. In particular, we observe that occluding the corner separated region in the Stokes solution to the BFS does not disrupt the bulk flow characteristics.</description>

      <title>CodePDE: An Inference Framework for LLM-driven PDE Solver Generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.08783v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Partial differential equations (PDEs) are fundamental to modeling physical systems, yet solving them remains a complex challenge. Traditional numerical solvers rely on expert knowledge to implement and are computationally expensive, while neural-network-based solvers require large training datasets and often lack interpretability. In this work, we frame PDE solving as a code generation task and introduce CodePDE, the first inference framework for generating PDE solvers using large language models (LLMs). With CodePDE, we present a thorough evaluation on critical capacities of LLM for PDE solving: reasoning, debugging, self-refinement, and test-time scaling. CodePDE shows that, with advanced inference-time algorithms and scaling strategies, LLMs can achieve strong performance across a range of representative PDE problems. We also identify novel insights into LLM-driven solver generation, such as trade-offs between solver reliability and sophistication, design principles for LLM-powered PDE solving agents, and failure modes for LLM on hard tasks. These insights offer guidance for building more capable and reliable LLM-based scientific engines.</description>

      <title>Physics vs Distributions: Pareto Optimal Flow Matching with Physics Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08604v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Physics-constrained generative modeling aims to produce high-dimensional samples that are both physically consistent and distributionally accurate, a task that remains challenging due to often conflicting optimization objectives. Recent advances in flow matching and diffusion models have enabled efficient generative modeling, but integrating physical constraints often degrades generative fidelity or requires costly inference-time corrections. Our work is the first to recognize the trade-off between distributional and physical accuracy. Based on the insight of inherently conflicting objectives, we introduce Physics-Based Flow Matching (PBFM) a method that enforces physical constraints at training time using conflict-free gradient updates and unrolling to mitigate Jensen's gap. Our approach avoids manual loss balancing and enables simultaneous optimization of generative and physical objectives. As a consequence, physics constraints do not impede inference performance. We benchmark our method across three representative PDE benchmarks. PBFM achieves a Pareto-optimal trade-off, competitive inference speed, and generalizes to a wide range of physics-constrained generative tasks, providing a practical tool for scientific machine learning.

      <title>Multi-material structural optimization for additive manufacturing based on a phase field approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02206v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A topology optimization problem in a phase field setting is considered to obtain rigid structures, which are resilient to external forces and constructable with additive manufacturing. Hence, large deformations of overhangs due to gravity shall be avoided during construction. The deformations depend on the stage of the construction and are modelled by linear elasticity equations on growing domains with height-dependent stress tensors and forces. Herewith, possible hardening effects can be included. Analytical results concerning the existence of minimizers and the differentiability of the reduced cost functional are presented in case of a finite number of construction layers. By proving Korn's inequality with a constant independent of the height, it is shown that the cost functional, formulated continuously in height, is well-defined. The problem is numerically solved using a projected gradient type method in function space, for which applicability is shown. Second-order information can be included by adapting the underlying inner product in every iteration. Additional adjustments enhancing the solver's performance, such as a nested procedure and subsystem solver specifcations, are stated. Numerical evidence is provided that for all discretization level and also for any number of construction layers, the iteration numbers stay roughly constant. The benefits of the nested procedure as well as of the inclusion of second order information are illustrated. Furthermore, the choice of weights for the penalization of overhangs is discussed. For various problem settings, results are presented for one or two materials and void in two as well as in three dimensions.</description>

      <title>PBPK-iPINNs: Inverse Physics-Informed Neural Networks for Physiologically Based Pharmacokinetic Brain Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12666v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) integrate machine learning with differential equations to solve forward and inverse problems while ensuring that predictions adhere to physical laws. Physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modeling advances beyond classical compartmental approaches by employing a mechanistic, physiology-focused framework. Such models involve many unknown parameters that are difficult to measure directly in humans due to ethical and practical constraints. PBPK models are constructed as systems of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) and these parametric ODEs are often stiff, and traditional numerical and statistical methods frequently fail to converge. In this study, we consider a permeability-limited, four-compartment PBPK brain model that mimics human brain functionality in drug delivery. We introduce PBPK-iPINN, a method for estimating drug-specific or patient-specific parameters and drug concentration profiles using inverse PINNs. We also conducted parameter identifiability analysis to determines whether the parameters can be uniquely and reliably estimated from the available data. We demonstrate that, for the inverse problem to converge to the correct solution, the components of the loss function (data loss, initial condition loss, and residual loss) must be appropriately weighted, and the hyperparameters including the number of layers and neurons, activation functions, learning rate, optimizer, and collocation points must be carefully tuned. The performance of the PBPK-iPINN approach is then compared with established numerical and statistical methods. Accurate parameter estimation yields precise drug concentration-time profiles, which in turn enable the calculation of pharmacokinetic metrics. These metrics support drug developers and clinicians in designing and optimizing therapies for brain cancer.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.00685v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of approximating the Langevin dynamics of inertial particles being transported by a background flow. In particular, we study an acceleration corrected advection-diffusion approximation to the Langevin dynamics, a popular approximation in the study of turbulent transport. We prove error estimates in the averaging regime in which the dimensionless relaxation timescale $\varepsilon$ is the small parameter. We show that for any finite time interval, the approximation error is of order $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon)$ in the strong sense and $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^2)$ in the weak sense, whose optimality is checked against computational experiment. Furthermore, we present numerical evidence suggesting that this approximation also captures the long-time behavior of the Langevin dynamics.</description>

Abstract: We present SiLU network constructions whose approximation efficiency depends critically on proper hyperparameter tuning. For the square function $x^2$, with optimally chosen shift $a$ and scale $\beta$, we achieve approximation error $\varepsilon$ using a two-layer network of constant width, where weights scale as $\beta^{\pm k}$ with $k = \mathcal{O}(\ln(1/\varepsilon))$. We then extend this approach through functional composition to Sobolev spaces, we obtain networks with depth $\mathcal{O}(1)$ and $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^{-d/n})$ parameters under optimal hyperparameters settings. Our work highlights the trade-off between architectural depth and activation parameter optimization in neural network approximation theory.</description>

      <title>Complete Characterizations of Well-Posedness in Parametric Composite Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14124v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper characterizes the well-posedness of Karush-Kuhn-Tucker system for perturbed composite optimization. Using the parabolic regularity, we introduce a novel second-order variational function, shown to be the pivotal object governing second-order behavior. This foundational result yields the strong second-order sufficient condition introduced here for the general class of composite optimization problems to naturally extend the classical second-order sufficient condition in nonlinear programming. Then we obtain several equivalent characterizations of the second-order qualification condition (SOQC) and highlight its equivalence to the constraint nondegeneracy condition under the $\mathcal{C}^{2}$-cone reducibility assumption. These insights lead us to multiple equivalent conditions for the major Lipschitz-like/Aubin property of KKT systems, including SOQC combined with the new second-order subdifferential condition and SOQC combined with tilt stability of local minimizers. Under the $\mathcal{C}^{2}$-cone reducibility, we settle the long-standing question by proving the equivalence between the Aubin property of KKT systems around local minimizers and the classical notion of strong regularity under some additional assumptions. Finally, we demonstrate that the Lipschitz-like property is equivalent to the nonsingularity of the generalized Jacobian associated with the KKT system under a certain verifiable assumption. These results provide a unified and rigorous framework for analyzing stability and sensitivity of solutions to composite optimization problems, as well as for the design and justification of numerical algorithms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.23804v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop efficient hierarchical preconditioners for optimal control problems governed by partial differential equations with uncertain coefficients. Adopting a discretize-then-optimize framework that integrates finite element discretization, stochastic Galerkin projection, and advanced time-discretization schemes, the approach addresses challenges of scaling large and ill-conditioned linear systems arising in uncertainty quantification. By exploiting sparsity of linear systems in stochastic Galerkin method, we formulate hierarchical preconditioners based on truncated stochastic expansion that strike an effective balance between computational cost and preconditioning quality. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed preconditioners significantly accelerate the convergence of iterative solvers compared to existing methods, providing robust and efficient solvers for both steady-state and time-dependent optimal control problems under uncertainty.</description>

      <title>Full grid solution for multi-asset options pricing with tensor networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00009v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Pricing multi-asset options via the Black-Scholes PDE is limited by the curse of dimensionality: classical full-grid solvers scale exponentially in the number of underlyings and are effectively restricted to three assets. Practitioners typically rely on Monte Carlo methods for computing complex instrument involving multiple correlated underlyings. We show that quantized tensor trains (QTT) turn the d-asset Black-Scholes PDE into a tractable high-dimensional problem on a personal computer. We construct QTT representations of the operator, payoffs, and boundary conditions with ranks that scale polynomially in d and polylogarithmically in the grid size, and build two solvers: a time-stepping algorithm for European and American options and a space-time algorithm for European options. We compute full-grid prices and Greeks for correlated basket and max-min options in three to five dimensions with high accuracy. The methods introduced can comfortably be pushed to full-grid solutions on 10-15 underlyings, with further algorithmic optimization and more compute power.</description>

      <title>Precision Autotuning for Linear Solvers via Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00728v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a reinforcement learning (RL) framework for adaptive precision tuning of linear solvers, and can be extended to general algorithms. The framework is formulated as a contextual bandit problem and solved using incremental action-value estimation with a discretized state space to select optimal precision configurations for computational steps, balancing precision and computational efficiency. To verify its effectiveness, we apply the framework to iterative refinement for solving linear systems $Ax = b$. In this application, our approach dynamically chooses precisions based on calculated features from the system. In detail, a Q-table maps discretized features (e.g., approximate condition number and matrix norm)to actions (chosen precision configurations for specific steps), optimized via an epsilon-greedy strategy to maximize a multi-objective reward balancing accuracy and computational cost. Empirical results demonstrate effective precision selection, reducing computational cost while maintaining accuracy comparable to double-precision baselines. The framework generalizes to diverse out-of-sample data and offers insight into utilizing RL precision selection for other numerical algorithms, advancing mixed-precision numerical methods in scientific computing. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work on precision autotuning with RL and verified on unseen datasets.</description>

      <title>Constrained Density Estimation via Optimal Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06830v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A novel framework for density estimation under expectation constraints is proposed. The framework minimizes the Wasserstein distance between the estimated density and a prior, subject to the constraints that the expected value of a set of functions adopts or exceeds given values. The framework is generalized to include regularization inequalities to mitigate the artifacts in the target measure. An annealing-like algorithm is developed to address non-smooth constraints, with its effectiveness demonstrated through both synthetic and proof-of-concept real world examples in finance.</description>

      <title>Qualitative analysis and numerical investigations of time-fractional Zika virus model arising in population dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11636v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Epidemic models play a crucial role in population dynamics, offering valuable insights into disease transmission while aiding in epidemic prediction and control. In this paper, we analyze the mathematical model of the time-fractional Zika virus transmission for human and mosquito populations. The fractional derivative is considered in the Caputo sense of order $\alpha\in(0,1).$ We begin by conducting a qualitative analysis using the stability theory of differential equations. The existence and uniqueness of the solution are established, and the model's stability is examined through Hyers-Ulam stability analysis. Furthermore, an efficient difference scheme utilizing the standard L1 technique is developed to simulate the model and analyze the solution's behavior under key parameters. The resulting nonlinear algebraic system is solved using the Newton-Raphson method. Finally, illustrative examples are presented to validate the theoretical findings. Graphical results indicate that the fractional model provides deeper insights and a better understanding of disease dynamics. These findings aid in controlling the virus through contact precautions and recommended therapies while also helping to predict its future spread.</description>

      <title>sangkuriang: A pseudo-spectral Python library for Korteweg-de Vries soliton simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12029v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equation serves as a foundational model in nonlinear wave physics, describing the balance between dispersive spreading and nonlinear steepening that gives rise to solitons. This article introduces sangkuriang, an open-source Python library for solving this equation using Fourier pseudo-spectral spatial discretization coupled with adaptive high-order time integration. The implementation leverages just-in-time (JIT) compilation for computational efficiency while maintaining accessibility for instructional purposes. Validation encompasses progressively complex scenarios including isolated soliton propagation, symmetric two-wave configurations, overtaking collisions between waves of differing amplitudes, and three-body interactions. Conservation of the classical invariants is monitored throughout, with deviations remaining small across all test cases. Measured soliton velocities conform closely to theoretical predictions based on the amplitude-velocity relationship characteristic of integrable systems. Complementary diagnostics drawn from information theory and recurrence analysis confirm that computed solutions preserve the regular phase-space structure expected for completely integrable dynamics. The solver outputs data in standard scientific formats compatible with common analysis tools and generates visualizations of spatiotemporal wave evolution. By combining numerical accuracy with practical accessibility on modest computational resources, sangkuriang offers a platform suitable for both classroom demonstrations of nonlinear wave phenomena and exploratory research into soliton dynamics.</description>
