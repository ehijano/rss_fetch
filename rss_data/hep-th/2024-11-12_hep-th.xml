      <description>arXiv:2411.05893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We comment on the fact that certain mathematical models that have been proposed in the quantum gravity literature, may not be subject to experimental checks, even if they turn out to be mathematically well defined. This means that they would be indistinguishable from other models, with a smaller number of quantum states. These considerations follow from very general properties of quantum measurement theory and classical gravity.</description>

      <title>Do we live on the End of the World?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05912v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a scenario of a de Sitter universe living on an End-of-the-World brane. Motivated by the Swampland programme and in particular the Cobordism Conjecture, we consider a compact region of AdS$_5$ nucleating from nothing, with a dS$_4$ living on its boundary. We show that it can equivalently be interpreted as an up-tunnelling from AdS$_5$ with cosmological constant $\Lambda\to -\infty$, following Brown and Dahlen's proposal for 'nothing'. Their picture naively leads to the conclusion that the brane has infinite negative tension. But we show that it becomes finite and positive once we employ holographic renormalization, recovering the Bubble of Something where the domain wall becomes a boundary of spacetime. The same holds true in any number of dimensions and, moreover, at the level of metric perturbations. This provides motivation for alternative routes of obtaining cosmology from quantum gravity or string theory using domain walls, departing from conventional vacuum approaches.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05918v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In these lectures we review two approaches to constructing particle actions from coset spaces of symmetry groups: non-linear realisations and coadjoint orbits. At the level of particle actions, we observe that they coincide. We also provide an introduction to symplectic geometry and we sketch the theory of coadjoint orbits for the Poincar\'e group.</description>

      <title>Three Dimensional Topological Field Theories and Nahm Sum Formulas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06081v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is known that a large class of characters of 2d conformal field theories (CFTs) can be written in the form of a Nahm sum. In \cite{Zagier:2007knq}, D. Zagier identified a list of Nahm sum expressions that are modular functions under a congruence subgroup of $SL(2,\mathbb{Z})$ and can be thought of as candidates for characters of rational CFTs. Motivated by the observation that the same formulas appear as the half-indices of certain 3d $\mathcal{N}=2$ supersymmetric gauge theories, we perform a general search over low-rank 3d $\mathcal{N}=2$ abelian Chern-Simons matter theories which either flow to unitary TFTs or $\mathcal{N}=4$ rank-zero SCFTs in the infrared. These are exceptional classes of 3d theories, which are expected to support rational and $C_2$-cofinite chiral algebras on their boundary. We compare and contrast our results with Zagier's and comment on a possible generalization of Nahm's conjecture.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.06109v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that on shell DDF amplitudes are on shell lightcone amplitudes and that Mandelstam maps emerge naturally with a precise normalization and are intrinsic to the DDF states. Off shell DDF and Mandelstam amplitudes \`a la Kaku-Kikkawa differ.
  Underway we give a very explicit formula for the conformal transformation of a generic vertex in the form of a compact generating function for free theories.</description>

      <title>Spinorial Superspaces and Super Yang-Mills Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06165v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In physics literature about supersymmetry, many authors refer to \emph{super Minkowski spaces}. These spaces are affine supermanifolds with certain distinguished spin structures. In these notes, we make the notion of such spin structures precise and generalise the setup to curved supermanifolds. This leads to the more general notion of \emph{spinorial superspaces}. By working in a suitable geometric and coordinate-free setting, many explicit coordinate computations appearing in physics literature can be replaced by more conceptual methods. As an application of the rather general framework of spinorial superspaces, we formulate $\mathcal N = 1$ super Yang-Mills theories on curved superspaces of spacetime dimensions $d=3$ and $d=4$ and show how to reduce the theory to field theories defined on an underlying ordinary spacetime manifold.</description>

      <title>The effect of pressure anisotropy on quark stars structure in the Starobinsky model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06170v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The structure and stability of quark stars (QSs) made of interacting quark matter are discussed in this study, taking color superconductivity and perturbative QCD corrections into account. By combining this EoS with the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) equations, we explore the mass-radius ($M-R$) relations of QSs. The analysis is conducted within the framework of $R^2$ gravity, where the gravity model is described by $f(R) = R + a R^2$. Our primary goal is to investigate how variations in the $R^2$ gravity parameter $a$ affect the mass-radius and mass-central density ($M-\rho_c$) relationships of QSs. Furthermore, we study the dynamical stability of these stars by analyzing the impact of anisotropy parameters $\beta$ and the interaction parameter $\lambda$ derived from the EoS, on their stability. Our results demonstrate that the presence of pressure anisotropy plays a significant role in increasing the maximum mass of QSs, with potential implications for the existence of super-massive pulsars. These findings are in agreement with recent astronomical observations, which suggest the possibility of neutron stars exceeding $2M_{\odot}$.</description>

      <title>Locality and Conserved Charges in $T\overline{T}$-Deformed CFTs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06261v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the locality properties of $T \overline T$-deformed CFTs within perturbation theory. Up to third order in the deformation parameter, we find a Hamiltonian operator which solves the flow equation, reproduces the Zamolodchikov energy spectrum, and is consistent with quasi-locality of the theory. This Hamiltonian includes terms proportional to the central charge which have not appeared before and which are necessary to reproduce the correct spectrum. We show that the Hamiltonian is not uniquely defined since it contains free parameters, starting at second order, which do not spoil the above properties. We then use it to determine the full conserved stress tensor. In our approach, the KdV charges are automatically conserved to all orders but are not a priori local. Nevertheless, we show that they can be made local to first order. Our techniques allow us to further comment on the space of Hamiltonians constructed from products of KdV charges which also flow to local charges in the deformed theory in the IR.</description>

      <title>Barrow Entropy and Extended Black Hole Thermodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06271v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By considering the concept of Barrow's idea of a fractal black hole horizon in the extended-phase space thermodynamics formalism, we explore the thermodynamic processes, the phase transition, and the stability of black holes. We study the impact of quantum gravity on the area of the black hole due to the fractal parameter, delta. In this regard, we show that the thermodynamic behavior of black holes is influenced by the impact of quantum gravity. We found that at low entropy, the value of the fractal parameter does not significantly affect thermodynamic characteristics; however, for medium and large entropy, the influence becomes apparent. The Joule-Thomson coefficient is examined to further check the impact of quantum gravity in the extended-phase space thermodynamics approach. The observation reveals that the influence of the fractal parameter on Joule-Thomson expansion is evident. As the parameter value increases, the inversion pressure rises, leading to an expansion of the cooling region and a contraction of the heating region in the pressure-temperature (P-T) plane.</description>

      <title>Holographic boundary conformal field theory with $T\bar T$ deformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06345v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a holographic dual of boundary conformal field theory (BCFT) with $T\bar T$ deformation, i.e. of $T\bar T$ BCFT. Our holographic proposal distinguishes two types of $T\bar T$ BCFTs, depending on whether the $T\bar T$ deformation deforms the boundary. For the boundary-deformed case, we find that boundary entropy serves as an effective measure to quantify the impact of boundary deformation. In this scenario, we calculate the energy spectrum for the $T\bar T$ BCFT within a finite interval to support the proposed dual. For the boundary-undeformed case, we calculate the entanglement entropy and R\'enyi entropy from both the field theory side and the gravity side, and find that they match.</description>

      <title>Adding the algebraic Ryu-Takayanigi formula to the algebraic reconstruction theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A huge progress in studying holographic theories is that holography can be interpreted via the quantum error correction, which makes equal the entanglement wedge reconstruction, the Jafferis-Lewkowycz-Maldacena-Suh formula, the radial commutativity and the Ryu-Takayanagi formula. We call the equivalence the reconstruction theorem, whose infinite-dimensional generalization via algebraic language was believed to exclude the algebraic version of the Ryu-Takayanagi formula. However, recent developments regarding gravitational algebras have shown that the inclusion of the algebraic Ryu-Takayanagi formula is plausible. In this letter, we prove that such inclusion holds for the cases of type I/II factors, which are expected to describe holographic theories.</description>

      <title>The GHY boundary term from the string worldsheet to linear order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using the method of images we derive the boundary term of the Einstein-$\Gamma^2$ action in half-space from the spherical worldsheet to first order in $\alpha'$ and to linear order in the metric perturbation around flat half-space. The $\Gamma^2$ action, written down by Einstein more than 100 years ago, includes a boundary term that consists of the Gibbons-Hawking-York action along with two additional terms that are functions of the metric, normal vector, and tangential derivatives. With this boundary term, the total (bulk + boundary) sphere effective action has a well-posed variational principle for Dirichlet boundary conditions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.06443v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss, at leading order in $\hbar$, the quantum mechanics of a specific realization in phase space of the Yang model describing noncommutative geometry in a curved background. In particular, we show how the deformation of the Heisenberg uncertainty relations crucially depends on the signs of the coupling constants of the model. We also discuss the dynamics of the free particle and of the harmonic oscillator. Also in this case the results depend on the signs of the coupling constants.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.06516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We review the remarkable interplay between modular symmetries and supergravity, which has led to major advances in both physics and mathematics in recent decades. Our focus will be on four-dimensional models with $\mathcal{N}=1$ and $\mathcal{N}=2$ local supersymmetry. We will look at the early articles on the topic, but also touch on recent developments. These results testify to how supergravity, when supplemented with the appropriate assumptions, can be turned into a unique window into quantum gravity.</description>

      <title>Vacuum energy and cosmological constant in QFT in curved spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06582v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The cosmological constant term (CC), $\Lambda$, is a pivotal ingredient in the standard model of cosmology or $\Lambda$CDM, but it is a rigid quantity for the entire cosmic history. This is unnatural and inconsistent. Different theoretical and phenomenological conundrums suggest that the $\Lambda$CDM necessitates further theoretical underpinning to cope with modern observations. An interesting approach is the framework of the `running vacuum model' (RVM). It endows $\Lambda$ with cosmic dynamics within a fundamental framework since it is based on QFT. In the RVM, the vacuum energy density (VED) appears as a series of powers of the Hubble function and its derivatives, $\rho_{\rm vac} (H, \dot{H},...)$. In the current universe, $\rho_{\rm vac}$ changes as $\sim H^2$. Higher order effects ${\cal O}(H^4)$, on the other hand, can be responsible for a new mechanism of inflation (RVM-inflation). On the practical side the RVM can alleviate the cosmological tensions on $\sigma_8$ and $H_0$. An intriguing smoking gun signature of the RVM is that its equation of state can mimic quintessence, as recently observed by DESI, so the vacuum can be the sought-for dynamical DE. At a deeper theoretical level, the RVM-renormalized form of the VED can avoid extreme fine tuning related to the well-known cosmological constant problem. Overall, the RVM has the capacity to impinge positively on relevant theoretical and practical aspects of modern cosmology.</description>

      <title>Optical Properties, Quasinormal Modes and Greybody factors of deformed AdS-Schwarzschild black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07173v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the temperature, photon and shadow radii, quasinormal modes (QNMs), greybody factors, and emission rates of deformed AdS black holes, focusing on the effects of the deformation parameter $ \alpha $ and control parameter $ \beta $. Increasing $ \alpha $ enhances the oscillation frequency and damping rate of gravitational waves, while $ \beta $ shows non-linear behaviour. Electromagnetic perturbations exhibit similar trends, though with lower frequencies and damping rates. Greybody factors are mainly influenced by multipole moment $ l $ and $ \alpha $, with $ \beta $ having a more subtle effect. These findings provide insights into black hole dynamics, mergers, and gravitational wave emissions.</description>

      <title>There and Back Again: Quantum Radiation from Round-trip Flying Mirrors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03521v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Erasing a black hole leaves spacetime flat, so light passing through the region before any star forms and after black hole's evaporation shows no time delay, just like a flying mirror that returns to its initial starting point. Quantum radiation from a round-trip flying mirror has not been solved despite the model's mathematical simplicity and physical clarity. Here, we solve the particle creation from worldlines that asymptotically start and stop at the same spot, resulting in interesting spectra and symmetries, including the time dependence of thermal radiance associated with Bose-Einstein and Fermi-Dirac Bogolubov coefficients. Fourier analysis, intrinsically linked to the Bogolubov mechanism, shows that a thermal Bogolubov distribution does not describe the spin statistics of the quantum field.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.05907v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We classify (multi)fusion 2-categories in terms of braided fusion categories and group cohomological data. This classification is homotopy coherent -- we provide an equivalence between the 3-groupoid of (multi)fusion 2-categories up to monoidal equivalences and a certain 3-groupoid of commuting squares of $\mathrm{B}\mathbb{Z}/2$-equivariant spaces. Rank finiteness and Ocneanu rigidity for fusion 2-categories are immediate corollaries of our classification.</description>

      <title>Field Equations in Chern-Simons-Gauss-Bonnet Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05911v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the effects of Chern-Simons-Gauss-Bonnet gravity on fundamental metrics. This theory involves perturbative corrections to general relativity, as well as two scalar fields, the axion and the dilaton, that arise from Chern-Simons and Gauss-Bonnet gravity modifications respectively. The combined Chern-Simons-Gauss-Bonnet gravity is motivated by a wide range of theoretical and phenomenological perspectives, including particle physics, string theory, and parity violation in the gravitational sector. In this work, we provide the complete set of field equations and equations of motion of the Chern-Simons-Gauss-Bonnet modified gravity theory for a suite of fundamental metrics (Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker, Schwarzschild, spherically symmetric, and perturbed Minkowski), under no prior assumptions on the behavior of the fields. The full set of field equations and equations of motion can be numerically solved and applied to specific observables under certain assumptions, and can be used to place constraints on the Chern-Simons-Gauss-Bonnet modified gravity theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.06075v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: derivation of the modified Friedmann equations inspired by the Barrow entropy, $S\sim A ^{1+\delta/2}$, where $0\leq\delta\leq 1$ is the Barrow exponent and $A$ is the horizon area. We then constrain the exponent $\delta$ by using Big-Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) observational data. In order to impose the upper bound on the Barrow exponent $\delta$, we set the observational bound on $\left| \frac{\delta T_f} {T_f }\right|$. We find out that the Barrow parameter $\delta$ should be around $ \delta \simeq 0.01$ in order not to spoil the BBN era. Next we derive the bound on the Barrow exponent $\delta$ in a different approach in which we analyze the effects of Barrow cosmology on the primordial abundances of light elements i.e. Helium $_{}^{4}\textit{He}$, Deuterium $D$ and Lithium $_{}^{7}\textit{Li}$. We observe that the deviation from standard Bekenstein-Hawking expression is small as expected. Additionally we present the relation between cosmic time $t$ and temperature $T$ in the context of modified Barrow cosmology. We confirm that the temperature of the early universe increases as the Barrow exponent $\delta$ (fractal structure of the horizon) increases, too.</description>

      <title>A Fluid-Membrane Description of the BTZ Black Hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06164v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The 2+1 dimensional Banados-Teitelboim-Zanelli (BTZ) black hole has proved to be a remarkably efficient tool to test ideas about quantum aspects of gravity and holography. Here, we provide a classical fluid-membrane description of this geometry, both in static and rotating versions, that defines a dynamical viscous Newtonian fluid with non-trivial transport coefficients, mimicking the black hole. The membrane paradigm for black holes in four or more dimensions usually yields fluids with a negative bulk viscosity, which is a problem because it yields decreasing total entropy in thermal processes according to Stokes' hypothesis. However, the (rotating) BTZ black hole has a zero bulk viscosity and is amenable to a physically viable fluid membrane description at thermal equilibrium.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.06203v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit particle creation in strong fields, and backreaction on those fields, from an amplitudes perspective. We describe the strong field by an initial coherent state of photons which we explicitly evolve in time, thus going beyond the background field approximation, and then consider observables which quantify the effects of backreaction. We present expressions for the waveform, vacuum persistence probability, and number of produced photons at next-to-leading order, all of which are impacted by backreaction, along with the number and statistics of produced pairs. We find that converting between in-out (amplitude) and in-in (expectation value) expressions requires explicit resummation of an infinite number of disconnected loop diagrams.</description>

Abstract: This paper explores the quantum and classical descriptions of gravitational wave detection in interferometers like LIGO. We demonstrate that while a simple graviton scattering model fails to explain the observed arm displacements, both the classical gravitational wave approach and a quantum gravitational energy method successfully predict the correct results. We provide a detailed analysis of why the quantum graviton energy approach succeeds, highlighting the importance of collective behavior and the quantum-classical correspondence in gravitational wave physics. Our findings contribute to the ongoing discussion about the quantum nature of gravity and its observable effects in macroscopic physics.</description>

Abstract: In this letter, we demonstrate for the first time that the moment expansion for an ultrarelativistic gas undergoing Bjorken flow diverges. We then show how this series can be resummed using the Borel-Pad\'e method and use this to determine the single-particle distribution function of the gas. Finally, we compare the exact resummed solution of the single-particle distribution function with solutions of the Boltzmann equation in the hydrodynamic limit and verify that the system displays considerable deviations from local equilibrium.</description>

Abstract: We show that a slowly varying Newton's constant, consistent with existing bounds, can potentially explain a host of observations pertaining to gravitational effects or phenomena across distances spanning from planetary to the cosmological, relying neither on the existence of Dark Matter or (and) Dark Energy, nor on any expected high proportions of either of them in the Universe. It may also have implications at very short distances or quantum gravity scales.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.06718v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the flavour sector of the supersymmetric $SU(5)$ Grand Unified Theory (GUT) model using machine learning techniques. The minimal $SU(5)$ model is known to predict fermion masses that disagree with observed values in nature. There are two well-known approaches to address this issue: one involves introducing a 45-representation Higgs field, while the other employs a higher-dimensional operator involving the 24-representation GUT Higgs field. We compare these two approaches by numerically optimising a loss function, defined as the ratio of determinants of mass matrices. Our findings indicate that the 24-Higgs approach achieves the observed fermion masses with smaller modifications to the original minimal $SU(5)$ model.</description>

      <title>Renormalisation in maximally symmetric spaces and semiclassical gravity in Anti-de Sitter spacetime</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.06834v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We obtain semiclassical gravity solutions in the Poincar\'e fundamental domain of $(3+1)$-dimensional Anti-de Sitter spacetime, PAdS$_4$, with a (massive or massless) Klein-Gordon field (with possibly non-trivial curvature coupling) with Dirichlet or Neumann boundary. Some results are explicitly and graphically presented for special values of the mass and curvature coupling (e.g. minimal or conformal coupling). In order to achieve this, we study in some generality how to perform the Hadamard renormalisation procedure for non-linear observables in maximally symmetric spacetimes in arbitrary dimensions, with emphasis on the stress-energy tensor. We show that, in this maximally symmetric setting, the Hadamard bi-distribution is invariant under the isometries of the spacetime, and can be seen as a `single-argument' distribution depending only on the geodesic distance, which significantly simplifies the Hadamard recursion relations and renormalisation computations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.06841v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we examine particle creation and the evaporation process in the context of Kalb-Ramond gravity. Specifically, we build upon two existing solutions from the literature \cite{yang2023static} and \cite{Liu:2024oas}, both addressing a static, spherically symmetric configuration. For this study, we focus on the scenario in which the cosmological constant vanishes. To begin, the corrections to Hawking radiation for bosonic modes are examined by studying the Klein-Gordon equation in curved spacetime. Through the calculation of Bogoliubov coefficients, we identify how the parameter $\ell$, which governs Lorentz symmetry breaking, contributes a correction to the amplitude associated with particle production. Within this approach, the power spectrum and Hawking temperature are derived. Additionally, we obtain expressions for the power spectrum and particle number density by analyzing Hawking radiation from a tunneling viewpoint. A parallel approach is applied to fermionic modes. Finally, we examine black hole evaporation, finding that the black hole lifetime in these cases can be determined analytically.</description>

      <title>Gravity and fluid dynamic correspondence on a null hypersurface: inconsistencies and advancement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06914v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unlike black hole thermodynamics, the fluid-gravity correspondence of a generic null surface appears to be ``incomplete''; though both approaches point to the emergent nature of gravitation. In the existing formulation of fluid-gravity correspondence of a null surface, we have only the momentum conservation relation in the form of the Damour-Navier-Stokes (DNS) equation. The other relations, such as the energy conservation relation, continuity relation, etc., are almost non-existent and are discussed sporadically in literature for stretched horizons. Furthermore, the fluid-gravity correspondence is not formulated from a suitable energy-momentum tensor in the conventional manner. In the paper, we address these issues. By giving the energy conservation relation, we improve the fluid-gravity analogy on a generic null hypersurface. Additionally, by introducing a suitable energy-momentum tensor, which forms the basis of the entire fluid description, we formulate the entire fluid description of the null surface. Moreover, we provide the expression of continuity relation in the context of fluid-gravity correspondence. The entire analysis has been done for a generic null surface, which differs from the existing stretched horizon approach and, thereby, expands the scope of applicability for any arbitrary null surface.</description>

Abstract: We explore a comprehensive analysis of the formalism governing the gravitational field equations in degenerate higher-order scalar-tensor theories. The propagation of these theories in the vacuum has a maximum of three degrees of freedom and is at most quadratic in the second derivative of the scalar field. We investigate the gravitational field equation for spherically symmetric anisotropic matter content along with its non-conserved equations. Our analysis focuses on the evaluation of structure scalars to assess their behavior under Einstein's modification. We present a realistic mass contribution that sheds light on both geometric mass and total energy budget evaluations for celestial objects. Ultimately, we discuss two viable models restricted as minimal complexity and conformal flatness to enhance the scientific contribution of the present manuscript.</description>

      <title>Functional renormalization group study of a four-fermion model with CP violation: implications to spontaneous CP violation models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07027v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We work on the functional renormalization group analysis on a four-fermion model with the CP and P violation in light of nonperturbative exploration of the infrared dynamics of quantum chromodynamics (QCD) arising from the spontaneous CP violation models in a view of the Wilsonian renormalization group. The fixed point structure reveals that in the large-$N_c$ limit, the CP $\bar{\theta}$ parameter is induced and approaches $\pi \cdot (N_f/2)$ (with the number of flavors $N_f$) toward the chiral broken phase due to the criticality and the large anomalous dimensions of the $U(1)$ axial violating four-fermion couplings. This trend seems to be intact even going beyond the large-$N_c$ leading, as long as the infrared dynamics of QCD is governed by the scalar condensate of the quark bilinear as desired. This gives an impact on modeling of the spontaneous CP violation scenarios: the perturbatively irrelevant four-fermion interactions nonperturbatively get relevant in the chiral broken phase, implying that the neutron electric dipole moment becomes too big, unless cancellations due to extra CP and P violating contributions outside of QCD are present at a certain intermediate infrared scale.</description>

Abstract: We analytically calculate one- and two-loop helicity amplitudes in massless QED, by adopting a four-dimensional tensor decomposition. We draw our attention to four-fermion and Compton scattering processes to higher orders in the dimensional regulator, as required for theoretical predictions at N$^3$LO. We organise loop amplitudes by proposing an efficient algorithm at integrand level to group Feynman graphs into integral families. We study the singular structure of these amplitudes and discuss the correspondence between QED and QCD processes. We present our results in terms of generalised polylogarithms up to transcendental weight six.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07092v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The von Neumann entanglement entropy provides important information regarding critical points and continuum limits for analog simulators such as arrays of Rydberg atoms. The easily accessible mutual information associated with the bitstring probabilities of complementary subsets $A$ and $B$ of one-dimensional quantum chains, provide reasonably sharp lower bounds on the corresponding bipartite von Neumann quantum entanglement entropy $S^{vN}_A$. Here, we show that these bounds can in most cases be improved by removing the bitstrings with a probability lower than some value $p_{min}$ and renormalizing the remaining probabilities (filtering). Surprisingly, in some cases, as we increase $p_{min}$ the filtered mutual information tends to plateaus at values very close to $S^{vN}_A$ over some range of $p_{min}$. We discuss the dependence on the size of the system, the lattice spacing, and the bipartition of the system. These observations were found for ladders of Rydberg atoms using numerical methods. We also compare with analog simulations involving Rubidium atoms performed remotely with the Aquila device.</description>

      <title>Conservation Law and Trace Anomaly for the Stress Energy Tensor of a Self-Interacting Scalar Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07109v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a self-interacting, massive, real scalar field on a four-dimensional globally hyperbolic spacetime and the associated stress-energy tensor. Using techniques proper of the algebraic approach to perturbative quantum field theory, we study the associated, Wick-ordered, quantum observable. In particular we generalize a construction, first developed in the free field theory scenario by Moretti in [Mor03], aimed at exploiting the existing freedoms in the definition of the classical stress-energy tensor, in order to define a quantum counterpart which is divergence free. We prove that this procedure can be adapted also to cubic or quartic self-interactions, at least up to order $\mathcal{O}(\lambda^3)$ in perturbation theory. As in the free field scenario, the price to pay for ensuring that the quantum stress-energy tensor is divergence free is the emergence of a trace anomaly, which is here computed for a quartic self-interaction.</description>

      <title>Gravitational wave propagation beyond General Relativity: geometric optic expansion and lens-induced dispersion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07164v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The nature of gravity can be tested by how gravitational waves (GWs) are emitted, detected, and propagate through the universe. Propagation tests are powerful, as small deviations compound over cosmological distances. However, GW propagation tests of theories beyond Einstein's general relativity (GR) are limited by the high degree of symmetry of the average cosmological spacetime. Deviations from homogeneity, i.e. gravitational lenses, allow for new interactions, e.g., between standard GW polarization and new scalar or vector fields, with different spin. Therefore, GW lensing beyond GR offers novel tests of cosmological gravity. Here we present the theory of GW propagation beyond GR in the short-wave expansion, including corrections to the leading-order amplitude and phase for the first time. As an example, we compute the dispersive (frequency-dependent) corrections to all metric and scalar field perturbations in Brans-Dicke, the simplest modified theory exhibiting GW dispersion. GW lensing effects are too small to observe in Brans-Dicke theories compatible with solar system and binary pulsar limits. Nevertheless, our formalism opens the possibility of novel tests of gravity, including dark-energy theories and screening mechanisms.</description>

      <title>An Explicit Categorical Construction of Instanton Density in Lattice Yang-Mills Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07195v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Since the inception of lattice QCD, a natural definition for the Yang-Mills instanton on lattice has been long sought for. In a recent work, one of authors showed the natural solution has to be organized in terms of bundle gerbes in higher homotopy theory / higher category theory, and introduced the principles for such a categorical construction. To pave the way towards actual numerical implementation in the near future, nonetheless, an explicit construction is necessary. In this paper we provide such an explicit construction for $SU(2)$ gauge theory, with technical aspects inspired by L\"{u}scher's 1982 geometrical construction. We will see how the latter is in a suitable sense a saddle point approximation to the full categorical construction. The generalization to $SU(N)$ will be discussed. The construction also allows for a natural definition of lattice Chern-Simons-Yang-Mills theory in three spacetime dimensions.</description>

      <title>Soft Hair of Dynamical Black Hole and Hawking Radiation</title>

      <description>arXiv:1801.03658v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Soft hair of black hole has been proposed recently to play an important role in the resolution of the black hole information paradox. Recent work has emphasized that the soft modes cannot affect the black hole S-matrix due to Weinberg soft theorems. However as soft hair is generated by supertranslation of geometry which involves an angular dependent shift of time, it must have nontrivial quantum effects. We consider supertranslation of the Vaidya black hole and construct a non-spherical symmetric dynamical spacetime with soft hair. We show that this spacetime admits a trapping horizon and is a dynamical black hole. We find that Hawking radiation is emitted from the trapped horizon of the dynamical black hole. The Hawking radiation has a spectrum which depends on the soft hair of the black hole and this is consistent with the factorization property of the black hole S-matrix.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1812.11658v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: After initially meeting with fierce resistance, "branes", p-dimensional extended objects which go beyond particles (p=0) and strings (p=1), now occupy centre stage in theoretical physics as microscopic components of M-theory, as the seeds of the AdS/CFT correspondence, as a branch of particle phenomenology, as the higher-dimensional progenitors of black holes and, via the "brane-world", as entire universes in their own right. Notwithstanding this early opposition, Nino Zichichi invited me to to talk about supermembranes and eleven dimensions at the 1987 School on Subnuclear Physics and has continued to keep Erice on the brane ever since. Here I provide a distillation of my Erice brane lectures and some personal recollections.</description>

      <title>Study of Asymptotic Free Scalar Field Theories from Adaptive Perturbation Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.05266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.05266v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We focus on the behavior of (2+1)d $\lambda\phi^4$ and (5+1)d $\lambda\phi^3$ or $\lambda|\phi|^3$ theories in different regimes and compare the results obtained from the adaptive perturbation method with those obtained from lattice simulation. These theories are simple models that exhibit asymptotic freedom, which is a property that is also observed in more complex theories such as QCD, which describes the strong interaction between quarks and gluons. Asymptotic freedom is an important feature of these theories because it allows for a perturbative treatment of interactions at high energies. However, the standard perturbation scheme breaks down in the presence of strong interactions, and the adaptive perturbation method, which involves resuming the Feynman diagrams, is more suitable for studying these interactions. Our research involves comparing the perturbation result to lattice simulation. In the case of the $\phi^3$ theory, there is no stable vacuum, so we explore evidence from the $|\phi|^3$ theory instead. Our results appear to show that resummation improves the strong coupling result for both the $\lambda\phi^4$ and $\lambda|\phi|^3$ theories. Additionally, we improve the resummation method for the three-point coupling vertex and study the RG flow to analyze the resummation contribution and theoretical properties.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.06733v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate the existence of $N$-tuple critical points of uncharged AdS black holes in generalized quasi-topological theories. The criticality is shown to have a geometrical interpretation described by the Maxwell's equal area rule. We present a compact reformulation of the area rule and identify a criterion for the emergence such points. Using this criterion, we construct several multi-critical points with genuine generalized quasi-topological densities, including a quadruple and a quintuple points.</description>

      <title>Scattering on self-dual Taub-NUT</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.03834v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive exact solutions of massless free field equations and tree-level two-point amplitudes up to spin 2 on self-dual Taub-NUT space-time, as well as on its single copy, the self-dual dyon. We use Killing spinors to build analogues of momentum eigenstates, finding that, in the spirit of color-kinematics duality, those for the self-dual dyon lift directly to provide states on the self-dual Taub-NUT background if one replaces charge with energy. We discover that they are forced to have faster growth at infinity than in flat space due to the topological non-triviality of these backgrounds. The amplitudes for massless scalars and spinning particles in the $(+\,+)$ and $(+\,-)$ helicity configurations vanish for generic kinematics as a consequence of the integrability of the self-dual sector. The $(-\,-)$ amplitudes are non-vanishing and we compute them exactly in the backgrounds, which are treated non-perturbatively. It is explained how spin is easily introduced via a Newman-Janis imaginary shift along the spin-vector leading directly to the additional well-known exponential factor in the dot product of the spin with the momenta. We also observe a double copy relation between the gluon amplitude on a self-dual dyon and graviton amplitude on a self-dual Taub-NUT space-time.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.02742v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We combine perturbation theory with analytic and numerical bootstrap techniques to study the critical point of the long-range Ising (LRI) model in two and three dimensions. This model interpolates between short-range Ising (SRI) and mean-field behaviour. We use the Lorentzian inversion formula to compute infinitely many three-loop corrections in the two-dimensional LRI near the mean-field end. We further exploit the exact OPE relations that follow from bulk locality of the LRI to compute infinitely many two-loop corrections near the mean-field end, as well as some one-loop corrections near SRI. By including such exact OPE relations in the crossing equations for LRI we set up a very constrained bootstrap problem, which we solve numerically using SDPB. We find a family of sharp kinks for two- and three-dimensional theories which compare favourably to perturbative predictions, as well as some Monte Carlo simulations for the two-dimensional LRI.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.16244v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Placing a black hole in a cavity provides a natural framework for exploring gravitational scales, thermodynamic instabilities, and effective gravity theories. In this paper, we examine the evolution of entanglement entropy and entanglement islands in a two-sided extension of the Schwarzschild black hole in a cavity. By introducing a reflecting boundary in the eternal black hole exteriors, we regulate the infrared modes of Hawking radiation, finding that the entanglement entropy eventually saturates at a constant value. This value can be lower than the black hole thermodynamic entropy, thus avoiding the Page formulation of the information paradox. Regarding entanglement islands, we identify a universal effect induced by the boundary, which we term the ``blinking island'' -- where the entanglement island temporarily disappears, resulting in a short-time information paradox.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.08445v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we build on our previous work to further investigate the role of evanescent operators in gauge theories, with a particular focus on their contribution to violations of unitarity. We develop an efficient method for calculating the norms of gauge-invariant operators in Yang-Mills (YM) theory by employing on-shell form factors. Our analysis, applicable to general spacetime dimensions, reveals the existence of negative norm states among evanescent operators. We also explore the one-loop anomalous dimensions of these operators and find complex anomalous dimensions. We broaden our analysis by considering YM theory coupled with scalar fields and we observe similar patterns of non-unitarity. The presence of negative norm states and complex anomalous dimensions across these analyses provides compelling evidence that general gauge theories are non-unitary in non-integer spacetime dimensions.</description>

Abstract: The macroscopic energy-momentum and spin densities of relativistic spin hydrodynamics are obtained from the ensemble average of their respective microscopic definitions (quantum operators). These microscopic definitions suffer from ambiguities, meaning that, one may obtain different forms of symmetric energy-momentum tensor and spin tensor through pseudogauge transformations (or in other words Belinfante improvement procedure). However, this ambiguity may be removed if we obtain these currents using Noether's second theorem instead of widely used Noether's first theorem. In this article, we use Noether's second theorem to derive energy-momentum and spin currents without the need of pseudogauge transformations for free Dirac massive particles with spin one-half.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15033v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate a structure of a 4-dimensional bulk space constructed from the $O(N)$ invariant critical $\varphi^4$ model in 3-dimension using the conformal smearing. We calculate a bulk metric corresponding to the information metric and the bulk-to-boundary propagator for a composite scalar field $\varphi^2$ in the large $N$ expansion. We show that the bulk metric describes an asymptotic AdS space at both UV (near boundary) and IR (deep in the bulk) limits, which correspond to the asymptotic free UV fixed point and the Wilson-Fisher IR fixed point of the 3-dimensional $\varphi^4$ model, respectively. The bulk-to-boundary scalar propagator, on the other hand, encodes $\Delta_{\varphi^2}$ (the conformal dimension of $\varphi^2$) into its $z$ (a coordinate in the extra direction of the AdS space) dependence. Namely it correctly reproduces not only $\Delta_{\varphi^2}=1$ at UV fixed point but also $\Delta_{\varphi^2}=2$ at the IR fixed point for the boundary theory. Moreover, we confirm consistency with the GKP-Witten relation in the interacting theory that the coefficient of the $z^{\Delta_{\varphi^2}}$ term in $z\to 0$ limit agrees exactly with the two-point function of $\varphi^2$ including an effect of the $\varphi^4$ interaction. }</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05755v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate positivity properties in quantum field theory (QFT). We provide evidence,and in some case proofs, that many building blocks of scattering amplitudes, and in some cases the full amplitudes, satisfy an infinite number of positivity conditions: the functions, as well as all their signed derivatives, are non-negative in a specified kinematic region. Such functions are known as completely monotonic(CM) in the mathematics literature. A powerful way to certify complete monotonicity is via integral representations. We thus show that it applies to planar and non-planar Feynman integrals possessing a Euclidean region,as well as to certain Euler integrals relevant to cosmological correlators and stringy integrals. This implies that in particular that many basic building blocks of perturbation theory, such as master integrals, can be chosen to be completely monotone. We also discuss two pathways for showing complete monotonicity for full amplitudes. One is related to properties of the analytic S-matrix. The other one is a close connection between the CM property and Positive Geometry. Motivated by this, we investigate positivity properties in planar maximally supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory. We present evidence, based on known analytic multi-loop results, that the CM property extends to several physical quantities in this theory. This includes the (suitably normalized) finite remainder function of the six-particle maximally-helicity-violating (MHV) amplitude, four-point scattering amplitudes on the Coulomb branch,four-point correlation functions, as well as the angle-dependent cusp anomalous dimension. Our findings are however not limited to supersymmetric theories. It is shown that the CM property holds for the QCD and QED cusp anomalous dimensions, to three and four loops, respectively. We comment on open questions, and on possible numerical applications of complete monotonicity.</description>

Abstract: Effective field theories break down inside large black holes on macroscopic scales when tidal forces are string-sized. If $r_0$ is the horizon radius and $\alpha'$ is the square of the string scale, the 4D Schwarzschild interior is strongly curved at $ \big(r_0 \alpha' \big)^{1/3}$. Infalling massless probes that reach this scale stretch and become excited strings. I generalize this picture for a wide class of black hole solutions in string theory. For the black hole dual to the large-$N$ BFSS model in a thermal state, and denoting $\ell_P$ the Planck length, tidal forces are stringy at $r_0 \left(\frac{r_0}{N^{1/3} \ell_P}\right)^{3/11}$, which is greater than the scale where string perturbation theory breaks down for sufficiently large $r_0/\ell_P$. For 4D Kerr, there is a range of spin parameters for which the inner horizon is to the future of the scale of stringy curvature. These results specify the portion of black hole interior solutions where effective field theory can be used; beyond these scales, one must resort to other methods.</description>

      <title>On the definition of Carrollian amplitudes in general dimensions</title>

Abstract: Carrollian amplitude is the natural object that defines the correlator of the boundary Carrollian field theory. In this work, we will elaborate on its proper definition in general dimensions. We use the vielbein field on the unit sphere to define the fundamental field with non-vanishing helicity in the local Cartesian frame which is the building block of the Carrollian amplitude. In general dimensions, the Carrollian amplitude is related to the momentum space scattering matrix by a modified Fourier transform. The Poincar\'e transformation law of the Carrollian amplitude in this definition has been discussed. We also find an isomorphism between the local rotation of the vielbein field and the superduality transformation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03723v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Zero-point fluctuations in the background of a cosmic string provide an opportunity to study the effects of topology in quantum field theory. We use a scattering theory approach to compute quantum corrections to the energy density of a cosmic string, using the "ballpoint pen" and "flowerpot" models to allow for a nonzero string radius. For computational efficiency, we consider a massless field in $2+1$ dimensions. We show how to implement precise and unambiguous renormalization conditions in the presence of a deficit angle, and make use of Kontorovich-Lebedev techniques to rewrite the sum over angular momentum channels as an integral on the imaginary axis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17913v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum Electrodynamics in 2+1 dimensions (QED$_3$) with two Dirac fermions displays time reversal symmetry, nontrivial SPT phases and anomalies. The fate of this theory in its strongly coupled regime has been debated extensively. Surprisingly, we find that gluing together the phase diagrams of two standard Wilson-Fisher $O(4)$ theories suffices to reproduce all the SPT phases, anomalies, and semi-classical limits. A central mechanism behind it is ``SPT absorption''. The patching of the $O(4)$ transitions makes very concrete predictions for the behavior of the theory in its strongly coupled limits; for instance, the $\theta=\pi$ sigma model with $S^3$ topology appears due to monopole condensation.</description>

      <title>Holographic Renyi entropy of 2d CFT in KdV generalized ensemble</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.19271v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH) in chaotic two dimensional CFTs is subtle due to infinitely many conserved KdV charges. Previous works have demonstrated that primary CFT eigenstates have flat entanglement spectrum, which is very different from the microcanonical ensemble. This result is an apparent contradiction to conventional ETH, which does not take KdV charges into account. In a companion paper \cite{KdVETHgeneral}, we resolve this discrepancy by studying the subsystem entropy of a chaotic CFT in KdV-generalized Gibbs and microcanonical ensembles. In this paper, we carry out parallel computations in the context of AdS/CFT. We focus on the high density limit, which is equivalent to thermodynamic limit in conformal theories. In this limit holographic Renyi entropy can be computed using the so-called gluing construction. We explicitly study the KdV-generalized microcanonical ensemble with the densities of the first two KdV charges $\langle \mathcal{Q}_1\rangle = q_1,\langle \mathcal{Q}_3\rangle = q_3$ fixed and obeying $q_3-q_1^2 \ll q_1^2$. In this regime we found that the refined Renyi entropy $\tilde{S}_n$ is $n$-independent for $n&gt;n_{cut}$, where $n_{cut}$ depends on $q_1,q_3$. By taking the primary state limit $q_3\to q_1^2$, we recover flat entanglement spectrum characteristic of fixed-area states, in agreement with the primary state behavior. This provides a consistency check of the KdV-generalized ETH in 2d CFTs.</description>

      <title>The horocycle regulator: exact cutoff-independence in AdS/CFT</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.00950v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While the entanglement entropy of a single subregion in quantum field theory is formally infinite and requires regularization, certain combinations of entropies are perfectly finite in the limit that the regulator is removed, the mutual information being a common example. For generic regulator schemes, such as a holographic calculation with a uniform radial cutoff, these quantities show non-trivial dependence on the regulator at finite values of the cutoff. We investigate a holographic regularization scheme defined in three-dimensional anti-de Sitter space constructed from \textit{horocycles}, curves in two-dimensional hyperbolic space perpendicular to all geodesics approaching a single point on the boundary, that leads to finite information measures that are \textit{totally} cutoff-independent, even at finite values of the regulator. We describe a broad class of such information measures, and describe how the field theory dual to the horocycle regulator is inherently non-local.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07322v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We describe the construction of large classes of explicit string theory backgrounds corresponding to 6d and 4d chiral theories with end of the world boundaries, and describe the strong coupling phenomena involved in gapping the chiral (but non-anomalous) sets of fields, such as strongly coupled phase transitions or symmetric mass generation. One class of 6d constructions is closely related to chirality changing phase transitions, such as those turning heterotic NS5-branes into gauge instantons, in flat space or orbifold singularities. A class of 4d models exploits systems of IIB D3-branes at toric CY3 singularities with an extra $\mathbf{Z}_2$ involution related to $G_2$ holonomy manifolds in the type IIB picture and its IIA mirror, which we explicitly describe in terms of dimer diagrams.</description>

Abstract: Exact finite-energy solutions to the nonlinear governing equations of the Born-Infeld theory of electrodynamics, describing continuous distributions of electric, magnetic, and dyonic charge sources, in both classical and generalized settings, are constructed explicitly. In particular, it is shown that, the finiteness of the total prescribed charges leads to the finiteness of the total energy, of the electromagnetic field system. As a by-product, this result resolves a puzzle arising in the dyonic point charge distribution situation where energy divergence inevitably occurs.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the linearized stability and causality properties of relativistic viscous superfluid hydrodynamics. The Landau-Lifshitz-Clark-Putterman formulation for the theory of relativistic viscous superfluids suffers from the same instability and acausality issues as the relativistic Navier-Stokes equation for normal fluids when written in the formulations of Eckart or Landau and Lifshitz. We show that conditions to ensure stability and causality can be satisfied with judicious redefinitions of the hydrodynamic variables. The conditions we obtain hold at non-zero superfluid velocity as well.</description>

      <title>Restricted Phase Space Thermodynamics of Dyonic AdS Black Holes: Comparative Analysis Using Different Entropy Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02273v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the Restricted Phase Space Thermodynamics (RPST) for the AdS dyonic black hole carrying the central charge $C$ and the chemical potential $\mu$, neglecting the pressure and conjugate volume along with comparison of different entropy models namely the Bekenstein-Hawking and the R\'enyi entropy model. Inclusion of the magnetic charge $\tilde{Q}_m$ gives rise to a richer phase structure of the study of thermodynamics by adding a non-equilibrium transition from an unstable small black hole to a stable black hole on top of the Van der Waals transition in the $T-S$ processes and a Hawking-Page transition in the $F-T$ plots. We study an extra mixed ensemble ($\tilde{\Phi}_e,\tilde{Q}_m)$ due to the inclusion of $\tilde{Q}_m$ where we see Van der Waals phase transition and whose plots change as the entropy model changes though the style of transition remains the same. We observe an interesting phenomenon where changing the R\'enyi parameter $\lambda$, the $T-S$ process changes the same way as when varying the central charge $C$ underlining some similarity that is not seen in the Bekenstein Hawking entropy model. We observe a similarity between the plots when both charges are turned off relating to the Schwarzschild black hole and the grand-canonical ensemble. One can observe that as the entropy models are changed, the homogeneity is not lost where the mass as a function of extensive variables is of order one and the rest zero. Finally, we see a similarity in the $\mu-C$ process across the entropy models signally some universality across entropy models as well as different types of black holes studied before.</description>

      <title>On brane systems with O${}^+$ planes -- 5d and 6d SCFTs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02491v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study Higgs branches of field theories with 8 supercharges in 5 and 6 dimensions, focusing on theories realised on 5-brane webs in Type IIB with an O$7^+$ plane, or a D6-D8-NS5 brane system in Type IIA in the presence of an O$8^+$ plane. We find magnetic quivers for the Higgs branches of these theories. The main consequence of the presence of the orientifold is that it renders the magnetic quiver to be non-simply-laced. We propose a contribution of the O$7^+$ to the usual stable intersection number of 5-branes from tropical geometry, and show that it is consistent with Fayet-Iliopoulos deformations of magnetic quivers which represent mass deformations of 5d SQFTs. From the magnetic quivers, we compute phase diagrams and highest weight generating functions for the Higgs branches, enabling us to identify the global form of the flavour symmetry for several families of 5d SQFTs; among them Bhardwaj's rank-1 theory. For 6d theories realised on a $-4$ curve, we observe the appearance of an additional $D_4$ slice on top of the phase diagram as one goes to the tensionless limit.</description>

      <title>Parity asymmetry of primordial scalar and tensor power spectra</title>

      <description>arXiv:2209.03928v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Although the cosmic microwave background (CMB) is largely understood to be homogeneous and isotropic, the CMB angular power spectra present anomalies that seem to break down parity symmetry at large angular scales. We argue that the primordial scalar and tensor power spectra can be parity asymmetric in our new construction of inflationary quantum fluctuations. Our formulation stems from the foundational questions of quantum field theory in curved spacetime in which we impose geometric superselection rules to the vacuum structure for (single-field) inflationary quantum fluctuations based on discrete spacetime transformations ($\mathcal{P}\mathcal{T}$). As a result, we estimate the amplitude of power asymmetry in the scalar and tensor sectors at different scales of $ 10^{-4} {\rm Mpc^{-1}}\lesssim k\lesssim 10^{-3}{\rm Mpc^{-1}}$. In particular, we predict the parity asymmetry for the primordial gravitational waves (PGWs) and quantify it for different models, like Starobinsky and $\alpha-$attractor single-field inflationary scenarios.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2301.00025v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: I perform a template-based search for stimulated emission of Hawking radiation (or Boltzmann echoes) by combining the gravitational wave data from 47 binary black hole merger events observed by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA collaboration. With a Bayesian inference approach, I found no statistically significant evidence for this signal in either of the 3 Gravitational Wave Transient Catalogs GWTC-1, GWTC-2 and GWTC-3. While the data does not provide definitive evidence against the presence of Boltzmann echoes, the Bayesian evidence for most events falls within the range of 0.3-1.6, with the hypothesis of a common (non-vanishing) echo amplitude for all mergers being weakly disfavoured at 2:5 odds. The only exception is GW190521, the most massive and confidently detected event ever observed, which shows a positive evidence of 9.2 for stimulated Hawking radiation. The ''look-elsewhere'' effect for this outlier event is assessed by applying two distinct methods to add simulated signals in real data, before and after the event, giving false (true) positive detection probabilities for higher Bayes factors of $1.5^{+1.2}_{-0.9}\%$, $4.4^{+2.0}_{-2.0} \%$ ($35 \pm 7 \%$, $35 \pm 15 \%$). An optimal combination of posteriors yields an upper limit of $A &lt; 0.4$ (at 90\% confidence level) for a universal echo amplitude, whereas $A \sim 1$ was predicted in the canonical model. To ensure the robustness of the results, I have employed an additional method to combine the events hierarchically. This approach involves using a target gaussian distribution and extracting the parameters from multiple uncertain observations, which may be affected by selection biases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.03398v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a family of SO($n$)-symmetric spin chains which generalize the transverse-field Ising chain for $n=1$. These spin chains are defined with Gamma matrices and can be exactly solved by mapping to $n$ species of itinerant Majorana fermions coupled to a static $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge field. Their phase diagrams include a critical point described by the $\mathrm{Spin}(n)_{1}$ conformal field theory as well as two distinct gapped phases. We show that one of the gapped phases is a trivial phase and the other realizes a symmetry-protected topological phase when $n \geq 2$. These two gapped phases are proved to be related to each other by a Kramers-Wannier duality. Furthermore, other elegant structures in the transverse-field Ising chain, such as the infinite-dimensional Onsager algebra, also carry over to our models.</description>

Abstract: For conformally K\"ahler Riemannian four-manifolds with a Killing field, we present a framework to solve the field equations for generalised gravitational instantons corresponding to conformal self-duality and to cosmological Einstein-Maxwell. After deriving generic identities for the curvature of such manifolds without assuming field equations, we obtain $SU(\infty)$ Toda formulations for the Page-Pope, Plebanski-Demianski, and Chen-Teo classes, we show how to solve the (modified) Toda equation, and we use this to find conformally self-dual and Einstein-Maxwell generalisations of these geometries.</description>

Abstract: The radiation-dominated universe is a key ingredient of the standard Big Bang cosmology. Radiation comprises numerous quantum elementary particles, and the macroscopic behavior of radiation is described by taking the quantum thermal average of its constituents. While the interactions between individual particles and gravitational waves are often neglected in this context, it raises the question of whether these elementary particles interact with gravitational waves in the framework of quantum field theory. To address this question, this paper aims to explore the quantum mechanical aspects of gravitational waves in a universe dominated by a massless scalar field, whose averaged energy-momentum tensor plays the role of background radiation. We establish the equivalence between the classical Einstein equation and the mean-field approximation of the Heisenberg equation in a local thermal state. Beyond the mean-field approximation, we analyze the quantum corrections to gravitational waves, particularly focusing on the thermal radiation loop corrections. Interestingly, we find the 1-loop correction surpasses the tree-level spectrum of primordial gravitational waves, which is $O(\alpha^2)$ where $\alpha=H_{\rm inf}/M_{\rm pl}$ is the ratio of the inflationary Hubble parameter to the Planck mass. Then, to see if this result persists even if we take into account all the higher order loop corrections, the loop expansion is reorganized in the series expansion in $\alpha$. We schematically discuss two-loop diagrams that may give $O(\alpha^2)$ contributions. We leave explicit computations of these diagrams for future studies. Thus, although we cannot claim that the whole loop corrections exceed the tree-level spectrum at the moment, our findings highlight the significance of quantum effects when studying the interaction between radiation and gravitational waves in the cosmological context.</description>

      <title>Reconstructing the metric in group field theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.10016v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a group field theory (GFT) for quantum gravity coupled to four massless scalar fields, using these matter fields to define a (relational) coordinate system. We exploit symmetries of the GFT action, in particular under shifts in the values of the scalar fields, to derive a set of classically conserved currents, and show that the same conservation laws hold exactly at the quantum level regardless of the choice of state. We propose a natural interpretation of the conserved currents which implies that the matter fields always satisfy the Klein--Gordon equation in GFT. We then observe that in our matter reference frame, the same conserved currents can be used to extract all components of an effective GFT spacetime metric. Finally, we apply this construction to the simple example of a spatially flat homogeneous and isotropic universe, where we derive an effective Friedmann equation directly from this metric. The Friedmann equation displays a bounce and a late-time limit equivalent to general relativity with a single scalar field. Our proposal goes substantially beyond the GFT literature in which only specific geometric quantities such as the total volume or volume perturbations could be defined, opening up the possibility to study more general geometries as emerging from GFT.</description>

      <title>On Sphaleron Heating in the Presence of Fermions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.13739v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Axion-like particles with a coupling to non-Abelian gauge fields at finite temperature can experience dissipation due to sphaleron heating. This could play an important role for warm inflation or dynamical dark energy. We investigate to what degree the efficiency of this non-perturbative mechanism depends on the details of the underlying particle physics model. For a wide range of scenarios and energy scales, we find that a previously discussed suppression of sphaleron heating by light fermions can be alleviated. As an outlook, we point out that fermionic effects may provide a new mechanism for ending warm inflation.</description>

      <title>Some exact Green function solutions for non-linear classical field theories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.17718v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider some non-linear non-homogeneous partial differential equations (PDEs) and derive their exact Green function solution as a functional Taylor expansion in powers of the source. The kind of PDEs we consider are dispersive ones where the exact solution of the corresponding homogeneous equations can have some known shape. The technique has a formal similarity with the Dyson--Schwinger set of equations to solve quantum field theories. However, there are no physical constraints. Indeed, we show that a complete coincidence with the statistical field model of a quartic scalar theory can be achieved in the Gaussian expansion of the cumulants of the partition function.</description>

      <title>Negative pressure as a quantum effect in free-streaming in the cosmological background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08661v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a study of energy density and pressure of a free real scalar quantum field after its decoupling from a thermal bath in the spatially flat Friedman-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker space-time by solving the Klein-Gordon equation both analytically and numerically for different predetermined scale factor functions $a(t)$. The energy density and pressure, defined by subtracting the vacuum expectation values at the decoupling time, feature corrections with respect to the classical free-streaming solution of the relativistic Boltzmann equation. We show that if the expansion rate is comparable or larger than $mc^2/\hbar$ or $KT_0/\hbar$ where $m$ is the mass and $T_0$ the decoupling temperature, both energy density and pressure get strong quantum corrections which substantially modify their classical dependence on the scale factor $a(t)$ and drive pressure to large negative values. For a minimally coupled field with a very low mass in an expanding de Sitter universe quantum corrections become dominant driving pressure and energy density to become asymptotically constant with an equation of state $p/\varepsilon \simeq -1$. For a minimally coupled massless field, quantum corrections are asymptotically dominant for any accelerated expansion.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08868v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gravitational memory effects and the BMS freedoms exhibited at future null infinity have recently been resolved and utilized in numerical relativity simulations. With this, gravitational wave models and our understanding of the fundamental nature of general relativity have been vastly improved. In this paper, we review the history and intuition behind memory effects and BMS symmetries, how they manifest in gravitational waves, and how controlling the infinite number of BMS freedoms of numerical relativity simulations can crucially improve the waveform models that are used by gravitational wave detectors. We reiterate the fact that, with memory effects and BMS symmetries, not only can these next-generation numerical waveforms be used to observe never-before-seen physics, but they can also be used to test GR and learn new astrophysical information about our universe.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02417v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show, both analytically and numerically, that non-Gaussian tails in the probability density function of curvature perturbations arise in ultra-slow-roll inflation from the $\delta N$ formalism, without invoking stochastic inflation. Previously reported discrepancies between both approaches are a consequence of not correctly accounting for momentum perturbations. Once they are taken into account, both approaches agree to an excellent degree. The shape of the tail depends strongly on the phase space of inflation.</description>

      <title>Light rings and causality for nonsingular ultracompact objects sourced by nonlinear electrodynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07957v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study observational signatures of nonsingular ultracompact objects regularized by nonlinear electrodynamics. The phenomenon of birefringence causes photons of different polarizations to propagate with respect to two distinct metrics, which manifests itself in the appearance of additional light rings surrounding the ultracompact object. We analyze the observational consequences of this result and illustrate our findings based on three regular black hole models commonly considered in the literature. We find that nonsingular horizonless ultracompact objects sourced by nonlinear electrodynamics possess an odd number of light rings and discuss the viability of this model as an effective description of their properties. In addition, we compare the phase velocities of polarized light rays propagating in nonsingular geometries sourced by nonlinear electrodynamics to the corresponding phase velocity in the Schwarzschild spacetime and demonstrate that regularizing the singularity by means of a theory that does not adhere to the Maxwell weak-field limit may lead to the emergence of acausal regions.</description>

      <title>Approximate quantum error correcting codes from conformal field theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09555v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The low-energy subspace of a conformal field theory (CFT) can serve as a quantum error correcting code, with important consequences in holography and quantum gravity. We consider generic 1+1D CFT codes under extensive local dephasing channels and analyze their error correctability in the thermodynamic limit. We show that (i) there is a finite decoding threshold if and only if the minimal nonzero scaling dimension in the fusion algebra generated by the jump operator of the channel is larger than $1/2$ and (ii) the number of protected logical qubits $k \geq \Omega( \log \log n)$, where $n$ is the number of physical qubits. As an application, we show that the one-dimensional quantum critical Ising model has a finite threshold for certain types of dephasing noise. Our general results also imply that a CFT code with continuous symmetry saturates a bound on the recovery fidelity for covariant codes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14391v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gravity is derived from an entropic action coupling matter fields with geometry. The fundamental idea is to relate the metric of Lorentzian spacetime to a density matrix and to describe the matter fields topologically, according to a Dirac-K\"ahler description, as the direct sum of a zero-form, a one-form and a two-form. While the geometry of spacetime is defined by its metric, the matter fields can be used to define an alternative metric, the metric induced by the matter fields, which geometrically describes the interplay between spacetime and matter. The proposed entropic action is the quantum relative entropy between the metric of spacetime and the metric induced by the matter fields. The modified Einstein equations obtained from this action reduce to the Einstein equations with zero cosmological constant in the regime of low coupling. By introducing the G-field, which acts as a set of Lagrangian multipliers, the proposed entropic action reduces to a dressed Einstein-Hilbert action with an emergent small and positive cosmological constant only dependent on the G-field. The obtained equations of modified gravity remains second order in the metric and in the G-field. A canonical quantization of this field theory could bring new insights into quantum gravity while further research might clarify the role that the G-field could have for dark matter.</description>

      <title>Is the type-D NUT C-metric really "missing" from the most general Pleba\'nski-Demia\'nski solution?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06733v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It remains a long-standing problem, unsettled for almost two decades in the general relativity community, ever since Griffiths and Podolsky demonstrated in Ref. [J.B. Griffiths and J. Podolsky, Class. Quant. Grav. 22, 3467 (2005)] that the type-D NUT C-metric seems to be absent from the most general family of the type-D Pleba\'nski-Demia\'nski (P-D) solution. However, Astorino [Phys. Rev. D 109, 084038 (2024)] presented a different form of rotating and accelerating black holes and showed that all known four-dimensional type-D accelerating black holes (without the NUT charge) can be recovered via various different limits in a definitive fashion. In particular, he provided, for the first time, the correct expressions for the type-D static accelerating black holes with a nonzero NUT charge, which was previously impossible using the traditional parametrization of the familiar P-D solution. Nevertheless, it still remains elusive how these two different forms of the four-dimensional rotating and accelerating solutions are related. In this paper, we aim to fill this gap by finding the obvious coordinate transformations and parameter identifications between the vacuum metrics after two different parametrizations of the generated solution via the inverse scattering method from the seed metric -- the Rindler vacuum background. We then resolve this ``missing" puzzle by providing another M\"{o}bius transformation and linear combinations of the Killing coordinates, which clearly cast the type-D NUT C-metric into the familiar form of the P-D solution. Additionally, we propose an alternative new routine for the normalization of the obtained metric derived via the inverse scattering method from the vacuum seed solution, which could be potentially useful for the construction of higher-dimensional solutions using the trivial vacuum background as the seed metric.</description>

      <title>Generalized Komar charges and Smarr formulas for black holes and boson stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08268v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The standard Komar charge is a $(d-2)$-form that can be defined in spacetimes admitting a Killing vector and which is closed when the vacuum Einstein equations are satisfied. Its integral at spatial infinity (the Komar integral) gives the conserved charge associated to the Killing vector, and, due to its on-shell closedness, the same value (expressed in terms of other physical variables) is obtained integrating over the event horizon (if any). This equality is the basis of the Smarr formula. This charge can be generalized so that it still is closed on-shell in presence of matter and its integrals give generalizations of the Smarr formula. We show how the Komar charge and other closed $(d-2)$-form charges can be used to prove non-existence theorems for gravitational solitons and boson stars. In particular, we show how one can deal with generalized symmetric fields (invariant under a combination of isometries and other global symmetries) and how the geralized symmetric ansatz permits to evade the non-existence theorems.</description>

      <title>Field redefinition and its impact in relativistic hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15387v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore the impact of field redefinition on the spectrum of linearized perturbations in relativistic hydrodynamics. We observe that the spectrum of hydrodynamics modes is never affected by the local field redefinition, however, the spectrum of the non-hydrodynamic modes is affected. Through an appropriate all-order redefinition, non-hydrodynamic modes can be eliminated, leading to a new frame where the spectrum contains only hydrodynamic modes. We also observe that the resulting stress-energy tensor may have an infinite series in momentum space, with a convergence radius linked to the eliminated non-hydrodynamic mode. In certain special cases, higher-order terms in the stress-energy tensor under field redefinition may cancel, indicating that non-hydrodynamic modes are mere artefacts of the fluid variable choice and hold no physical significance, even if they appear to violate physical constraints. Using a special toy example, we find a criterion to distinguish between physical and unphysical non-hydrodynamic modes.</description>

      <title>Chern-Simons Induced Thermal Friction on Axion Domain Walls</title>

Abstract: We study the dynamics and interactions of the solitonic domain walls that occur in realistic axion electrodynamics models including the Chern-Simons interaction, $a\epsilon_{\mu\nu\lambda\sigma}F^{\mu\nu} F^{\lambda\sigma}$, between an axion $a(x)$ of mass $m_a$, and a massless U(1) gauge field, e.g. EM, interacting with strength $\alpha=e^2/4\pi$ with charged matter, e.g. electron-positron pairs. In particular, in the presence of a U(1) gauge-and-matter relativistic thermal plasma we study the friction experienced by the walls due to the Chern-Simons term. Utilizing the linear response method we include the collective effects of the plasma, as opposed to purely particle scattering across the wall (as is done in previous treatments) which is valid only in the thin wall regime that is rarely applicable in realistic cases. We show that the friction depends on the Lorentz-$\gamma$-factor-dependent inverse thickness of the wall in the plasma frame, $\ell^{-1} \sim \gamma m_a$, compared to the three different plasma scales, the temperature $T$, the Debye mass $m_D\sim\sqrt{\alpha} T$, and the damping rate $\Gamma \sim \alpha^2 T$, and elucidate the underlying physical intuition for this behavior. (For friction in the thin-wall-limit we correct previous expressions in the literature.) We further consider the effects of long-range coherent magnetic fields that are possibly present in the early universe and compare their effect with that of thermal magnetic fields. Finally, we briefly discuss the possible early universe consequences of our results for domain wall motion and network decay, stochastic gravitational wave production from domain wall networks, and possible primordial black hole production from domain wall collapse, though a more complete discussion of these topics is reserved for a companion paper.</description>

      <title>Gauge coupling jump and small instantons from a large non-minimal coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00768v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: If a scalar field couples to the Ricci scalar with a large non-minimal coupling, the Standard Model coupling parameters can differ above and below an intermediate field range of the scalar due to the non-renormalizability. In this paper, we study, for the first time, the threshold effects on a gauge coupling in both Metric and Palatini formulations of gravity. We find that the gauge coupling naturally jumps around this intermediate scale since counter terms for the renormalization behave so. If the gauge coupling becomes strong with a large scalar field value due to this effect, there can be an enhanced small instanton contribution, the dilute gas approximation of which is justified because the gauge sector decouples when the scalar wave mode is very short. Using these findings, we discuss the QCD axion quality problem, the heavy QCD axion, the QCD axion abundance, and the suppression of isocurvature perturbations. We show that axion physics may differ substantially from na\"{i}ve expectations when we introduce a large non-minimal coupling for any scalar field.</description>

      <title>Predicting New Above-Threshold Molecular States Via Triangular Singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03119v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Considering that the experimentally observed molecular states are significantly fewer than those predicted theoretically, and that these states are traditionally classified as lying below thresholds while several candidates are found above them, we propose to broaden the definition of molecular states to include those that exist just above the thresholds. Identifying resonance peaks in invariant mass distributions and scattering cross-sections is crucial for probing these states, yet the mechanisms responsible for such enhancements remain unclear, complicating our understanding of new particle production. While the peaks linked to triangular singularities do not correspond to true hadronic states, the associated production mechanisms may provide valuable insight into the search for genuine hadrons. In this work, we propose employing the triangular singularity mechanism to theoretically investigate yet-to-be-observed molecular states, particularly those that could test heavy quark symmetry. We argue that these states may have true masses surpassing the thresholds of their constituent components, rather than being predicted to be below them by theoretical models. Our findings suggest the possible existence of 16 additional heavy quark molecular states, including $X(4014)$, $Z_{cs}(4123)$, $Y(4320)$, $Z(4430)$, and $\Upsilon(11020)$, which are posited to contain $D^{*}\bar{D}^{*}$, $D^{*}\bar{D}^{*}_{s}$, $D_1\bar{D}$, $D_1\bar{D}^{*}$, and $B_{1}(5721)\bar{B}$ constituents, respectively. The recognition of these states would substantiate heavy quark symmetry and enhance our understanding of hadronic dynamics and molecular states formation.</description>
