      <title>Twins in relativistic spacetimes: dispelling some misconceptions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21455v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In contrast to Newtonian physics, there is no absolute time in relativistic (Lorentzian) spacetimes. This immediately implies that two twins may, in general, age at different rates. For this to happen, there must be, of course, some asymmetry between their worldlines, along which the elapsed proper times are evaluated; such asymmetry might not be, however, so intuitively apparent. Our primary objective is to present, in a concise and didactic manner, some lesser-known results and derive novel ones from a modern, geometrical, and covariant standpoint, which aims to clarify the issue and dispel related misconceptions. First, we recall that: (i) the original ``twin paradox'' may be perfectly dealt with in special relativity (physics in a flat spacetime) and does not necessarily involve an accelerated twin. We then explore the issue of differential aging in general relativity (physics in a curved background) in the prototypical case of the vacuum Schwarzschild spacetime, considering several pairs of twins. In this context, we show that: (ii) it is not true that a twin which gets closer to the Schwarzschild horizon, by being subject to a stronger gravitational field, where time sort of slows down, should always get younger than a twin that stays further away, in a region of weaker gravitational field, and (iii) it is also false that an accelerated twin always returns younger than a geodesic one. Finally, we argue that (iv) in a generic spacetime, there is no universal correlation between the phenomena of differential aging and the Doppler effect. Two particularly pedagogical resources provided are a glossary of relevant terms and supplementary Python notebooks in a GitHub repository.</description>

      <title>Engaging and Educating Eclipse Observers Through Workshops, Media, Planetarium shows and Citizen Science</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.22348v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Heliophysics Big Year was an extended year where major solar events engaged the public. It included two eclipses (annular on October 14, 2023 and total on April 8, 2024), plus solar max and the Parker Solar Probe perihelion December 24, 2024. After the eclipse of 2017, many millions more Americans planned to view the solar corona. We expanded our eclipse website with activities, citizen science projects, resources, training videos, equipment, and external links. We were the Southwest Regional Coordinator for Citizen CATE 2024 project, training the state coordinators and their teams with the equipment and procedures. We trained teachers at local, regional, national, and international workshops, providing eclipse viewing cards, lenses to make solar cup projectors, a safe viewing screen pattern, and access to the training materials. We made presentations to the media and hosted public events to demonstrate safe eclipse viewing techniques. HMNS hosted live viewing for the annular and total plus solstice and equinox events, reaching tens of thousands of people. HMNS also secured a grant to provide 100 eclipse viewing cards for every public school (8,800+) in Texas. We distributed another 57,000 eclipse viewers to teachers and the public. We appeared in media both in advance of the eclipses and as live commentators. The most lasting and impactful product was our planetarium show Totality, which was given away free and shown in various formats (flatscreen, fisheye, or prewarped). Over 180,000 views of the show and its animations have been documented. We continued to improve our space weather forecasting site, which correctly predicted the major solar storms of May 10-11 and October 8-10, 2024. In total, we reached nearly two million learners.</description>
