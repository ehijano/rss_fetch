      <title>Optional intervals event, sequential operation and their applications in physics, computer science and applied mathematics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09471v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce algebraic theories such as set theory and group theory into the analysis of the execution interval and sequence of events. We propose Optional Intervals Event(OIE) as an abstract entity mapping to events, and define two sequential operations, "Complete Sequential Addition" for concurrent events and "Complete Sequential Multiplication" for sequential events. We prove that "Complete Sequential Addition" forms a commutative semigroup and "Complete Sequential Multiplication" forms a semigroup under their extended result sets, and draw Cayley tables to visualize algebraic structures. We use these new concepts to provide a new formal representation of "starting simultaneously" thereby resolving measurement errors. Finally, we present other implications derived from our work. This work enables more rigorous event scheduling, physical simulations, and computational modeling beyond observational limitations.</description>

      <title>A study of a family of self-referential sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18103v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce and analyze a three-parameter family of self-referential integer sequences $S(x,y,z)$: starting from $a(1)=x$, each term advances by $y$ when the index $k$ has already appeared as a value and by $z$ otherwise. This simple rule generates a surprising zoo of behaviors, many of which are catalogued - albeit in a rather unstructured fashion - in the OEIS. This family has recently and independently been studied by Fokkink and Joshi, who named them "hiccup sequences" and established their general morphic nature. Our work provides a complementary, in-depth analysis of major subfamilies. Whenever $y&gt;z&gt;0$, we prove that the density $a(k)/k$ converges to the positive root of $r^{2}-zr-(y-z)=0$. Two subfamilies, $S(x,Z+1,Z)$ and $S(x,Z,Z+1)$, yield explicit non-homogeneous Beatty sequences, providing explicit formulas for numerous OEIS entries. For $y=0$ and $z \ge 2$, the sequences eventually become periodic and satisfy linear recurrences. Critical cases with a zero discriminant unveil geometric patterns on triangular, square, and hexagonal lattices. Finally, via tree-like representations we uncover a tight link with meta-Fibonacci recurrences. These results position $S(x,y,z)$ as a unifying framework connecting additive combinatorics, number theory, and discrete dynamics.</description>
