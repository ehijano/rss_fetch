      <title>Energy of a graph and Randi\'c index of subgraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03561v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a new inequality between the energy of a graph and a weighted sum over the edges of the graph. Using this inequality we prove that $\mathcal{E}(G)\geq 2R(H)$, where $ \mathcal{E}(G)$ is the energy of a graph $G$ and $R(H)$ is the Randi\'c index of any subgraph of $G$ (not necessarily induced). In particular, this generalizes well-known inequalities $\mathcal{E}(G)\geq 2R(G)$ and $\mathcal{E}(G)\geq 2\mu(G)$ where $\mu(G)$ is the matching number. We give other inequalities as applications to this result.</description>

      <title>A note on sequences variant of irregularity strength for hypercubes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03612v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $f: E \mapsto \{1,2,\dots,k\}$ be an edge coloring of the $n$ - dimensional hypercube $H_n$. By the palette at a vertex $v$ we mean the sequence $\left(f(e_1(v)), f(e_1(v)),\dots, f(e_n(v))\right)$, where $e_i(v)$ is the $i$ - dimensional edge incident to $v$. In the paper, we show that two colors are enough to distinguish all vertices of the $n$ - dimensional hypercube $H_n$ ($n \geq 2$) by their palettes. We also show that if $f$ is a proper edge coloring of the hypercube $H_n$ ($n\geq 5$), then $n$ colors suffice to distinguish all vertices by their palettes.</description>

      <title>About the second neighborhood conjecture for tournaments missing two stars or disjoint paths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03635v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Seymour's Second Neighborhood Conjecture (SSNC) asserts that every oriented finite simple graph (without digons) has a vertex whose second out-neighborhood is at least as large as its first out-neighborhood. Such a vertex is said to have the second neighborhood property (SNP). In this paper, we prove SSNC for tournaments missing two stars. We also study SSNC for tournaments missing disjoint paths and, particularly, in the case of missing paths of length 2. In some cases, we exhibit at least two vertices with the SNP.</description>

      <title>More on the number of distinct values of a class of functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03655v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a previous article, the authors determined the first (and at the time of writing, the only) non-trivial upper bound for the cardinality of the image set for several classes of functions, including planar functions. Here, we show that the upper bound cannot be tight for planar functions over $\mathbb F_q$, with the possible exception of $q=343.$ We further show that if such an exceptional planar function exists, then it implies the existence of a projective plane of order 18. This follows from more general results, which apply to wider classes of functions.</description>

      <title>Graphs Identifiable by Degree Sequence and Chromatic Number</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03667v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unigraphs are graphs identifiable up to isomorphism from their degree sequences. Given a class $\mathcal{A}$ of graphs, we define the class of $\mathcal{A}$-unigraphs to be graphs identifiable from degree sequence and membership in $\mathcal{A}$. While these classes are often not hereditary, we provide characterizations of the largest hereditary subclass contained in the bipartite-unigraphs, the $k$-partite unigraphs, the perfect-unigraphs, and the chordal-unigraphs. We also characterize the largest hereditary subclass contained in the bipartite-unigraphs in terms of structure, degree sequence, and a partial order on degree sequences due to Rao. Lastly, we show that all unigraphs $G$ satisfy the bound $\chi(G) \le \omega(G) + 1$ and are hence apex-perfect graphs.</description>

      <title>Total Positivity of Almost-Riordan Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03774v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study the total positivity of almost-Riordan arrays $(d(t)|\, g(t), f(t))$ and establish its necessary conditions and sufficient conditions, particularly, for some well used formal power series $d(t)$. We present a semidirect product of an almost-array and use it to transfer a total positivity problem for an almost-Riordan array to the total positivity problem for a quasi-Riordan array. We find the sequence characterization of total positivity of the almost-Riordan arrays. The production matrix $J$ of an almost-Riordan array $(d|\, g,f)$ is presented so that $J$ is totally positive implies the total positivity of both the almost-Riordan array $(d|\, g,f)$ and the Riordan array $(g,f)$. We also present a counterexample to illustrate that this sufficient condition is not necessary. If the production matrix $J$ is tridiagonal, then the expressions of its principal minors are given. By using expressions, we find a sufficient and necessary condition of the total positivity of almost-Riordan arrays with tridiagonal production matrices. A numerous examples are given to demonstrate our results.</description>

      <title>Flips in colorful triangulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The associahedron is the graph $\mathcal{G}_N$ that has as nodes all triangulations of a convex $N$-gon, and an edge between any two triangulations that differ in a flip operation, which consists of removing an edge shared by two triangles and replacing it by the other diagonal of the resulting 4-gon. In this paper, we consider a large collection of induced subgraphs of $\mathcal{G}_N$ obtained by Ramsey-type colorability properties. Specifically, coloring the points of the $N$-gon red and blue alternatingly, we consider only colorful triangulations, namely triangulations in which every triangle has points in both colors, i.e., monochromatic triangles are forbidden. The resulting induced subgraph of $\mathcal{G}_N$ on colorful triangulations is denoted by $\mathcal{F}_N$. We prove that $\mathcal{F}_N$ has a Hamilton cycle for all $N\geq 8$, resolving a problem raised by Sagan, i.e., all colorful triangulations on $N$ points can be listed so that any two cyclically consecutive triangulations differ in a flip. In fact, we prove that for an arbitrary fixed coloring pattern of the $N$ points with at least 10 changes of color, the resulting subgraph of $\mathcal{G}_N$ on colorful triangulations (for that coloring pattern) admits a Hamilton cycle. We also provide an efficient algorithm for computing a Hamilton path in $\mathcal{F}_N$ that runs in time $\mathcal{O}(1)$ on average per generated node. This algorithm is based on a new and algorithmic construction of a tree rotation Gray code for listing all $n$-vertex $k$-ary trees that runs in time $\mathcal{O}(k)$ on average per generated tree.</description>

      <title>A star-comb lemma for finite digraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03883v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is well-known that for any set $U$ of vertices in a connected graph $G$ there is either a subdivided star in $G$ with a large number of leaves in $U$, or a comb in $G$ with a large number of teeth in $U$.
  In this paper we extend this property to directed graphs. More precisely, we prove that for any set $U$ of vertices in a strongly connected directed graph $D$, there exists a strongly connected substructure of $D$ attached to a large number of vertices in $U$ that is either shaped by a star or shaped by a comb.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.03942v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, the association scheme defined on the flags of a finite generalized quadrangle is considered. All possible fusions of this scheme are listed, and a full description for those of classes 2 and 3 is given. Furthermore, it is showed that an association scheme with appropriate parameters must arise from the flags of a generalized quadrangle. The same is done for one of its 4-class symmetric fusion.</description>

      <title>Induced matching vs edge open packing: trees and product graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04020v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a graph $G$, the maximum size of an induced subgraph of $G$ each component of which is a star is called the edge open packing number, $\rho_{e}^{o}(G)$, of $G$. Similarly, the maximum size of an induced subgraph of $G$ each component of which is the star $K_{1,1}$ is the induced matching number, $\nu_I(G)$, of $G$. While the inequality $\rho_e^o(G)\leq \nu_{I}(G)$ clearly holds for all graphs $G$, we provide a structural characterization of those trees that attain the equality. We prove that the induced matching number of the lexicographic product $G\circ H$ of arbitrary two graphs $G$ and $H$ equals $\alpha(G)\nu_I(H)$. By similar techniques, we prove sharp lower and upper bounds on the edge open packing number of the lexicographic product of graphs, which in particular lead to NP-hardness results in triangular graphs for both invariants studied in this paper. For the direct product $G\times H$ of two graphs we provide lower bounds on $\nu_I(G\times H)$ and $\rho_{e}^{o}(G\times H)$, both of which are widely sharp. We also present sharp lower bounds for both invariants in the Cartesian and the strong product of two graphs. Finally, we consider the edge open packing number in hypercubes establishing the exact values of $\rho_e^o(Q_n)$ when $n$ is a power of $2$, and present a closed formula for the induced matching number of the rooted product of arbitrary two graphs over an arbitrary root vertex.</description>

      <title>Orbits of the hyperoctahedral group as Euclidean designs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The hyperoctahedral group $H$ in $n$ dimensions (the Weyl group of Lie type $B_n$) is the subgroup of the orthogonal group generated by all transpositions of coordinates and reflections with respect to coordinate hyperplanes. A finite set ${\cal X} \subset \mathbb{R}^n$ with a weight function $w: {\cal X} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^+$ is called a Euclidean $t$-design, if $$\sum_{r \in R} W_r \overline{f}_{S_{r}} = \sum_{{\bf x} \in {\cal X}} w({\bf x}) f({\bf x})$$ holds for every polynomial $f$ of total degree at most $t$; here $R$ is the set of norms of the points in ${\cal X}$, $W_r$ is the total weight of all elements of ${\cal X}$ with norm $r$, $S_r$ is the $n$-dimensional sphere of radius $r$ centered at the origin, and $\overline{f}_{S_{r}}$ is the average of $f$ over $S_{r}$.
  Here we consider Euclidean designs which are supported by orbits of the hyperoctahedral group. Namely, we prove that any Euclidean design on a union of generalized hyperoctahedra has strength (maximum $t$ for which it is a Euclidean design) equal to 3, 5, or 7. We find explicit necessary and sufficient conditions for when this strength is 5 and for when it is 7. In order to establish our classification, we translate the above definition of Euclidean designs to a single equation for $t=5$, a set of three equations for $t=7$, and a set of seven equations for $t=9$.
  Neumaier and Seidel (1988), as well as Delsarte and Seidel (1989), proved a Fisher-type inequality $|{\cal X}| \geq N(n,p,t)$ for the minimum size of a Euclidean $t$-design in $\mathbb{R}^n$ on $p=|R|$ concentric spheres (assuming that the design is antipodal if $t$ is odd). A Euclidean design with exactly $N(n,p,t)$ points is called tight. We exhibit new examples of antipodal tight Euclidean designs, supported by orbits of the hyperoctahedral group, for $N(n,p,t)=$(3,2,5), (3,3,7), and (4,2,7).</description>

      <title>The geometry of intersecting codes and applications to additive combinatorics and factorization theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intersecting codes are linear codes where every two nonzero codewords have non-trivially intersecting support. In this article we expand on the theory of this family of codes, by showing that nondegenerate intersecting codes correspond to sets of points (with multiplicites) in a projective space that are not contained in two hyperplanes. This correspondence allows the use of geometric arguments to demonstrate properties and provide constructions of intersecting codes. We improve on existing bounds on their length and provide explicit constructions of short intersecting codes. Finally, generalizing a link between coding theory and the theory of the Davenport constant (a combinatorial invariant of finite abelian groups), we provide new asymptotic bounds on the weighted $2$-wise Davenport constant. These bounds then yield results on factorizations in rings of algebraic integers and related structures.</description>

      <title>Solution to a conjecture on resistance distances of block tower graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a connected graph. The resistance distance between two vertices $u$ and $v$ of $G$, denoted by $R_{G}[u,v]$, is defined as the net effective resistance between them in the electric network constructed from $G$ by replacing each edge with a unit resistor. The resistance diameter of $G$, denoted by $D_{r}(G)$, is defined as the maximum resistance distance among all pairs of vertices of $G$. Let $P_n=a_1a_2\ldots a_n$ be the $n$-vertex path graph and $C_{4}=b_{1}b_2b_3b_4b_{1}$ be the 4-cycle. Then the $n$-th block tower graph $G_n$ is defined as the the Cartesian product of $P_n$ and $C_4$, that is, $G_n=P_{n}\square C_4$. Clearly, the vertex set of $G_n$ is $\{(a_i,b_j)|i=1,\ldots,n;j=1,\ldots,4\}$. In [Discrete Appl. Math. 320 (2022) 387--407], Evans and Francis proposed the following conjecture on resistance distances of $G_n$ and $G_{n+1}$: \begin{equation*} \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty}\left(R_{G_{n+1}}[(a_{1},b_1),(a_{n+1},b_3)]-R_{G_{n}}[(a_{1},b_1),(a_{n},b_3)]\right)=\frac{1}{4}. \end{equation*}
  In this paper, combing algebraic methods and electric network approaches, we confirm and further generalize this conjecture. In addition, we determine all the pair of vertices that reach the resistance diameter of $G_{n}$, which enables us to give an equivalent explanation of the conjecture.</description>

      <title>Two Erd\H{o}s-Hajnal-type theorems for forbidden order-size pairs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The celebrated Erd\H{o}s-Hajnal conjecture says that any graph without a fixed induced subgraph $H$ contains a very large homogeneous set. A direct analog of this conjecture is not true for hypergraphs. In this paper we present two natural variants of this problem which do hold for hypergraphs. We show that for every $r \geq 3$, $m \geq m_0(r)$ and $0 \leq f \leq \binom{m}{r}$, if an $r$-graph $G$ does not contain $m$ vertices spanning exactly $f$ edges, then $G$ contains much bigger homogeneous sets than what is guaranteed to exist in general $r$-graphs. We also prove that if a $3$-graph $G$ does not contain homogeneous sets of polynomial size, then for every $m \geq 3$ there are $\Omega(m^3)$ values of $f$ such that $G$ contains $m$ vertices spanning exactly $f$ edges. This makes progress on a conjecture of Axenovich, Brada\v{c}, Gishboliner, Mubayi and Weber.</description>

      <title>Stirling permutation codes. II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04211v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the context of Stirling polynomials, Gessel and Stanley introduced the definition of Stirling permutation, which has attracted extensive attention over the past decades. Recently, we introduced Stirling permutation code and provided numerous equidistribution results as applications. The purpose of the present work is to further analyse Stirling permutation code. First, we derive an expansion formula expressing the joint distribution of the types A and B descent statistics over the hyperoctahedral group, and we also find an interlacing property involving the zeros of its coefficient polynomials. Next, we prove a strong connection between signed permutations in the hyperoctahedral group and Stirling permutations. Furthermore, we investigate unified generalizations of the trivariate second-order Eulerian polynomials and ascent-plateau polynomials. Using Stirling permutation codes, we provide expansion formulas for eight-variable and seventeen-variable polynomials, which imply several $e$-positive expansions and clarify the connection among several statistics. Our results generalize the results of Dumont, B\'ona, Janson, Haglund-Visontai and Chen-Fu.</description>

      <title>Embedding induced trees in sparse expanding graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04260v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inspired by the network routing literature \cite{aggarwal1996efficient}, we develop what we call a ``Pre-Emptive Greedy Algorithm" to embed bounded degree induced trees in sparse expanders.
  This generalises a powerful and central result of Friedman and Pippenger to the induced setting.
  As corollaries we obtain that a sparse random graph contains all bounded degree trees of linear order (whp) and that the induced and size induced Ramsey numbers of bounded degree trees are linear. No such linear bounds were previously known. We also prove a nearly-tight result on induced forests in bounded degree countable expanders. We expect that our new result will find many more applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.03597v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compute the real and complex Buchstaber numbers of an arbitrary Bier sphere. In dimension two, we identify all the 13 different combinatorial types of Bier spheres and show that 11 of them are nerve complexes of nestohedra, while the remaining two are merely nerve complexes of generalized permutohedra: one of them is a non-flag polytope and the other one is a 2-truncated cube. As an application of our results, we construct a regular normal fan for each of those 13 Delzant polytopes, compute cohomology rings of the corresponding nonsingular projective toric varieties and discuss orientability of the corresponding small covers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.03664v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This is an introduction to graph theory, from a geometric viewpoint. A finite graph $X$ is described by its adjacency matrix $d\in M_N(0,1)$, which can be thought of as a kind of discrete Laplacian, and we first discuss the basics of graph theory, by using $d$ and linear algebra tools. Then we discuss the computation of the classical and quantum symmetry groups $G(X)\subset G^+(X)$, which must leave invariant the eigenspaces of $d$. Finally, we discuss similar questions for the quantum graphs, with these being again described by certain matrices $d\in M_N(\mathbb C)$, but in a more twisted way.</description>

      <title>Constructing embedded surfaces for cellular embeddings of leveled spatial graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03800v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Finding a closed orientable surface $\mathcal{S}$ embedded in $\mathbb{R}^3$ where a given spatial graph $\mathcal{G} \subset \mathbb{R}^3$ cellular embeds is in general not possible. We therefore restrict our interest to the special class of spatial graphs that are leveled. We show that for leveled spatial graphs with a small number of levels, a surface $\mathcal{S}$ can always be found. The argument is based on the idea of decomposing $\mathcal{G}$ into subgraphs that can be placed on a sphere and on handles that are attached to the sphere, together forming an embedding of $\mathcal{G}$ in $\mathcal{S}$. We generalize the procedure to an algorithm that, if successful, constructs $\mathcal{S}$ for leveled spatial graphs with any number of levels. We conjecture that all connected leveled embeddings can be cellular embedded with the presented algorithm.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.03987v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the uniform algebraic rank of a divisor class on a finite graph. We show that it lies between Caporaso's algebraic rank and the combinatorial rank of Baker and Norine. We prove the Riemann-Roch theorem for the uniform algebraic rank, and show that both the algebraic and the uniform algebraic rank are realized on effective divisors. As an application, we use the uniform algebraic rank to show that Clifford representatives always exist. We conclude with an explicit description of such Clifford representatives for a large class of graphs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04011v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $A=\{a_1,a_2,\dots, a_m\}$ be a subset of a finite abelian group $G$. We call $A$ {\it $t$-independent} in $G$, if whenever $$\lambda_1a_1+\lambda_2a_2+\cdots +\lambda_m a_m=0$$ for some integers $\lambda_1, \lambda_2, \dots , \lambda_m$ with $$|\lambda_1|+|\lambda_2|+\cdots +|\lambda_m| \leq t,$$ we have $\lambda_1=\lambda_2= \cdots = \lambda_m=0$, and we say that $A$ is {\it $s$-spanning} in $G$, if every element $g$ of $G$ can be written as $$g=\lambda_1a_1+\lambda_2a_2+\cdots +\lambda_m a_m$$ for some integers $\lambda_1, \lambda_2, \dots , \lambda_m$ with $$|\lambda_1|+|\lambda_2|+\cdots +|\lambda_m| \leq s.$$ In this paper we give an upper bound for the size of a $t$-independent set and a lower bound for the size of an $s$-spanning set in $G$, and determine some cases when this extremal size occurs. We also discuss an interesting connection to spherical combinatorics.</description>

      <title>On the zeros of partition functions with multi-spin interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04179v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $X_1, \ldots, X_n$ be probability spaces, let $X$ be their direct product, let $\phi_1, \ldots, \phi_m: X \longrightarrow {\Bbb C}$ be random variables, each depending only on a few coordinates of a point $x=(x_1, \ldots, x_n)$, and let $f=\phi_1 + \ldots + \phi_m$. The expectation $E\thinspace e^{\lambda f}$, where $\lambda \in {\Bbb C}$, appears in statistical physics as the partition function of a system with multi-spin interactions, and also in combinatorics and computer science, where it is known as the partition function of edge-coloring models, tensor network contractions or a Holant polynomial. Assuming that each $\phi_i$ is 1-Lipschitz in the Hamming metric of $X$, that each $\phi_i(x)$ depends on at most $r \geq 2$ coordinates $x_1, \ldots, x_n$ of $x \in X$, and that for each $j$ there are at most $c \geq 1$ functions $\phi_i$ that depend on the coordinate $x_j$, we prove that $E\thinspace e^{\lambda f} \ne 0$ provided $| \lambda | \leq \ (3 c \sqrt{r-1})^{-1}$ and that the bound is sharp up to a logarithmic in $r$ factor. As a corollary, the value of the expectation can be efficiently approximated, provided $\lambda$ lies in a slightly smaller disc.</description>

      <title>A Note About Majority Colorings of Countable DAGs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04189v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A majority coloring of an undirected graph is a vertex coloring in which for each vertex there are at least as many bi-chromatic edges containing that vertex as monochromatic ones. It is known that for every countable graph a majority 3-coloring always exists. The Unfriendly Partition Conjecture states that every countable graph admits a majority 2-coloring. Since the 3-coloring result extends to countable DAGs, a variant of the conjecture states that 2 colors are enough to majority color every countable DAG. We show that this is false by presenting a DAG for which 3 colors are necessary. Presented construction is strongly based on a StackExchange conversation regarding labellings of infinite graphs that is linked in the references.</description>

      <title>On the Expressive Power of Spectral Invariant Graph Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04336v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Incorporating spectral information to enhance Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) has shown promising results but raises a fundamental challenge due to the inherent ambiguity of eigenvectors. Various architectures have been proposed to address this ambiguity, referred to as spectral invariant architectures. Notable examples include GNNs and Graph Transformers that use spectral distances, spectral projection matrices, or other invariant spectral features. However, the potential expressive power of these spectral invariant architectures remains largely unclear. The goal of this work is to gain a deep theoretical understanding of the expressive power obtainable when using spectral features. We first introduce a unified message-passing framework for designing spectral invariant GNNs, called Eigenspace Projection GNN (EPNN). A comprehensive analysis shows that EPNN essentially unifies all prior spectral invariant architectures, in that they are either strictly less expressive or equivalent to EPNN. A fine-grained expressiveness hierarchy among different architectures is also established. On the other hand, we prove that EPNN itself is bounded by a recently proposed class of Subgraph GNNs, implying that all these spectral invariant architectures are strictly less expressive than 3-WL. Finally, we discuss whether using spectral features can gain additional expressiveness when combined with more expressive GNNs.</description>

      <title>On the use of senders for asymmetric tuples of cliques in Ramsey theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.15840v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A graph $G$ is $q$-Ramsey for a $q$-tuple of graphs $(H_1,\ldots,H_q)$ if for every $q$-coloring of the edges of $G$ there exists a monochromatic copy of $H_i$ in color $i$ for some $i\in[q]$. Over the last few decades, researchers have investigated a number of questions related to this notion, aiming to understand the properties of graphs that are $q$-Ramsey for a fixed tuple. Among the tools developed while studying questions of this type are gadget graphs, called signal senders and determiners, which have proven invaluable for building Ramsey graphs with certain properties. However, until now these gadgets have been shown to exist and used mainly in the two-color setting or in the symmetric multicolor setting, and our knowledge about their existence for multicolor asymmetric tuples is extremely limited. In this paper, we construct such gadgets for any tuple of cliques. We then use these gadgets to generalize three classical theorems in this area to the asymmetric multicolor setting.</description>

Abstract: We introduce the multi-width of a lattice polytope and use this to classify and count all lattice tetrahedra with multi-width $(1,w_2,w_3)$. The approach used in this classification can be extended into a computer algorithm to classify lattice tetrahedra of any given multi-width. We use this to classify tetrahedra with multi-width $(2,w_2,w_3)$ for small $w_2$ and $w_3$ and make conjectures about the function counting lattice tetrahedra of any multi-width.</description>

      <title>Fragmenting any Parallelepiped into a Signed Tiling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.07900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.07900v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is broadly known that any parallelepiped tiles space by translating copies of itself along its edges. In earlier work relating to higher-dimensional sandpile groups, the second author discovered a novel construction which fragments the parallelpiped into a collection of smaller tiles. These tiles fill space with the same symmetry as the larger parallelepiped. Their volumes are equal to the components of the multi-row Laplace determinant expansion, so this construction only works when all these signs are non-negative (or non-positive).
  In this work, we extend the construction to work for all parallelepipeds, without requiring the non-negative condition. This naturally gives tiles with negative volume, which we understand to mean canceling out tiles with positive volume. In fact, with this cancellation, we prove that every point in space is contained in exactly one more tile with positive volume than tile with negative volume. This is a natural definition for a signed tiling.
  Our main technique is to show that the net number of signed tiles doesn't change as a point moves through space. This is a relatively indirect proof method, and the underlying structure of these tilings remains mysterious.</description>

      <title>Ramsey-type results on parameters related to domination</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.07667v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The following inequality chain $$ ir(G)\le \gamma(G)\le i(G)\le \alpha(G) \le \Gamma(G) \le I\!R(G)$$ is known as a domination chain, where $ir(G), \gamma(G), i(G), \alpha(G), \Gamma(G)$, and $I\!R(G)$ are the lower irredundance number, the domination number, the independence domination number, the independence number, the upper domination number and the upper irredundance number of $G$, respectively. The Ramsey-type problem seeks to characterize the family $\mathcal H$ of graphs such that every $\mathcal H$-free graph $G$ has a bounded parameter $\mu$. The classical Ramsey's theorem states that every $\{K_n, E_n\}$-free graph has a bounded number of vertices. Furuya (Discrete Math.Theor 2018) characterized $\mathcal H$ such that every connected $\mathcal H$-free graph $G$ has a bounded domination number. The characterization of the graph family $\mathcal H$ for which every connected $\mathcal H$-free graph $G$ has a bounded independence number was due to Choi, Furuya, Kim, Park~(Discrete math. 2020) and Chiba, Furuya (Electron. J. Combin., 2022). In this paper, we further characterize $\mathcal H$ such that every connected $\mathcal H$-free graph $G$ has bounded $\mu(G)$ for $\mu$ belonging to the set $\{ir(G), i(G), \Gamma(G), \text{IR}(G)\}$. This completes the characterization of $\mathcal H$ for which every connected $\mathcal H$-free graph $G$ has bounded $\mu(G)$ for $\mu(G)$ along the domination chain. Additionally, we characterize $\mathcal H$ such that every connected $\mathcal H$-free graph $G$ has bounded $\mu(G)$ for $\mu$ related to the domination number. Specifically, we consider the parameters $O\!I\!R(G)$, $I\!S(G)$, or $I\!R\!S(G)\}$, where $O\!I\!R(G)$, $I\!S(G)$, and $I\!R\!S(G)$ are the open irredundance number, the independence saturation number, and the irredundance saturation number of graph $G$, respectively.</description>

Specifically, we show that the Coxeter analogues of the interchange graphs introduced by Brualdi and Li remain degree regular. This degree can be interpreted geometrically, in terms of distances in the Coxeter permutahedra studied recently by Ardila, Castillo, Eur and Postnikov.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.14113v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a set $X$, a collection $\mathcal{F} \subset \mathcal{P}(X)$ is said to be $k$-Sperner if it does not contain a chain of length $k+1$ under set inclusion and it is saturated if it is maximal with respect to this probability. Gerbner et al. proved that the smallest saturated $k$-Sperner system contains at least $2^{k/2-1}$ elements, and later, Morrison, Noel, and Scott showed that the smallest such set contains no more than $2^{0.976723k}$ elements. We improve both the upper and lower bounds, showing that the size of the smallest saturated $k$-Sperner system lies between $\sqrt{k}2^{k/2}$ and $2^{0.961471k}$.</description>

Abstract: Inhomogeneous versions of Jack and Macdonald polynomials, called interpolation polynomials, have been introduced by Knop--Sahi (type $A$) and Okounkov (type $BC$). In this paper, we study binomial coefficients and Littlewood--Richardson (LR) coefficients for these interpolation polynomials. We extend to type $BC$ the weighted sum formula for binomial coefficients due to the second author in type $A$, and obtain a new weighted sum formula for LR coefficients for both types $A$ and $BC$. We prove that binomial coefficients are positive and monotone using the weighted sum formula and the combinatorial formulas due to Okounkov.
  As an application, we prove various inequalities on power-sums and Jack polynomials, including their specializations, monomial, Schur, Zonal and elementary symmetric polynomials, generalizing similar inequalities due to Cuttler--Greene--Skandera, Sra and Khare--Tao.</description>

A 203 (2024), Art. 105849] recently obtained two interesting results on the sum of the parts with the same parity in the partitions of $n$ (the modulo $2$ case), the proof of which relies on generating functions. Motivated by Andrews and Merca's results, we define six statistics related to the partitions of $n$ and show that the two triples of the six statistics are equidistributed. From this equidistributed result, we derive modulo $m$ extensions of Andrews and Merca's results for all integers $m\ge 2$. The proof of the main result is based on a general bijection on the set of partitions of $n$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02269v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A given subset $A$ of natural numbers is said to be complete if every element of $\N$ is the sum of distinct terms taken from $A$. This topic is strongly connected to the knapsack problem which is known to be NP complete. The main goal of the paper is to study the structure of subset sums in a higher dimension. We show 'dense' sets and generalized arithmetic progrssions in subset sums of certain sets.</description>

      <title>Total coloring and edge-girth coloring of regular graphs via efficient dominating sets or perfect codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08781v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A total coloring of a regular graph $G$ via a color set formed by one more unit than the degree of $G$ is said to be a totally efficient coloring if each color class is an efficient dominating set (or perfect code). We show that the binary 3-cube graph has a totally efficient coloring that in turn yields an edge-girth coloring of the binary 4-cube. We conjecture that this graph $G$ is the only existing case of a totally efficient coloring and subsequent edge-girth coloring of the prism of $G$. We also deal with a related problem exemplified by star (multiset) transposition graphs, leading to edge-girth colorings on their prisms, or the prisms of their Hamming shells.</description>

Abstract: We prove analogs of Brooks' Theorem for the list-distinguishing chromatic number of finite connected graphs. Moreover, we give new examples to determine two sharp upper bounds for the list-distinguishing chromatic number of a graph G in terms of the coloring number of G and the list-chromatic number of G. We also determine the list-distinguishing chromatic number for various families of graphs (example: the book graphs).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01995v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Based on two involutions and a bijection, we completely determine the difference between the number of $\ell$-regular partitions of $n$ into an even number of parts and into an odd number of parts for all positive integers $n$ and $\ell&gt;1$, which extends two recent results due to Ballantine and Merca. As an application, we provide a combinatorial proof of Hickerson's identity on the number of partitions into an even and odd number of parts.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.03021v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we relate a well-known in symplectic geometry compactification of the space of symmetric bilinear forms on the Lagrangian Grassmannian to the specific compactifications of the space of electrical networks in the disc obtained in \cite{L}, \cite{CGS} and \cite{BGKT}. In particular, we state an explicit connection between these works and describe some of the combinatorics developed there in the language of symplectic geometry. We also show that the combinatorics of the concordance vectors forces the uniqueness of the symplectic form, such that corresponding points of the Grassmannian are isotropic. We define a notion of Lagrangian concordance which provides a construction of the compactification of the space of electrical networks in the positive part of the Lagrangian Grassmannian bypassing the construction from \cite{L}.</description>

Abstract: In new progress on conjectures of Stein, and Addario-Berry, Havet, Linhares Sales, Reed and Thomass\'e, we prove that every oriented graph with all in- and out-degrees greater than 5k/8 contains an alternating path of length k. This improves on previous results of Klimo\v{s}ov\'a and Stein, and Chen, Hou and Zhou.</description>

      <title>Scaling limit of soliton lengths in a multicolor box-ball system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.04458</link>
      <description>arXiv:1911.04458v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The box-ball systems are integrable cellular automata whose long-time behavior is characterized by soliton solutions, with rich connections to other integrable systems such as the Korteweg-de Vries equation. In this paper, we consider a multicolor box-ball system with two types of random initial configurations and obtain sharp scaling limits of the soliton lengths as the system size tends to infinity. We obtain a sharp scaling limit of soliton lengths that turns out to be more delicate than that in the single color case established in [Levine, Lyu, Pike '20]. A large part of our analysis is devoted to studying the associated carrier process, which is a multi-dimensional Markov chain on the orthant, whose excursions and running maxima are closely related to soliton lengths. We establish the sharp scaling of its ruin probabilities, Skorokhod decomposition, strong law of large numbers, and weak diffusive scaling limit to a semimartingale reflecting Brownian motion with explicit parameters. We also establish and utilize complementary descriptions of the soliton lengths and numbers in terms of modified Greene-Kleitman invariants for the box-ball systems and associated circular exclusion processes.</description>

      <title>Threshold rates for properties of random codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.04553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2009.04553v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Suppose that $P$ is a property that may be satisfied by a random code $C \subset \Sigma^n$. For example, for some $p \in (0,1)$, ${P}$ might be the property that there exist three elements of $C$ that lie in some Hamming ball of radius $pn$. We say that $R^*$ is the threshold rate for ${P}$ if a random code of rate $R^* + \epsilon$ is very likely to satisfy ${P}$, while a random code of rate $R^* - \epsilon$ is very unlikely to satisfy ${P}$. While random codes are well-studied in coding theory, even the threshold rates for relatively simple properties like the one above are not well understood.
  We characterize threshold rates for a rich class of properties. These properties, like the example above, are defined by the inclusion of specific sets of codewords which are also suitably "symmetric". For properties in this class, we show that the threshold rate is in fact equal to the lower bound that a simple first-moment calculation obtains. Our techniques not only pin down the threshold rate for the property ${P}$ above, they give sharp bounds on the threshold rate for list-recovery in several parameter regimes, as well as an efficient algorithm for estimating the threshold rates for list-recovery in general.</description>

      <title>Punctured Low-Bias Codes Behave Like Random Linear Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.11725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2109.11725v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Random linear codes are a workhorse in coding theory, and are used to show the existence of codes with the best known or even near-optimal trade-offs in many noise models. However, they have little structure besides linearity, and are not amenable to tractable error-correction algorithms.
  In this work, we prove a general derandomization result applicable to random linear codes. Namely, in settings where the coding-theoretic property of interest is "local" (in the sense of forbidding certain bad configurations involving few vectors -- code distance and list-decodability being notable examples), one can replace random linear codes (RLCs) with a significantly derandomized variant with essentially no loss in parameters. Specifically, instead of randomly sampling coordinates of the (long) Hadamard code (which is an equivalent way to describe RLCs), one can randomly sample coordinates of any code with low bias. Over large alphabets, the low bias requirement can be weakened to just large distance. Furthermore, large distance suffices even with a small alphabet in order to match the current best known bounds for RLC list-decodability.
  In particular, by virtue of our result, all current (and future) achievability bounds for list-decodability of random linear codes extend automatically to random puncturings of any low-bias (or large alphabet) "mother" code. We also show that our punctured codes emulate the behavior of RLCs on stochastic channels, thus giving a derandomization of RLCs in the context of achieving Shannon capacity as well. Thus, we have a randomness-efficient way to sample codes achieving capacity in both worst-case and stochastic settings that can further inherit algebraic or other algorithmically useful structural properties of the mother code.</description>

      <title>Enumerating minimal solution sets for metric graph problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.17419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.17419v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Problems from metric graph theory like Metric Dimension, Geodetic Set, and Strong Metric Dimension have recently had a strong impact in parameterized complexity by being the first known problems in NP to admit double-exponential lower bounds in the treewidth, and even in the vertex cover number for the latter, assuming the Exponential Time Hypothesis. We initiate the study of enumerating minimal solution sets for these problems and show that they are also of great interest in enumeration. Specifically, we show that enumerating minimal resolving sets in graphs and minimal geodetic sets in split graphs are equivalent to enumerating minimal transversals in hypergraphs (denoted Trans-Enum), whose solvability in total-polynomial time is one of the most important open problems in algorithmic enumeration. This provides two new natural examples to a question that emerged in recent works: for which vertex (or edge) set graph property $\Pi$ is the enumeration of minimal (or maximal) subsets satisfying $\Pi$ equivalent to Trans-Enum? As very few properties are known to fit within this context -- namely, those related to minimal domination -- our results make significant progress in characterizing such properties, and provide new angles to approach Trans-Enum. In contrast, we observe that minimal strong resolving sets can be enumerated with polynomial delay. Additionally, we consider cases where our reductions do not apply, namely graphs with no long induced paths, and show both positive and negative results related to the enumeration and extension of partial solutions.</description>

      <title>Special divisors in special divisor classes on graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.13207v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As in algebraic geometry, an effective divisor class on a vertex-weighted graph is called special if also its residual class is effective. We study the question, when this is true already on the level of divisors; that is, when there exists an effective divisor in the class whose residual is effective as well, so called uniform divisors. We show that uniform divisors exist in any special class on graphs with all vertex weights non-zero; we show that in general a representative can be chosen, whose value is off by at most one on vertices of weight zero. To prove this, we generalize the notion of divisors that are reduced with respect to a vertex to divisors that are reduced with respect to a set of vertices. We compare this notion to a previous generalization due to Luo. As an application, we obtain a new algorithm to determine whether a divisor class is effective.</description>

Abstract: We study mixtures of decomposable graphical models, focusing on their ideals and dimensions. For mixtures of clique stars, we characterize the ideals in terms of ideals of mixtures of independence models. We also give a recursive formula for their ML degrees. Finally, we prove that second secant varieties of all other decomposable graphical models have the expected dimension.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.03439v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the Wilson line defect half-indices of 3d $\mathcal{N}=2$ supersymmetric $SU(N)$ Chern-Simons theories of level $k\le -N$ with Neumann boundary conditions for the gauge fields, together with 2d Fermi multiplets and fundamental 3d chiral multiplets to cancel the gauge anomaly. We derive some exact results and also make some conjectures based on expansions of the $q$-series. We find several interesting connections with special functions known in the literature, including Rogers-Ramanujan functions for which we conjecture integral representations, and the appearance of Appell-Lerch sums for certain Wilson line half-index grand canonical ensembles which reveal an unexpected appearance of mock modular functions. We also find intriguing $q$-difference equations relating half-indices to Wilson line half-indices. Some of these results also have a description in terms of a dual theory with Dirichlet boundary conditions for the vector multiplet in the dual theory.</description>
