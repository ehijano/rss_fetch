      <title>Quantum-Inspired Fluid Simulation of 2D Turbulence with GPU Acceleration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17823v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tensor network algorithms can efficiently simulate complex quantum many-body systems by utilizing knowledge of their structure and entanglement. These methodologies have been adapted recently for solving the Navier-Stokes equations, which describe a spectrum of fluid phenomena, from the aerodynamics of vehicles to weather patterns. Within this quantum-inspired paradigm, velocity is encoded as matrix product states (MPS), effectively harnessing the analogy between interscale correlations of fluid dynamics and entanglement in quantum many-body physics. This particular tensor structure is also called quantics tensor train (QTT). By utilizing NVIDIA's cuQuantum library to perform parallel tensor computations on GPUs, our adaptation speeds up simulations by up to 12.1 times. This allows us to study the algorithm in terms of its applicability, scalability, and performance. By simulating two qualitatively different but commonly encountered 2D flow problems at high Reynolds numbers up to $1\times10^7$ using a fourth-order time stepping scheme, we find that the algorithm has a potential advantage over direct numerical simulations in the turbulent regime as the requirements for grid resolution increase drastically. In addition, we derive the scaling $\chi=\mathcal{O}(\text{poly}(1/\epsilon))$ for the maximum bond dimension $\chi$ of MPS representing turbulent flow fields, with an error $\epsilon$, based on the spectral distribution of turbulent kinetic energy. Our findings motivate further exploration of related quantum algorithms and other tensor network methods.</description>

      <title>On the mechanics of inhaled bronchial transmission of pathogenic microdroplets generated from the upper respiratory tract, with implications for infection onset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17895v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Could the microdroplets formed by viscoelastic stretching and break-up of mucosal liquids in the upper respiratory tract (URT), when inhaled further downwind, explain the brisk pace at which deep lung infections emerge following onset of initial infection at the URT? While it is well-established that particulates inhaled from outside can possibly penetrate to the lower airway only if they are &lt; 5 microns, the fate of particulates (many &gt; 5-microns in diameter) sheared away from the intra-URT mucosa during inhalation remains an open question. These particulates predominantly originate at the nasopharynx, oropharynx, and laryngeal chamber with the vocal folds. To resolve the posed question, this study considers a CT-based 3D anatomical airway reconstruction and isolates the tract from the laryngeal vocal fold region, mapping the entire tracheal cavity and concluding at generation 2 of the tracheobronchial tree. Through the delineated geometry, airflow simulation is conducted using the LES scheme to replicate relaxed inhalation at 15 L/min. Against the ambient air flux, numerical experiments have been performed to monitor the transport of liquid particulates with diameters 1-30 microns, bearing physical properties akin to aerosolized mucus with embedded virions. The full-scale numerical transmission trends to the lower airway were found consistent with the findings from a reduced-order mathematical model that conceptualized the impact of intra-airway vortex instabilities on local particle transport through point vortex idealization in an anatomy-guided 2D potential flow domain. The results collectively demonstrate markedly elevated trends of deep lung penetration by the URT-derived particulates, even if they are as large as 10- and 15 microns. The high viral load carried by such droplets to the bronchial spaces could mechanistically explain the accelerated seeding of infection in the lungs.</description>

      <title>Modeling and simulations of high-density two-phase flows using projection-based Cahn-Hilliard Navier-Stokes equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17933v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurately modeling the dynamics of high-density ratio ($\mathcal{O}(10^5)$) two-phase flows is important for many applications in material science and manufacturing. In this work, we consider numerical simulations of molten metal undergoing microgravity oscillations. Accurate simulation of the oscillation dynamics allows us to characterize the interplay between the two fluids' surface tension and density ratio, which is an important consideration for terrestrial manufacturing applications. We present a projection-based computational framework for solving a thermodynamically-consistent Cahn-Hilliard Navier-Stokes equations for two-phase flows under these large density ratios. A modified version of the pressure-decoupled solver based on the Helmholtz-Hodge decomposition presented in Khanwale et al. [$\textit{A fully-coupled framework for solving Cahn-Hilliard Navier-Stokes equations: Second-order, energy-stable numerical methods on adaptive octree based meshes.}$, Journal of Computational Physics 475 (2023): 111874] is used. We present a comprehensive convergence study to investigate the effect of mesh resolution, time-step, and interfacial thickness on droplet-shape oscillations. We deploy our framework to predict the oscillation behavior of three physical systems exhibiting very large density ratios ($10^4-10^5:1$) that have previously never been performed.</description>

      <title>Symmetry Breaking in Chemical Systems: Engineering Complexity through Self-Organization and Marangoni Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18006v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the impact of a periodic array of hydrophilic cylindrical obstacles on the spatio-temporal dynamics of chemical waves in the bubble-free Belousov-Zhabotinsky-1,4-cyclohexanedione (BZ-CHD) oscillatory chemical reaction. We find that the thin fluid layer ascending the outer surfaces of these hydrophilic obstacles is crucial for influencing wave dynamics. We observe that circular waves begin almost simultaneously at these obstacles and spread outward. In a covered setup where evaporation is minimal, these wavefronts retain their circular shape. However, in an open setup where evaporative cooling is more pronounced, thermal Marangoni flows trigger wavefront instabilities, leading to the formation of distinctive flower-like patterns around the obstacles. Our experiments also shows that the number of petals formed increases linearly with the diameter of the pillars, though a minimum diameter is required for the instabilities to manifest. These results highlight the ability to engineer specific wave patterns, offering a strategy to control and steer the reaction dynamics. This capability is particularly crucial for the development of microfluidic devices that demand precise control over chemical wave propagation.</description>

      <title>Gauge Freedom and Objective Rates in the Morphodynamics of Fluid Deformable Surfaces: the Jaumann Rate vs. the Material Derivative</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18014v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Morphodynamic descriptions of fluid deformable surfaces are relevant for a range of biological and soft matter phenomena, spanning materials that can be passive or active, as well as ordered or topological. However, a principled, geometric formulation of the correct hydrodynamic equations has remained opaque, with objective rates proving a central, contentious issue. We argue that this is due to a conflation of several important notions that must be disambiguated when describing fluid deformable surfaces. These are the Eulerian and Lagrangian perspectives on fluid motion, and three different types of gauge freedom: in the ambient space; in the parameterisation of the surface, and; in the choice of frame field on the surface. We clarify these ideas, and show that objective rates in fluid deformable surfaces are time derivatives that are invariant under the first of these gauge freedoms, and which also preserve the structure of the ambient metric. The latter condition reduces a potentially infinite number of possible objective rates to only two: the material derivative and the Jaumann rate. The material derivative is invariant under the Galilean group, and therefore applies to velocities, whose rate captures the conservation of momentum. The Jaumann derivative is invariant under all time-dependent isometries, and therefore applies to local order parameters, or symmetry-broken variables, such as the nematic $Q$-tensor. We provide examples of material and Jaumann rates in two different frame fields that are pertinent to the current applications of the fluid mechanics of deformable surfaces.</description>

      <title>An Eulerian Meshless Method for Two-phase Flows with Embedded Geometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel Eulerian meshless method for two-phase flows with arbitrary embedded geometries. The spatial derivatives are computed using the meshless generalized finite difference method (GFDM). The sharp phase interface is tracked using a volume fraction function. The volume fraction is advected using a method based on the minimisation of a directional flux-based error. For stability, the advection terms are discretised using upwinding schemes. In the vicinity of the embedded geometries, the signed distance function is used to populate the surface of the geometries to generate a body-conforming point cloud. Consequently, the points on the boundaries participate directly in the discretisation, unlike conventional immersed-boundary methods where they are either used to calculate momentum deficit (for example, continuous forcing) or conservation losses (for example, cut-cell methods). The boundary conditions are, therefore, directly imposed at these points on the embedded geometries, opening up the possibility for a discretisation that is body-conforming and spatially varying in resolution, while retaining the consistency of the scheme. We present benchmark test cases that validate the method for two-phase flows, flows with embedded boundaries and a combination of both.</description>

      <title>Stokes' paradox in rarefied gases: A perspective through the method of fundamental solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18128v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the realm of fluid dynamics, a curious and counterintuitive phenomenon is Stokes' paradox. While Stokes equations -- used for modeling slow and steady flows -- lead to a meaningful solution to the problem of slow and steady flow past a sphere, they fail to yield a non-trivial solution to the problem of slow and steady flow past an infinitely long cylinder (a two-dimensional problem essentially); this is referred to as Stokes' paradox. We revisit this paradox in the context of rarefied gas flows by means of the method of fundamental solutions (MFS). To this end, we adopt an extended hydrodynamic model, referred to as the CCR model, consisting of the balance equations for the mass, momentum and energy and closed with the coupled constitutive relations. We determine an analytic solution of the CCR model for the problem and compare it with the MFS-based numerical solution. Apart from addressing flow past a circular cylinder, we aim to showcase the capability of the MFS to predict the flow past other objects in two dimensions for which the analytic solutions do not exist. For that, we investigate the problem of rarefied gas flow past an infinitely long semicircular cylinder.</description>

      <title>Thermal explosion characteristics of a gelled hypergolic droplet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When a sphere of one reactant is placed in the medium of another reactant with which it is hypergolic, a chemical reaction (modeled here as a zeroth-order one-step irreversible Arrhenius reaction) occurs at the common interface of the two reactants, and the heat generated at the interface then is transmitted away from it by thermal conduction. Depending on the nature of the problem, the system may approach an explosive mode, or it may settle into a steady-state mode. The critical condition defining the transition between these two states is determined analytically. In particular, explicit formulas for the ignition delay time for the explosive mode are provided for two limits, one in which an appropriately defined Damk\"ohler number is large and the other in which it is closer to the critical conditions. This is accomplished here by deriving and solving an integral equation for the time evolution of the interface temperature, employing activation-energy asymptotics.</description>

      <title>Near-limit H$_2$-O$_2$-N$_2$ combustion in nonpremixed counterflow mixing layers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18232v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Numerical computations employing detailed chemistry are used to characterize the different combustion modes emerging in mixing layers separating nitrogen-diluted counterflowing planar streams of hydrogen and oxygen. Attention is focused on high degrees of dilution, resulting in near-limit flames, with peak temperatures close to the crossover temperature. A bifurcation diagram is presented in a plane, having the stoichiometric mixture fraction and normalized strain rate as coordinates, that identifies six different combustion regimes involving four different flame types, namely, diffusion-flame sheets, advancing and retreating edge flames, multiple flame tubes, and single isolated flame tubes. Multiple-tube flame configurations vary from small, round, widely separated flame strings at high strain rates to wide, flat, densely packed flame strips, with narrow flame-free gaps between them, at lower strain rates, and they are steady and stable in various arrays over a continuum of tube-separation distances. The observed flame behavior exhibits hysteresis in a certain range of parameters, with the structure that is established depending on the ignition mechanism, as it also does at high strain rates, and a continuum of different stable steady-state flame configurations exists, each accessed from a different initial condition.</description>

      <title>The exponential Lagrangian mean</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lagrangian averaging is a valuable tool for the analysis and modelling of multiscale processes in fluid dynamics. The numerical computation of Lagrangian averages from simulation data is considered challenging, however. In response, we develop a straightforward form of Lagrangian (time) averaging -- exponential averaging -- and derive simple partial differential equations that govern the evolution of the Lagrangian mean fields. These equations can be solved at minimum cost as part of the numerical simulation of fluid models, using the same time and space discretisation as for the dynamical equations.
  We implement exponential averaging in the rotating shallow-water model and demonstrate its effectiveness at filtering out large-amplitude Poincar\'e waves while retaining the salient features of an underlying turbulent flow. We generalise the computation of exponential Lagrangian means from scalar to tensor fields and apply the generalisation to the computation of the Lagrangian mean momentum and of the related pseudomomentum.</description>

      <title>Bayesian inverse Navier-Stokes problems: joint flow field reconstruction and parameter learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18464v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We formulate and solve a Bayesian inverse Navier-Stokes (N-S) problem that assimilates velocimetry data in order to jointly reconstruct a 3D flow field and learn the unknown N-S parameters, including the boundary position. By hardwiring a generalised N-S problem, and regularising its unknown parameters using Gaussian prior distributions, we learn the most likely parameters in a collapsed search space. The most likely flow field reconstruction is then the N-S solution that corresponds to the learned parameters. We develop the method in the variational setting and use a stabilised Nitsche weak form of the N-S problem that permits the control of all N-S parameters. To regularise the inferred the geometry, we use a viscous signed distance field (vSDF) as an auxiliary variable, which is given as the solution of a viscous Eikonal boundary value problem. We devise an algorithm that solves this inverse problem, and numerically implement it using an adjoint-consistent stabilised cut-cell finite element method. We then use this method to reconstruct magnetic resonance velocimetry (flow-MRI) data of a 3D steady laminar flow through a physical model of an aortic arch for two different Reynolds numbers and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) levels (low/high). We find that the method can accurately i) reconstruct the low SNR data by filtering out the noise/artefacts and recovering flow features that are obscured by noise, and ii) reproduce the high SNR data without overfitting. Although the framework that we develop applies to 3D steady laminar flows in complex geometries, it readily extends to time-dependent laminar and Reynolds-averaged turbulent flows, as well as non-Newtonian (e.g. viscoelastic) fluids.</description>

      <title>Generation of spatiotemporal acoustic vortices with arbitrarily oriented orbital angular momentum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18084v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite extensive exploration of acoustic vortices carrying orbital angular momentum (OAM), the generation of acoustic vortices with OAM orientations beyond the conventional longitudinal direction remains largely unexplored. Spatiotemporal (ST) vortices, featuring spiral phase twisting in the ST domain and carrying transverse OAM, have recently attracted considerable interest in optics and acoustics. Here, we report the generation of three-dimensional (3D) ST acoustic vortices with arbitrarily oriented OAM, thereby opening up a new dimension in acoustic OAM control. By utilizing a two-dimensional (2D) acoustic phased array, we introduce two approaches to manipulate the orientation of OAM: through the direct rotation of vortices in 3D space and the intersection of vortices carrying distinct types of OAM. These methods enable unprecedented control over the orientation of acoustic OAM, providing a new degree of freedom in the manipulation of acoustic waves. The arbitrarily oriented OAM holds promise for enhancing acoustic communication by broadening capacity and enabling more complex particle manipulation techniques. Our work establishes a foundation for future explorations into the complex dynamics of novel structured acoustic fields in the ST domain.</description>

      <title>Strong wave turbulence in strongly local large $N$ theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18475v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study wave turbulence in systems with two special properties: a large number of fields (large $N$) and a nonlinear interaction that is strongly local in momentum space. The first property allows us to find the kinetic equation at all interaction strengths -- both weak and strong, at leading order in $1/N$. The second allows us to turn the kinetic equation -- an integral equation -- into a differential equation. We find stationary solutions for the occupation number as a function of wave number, valid at all scales. As expected, on the weak coupling end the solutions asymptote to Kolmogorov-Zakharov scaling. On the strong coupling end, they asymptote to either the widely conjectured generalized Phillips spectrum (also known as critical balance), or a Kolmogorov-like scaling exponent.</description>

      <title>Marangoni droplets of dextran in PEG solution and its motile change due to coil-globule transition of coexisting DNA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.07494v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motile droplets using Marangoni convection are attracting attention for their potential as cell-mimicking small robots. However, the motion of droplets relative to the internal and external environments that generate Marangoni convection has not been quantitatively described. This study used an aqueous two-phase system (polyethylene glycol (PEG) and dextran) in an elongated chamber to generate motile dextran droplets in a constant PEG concentration gradient. We demonstrated that dextran droplets move by Marangoni convection, resulting from the PEG concentration gradient and the active transport of PEG and dextran into and out of the droplet. Furthermore, by spontaneously incorporating long DNA into the dextran droplets, we achieved cell-like motility changes controlled by coexisting environment-sensing molecules. The DNA changes its position within the droplet and motile speed in response to external conditions. In the presence of Mg2+, the coil-globule transition of DNA inside the droplet accelerates the motile speed due to the decrease in the droplet's dynamic viscosity. Globule DNA condenses at the rear part of the droplet along the convection, while coil DNA moves away from the droplet's central axis, separating the dipole convections. These results provide a blueprint for designing autonomous small robots using phase-separated droplets, which change the mobility and molecular distribution within the droplet in reaction to the environment. It will also open unexplored areas of self-assembly mechanisms through phase separation under convections, such as intracellular phase separation.</description>
