      <title>Quantitative Linear Stability Analysis of Elliptic Relative Equilibria in the Planar N-Body Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09809v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An elliptic relative equilibrium (ERE) is a special solution of the planar $N$-body problem generated by a central configuration. Its linear stability depends on the eccentricity $e$ and the masses of the bodies. However, for $e&gt;0$, the variational equations become non-autonomous and highly complex, particularly near $e=1$, where the system exhibits a singularity. This complicates the stability analysis as $e$ approaches one, making it challenging to derive a rigorous quantitative estimate for the stable region across $e\in[0,1)$. In this work, we address this problem. Using trace formulas for the non-degenerate Hamiltonian system of EREs, we establish an upper bound ensuring non-degeneracy for all $e\in[0,1)$. As key applications, we provide explicit stability estimates for the Lagrange, Euler, and regular $(1+n)$-gon EREs over the full range of eccentricity.</description>

      <title>Data-driven approximation of transfer operators for mean-field stochastic differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09891v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mean-field stochastic differential equations, also called McKean--Vlasov equations, are the limiting equations of interacting particle systems with fully symmetric interaction potential. Such systems play an important role in a variety of fields ranging from biology and physics to sociology and economics. Global information about the behavior of complex dynamical systems can be obtained by analyzing the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of associated transfer operators such as the Perron--Frobenius operator and the Koopman operator. In this paper, we extend transfer operator theory to McKean--Vlasov equations and show how extended dynamic mode decomposition and the Galerkin projection methodology can be used to compute finite-dimensional approximations of these operators, which allows us to compute spectral properties and thus to identify slowly evolving spatiotemporal patterns or to detect metastable sets. The results will be illustrated with the aid of several guiding examples and benchmark problems including the Cormier model, the Kuramoto model, and a three-dimensional generalization of the Kuramoto model.</description>

      <title>Exponential mixing of measures of maximal entropy for certain skew products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09908v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a relation between the continuity of the fiber entropy and the continuity of the fiber Lyapunov exponents for skew products with 2-dimensional fibers. This result extends the theorem for surfaces proved by Buzzi-Crovisier-Sarig. As a consequence, we are able to obtain classes of skew products that satisfies the strong positive recurrence (SPR) property, in particular it has finite number of measures of maximal entropy, all exponentially mixing with good statistical properties.</description>

      <title>On the parabolic Fatou domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09914v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $f$ be a rational map with an infinitely-connected fixed parabolic Fatou domain $U$. We prove that there exists a rational map $g$ with a completely invariant parabolic Fatou domain $V$, such that $(f,U)$ and $(g,V)$ are conformally conjugate, and each non-singleton Julia component of $g$ is a Jordan curve which bounds a superattracting Fatou domain of $g$ containing at most one postcritical point. Furthermore, we show that if the Julia set of $f$ is a Cantor set, then the parabolic Fatou domain can be perturbed into an attracting one without affecting the topology of the Julia set.</description>

      <title>Patterson-Sullivan construction of equilibrium states and weighted counting in nonpositive curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09924v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider the geodesic flow on a closed rank one manifold of nonpositive curvature. For certain H\"{o}lder continuous potential, there exists a unique equilibrium state by \cite{BCFT}. In this paper, we introduce the notions of core limit set, regular radial limit set and uniformly recurrent and regular vectors, and then construct a family of Patterson-Sullivan measures on the boundary at infinity in two separate settings. Then we give an explicit construction of the above unique equilibrium state using Patterson-Sullivan measures. This enables us to prove the Bernoulli property of the equilibrium states. Using the Patterson-Sullivan construction and mixing properties of equilibrium states, we count the number of free homotopy classes with weights in nonpositive curvature.</description>

      <title>Variety of physical measures in partially hyperbolic systems with multi 1-D centers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide two robust examples of globally partially hyperbolic systems with a multi one-dimensional center splitting, for which all Gibbs u-states are hyperbolic and the number of physical measures is fixed. In the second example, the physical measures have different unstable indices, and the supports of those with index at least 2 can be adjusted to lie on a non-uniformly hyperbolic set using the techniques developed for the first example. Such partially hyperbolic systems were previously studied in \cite{MC25, Bur25}, where the existence and finiteness of physical measures were established under the assumption of hyperbolicity of the Gibbs $u$-states or the SRB measures, respectively.</description>

      <title>Global Hopf bifurcation and connected components in a delayed predator-prey model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of a delayed predator-prey system with Holling type II functional response, focusing on the interplay between time delay and carrying capacity. Using local and global Hopf bifurcation theory, we establish the existence of sequences of bifurcations as the delay parameter varies, and prove that the connected components of global Hopf branches are nested under suitable conditions. A novel contribution is to show that the classical limit cycle of the non-delayed system belongs to a connected component of the global Hopf bifurcation in Fuller's space. Our analysis combines rigorous functional differential equation theory with continuation methods to characterize the structure and boundedness of bifurcation branches. We further demonstrate that delays can induce oscillatory coexistence at lower carrying capacities than in the corresponding ODE model, yielding counterintuitive biological insights. The results contribute to the broader theory of global bifurcations in delay differential equations while providing new perspectives on nonlinear population dynamics.</description>

      <title>Index theory for non-compact quantum graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09749v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop an index theory for variational problems on noncompact quantum graphs. The main results are a spectral flow formula, relating the net change of eigenvalues to the Maslov index of boundary data, and a Morse index theorem, equating the negative directions of the Lagrangian action with the total multiplicity of conjugate instants along the edges.
  These results extend classical tools in global analysis and symplectic geometry to graph based models, with applications to nonlinear wave equations such as the nonlinear Schroedinger equation. The spectral flow formula is proved by constructing a Lagrangian intersection theory in the Gelfand-Robbin quotients of the second variation of the action. This approach also recovers, in a unified way, the known formulas for heteroclinic, halfclinic, homoclinic, and bounded orbits of (non)autonomous Lagrangian systems.</description>

      <title>Turing patterns on adaptive networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10124v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We are surrounded by spatio-temporal patterns resulting from the interaction of the numerous basic units constituting natural or human-made systems. In presence of diffusive-like coupling, Turing theory has been largely applied to explain the formation of such self-organized motifs both on continuous domains or networked systems, where reactions occur in the nodes and the available links are used for species to diffuse. In many relevant applications, those links are not static, as very often assumed, but evolve in time and more importantly they adapt their weights to the states of the nodes. In this work, we make one step forward and we provide a general theory to prove the validity of Turing idea in the case of adaptive symmetric networks with positive weights. The conditions for the emergence of Turing instability rely on the spectral property of the Laplace matrix and the model parameters, thus strengthening the interplay between dynamics and network topology. A rich variety of patterns are presented by using two prototype models of nonlinear dynamical systems, the Brusselator and the FitzHugh-Nagumo model. Because many empirical networks adapt to changes in the system states, our results pave the way for a thorough understanding of self-organization in real-world systems.</description>

      <title>The Single Ring Theorem and a Question of Shub</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10358v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given an orthogonally invariant probability measure on $GL(d,\mathbb{R})$, Mike Shub asked whether the average product of the $k$ top eigenvalues in the ensemble can be lower bounded by the average distortion along $k$ dimensional Grassmanians. Recently, Armentano, Chinta, Sahi, and Shub provided partial progress, however they attach a constant $c_{d,k} \to 0 as d \to \infty$. In this paper, by invoking the Single Ring Theorem and sequels, we show the conjecture asymptotically for the spectral radius, in particular, $c_{d,k} \to 1$ as $d \to \infty$, and $k = 1$.</description>

      <title>Near-Hamiltonian dynamics and energy-like quantities of next-generation neural mass models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10428v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural mass models describe the mean-field dynamics of populations of neurons. In this work we illustrate how fundamental ideas of physics, such as energy and conserved quantities, can be explored for such models. We show that time-rescaling renders recent next-generation neural mass models Hamiltonian in the limit of a homogeneous population or strong coupling. The corresponding energy-like quantity provides considerable insight into the model dynamics even in the case of heterogeneity, and explain for example why orbits are near-ellipsoidal and predict spike amplitude during bursting dynamics. We illustrate how these energy considerations provide a possible link between neuronal population behavior and energy landscape theory, which has been used to analyze data from brain recordings. Our introduction of near-Hamiltonian descriptions of neuronal activity could permit the application of highly developed physics theory to get insight into brain behavior.</description>

Abstract: We construct examples of continuous $\mathrm{GL}(2,\mathbb{R})$-cocycles which are not uniformly hyperbolic despite having the same non-zero Lyapunov exponents with respect to all invariant measures. The base dynamics can be any non-trivial subshift of finite type. According to a theorem of DeWitt--Gogolev and Guysinsky, such cocycles cannot be H\"older-continuous. Our construction uses the nonuniformly hyperbolic cocycles discovered by Walters in 1984.</description>

      <title>The fibered rotation number for ergodic symplectic cocycles and its applications: I. Gap Labelling Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19845v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $ (\Theta,T,\mu) $ be an ergodic topological dynamical system. The fibered rotation number for cocycles in $ \Theta\times \mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{R}) $, acting on $ \Theta\times \mathbb{R}\mathbb{P}^1
  $ is well-defined and has wide applications in the study of the spectral theory of Schr\"odinger operators. In this paper, we will provide its natural generalization for higher dimensional cocycles in $ \Theta\times\mathrm{SP}(2m,\mathbb{R}) $ or $ \Theta\times \mathrm{HSP}(2m,\mathbb{C}) $, where $ \mathrm{SP}(2m,\mathbb{R}) $ and $ \mathrm{HSP}(2m,\mathbb{C}) $ respectively refer to the $ 2m $-dimensional symplectic or Hermitian-symplectic matrices. As a corollary, we establish the equivalence between the integrated density of states for generalized Schr\"odinger operators and the fibered rotation number; and the Gap Labelling Theorem via the Schwartzman group, as expected from the one dimensional case [AS1983, JM1982].</description>

Abstract: We examine pairs of closed plane curves that have the same closing property as two conic sections in Poncelet's porism. We show how the vertex curve can be computed for a given envelope and vice versa. Our formulas are universal in the sense that they produce all possible sufficiently regular pairs of such Poncelet curves. We arrive at similar results for sets of curves, analogous to the pencil of conic sections in the full Poncelet theorem. We also study the case of Poncelet curves that carry Poncelet polygons which are equiangular or even congruent.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.14367v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The dynamics of numerous physical systems, such as spins and qubits, can be described as a series of rotation operations, i.e., walks in the manifold of the rotation group. A basic question with practical applications is how likely and under what conditions such walks return to the origin (the identity rotation), which means that the physical system returns to its initial state. In three dimensions, we show that almost every walk in SO(3) or SU(2), even a very complicated one, will preferentially return to the origin simply by traversing the walk twice in a row and uniformly scaling all rotation angles. We explain why traversing the walk only once almost never suffices to return, and comment on the problem in higher dimensions.</description>

Abstract: The classical Floquet theory allows to map a time-periodic system of linear differential equations into an autonomous one. By looking at it in a geometrical way, we extend the theory to a class of non-autonomous non-periodic equations. This is obtained by considering a change of variables which depends on time in a non-trivial way, i.e. introducing gauge transformations, well known in fundamental Physics and Field Theory -- but which seems to have received little attention in this context.</description>
