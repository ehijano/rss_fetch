      <title>Exploring Fermi's Paradox using an Intragalactic Colonization Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00061v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore Fermi's Paradox via a system of differential equations and using simulations of dispersal and interactions between competing interplanetary civilizations. To quantify the resources and potentials of these worlds, three different state variables representing population, environment, and technology, are used. When encounters occur between two different civilizations, the deterministic Lanchester Battle Model is used to determine the outcome of the conflict. We use the Unity engine to simulate the possible outcomes of colonization by different types of civilizations to further investigate Fermi's question.
  When growth rates of population, technology and nature are out of balance, planetary civilizations can collapse. If the balance is adequate, then some civilizations can develop into dominating ones; nevertheless, they leave large spatial gaps in the distribution of their colonies. The unexpected result is that small civilizations can be left in existence by dominating civilizations in a galaxy due to those large gaps. Our results provide some insights into the validity of various solutions to Fermi's Paradox.</description>

      <title>Torus bifurcation of a dissipative time crystal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00155v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using a quantum gas setup consisting of a Bose-Einstein condensate strongly coupled to a high-finesse optical cavity by a transverse pump laser, we experimentally observe an instability of a dissipative continuous time crystal (CTC) towards a time crystalline state exhibiting two prominent oscillation frequencies. Applying a mean-field approximation model and a Floquet analysis, we theoretically confirm that this transition is a manifestation in a many-body system of a torus bifurcation between a limit cycle (LC) and a limit torus (LT). We theoretically illustrate the LC and LT attractors using the minimal model and experimentally reconstruct them using Takens' embedding theorem applied to the non-destructively measured intracavity photon dynamics.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Node Positioning in Biological Transport Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00692v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Biological transport networks are highly optimized structures that ensure power-efficient distribution of fluids across various domains, including animal vasculature and plant venation. Theoretically, these networks can be described as space-embedded graphs, and rich structures that align well with observations emerge from optimizing their hydrodynamic energy dissipation. Studies on these models typically use regular grids and focus solely on edge width optimization. Here, we present a generalization of the hydrodynamic graph model which permits additional optimization of node positioning. We achieve this by defining sink regions, accounting for the energy dissipation of delivery within these areas, and optimizing by means of differentiable physics. In the context of leaf venation patterns, our method results in organic networks that adapt to irregularities of boundaries and node misalignment, as well as overall improved efficiency. We study the dependency of the emergent network structures on the capillary delivery conductivity and identify a phase transition in which the network collapses below a critical threshold. Our findings provide insights into the early formation of biological systems and the efficient construction of transport networks.</description>
