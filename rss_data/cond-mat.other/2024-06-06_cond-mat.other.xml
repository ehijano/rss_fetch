      <title>Coexistence of Topological Dirac and Dirac Nodal line semimetal in SrCaP belonging to Nodal line semimetal family SrCaX(X= Bi, Sb, As, P)</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.03952v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nodal line semimetals represent precursor states for various topological phases, exhibiting intrinsic topological characteristics and intriguing properties. These materials host rare and distinctive topological features, which can give rise to exotic phenomena, thereby garnering significant attention in both fundamental research and technological applications. In this study, we conduct ab-initio calculations to explore the properties of SrCaX (X = Bi, Sb, As, P), identifying these as multiple Dirac nodal line semimetals protected by Z2 quantized Berry phases and manifesting multiple drum-head-like surface states. The nodal lines in these compounds are situated at the M point when kz = 0 and at the A point when kz = {\pi}. Notably, SrCaX family exhibits a unique characteristic wherein they host both type II Dirac point and topological nodal line semimetal within a single crystal structure, hence providing an excellent platform for studying the interplay between different topological properties. Additionally, in SrCaP topological Dirac semimetal, Type II Dirac point and topological nodal line semimetal features coexist in a single crystal. These special features in this series of materials make them ideal candidates for further investigation by experimental means.</description>

      <title>Manipulating the Relaxation Time of Boundary-Dissipative Systems through Bond Dissipation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04183v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Relaxation time plays a crucial role in describing the relaxation processes of quantum systems. We study the effect of a type of bond dissipation on the relaxation time of boundary dissipative systems and find that it can change the scaling of the relaxation time $T_c\sim L^{z}$ from $z=3$ to a value significantly less than $3$. We further reveal that the reason such bond dissipation can significantly reduce the relaxation time is that it can selectively target specific states. For Anderson localized systems, the scaling behavior of the relaxation time changes from an exponential form to a power-law form as the system size varies. This is because the bond dissipation we consider can not only select specific states but also disrupt the localization properties. Our work reveals that in open systems, one type of dissipation can be used to regulate the effects produced by another type of dissipation.</description>
