      <title>Comparative Analysis of Community Detection Algorithms on the SNAP Social Circles Dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In network research, Community Detection has always been a topic of significant interest in network science, with numerous papers and algorithms proposing to uncover the underlying structures within networks. In this paper, we conduct a comparative analysis of several prominent community detection algorithms applied to the SNAP Social Circles Dataset, derived from the Facebook Social Media network. The algorithms implemented include Louvain, Girvan-Newman, Spectral Clustering, K-Means Clustering, etc. We evaluate the performance of these algorithms based on various metrics such as modularity, normalized cut-ratio, silhouette score, compactness, and separability. Our findings reveal insights into the effectiveness of each algorithm in detecting various meaningful communities within the social network, shedding light on their strength and limitations. This research contributes to the understanding of community detection methods and provides valuable guidance for their application in analyzing real-world social networks.</description>

      <title>Community detection for directed networks revisited using bimodularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04777v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Community structure is a key feature omnipresent in real-world network data. Plethora of methods have been proposed to reveal subsets of densely interconnected nodes using criteria such as the modularity index. These approaches have been successful for undirected graphs, but directed edge information has not yet been dealt with in a satisfactory way. Here, we revisit the concept of directed communities as a mapping between sending and receiving communities. This translates into a new definition that we term bimodularity. Using convex relaxation, bimodularity can be optimized with the singular value decomposition of the directed modularity matrix. Subsequently, we propose an edge-based clustering approach to reveal the directed communities including their mappings. The feasibility of the new framework is illustrated on a synthetic model and further applied to the neuronal wiring diagram of the \textit{C. elegans}, for which it yields meaningful feedforward loops of the head and body motion systems. This framework sets the ground for the understanding and detection of community structures in directed networks.</description>

      <title>On the Inference of Sociodemographics on Reddit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05049v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inference of sociodemographic attributes of social media users is an essential step for computational social science (CSS) research to link online and offline behavior. However, there is a lack of a systematic evaluation and clear guidelines for optimal methodologies for this task on Reddit, one of today's largest social media. In this study, we fill this gap by comparing state-of-the-art (SOTA) and probabilistic models.
  To this end, first we collect a novel data set of more than 850k self-declarations on age, gender, and partisan affiliation from Reddit comments. Then, we systematically compare alternatives to the widely used embedding-based model and labeling techniques for the definition of the ground-truth. We do so on two tasks: ($i$) predicting binary labels (classification); and ($ii$)~predicting the prevalence of a demographic class among a set of users (quantification).
  Our findings reveal that Naive Bayes models not only offer transparency and interpretability by design but also consistently outperform the SOTA. Specifically, they achieve an improvement in ROC AUC of up to $19\%$ and maintain a mean absolute error (MAE) below $15\%$ in quantification for large-scale data settings. Finally, we discuss best practices for researchers in CSS, emphasizing coverage, interpretability, reliability, and scalability.
  The code and model weights used for the experiments are publicly available.\footnote{https://anonymous.4open.science/r/SDI-submission-5234}</description>

      <title>GNNs Getting ComFy: Community and Feature Similarity Guided Rewiring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04891v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Maximizing the spectral gap through graph rewiring has been proposed to enhance the performance of message-passing graph neural networks (GNNs) by addressing over-squashing. However, as we show, minimizing the spectral gap can also improve generalization. To explain this, we analyze how rewiring can benefit GNNs within the context of stochastic block models. Since spectral gap optimization primarily influences community strength, it improves performance when the community structure aligns with node labels. Building on this insight, we propose three distinct rewiring strategies that explicitly target community structure, node labels, and their alignment: (a) community structure-based rewiring (ComMa), a more computationally efficient alternative to spectral gap optimization that achieves similar goals; (b) feature similarity-based rewiring (FeaSt), which focuses on maximizing global homophily; and (c) a hybrid approach (ComFy), which enhances local feature similarity while preserving community structure to optimize label-community alignment. Extensive experiments confirm the effectiveness of these strategies and support our theoretical insights.</description>

      <title>WikiReddit: Tracing Information and Attention Flows Between Online Platforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04942v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The World Wide Web is a complex interconnected digital ecosystem, where information and attention flow between platforms and communities throughout the globe. These interactions co-construct how we understand the world, reflecting and shaping public discourse. Unfortunately, researchers often struggle to understand how information circulates and evolves across the web because platform-specific data is often siloed and restricted by linguistic barriers. To address this gap, we present a comprehensive, multilingual dataset capturing all Wikipedia links shared in posts and comments on Reddit from 2020 to 2023, excluding those from private and NSFW subreddits. Each linked Wikipedia article is enriched with revision history, page view data, article ID, redirects, and Wikidata identifiers. Through a research agreement with Reddit, our dataset ensures user privacy while providing a query and ID mechanism that integrates with the Reddit and Wikipedia APIs. This enables extended analyses for researchers studying how information flows across platforms. For example, Reddit discussions use Wikipedia for deliberation and fact-checking which subsequently influences Wikipedia content, by driving traffic to articles or inspiring edits. By analyzing the relationship between information shared and discussed on these platforms, our dataset provides a foundation for examining the interplay between social media discourse and collaborative knowledge consumption and production.</description>

      <title>The Role of Science in the Climate Change Discussions on Reddit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05026v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Collective and individual action necessary to address climate change hinges on the public's understanding of the relevant scientific findings. In this study, we examine the use of scientific sources in the course of 14 years of public deliberation around climate change on one of the largest social media platforms, Reddit. We find that only 4.0% of the links in the Reddit posts, and 6.5% in the comments, point to domains of scientific sources, although these rates have been increasing in the past decades. These links are dwarfed, however, by the citations of mass media, newspapers, and social media, the latter of which peaked especially during 2019-2020. Further, scientific sources are more likely to be posted by users who also post links to sources having central-left political leaning, and less so by those posting more polarized sources. Unfortunately, scientific sources are not often used in response to links to unreliable sources.</description>

      <title>The DSA Transparency Database: Auditing Self-reported Moderation Actions by Social Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.10269v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Since September 2023, the Digital Services Act (DSA) obliges large online platforms to submit detailed data on each moderation action they take within the European Union (EU) to the DSA Transparency Database. From its inception, this centralized database has sparked scholarly interest as an unprecedented and potentially unique trove of data on real-world online moderation. Here, we thoroughly analyze all 353.12M records submitted by the eight largest social media platforms in the EU during the first 100 days of the database. Specifically, we conduct a platform-wise comparative study of their: volume of moderation actions, grounds for decision, types of applied restrictions, types of moderated content, timeliness in undertaking and submitting moderation actions, and use of automation. Furthermore, we systematically cross-check the contents of the database with the platforms' own transparency reports. Our analyses reveal that (i) the platforms adhered only in part to the philosophy and structure of the database, (ii) the structure of the database is partially inadequate for the platforms' reporting needs, (iii) the platforms exhibited substantial differences in their moderation actions, (iv) a remarkable fraction of the database data is inconsistent, (v) the platform X (formerly Twitter) presents the most inconsistencies. Our findings have far-reaching implications for policymakers and scholars across diverse disciplines. They offer guidance for future regulations that cater to the reporting needs of online platforms in general, but also highlight opportunities to improve and refine the database itself.</description>

      <title>Contextualized Counterspeech: Strategies for Adaptation, Personalization, and Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07338v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: AI-generated counterspeech offers a promising and scalable strategy to curb online toxicity through direct replies that promote civil discourse. However, current counterspeech is one-size-fits-all, lacking adaptation to the moderation context and the users involved. We propose and evaluate multiple strategies for generating tailored counterspeech that is adapted to the moderation context and personalized for the moderated user. We instruct an LLaMA2-13B model to generate counterspeech, experimenting with various configurations based on different contextual information and fine-tuning strategies. We identify the configurations that generate persuasive counterspeech through a combination of quantitative indicators and human evaluations collected via a pre-registered mixed-design crowdsourcing experiment. Results show that contextualized counterspeech can significantly outperform state-of-the-art generic counterspeech in adequacy and persuasiveness, without compromising other characteristics. Our findings also reveal a poor correlation between quantitative indicators and human evaluations, suggesting that these methods assess different aspects and highlighting the need for nuanced evaluation methodologies. The effectiveness of contextualized AI-generated counterspeech and the divergence between human and algorithmic evaluations underscore the importance of increased human-AI collaboration in content moderation.</description>

      <title>A Weighted Similarity Metric for Community Detection in Sparse Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07025v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many Natural Language Processing (NLP) related applications involves topics and sentiments derived from short documents such as consumer reviews and social media posts. Topics and sentiments of short documents are highly sparse because a short document generally covers a few topics among hundreds of candidates. Imputation of missing data is sometimes hard to justify and also often unpractical in highly sparse data. We developed a method for calculating a weighted similarity for highly sparse data without imputation. This weighted similarity is consist of three components to capture similarities based on both existence and lack of common properties and pattern of missing values. As a case study, we used a community detection algorithm and this weighted similarity to group different shampoo brands based on sparse topic sentiments derived from short consumer reviews. Compared with traditional imputation and similarity measures, the weighted similarity shows better performance in both general community structures and average community qualities. The performance is consistent and robust across metrics and community complexities.</description>
