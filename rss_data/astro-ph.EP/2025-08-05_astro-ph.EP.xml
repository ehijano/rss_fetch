      <title>Detailed radial scale height profile of dust grains as probed by dust self-scattering in HL Tau</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The vertical settling of dust grains in a circumstellar disk, characterized by their scale height, is a pivotal process in the formation of planets. This study offers in-depth analysis and modeling of the radial scale height profile of dust grains in the HL Tau system, leveraging high-resolution polarization observations. We resolve the inner disk's polarization, revealing a significant near-far side asymmetry, with the near side being markedly brighter than the far side in polarized intensity. This asymmetry is attributed to a geometrically thick inner dust disk, suggesting a large aspect ratio of $H/R \ge 0.15$. The first ring at 20 au exhibits an azimuthal contrast, with polarization enhanced along the minor axis, indicating a moderately thick dust ring with $H/R \approx 0.1$. The absence of the near-far side asymmetry at larger scales implies a thin dust layer, with $H/R &lt; 0.05$. Taken together, these findings depict a disk with a turbulent inner region and a settled outer disk, requiring a variable turbulence model with $\alpha$ increasing from $10^{-5}$ at 100 au to $10^{-2.5}$ at 20 au. This research sheds light on dust settling and turbulence levels within protoplanetary disks, providing valuable insights into the mechanisms of planet formation.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the Atmosphere of HR 7672 B from the Near-Infrared High-Resolution Spectrum Using REACH/Subaru</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01281v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Characterizing the atmospheres of exoplanets and brown dwarfs is crucial for understanding their atmospheric physics and chemistry, searching for biosignatures, and investigating their formation histories. Recent advances in observational techniques, combining adaptive optics with high-resolution spectrographs, have enabled detailed spectroscopic analysis for directly imaged faint companions. In this paper, we report an atmospheric retrieval on the L-type brown dwarf HR 7672 B using a near-infrared high-contrast high-resolution spectrograph, REACH (Y, J, H band, $R\sim100,000$), which combines SCExAO with IRD at the Subaru Telescope. Our model, developed based on the ExoJAX spectrum code, simultaneously accounts for several factors, including the presence of clouds in the L dwarf's atmosphere as well as contamination from the host star's light and telluric absorption lines in the observed spectra. Our analysis identified H2O and FeH as the primary absorbers in the observed J- and H-band spectra. Additionally, the observed features were reproduced with a model that includes cloud opacity, assuming an optically thick cloud at the pressure $P_\mathrm{top}$. The resulting temperature at the cloud top pressure suggests the potential formation of clouds composed of TiO2, Al2O3, or Fe. This study is the first science demonstration for faint spectra obtained by REACH, providing a foundation for future investigations into the atmospheres of exoplanets and brown dwarfs.</description>

      <title>Error dependencies in the space-based CNEOS fireball database</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01454v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We evaluate the reliability of CNEOS-derived ephemerides of fireball events given the absence of the underlying data. We analyzed 18 events that have both (i) sufficient satellite information to derive orbits and (ii) ground-based observational counterparts. We quantify the uncertainties on these calibrated events using the orbital similarity criterion D_D. We also examine the velocity components imbalance and identify discriminants that can indicate the accuracy of an event. We identify two groups in the CNEOS database. CNEOS data produces ephemeris determinations with D_D&lt;0.1 for fireballs reported either (i) after late 2017 or (ii) with impact energies above 0.45 kt with 74-78% of events having D_D=0.03$\pm$0.02, while ~11% show D_D&lt;0.008. Our statistical test confirms these two parameters as the only reliable discriminants that, when combined, explain the two accuracy groups. Daylight, z-velocity component, low altitude, long duration, and latitude might also indicate errors, although the limited dataset may obscure correlations. No clear discriminants are identified for more restrictive D_D cut-offs. We provide estimates of orbital uncertainties for calibrated events. The hyperbolic fireball subset in the CNEOS database appears as an outlier in the velocity imbalance test. Our results confirm that the fidelity of CNEOS fireball data improved significantly from 2018, likely due to the deployment of next-generation space sensors, and show a growing number of high-velocity events. Hyperbolic candidates should be interpreted with caution, as their velocities and inclinations likely reflect measurement errors. Accuracy constraints remain limited by the dataset size, as evidenced by the lack of statistically significant dependence on duration, preventing strong conclusions from being drawn.</description>

      <title>Families of Transfers from circular low Earth orbit to Distant Prograde Orbit around the Moon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01769v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Distant prograde orbits around the Moon exhibit remarkable potential for practical applications such as cislunar surveillance activities and low-energy transfers due to their instability. Previous works on transfers from circular low Earth orbit to distant prograde orbits mainly focused on construction methods based on dynamical structures, lacking a comprehensive analysis of the solution space of this transfer scenario. This paper investigates the solution space and identifies families of transfers from a 167 km circular low Earth orbit to a 1:1 distant prograde orbit. In particular, grid search and trajectory continuation are performed to construct these transfer trajectories. Initial guesses of the transfers are selected in the 1:1 distant prograde orbit through a backward propagation strategy and are then corrected to satisfy specified constraints. Based on the obtained solutions, a linear predictor is derived to predict more feasible solutions and a predictor-corrector continuation method is used to extend the solution space. Twelve transfer families are identified, most of which are new or previously underexplored. The distributions of construction parameters and transfer characteristics of these twelve families are analyzed and discussed, showing which families are applicable to which types of specific practical missions. Comparison between the obtained solution and solution developed by previous works is further performed to imply the effects of the selection of dynamical model on transfer construction.</description>

      <title>Silicate Sundogs: Probing the Effects of Grain Directionality in Exoplanet Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Crystalline ice in Earth's atmosphere can produce spectacular phenomena due to orientation-dependent attenuation, such as sun dogs and halos, providing diagnostics of the external processes acting on the aerosol grains. Crystalline mineral aerosols, such as quartz (SiO$_2$) and enstatite/forsterite (MgSiO$_3$/Mg$_2$SiO$_4$), have long been predicted to form in hot Jupiter atmospheres with JWST MIRI LRS verifying the existence of crystalline quartz observationally. Due to the strong horizontal winds ($\sim$ 1 - 5 km s$^{-1}$) and small aerosol grains ($&lt;1$ $\mu$m) found in hot Jupiter atmospheres, we show that aerosols could be mechanically aligned with the winds. We then derive directional-dependent optical properties of quartz, enstatite, and forsterite and model transmission and emission spectra assuming random and mechanically aligned orientations, finding that the orientation of all three crystalline aerosols can impart $\geq$ 100 ppm differences in observed spectra (8 - 12 $\mu$m). We run retrievals on JWST MIRI LRS transmission and emission data of WASP-17b and find that directionality alone cannot physically explain the transmission data, pointing towards polymorphs or insufficient lab data, and find weak hints of directionality (1.0 - 1.3$\sigma$) in the emission data. This work demonstrates the power of JWST MIRI LRS in detecting aerosol directionality with future observations, and a technique by which to probe how aerosols interact with atmospheric dynamical processes. To foster the exploration of aerosols in exoplanet data, the open-source code POSEIDON has been updated (v1.3.1) to include 144 new directional and temperature aerosols with precomputed optical properties, alongside new aerosol models.</description>

      <title>Thermoelastic Contraction as a Suppressor of Atmospheric Escape in Close-in Exoplanets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01885v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The long-term retention of substantial atmospheres in close-in exoplanets presents a major challenge to classical hydrodynamic escape theory, which predicts rapid mass loss under intense stellar irradiation. In this work, we propose a fully classical, interior-driven suppression mechanism based on thermoelastic contraction of the planetary mantle. By incorporating pressure- and temperature-dependent elastic deformation into the structural evolution of the planet, we demonstrate that radial contraction can lead to measurable increases in surface escape velocity. We analytically derive a modified escape condition and introduce a dimensionless suppression index Xi that quantifies the extent to which internal mechanical response inhibits atmospheric loss. Numerical simulations across a wide parameter space show that volumetric strain values in the range 0.005 to 0.01 can enhance escape velocities by up to 10 percent, leading to a reduction in energy-limited escape rates by over 50 percent. When applied to warm mini-Neptunes such as GJ 1214b, K2-18b, and TOI-270c, the model successfully accounts for their persistent atmospheres without invoking exotic stellar conditions or chemical outliers. Our results indicate that planetary elasticity, often neglected in escape models, plays a first-order role in shaping the atmospheric evolution of close-in worlds. The theory yields specific observational predictions, including suppressed outflow signatures and radius anomalies, which may be testable with JWST, ARIEL, and future spectroscopic missions.</description>

      <title>Mission Analysis for the HENON CubeSat Mission to a Large Sun-Earth Distant Retrograde Orbit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The HEliospheric pioNeer for sOlar and interplanetary threats defeNce (HENON) mission is a CubeSat Space Weather mission, designed to operate in a Sun-Earth Distant Retrograde Orbit (DRO) at more than 10 million km from Earth. HENON will embark payloads tailored for Space Weather (SWE) observations: a high-resolution energetic particle radiation monitor, a Faraday cup, and a magnetometer, enabling quasi-real-time monitoring of interplanetary conditions in deep space. HENON has multiple objectives, such as demonstrating CubeSat capabilities in deep space, including long-duration electric propulsion with periodic telemetry and command, and robust attitude control for deep-space operations. It will pave the way for a future fleet of spacecraft on DROs, providing continuous near real-time measurements for SWE forecasting. This paper focuses on the mission analysis performed for phases A and B, with the main goal of defining a baseline transfer trajectory to a heliocentric DRO in co-orbital motion with Earth. The proposed transfer leverages a rideshare opportunity on a mission escaping Earth gravity field, most likely one headed toward the Sun-Earth L2 region, and relies exclusively on on-board electric propulsion to reach deep space, making it a pioneering demonstration of this approach and the technology. Under appropriate assumptions on the electric propulsion system performance, spacecraft mass, and propellant budget, it is shown that the HENON target DRO can be reached in about one year, accounting also for periodic interruptions of thrusting to allow for telemetry, tracking, and command.</description>

      <title>Discovery and dynamics of a Sedna-like object with a perihelion of 66 au</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Trans-Neptunian objects (TNOs) with large perihelion distances ($q &gt; 60$ au) and semi-major axes ($a &gt; 200$ au) provide insights into the early evolution of the solar system and the existence of a hypothetical distant planet. These objects are still rare and their detection is challenging, yet they play a crucial role in constraining models of solar system formation. Here we report the discovery of a Sedna-like TNO, 2023\,KQ$_{14}$, nicknamed `Ammonite', with $q = 66$ au, $a = 252$ au, and inclination $i=11^\circ$. Ammonite's orbit does not align with those of the other Sedna-like objects and fills the previously unexplained `$q$-gap' in the observed distribution of distant solar system objects. Simulations demonstrate that Ammonite is dynamically stable over 4.5 billion years. % with less than 1\% variation in its semi-major axis. Our analysis suggests that Ammonite and the other Sedna-like objects may have shared a primordial orbital clustering around 4.2 billion years ago. Furthermore, Ammonite's stable orbit favors larger orbits ($\sim$ 500 au) rather than closer ones for a large hypothetical planet in present-day trans-Neptunian space.</description>

      <title>On the formation of multiple dust-trapping rings in the inner Solar system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Isotopic properties of meteorites provide evidence that multiple dust trap or pressure bumps had to form and persist in the inner Solar System on a timescale of millions of years. The formation of a pressure bump at the outer edge of the gap opened by Jupiter blocks particles drifting from the outer to the inner disk. This is not enough to preserve dust in the inner disk. However, in low viscosity disks, under specific condition on the gas cooling time, massive planets can also open secondary gaps, separated by density bumps, inward of the main gap. The majority of studies have been done in two dimensional equatorial simulations with prescribed disk cooling. Recent results have shown that including the treatment of radiation transport is key to determine the formation of secondary gaps. We extend previous studies to three dimensional disks including radiative effects and we also consider non ideal MHD effects, in disks with prescribed cooling time.
  We perform three dimensional hydrodynamical numerical simulations with self consistent treatment of radiative effects and including the magnetic field with non ideal Ohmic and Ambipolar effects. We show that in a disk with low bulk viscosity and consistent treatment of radiative effects, planetary masses close to the pebble isolation mass as well as a Jupiter massive planet open multiple gaps. In the presence of non ideal MHD effects multiple gaps and rings are also formed by a Jupiter massive planet.In conclusion the formation of multiple gaps and rings inside the planetary orbit is crucial to preserve dust reservoirs. Such reservoirs are pushed towards the inner part of the disk during Jupiter runaway growth and are persistent after Jupiter's growth. Multiple dust reservoirs could therefore be present in the inner Solar System since the formation of Jupiter's solid core if the disk had low-viscosity.</description>

      <title>Placing the Near-Earth Object Impact Probability in Context</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02418v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Near-Earth objects (NEOs) have the potential to cause extensive damage and loss of life on Earth. Advancements in NEO discovery, trajectory prediction, and deflection technology indicate that an impact could be prevented, with sufficient warning time. We derive an impact frequency of NEOs 140m and larger, using the NEOMOD2 NEO population model and JPL Horizons. We then place that frequency in context with other preventable causes of death; allowing for comparison between a planet-wide event and individual events that cause fatalities such as car crashes and carbon monoxide poisoning. We find that the chance of a $&gt;140$ m asteroid hitting the Earth is more likely than the chance of an individual being struck by lightning.</description>

      <title>Pre-discovery TESS Observations of Interstellar Object 3I/ATLAS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02499v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 3I/ATLAS, also known as C/2025 N1 (ATLAS), is the third known interstellar object to pass through our Solar System. We report serendipitous Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) observations of 3I/ATLAS taken between 2025-05-07 and 2025-06-02,, 55 days prior to the discovery date (2025-07-01) and 14 days prior to the current earliest observation (2025-05-21). We retrieve the TESS pixel data, perform a robust background correction and use a data-driven approach to refine the object's ephemeris. We find a statistically significant offset between the target's observed and predicted positions and we show that this is dominated by uncertainty in the TESS World Coordinate System (WCS) rather than the ephemeris. 3I/ATLAS is too faint to be detected in the individual 200\,second TESS integrations, so we perform image stacking to improve detectability. After co-adding the TESS image data, we performed aperture and Pixel Response Function (PRF) photometry to create two light curves for 3I/ATLAS. Each light curve consists of 15 measurements with $\text{SNR}&gt;3$, collected across two different TESS cameras during the 26\,days that the object was observed, but the PRF light curve is more robust against image noise. The PRF light curve in the TESS bandpass shows a gradual increase in brightness from $T_{\text{mag}} = 20.9 \pm 0.29$ to $T_{\text{mag}} = 19.57 \pm 0.15$. This is expected as 3I/ATLAS approaches the inner Solar System. This paper highlights the power of using TESS for Solar System science; by increasing the photometric observing baseline, future studies will be able to investigate the long-term behavior of 3I/ATLAS</description>

      <title>MINDS. Young binary systems with JWST/MIRI: Variable water-rich primaries and extended emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02576v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As part of the JWST GTO program MINDS, we analyze the mid-infrared emission of three Class II binary systems: VW Cha, WX Cha, and RW Aur, to investigate the impact of stellar multiplicity on the chemistry and physics of their inner disk. We analyze the 1D spectrum from JWST/MIRI-MRS for primary and secondary disks separately, extracted by combining forward modeling with a theoretical PSF and aperture photometry. We modeled the molecular lines with 0D slab models. We interpret the results by comparing our JWST spectra to VLT/CRIRES+, Spitzer/IRS, and ALMA. Primary and secondary disks are dramatically different in their mid-infrared emission, with primary disks showing H2O-rich spectra, and secondary disks being mostly line poor to the sensitivity of our spectra. When comparing MIRI-MRS to Spitzer/IRS, we observe large variability in the line emission of VW Cha A, as well as in the continuum of RW Aur A. The disks around VW Cha BC and RW Aur B show evidence of ionizing radiation, and a further comparison with ALMA at high angular resolution dust continuum suggest that the spectrum of RW Aur B is well explained by its ~4 au cavity. All the systems show [Ne II] jet emission, and three of them also show spatially resolved emission structures in H2, likely originated by outflows and dynamical interactions. Many of the observed features in the primary disks, such as enhanced water emission, could be linked to the increased accretion and radial drift produced by dynamical disk truncation. However, additional mechanisms are needed to explain the large differences between primary and secondary disks, potentially inner disk substructures. This work is an example of the need for combining multiple facilities to fully understand the observations from JWST.</description>

      <title>Additive Manufacturing of PEEK/Lunar Regolith Composites for Sustainable Lunar Manufacturing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00894v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As humanity advances toward long-term lunar presence under NASA's Artemis program, the development of lunar-based manufacturing and construction (LBMC) capabilities has become increasingly critical. The high cost of transporting materials from Earth makes in-situ resource utilization (ISRU) essential, with lunar regolith serving as a promising local feedstock. Additive manufacturing (AM) offers a compelling platform for LBMC due to its geometric flexibility, material efficiency, and capacity for on-demand, site-specific production. This study investigates material extrusion (MEX) AM of polyether-ether-ketone (PEEK) composites containing 10 to 50 wt% lunar regolith simulant (LRS). PEEK and LMS-1D powders were melt-compounded via twin-screw extrusion, printed using a high-temperature chamber, and annealed at 300 degrees C. The samples were characterized through density measurements, thermal analysis, tensile testing, and microstructural and elemental mapping. All filaments exhibited densities above 96%, though as-printed porosity increased from less than 1% in neat PEEK to 7.5% at 50 wt% LRS due to elevated melt viscosity. Regolith incorporation enhanced crystallinity (17.4 to 20.5%) and elastic modulus (by 6-41%), while reducing delamination and warping, which improved dimensional accuracy and print success rates. Tensile strength declined gradually from 107 MPa to 90 MPa up to 40 wt% LRS, then dropped sharply to approximately 70 MPa at 50 wt%. Annealing improved density and stiffness for composites containing up to 30 wt% LRS, with marginal benefit at higher contents. Microstructural and elemental analyses confirmed a continuous PEEK matrix with uniformly dispersed regolith particles. This work establishes processing windows and trade-offs for regolith-rich PEEK composites, supporting ISRU-enabled AM of future lunar infrastructure.</description>

      <title>Complementary Planetary Spectroscopy Probes of Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00980v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate dark matter (DM) interactions via spectroscopic signatures of energy injection in planetary environments. We develop a general framework to account for how DM energy injection signals depend on the DM spatial distribution, planetary structure, and DM energy deposition profile. We combine UV airglow data on the Solar System's gas giants from the Voyager and New Horizons flybys, and ionospheric measurements from AMS-02 and ELFIN CubeSat on Earth, with internal heat flow data from Cassini, Voyager, and terrestrial boreholes, to constrain DM-nucleon scattering across both heavy and light mediator scenarios. We show that Earth, gas giants, and ice giants probe complementary DM masses and mediator properties, and forecast the reach of a free-floating Super-Jupiter. These results establish planetary spectroscopy as a powerful and versatile probe of the dark sector, complementary to direct detection, cosmology, and collider searches.</description>

      <title>Corotating Interaction Regions (CIRs): impacts with exoplanets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01267v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Corotating interaction regions (CIRs) are compressions that form in stellar winds when streams of different speeds collide. They form an Archimedean spiral around the star and can compress any exoplanetary magnetospheres they impact. They may also steepen into shocks capable of accelerating particles to high energies. We model the frequency and strength of these CIRS for stars of spectral types F-M. We show that the minimum radius, $r_{CIR}=\Delta \phi u_{slow}/\Omega$, at which CIRs form varies strongly with the rotation rate (and hence age) of the star. For some exoplanets, such as those in Earth or Mars orbits, CIRs can form within the exoplanet's orbit at all stellar rotation rates, depending on the angular size of the fast wind segment ($\Delta \phi$). These exoplanets will experience CIR impacts at all stellar ages. However, for closer-in orbits such as Mercury or Venus, this may only be the case at higher stellar rotation rates. Both the frequency and impact of CIRs depend on the stellar rotation rate. For exoplanets with $P_{orbit}\gg P_*$, CIR impacts lasting for a time $\Delta t$ raise the exoplanetary outflow rate by a factor $R$. If $P_*\leq N\Delta t$ the CIR pulses overlap in time, whereas if $N\Delta t &lt; P_* \leq N\Delta t(R+1)$, the planet experiences discrete pulses of compression and relaxation and the CIR-related outflow is more than 50$\%$ of the total. For $P_* &gt; N\Delta t(R+1)$ the pulses are less frequent, and contribute less than $50\%$ of the total outflow.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.01660v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Global Positioning System (GPS) satellites are essential for providing accurate navigation and timing information worldwide. Operating in medium Earth orbit (MEO), these satellites must maintain precise Earth-pointing attitudes to transmit signals effectively. This paper presents a comprehensive review of the operational dynamics, attitude determination and control systems (ADCS), and orbital insertion techniques for GPS satellites. We explore the integration of sensors and actuators, control algorithms, stabilization strategies, and the launch procedures required to deploy these satellites. Key equations related to orbital mechanics and attitude control are discussed, and references to recent technical literature are included.</description>

      <title>Spot-Crossing Variations Confirm a Misaligned Orbit for a Planet Transiting an M Dwarf</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11998v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: TOI-3884~b is an unusual 6.4~R$_\oplus$ planet orbiting an M4 host, whose transits display large and persistent spot-crossing events. We used the \textit{Tierras} Observatory to monitor both the long-term photometric variability of TOI-3884 and changes in the spot-crossing events across multiple transits of the planet. We show that the star rotates with a period of $11.020 \pm 0.015$~days. We simultaneously model the rotational modulation of the star and variations in transit shapes that arise due to rotation of the spot, allowing us to determine the true stellar obliquity, $\psi_\star$. The data are best described by a planet on a misaligned orbit around a highly inclined star ($\psi_\star = {77.4^\circ} ^{+2.3^\circ}_{-2.5^\circ}$; $i_\star = {22.3^\circ}^{+1.8^\circ}_{-1.6^\circ}$) that hosts a large polar starspot ($r_\mathrm{spot} = {31.2^\circ}^{+2.4^\circ}_{-1.9^\circ}$; $\lambda_\mathrm{spot} = {80.5^\circ}\pm1.2^\circ$). Archival photometry from the Zwicky Transient Facility suggests that this polar spot has persisted on TOI-3884 for at least seven years. The TOI-3884 system provides a benchmark for studying the evolution of a polar spot on an M dwarf.</description>

      <title>From a Different Star: 3I/ATLAS in the context of the \={O}tautahi-Oxford interstellar object population model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05318v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The discovery of the third interstellar object (ISO), 3I/ATLAS (`3I'), provides a rare chance to directly observe a small body from another Solar System. Studying its chemistry and dynamics will add to our understanding of how the processes of planetesimal formation and evolution happen across the Milky Way's disk, and how such objects respond to the Milky Way's potential. In this Letter, we present a first assessment of 3I in the context of the \={O}tautahi-Oxford model, which uses data from Gaia in conjunction with models of protoplanetary disk chemistry and Galactic dynamics to predict the properties of the ISO population. The model shows that both the velocity and radiant of 3I are within the expected range. Its velocity predicts an age of over 7.6 Gyr and a high water mass fraction, which may become observable shortly. We also conclude that it is very unlikely that 3I shares an origin with either of the previous two interstellar object detections.</description>

      <title>Intercepting 3I/ATLAS at Closest Approach to Jupiter with the Juno spacecraft</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21402v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The interstellar object 3I/ATLAS is expected to arrive at a distance of $53.56(\pm 0.45)$ million ${\rm km}$ ($0.358\pm 0.003$~au) from Jupiter on March 16, 2026. We show that applying a total thrust $\Delta$V of $2.6755 {{\rm km~s^{-1}}}$ to lower perijove on September 9, 2025 and then execute a Jupiter Oberth Maneuver, can bring the Juno spacecraft from its orbit around Jupiter to intercept the path of 3I/ATLAS on March 14, 2026. We further show that it is possible for Juno to come much closer to 3I/ATLAS ($\sim{27}$ million km) with 110 kg of remaining propellant, merely 5.4% of the initial fuel reservoir. We find that for low available $\Delta$V there is no particular benefit in application of a double impulse (for example to reach $\sim{27}$ million km from 3I/ATLAS), however if Juno has a higher $\Delta$V capability there is significant advantage to a second impulse with typically a saving of propellant by a factor of a half. A close fly-by might be able to probe the nature of 3I/ATLAS far better than telescopes on Earth.</description>
