      <title>Weak Optimal Transport: When is the Dual Potential Convex?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07200v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Weak optimal transport generalizes the classical theory of optimal transportation to nonlinear cost functions and covers a range of problems that lie beyond the traditional theory - including entropic transport, martingale transport, and applications in mechanism design. As in the classical case, the weak transport problem can also be written as a dual maximization problem over a pair of conjugate potentials.
  We identify sharp monotonicity conditions on the cost under which the dual problem can be restricted to convex potentials. This framework unifies several known results from the literature, including barycentric transport, martingale Benamou-Brenier, the multiple-good monopolist problem, Strassen's theorem, stochastic order projections and the classical Brenier theorem.</description>

      <title>The LDP of McKean-Vlasov stochastic differential equations with H\"{o}lder continuous conditions and integrable conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we first study the large deviation principle (LDP) for non-degenerate McKean-Vlasov stochastic differential equations (MVSDEs) with H\"{o}lder continuous drifts by using Zvonkin's transformation. When the drift only satisfies H\"{o}lder condition, the skeleton equation may have multiple solutions. Among these solutions, we find one that ensures the MVSDEs satisfy the LDP. Moreover, we introduce a new definition for the rate function that reduces to traditional rate function if the drift satisfies the Lipschitz condition. Secondly, we study the LDP for degenerate MVSDEs with H\"{o}lder continuous drifts.</description>

      <title>Edge statistics for singular values of products of rectangular complex Ginibre matrices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.07431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the edge statistics of singular values for products of independent rectangular complex Ginibre matrices. Building on work \cite{LWW23}, which introduced the depth-to-width ratio (DWR) and established the critical kernel, we show that the DWR acts as a sharp threshold: local statistics exhibit Gaussian fluctuations in the low-DWR regime, while the Airy kernel emerges at the soft edge in the high-DWR regime.</description>

      <title>Marginals of the planar symmetric Markov random flight on long time intervals behave like the Goldstein-Kac telegraph process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07525v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The planar symmetric Markov random flight $\bold X(t), \; t&gt;0,$ is represented by the stochastic motion of a particle moving with constant finite speed $c&gt;0$ in the Euclidean plane $\Bbb R^2$ and taking on its initial and each new directions at $\lambda$-Poisson ($\lambda&gt;0$) distributed random time instants by choosing them at random according to the uniform distribution on the unit circumference. We consider the marginals of $\bold X(t)$, that is, the projection of this stochastic motion onto the axes. This projection onto the $x_1$-axis (respectively, onto the $x_2$-axis) represents a one-dimensional stochastic motion with random velocity $c \cos\alpha$ (respectively, with random velocity $c \sin\alpha$), where $\alpha$ is a random variable distributed uniformly on the interval $[0, 2\pi)$. We prove that the density of the marginals of $\bold X(t)$ is asymptotically, as $t\to\infty$, equivalent to the density of the classical one-dimensional Goldstein-Kac telegraph process with parameters ($c, \lambda$). This unexpected and interesting result is confirmed by numerical calculations.</description>

      <title>Strong averaging principle for nonautonomous slow-fast SPDEs driven by $\alpha$-stable processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07538v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper considers a class of nonautonomous slow-fast stochastic partial differential equations driven by $\alpha$-stable processes for $\alpha\in (1,2)$. By introducing the evolution system of measures, we establish an averaging principle for this stochastic system. Specifically, we first prove the strong convergence (in the $L^p$ sense for $p\in (1,\alpha)$) of the slow component to the solution of a simplified averaged equation with coefficients depend on the scaling parameter. Furthermore, under conditions that coefficients are time-periodic or satisfy certain asymptotic convergence, we prove that the slow component converges strongly to the solution of an averaged equation, whose coefficients are independent of the scaling parameter. Finally, a concrete example is provided to illustrate the applicability of our assumptions. Notably, the absence of finite second moments in the solution caused by the $\alpha$-stable processes requires new technical treatments, thereby solving a problem mentioned in [1,Remark 3.3].</description>

      <title>Distance to stationarity and open set recurrence for ergodic processes on the unit interval with a Bernstein or a Siegmund dual</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07587v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use duality techniques - specifically Siegmund and Bernstein duality - as tools to analyse ergodic and recurrence properties of $[0,1]$-valued Markov processes. These dualities enable the derivation of sharp bounds on the distance to stationarity and allow for a novel approach to establishing topological recurrence, whereby ergodicity implies recurrent visits to neighbourhoods of points in the stationary distribution's support. We first relate Siegmund and Bernstein duality in cases where both apply, such as $\Lambda$-Wright--Fisher processes. We then exploit the dual processes to derive bounds on the distance to stationarity and simple criteria for open set recurrence. Our results apply to a broad class of $\Lambda$-Wright--Fisher processes with frequency-dependent selection, mutation, and random environmental effects. In many cases, Bernstein duals can be constructed from the same ancestral structures underlying moment duals, allowing our methods to extend and strengthen existing results based on moment duality. This framework provides a robust approach to studying the long-term behaviour of complex population models beyond the classical moment dual setting.</description>

      <title>Multi-species McKean-Vlasov dynamics in non-convex landscapes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07617v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study multi-species stochastic interacting particle systems and their mean-field McKean-Vlasov partial differential equations (PDEs) in non-convex landscapes. We discuss the well-posedness of the multi-species SDE system, propagation of chaos and the derivation of the coupled McKean-Vlasov PDE system in the mean field limit. Our focus is on the long-time and asymptotic behaviour of the mean-field PDEs. Under suitable growth assumptions on the potentials and an appropriate structural assumption, we show the existence and (non-) uniqueness of stationary solutions and study their linear stability. Under a symmetry assumption we construct a free-energy functional that plays the role of a Lyapunov function for the mean-field PDE system. Furthermore, we prove the existence of a phase transition at low noise strengths and establish the convergence of solutions to the mean-field PDEs (and of their free energy) to a stationary state (and the corresponding free energy).</description>

      <title>Upper Expected Meeting Times for Interdependent Stochastic Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyse the problem of meeting times for interdependent stochastic agents: random walkers whose behaviour is stochastic but controlled by their selections from some set of allowed actions, and the inference problem of when these agents will be in the same state for the first time. We consider the case where we are epistemically uncertain about the selected actions of these agents, and show how their behaviour can be modelled using imprecise Markov chains. This allows us to use results and algorithms from the literature, to exactly compute bounds on their meeting time, which are tight with respect to our epistemic uncertainty models. We focus on the two-agent case, but discuss how it can be naturally extended to an arbitrary number of agents, and how the corresponding combinatorial explosion can be partly mitigated by exploiting symmetries inherent in the problem.</description>

      <title>Observables of random spanning trees in random environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07702v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this thesis, we study a new disordered system called random spanning tree in random environment (RSTRE) across different families of graphs with varying disorder distributions. We examine several observables as functions of the disorder strength (inverse temperature) $\beta \geq 0$, and compare their values to the extreme cases $\beta = 0$ and $\beta \rightarrow \infty$, which correspond to the uniform spanning tree (UST) and the minimum spanning tree (MST), respectively. The results concerning the diameter are in line with those of arXiv:2311.01808 and arXiv:2410.16830, while the findings on local observables are based on arXiv:2410.16836. This thesis also includes new material on the RSTRE in the Euclidean infinite lattice, as well as a novel result on the diameter of the unweighted UST on a slightly supercritical random graph.</description>

      <title>First-passage time for PDifMPs: an Exact simulation approach for time-varying thresholds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07822v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Piecewise Diffusion Markov Processes (PDifMPs) are valuable for modelling systems where continuous dynamics are interrupted by sudden shifts and/or changes in drift and diffusion. The first-passage time (FPT) in such models plays a central role in understanding when a process first reaches a critical boundary. In many systems, time-dependent thresholds provide a flexible framework for reflecting evolving conditions, making them essential for realistic modelling. We propose a hybrid exact simulation scheme for computing the FPT of PDifMPs to time-dependent thresholds. Exact methods traditionally exist for pure diffusions, using Brownian motion as an auxiliary process and accepting sampled paths with a probability weight. Between jumps, the PDifMP evolves as a diffusion, allowing us to apply the exact method within each inter-jump interval. The main challenge arises when no threshold crossing is detected in an interval: We then need the value of the process at the jump time, and for that, we introduce an approach to simulate a conditionally constrained auxiliary process and derive the corresponding acceptance probability. Furthermore, we prove the convergence of the method and illustrate it using numerical examples.</description>

      <title>Constrained quantization for discrete distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Constrained quantization for a Borel probability measure refers to the process of approximating a given probability distribution by a discrete probability measure supported on a finite number of points that lie within a specified set, known as the constraint. This paper investigates constrained quantization for several types of discrete probability distributions under two different constraints. The study begins with an analysis of two discrete distributions, one uniform and one nonuniform, defined over a finite support. For each distribution, the constrained optimal sets of representative points and the corresponding constrained quantization errors are computed under both constraints. The analysis is then extended to an infinite discrete distribution supported on the reciprocals of the natural numbers. For this infinite case, and under two different constraints, the paper determines all possible constrained optimal sets of $n$-points and the associated $n$th constrained quantization errors for all $1 \leq n \leq 2000$. The problem of constrained quantization for $n &gt; 2000$ in this infinite setting remains open.</description>

      <title>Master equations for continuous-time random walks with stochastic resetting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07590v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a general continuous-time random walk (CTRW), by including non-Markovian cases and L\'evy flights, under complete stochastic resetting to the initial position with an arbitrary law, which can be power-lawed as well as Poissonian. We provide three linked results. First, we show that the random walk under stochastic resetting is a CTRW with the same jump-size distribution of the non-reset original CTRW but different counting process. Later, we derive the condition for a CTRW with stochastic resetting to be a meaningful displacement process at large elapsed times, i.e., the probability to jump to any site is higher than the probability to be reset to the initial position, and we call this condition the zero-law for stochastic resetting. This law joins with the other two laws for reset random walks concerning the existence and the non-existence of a non-equilibrium stationary state. Finally, we derive master equations for CTRWs when the resetting law is a completely monotone function.</description>

      <title>Towards conservative inference in credal networks using belief functions: the case of credal chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07619v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper explores belief inference in credal networks using Dempster-Shafer theory. By building on previous work, we propose a novel framework for propagating uncertainty through a subclass of credal networks, namely chains. The proposed approach efficiently yields conservative intervals through belief and plausibility functions, combining computational speed with robust uncertainty representation. Key contributions include formalizing belief-based inference methods and comparing belief-based inference against classical sensitivity analysis. Numerical results highlight the advantages and limitations of applying belief inference within this framework, providing insights into its practical utility for chains and for credal networks in general.</description>

      <title>The Strong Law of Large Numbers for random semigroups on uniformly smooth Banach spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07658v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider random linear continuous operators $\Omega \to \mathcal{L}(X, X)$ on a Banach space $X$. For example, such random operators may be random quantum channels. The Law of Large Numbers is known when $X$ is a Hilbert space, in the form of the usual Law of Large Numbers for random operators, and in some other particular cases. Instead of the sum of i.i.d. variables, there may be considered the composition of random semigroups $e^{A_it/n}$. We obtain the Strong Law of Large Numbers in Strong Operator Topology for random semigroups on a uniformly smooth Banach space. We also develop another approach giving the SLLN in Weak Operator Topology for all Banach spaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.07859v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given an infinite connected graph, a way to randomly perturb its metric is to assign random i.i.d. lengths to the edges of the graph. Assume that the graph is infinite and of bounded degree. Assume also strict positivity and finite expectation of the edge length distribution and existence of a sublinearly Morse bi-infinite geodesic line, we prove that almost surely there exists a bi-infinite geodesic line. This generalizes a previous result of \cite{BT17} regarding Morse geodesics.</description>

      <title>The maximum proportion of spreaders in stochastic rumor models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07914v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We examine a general stochastic rumor model characterized by specific parameters that govern the interaction rates among individuals. Our model includes the \((\alpha, p)\)-probability variants of the well-known Daley--Kendall and Maki--Thompson models. In these variants, a spreader involved in an interaction attempts to transmit the rumor with probability \(p\); if successful, any spreader encountering an individual already informed of the rumor has probability \(\alpha\) of becoming a stifler. We prove that the maximum proportion of spreaders throughout the process converges almost surely, as the population size approaches~\(\infty\). For both the classical Daley--Kendall and Maki--Thompson models, the asymptotic proportion of the rumor peak is \(1 - \log 2 \approx 0.3069\).</description>

      <title>Conditioned local limit theorems for products of positive random matrices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.07565v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $(g_{n})_{n\geq 1}$ be a sequence of independent and identically distributed positive random $d\times d$ matrices, where $d\geq 2$ is an integer. For any starting point $x \in \mathbb{R}_+^d$ with $|x| = 1$ and $y \in \mathbb R$, we define the exit time $\tau_{x, y} = \inf \{ k \geq 1: y + \log |g_k \cdots g_1 x| &lt; 0 \}$. In this paper, we investigate the conditioned local probability $\mathbb{P} (y + \log |g_n \cdots g_1 x| \in z + [0, \Delta], \tau_{x, y} &gt; n)$ under various assumptions on $y$, $z$ and $\Delta$. For the case where $z = O(\sqrt{n})$, we establish an exact asymptotic result as $n \to \infty$, uniformly in $y$ and $\Delta$, which extends the classical Caravenna conditioned local limit theorem to the case of products of positive random matrices. Our proof does not rely on the reversibility techniques. Furthermore, for arbitrary $z \in \mathbb R_+$, we deduce a uniform upper bound with rate $n^{-3/2}$.</description>

      <title>On the monotonicity of discrete entropy for log-concave random vectors on $\mathbb{Z}^d$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.15462v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove the following type of discrete entropy monotonicity for sums of isotropic, log-concave, independent and identically distributed random vectors $X_1,\dots,X_{n+1}$ on $\mathbb{Z}^d$: $$ H(X_1+\cdots+X_{n+1}) \geq H(X_1+\cdots+X_{n}) + \frac{d}{2}\log{\Bigl(\frac{n+1}{n}\Bigr)} +o(1), $$ where $o(1)$ vanishes as $H(X_1) \to \infty$. Moreover, for the $o(1)$-term, we obtain a rate of convergence $ O\Bigl({H(X_1)}{e^{-\frac{1}{d}H(X_1)}}\Bigr)$, where the implied constants depend on $d$ and $n$. This generalizes to $\mathbb{Z}^d$ the one-dimensional result of the second named author (2023). As in dimension one, our strategy is to establish that the discrete entropy $H(X_1+\cdots+X_{n})$ is close to the differential (continuous) entropy $h(X_1+U_1+\cdots+X_{n}+U_{n})$, where $U_1,\dots, U_n$ are independent and identically distributed uniform random vectors on $[0,1]^d$ and to apply the theorem of Artstein, Ball, Barthe and Naor (2004) on the monotonicity of differential entropy. In fact, we show this result under more general assumptions than log-concavity, which are preserved up to constants under convolution. In order to show that log-concave distributions satisfy our assumptions in dimension $d\ge2$, more involved tools from convex geometry are needed because a suitable position is required. We show that, for a log-concave function on $\mathbb{R}^d$ in isotropic position, its integral, barycenter and covariance matrix are close to their discrete counterparts. Moreover, in the log-concave case, we weaken the isotropicity assumption to what we call almost isotropicity. One of our technical tools is a discrete analogue to the upper bound on the isotropic constant of a log-concave function, which extends to dimensions $d\ge1$ a result of Bobkov, Marsiglietti and Melbourne (2022).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.17900v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a simple construction of the Anderson Hamiltonian with white noise potential on $\mathbf{R}^2$ and $\mathbf{R}^3$ based on the solution theory of the parabolic Anderson model. It relies on a theorem of Klein and Landau [KL81] that associates a unique self-adjoint generator to a symmetric semigroup satisfying some mild assumptions. Then, we show that almost surely the spectrum of this random Schr\"odinger operator is $\mathbf{R}$. To prove this result, we extend the method of Kotani [Kot85] to our setting of singular random operators.</description>

      <title>Cumulants and Limit Theorems for $q$-step walks on random graphs of long-range percolation radius model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11667v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study cumulants of numbers of $q$-step walks on Erd\"os-R\'enyi-type random graphs of long-range percolation radius model in the limit when the number of vertices $N$, concentration $c$, and the interaction radius $R$ tend to infinity. These cumulants can be associated with a formal cumulant expansion of the free energy of matrix models of exponential random graphs widely known in mathematical and theoretical physics.
  We show that in three different asymptotic regimes, the limiting values of $k$-th cumulants ${\cal F}_k^{(q)}$ exist and can be associated with one or another family of tree-type diagrams, in dependence of the asymptotic behavior of parameters $cR/N$ for $q$-step non-closed walks and $c^2R/N^2$ for 3-step closed walks, respectively. In certain cases, we obtain ${\cal F}_k^{(q)}$ in explicit form.
  These results allow us to prove Limit Theorems for the number of non-closed walks and for the number of triangles in corresponding ensembles of large random graphs. As a consequence, we indicate an asymptotic regime when in random graphs that we consider, the average vertex degree remains bounded while the total number of triangles infinitely increases, thus rigorously solving a graph collapse problem known in applications.</description>

      <title>On Marginal Stability in Low Temperature Spherical Spin Glasses</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.15728v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show marginal stability of near-ground states in spherical spin glasses is equivalent to full replica symmetry breaking at zero temperature near overlap $1$. This connection has long been implicit in the physics literature, which also links marginal stability to the performance of efficient algorithms. For even models, we prove the Hessian has no outlier eigenvalues, and obtain geometric consequences for low temperature Gibbs measures in the case that marginal stability is absent. Our proofs rely on interpolation bounds for vector spin glass models. For generic models, we give another more conceptual argument that full RSB near overlap $1$ implies marginal stability at low temperature.</description>

      <title>Strong regularization by noise for a class of kinetic SDEs driven by symmetric {\alpha}-stable processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13432v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish strong well-posedness for a class of degenerate SDEs of kinetic type with autonomous diffusion driven by a symmetric $\alpha$-stable process under H\"older regularity conditions for the drift term. We partially recover the thresholds for the H\"older regularity that are optimal for weak uniqueness. In general dimension, we only consider $\alpha = 2$ and need an additional integrability assumption for the gradient of the drift: this condition is satisfied by Peano-type functions. In the one-dimensional case we do not need any additional assumption. In the multi-dimensional case, the proof is based on a first-order Zvonkin transform/PDE, while for the one-dimensional case we use a second-order Zvonkin/PDE transform together with a Watanabe-Yamada technique.</description>

      <title>New chaos decomposition of Gaussian nodal volumes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22350v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the random variable defined by the volume of the zero set of a smooth Gaussian field, on a general Riemannian manifold possibly with boundary, a fundamental object in probability and geometry. We prove a new explicit formula for its Wiener-It\^o chaos decomposition that is notably simpler than existing alternatives and which holds in greater generality, without requiring the field to be compatible with the geometry of the manifold. A key advantage of our formulation is a significant reduction in the complexity of computing the variance of the nodal volume. Unlike the standard Hermite expansion, which requires evaluating the expectation of products of $2+2n$ Hermite polynomials, our approach reduces this task--in any dimension $n$--to computing the expectation of a product of just four Hermite polynomials. As a consequence, we establish a new exact formula for the variance, together with lower and upper bounds. Importantly, in contrast to previous results, our approach applies to highly non-isotropic situations, allowing the study of Riemannian random waves on arbitrary manifolds. By introducing two parameters associated to any Gaussian field: the frequency and the eccentricity, we quantify the deviation from the standard settings (e.g., spheres) and establish a quantitative version of Berry's cancellation phenomenon valid on all manifolds.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2105.14807v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We carry out an in-depth study of Martin compactifications of affine buildings, from the viewpoint of potential theory and random walks. This work does not use any group action on buildings, although all the results are also stated within the framework of the Bruhat--Tits theory of semisimple groups over non-Archimedean local fields. This choice should allow the use of these building compactifications in intriguing geometric group theory situations, where only lattice actions are available. The resulting compactified spaces use and, at the same time, make it possible to understand geometrically the descriptions of asymptotic behavior of kernels resulting from the non-Archimedean harmonic analysis on affine buildings. Along the paper, we make explicit the most substantial differences with the case of symmetric spaces, namely absence of a group action but existence of precise asymptotics of Green kernels and, of course, no possibility to stand by standard techniques from PDEs.</description>

      <title>Spectral Estimators for Structured Generalized Linear Models via Approximate Message Passing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.14507v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of parameter estimation in a high-dimensional generalized linear model. Spectral methods obtained via the principal eigenvector of a suitable data-dependent matrix provide a simple yet surprisingly effective solution. However, despite their wide use, a rigorous performance characterization, as well as a principled way to preprocess the data, are available only for unstructured (i.i.d.\ Gaussian and Haar orthogonal) designs. In contrast, real-world data matrices are highly structured and exhibit non-trivial correlations. To address the problem, we consider correlated Gaussian designs capturing the anisotropic nature of the features via a covariance matrix $\Sigma$. Our main result is a precise asymptotic characterization of the performance of spectral estimators. This allows us to identify the optimal preprocessing that minimizes the number of samples needed for parameter estimation. Surprisingly, such preprocessing is universal across a broad set of designs, which partly addresses a conjecture on optimal spectral estimators for rotationally invariant models. Our principled approach vastly improves upon previous heuristic methods, including for designs common in computational imaging and genetics. The proposed methodology, based on approximate message passing, is broadly applicable and opens the way to the precise characterization of spiked matrices and of the corresponding spectral methods in a variety of settings.</description>

      <title>Multiplicative chaos measure for multiplicative functions: the $L^1$-regime</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.10555v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\alpha$ be a Steinhaus random multiplicative function. For a wide class of multiplicative functions $f$ we construct a multiplicative chaos measure arising from the Dirichlet series of $\alpha f$, in the whole $L^1$-regime. Our method does not rely on the thick point approach or Gaussian approximation, and uses a modified second moment method with the help of an approximate Girsanov theorem. We also employ the idea of weak convergence in $L^r$ to show that the limiting measure is independent of the choice of the approximation schemes, and this may be seen as a non-Gaussian analogue of Shamov's characterisation of multiplicative chaos.
  Our class of $f$-s consists of those for which the mean value of $|f(p)|^2$ lies in $(0,1)$. In particular, it includes the indicator of sums of two squares. As an application of our construction, we establish a generalised central limit theorem for the (normalised) sums of $\alpha f$, with random variance determined by the total mass of our measure.</description>

Each inverse generator also fulfills the necessary conditions as regards the boundary conditions, marginal uniformity, and 2-increasing properties. Although these copulas satisfy these conditions, they have some limitations. They do not cover the entire dependency spectrum, ranging from perfect negative dependency to perfect positive dependency, passing through the independence state</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.15131v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the infinite-time mean field games with discounting, establishing an equilibrium where individual optimal strategies collectively regenerate the mean-field distribution. To solve this problem, we partition all agents into a representative player and the social equilibrium. When the optimal strategy of the representative player shares the same feedback form with the strategy of the social equilibrium, we say the system achieves a Nash equilibrium.
  We construct a Nash equilibrium using the stochastic maximum principle and infinite-time forward-backward stochastic differential equations. By employing the elliptic master equations, a class of distribution-dependent elliptic PDEs , we provide a representation for the Nash equilibrium. And we prove that the solutions to a system of infinite-time forward-backward stochastic differential equations can be employed to construct viscosity solutions for a class of distribution-dependent elliptic PDEs.</description>

      <title>Gaussian approximation for non-linearity parameter estimation in perturbed random fields on the sphere</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.05074v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The nonlinear parameter measures the amplitude of primordial non-Gaussianity in the cosmic microwave background radiation (CMB), offering a crucial test of early universe models. While standard single field inflation predicts nearly Gaussian fluctuations, more complex scenarios yield subtle non Gaussian signals, particularly captured by the CMB bispectrum. In the local model, these signals arise through a quadratic correction to a Gaussian field. To estimate the nonlinear parameter, we adopt a Komatsu Spergel Wandelt (KSW) type estimator, based on spherical harmonics and Wigner 3j symbols, and adapted to narrow band configurations that depend on the range of multipoles considered. In this paper, we rigorously study its asymptotic properties by applying fourth-moment theorems from Wiener chaos theory. More in detail, we establish a quantitative central limit theorem for the KSW estimator, with an explicit convergence rate controlled by number of admissible multipoles. Our results establish both theoretical guarantees and practical robustness for high resolution CMB analyses.</description>

Abstract: A celebrated result in convex geometry is Gr\"unbaum's inequality, which quantifies how much volume of a convex body can be cut off by a hyperplane passing through its barycenter. In this work, we establish a series of sharp Gr\"unbaum-type inequalities - with equality characterizations - for probability measures under certain concavity assumptions. Of particular interest is the case of $s$-concave Radon measures. For such measures, we provide a simpler proof of known results and, more importantly, obtain the previously missing equality characterization. This is achieved by gaining new insight into the equality case of their Brunn-Minkowski-type inequality.
  Moreover, we show that these ``$s$-Gr\"unbaum'' inequalities can hold only when $s &gt; -1$. However, for convex measures on the real line, we prove Gr\"unbaum-type inequalities involving their cumulative distribution function. Finally, by applying the renowned Ehrhard inequality, we deduce an ``Ehrhard-Gr\"unbaum'' inequality for the Gaussian measure on $\mathbb{R}^n$, which improves upon the bound derived from its log-concavity.</description>
