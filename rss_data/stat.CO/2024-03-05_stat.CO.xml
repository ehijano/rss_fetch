      <title>Automated Efficient Estimation using Monte Carlo Efficient Influence Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00158v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many practical problems involve estimating low dimensional statistical quantities with high-dimensional models and datasets. Several approaches address these estimation tasks based on the theory of influence functions, such as debiased/double ML or targeted minimum loss estimation. This paper introduces \textit{Monte Carlo Efficient Influence Functions} (MC-EIF), a fully automated technique for approximating efficient influence functions that integrates seamlessly with existing differentiable probabilistic programming systems. MC-EIF automates efficient statistical estimation for a broad class of models and target functionals that would previously require rigorous custom analysis. We prove that MC-EIF is consistent, and that estimators using MC-EIF achieve optimal $\sqrt{N}$ convergence rates. We show empirically that estimators using MC-EIF are at parity with estimators using analytic EIFs. Finally, we demonstrate a novel capstone example using MC-EIF for optimal portfolio selection.</description>

      <title>On Cyclical MCMC Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cyclical MCMC is a novel MCMC framework recently proposed by Zhang et al. (2019) to address the challenge posed by high-dimensional multimodal posterior distributions like those arising in deep learning. The algorithm works by generating a nonhomogeneous Markov chain that tracks -- cyclically in time -- tempered versions of the target distribution. We show in this work that cyclical MCMC converges to the desired probability distribution in settings where the Markov kernels used are fast mixing, and sufficiently long cycles are employed. However in the far more common settings of slow mixing kernels, the algorithm may fail to produce samples from the desired distribution. In particular, in a simple mixture example with unequal variance, we show by simulation that cyclical MCMC fails to converge to the desired limit. Finally, we show that cyclical MCMC typically estimates well the local shape of the target distribution around each mode, even when we do not have convergence to the target.</description>

      <title>Shrinkage estimators in zero-inflated Bell regression model with application</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00749v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose Stein-type estimators for zero-inflated Bell regression models by incorporating information on model parameters. These estimators combine the advantages of unrestricted and restricted estimators. We derive the asymptotic distributional properties, including bias and mean squared error, for the proposed shrinkage estimators. Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate the superior performance of our shrinkage estimators across various scenarios. Furthermore, we apply the proposed estimators to analyze a real dataset, showcasing their practical utility.</description>

      <title>Population Power Curves in ASCA with Permutation Testing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00429v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we revisit the Power Curves in ANOVA Simultaneous Component Analysis (ASCA) based on permutation testing, and introduce the Population Curves derived from population parameters describing the relative effect among factors and interactions. We distinguish Relative from Absolute Population Curves, where the former represent statistical power in terms of the normalized effect size between structure and noise, and the latter in terms of the sample size. Relative Population Curves are useful to find the optimal ASCA model (e.g., fixed/random factors, crossed/nested relationships, interactions, the test statistic, transformations, etc.) for the analysis of an experimental design at hand. Absolute Population Curves are useful to determine the sample size and the optimal number of levels for each factor during the planning phase on an experiment. We illustrate both types of curves through simulation. We expect Population Curves to become the go-to approach to plan the optimal analysis pipeline and the required sample size in an omics study analyzed with ASCA.</description>

      <title>lpcde: Estimation and Inference for Local Polynomial Conditional Density Estimators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.10375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.10375v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper discusses the R package lpcde, which stands for local polynomial conditional density estimation. It implements the kernel-based local polynomial smoothing methods introduced in Cattaneo, Chandak, Jansson, Ma (2024( for statistical estimation and inference of conditional distributions, densities, and derivatives thereof. The package offers mean square error optimal bandwidth selection and associated point estimators, as well as uncertainty quantification based on robust bias correction both pointwise (e.g., confidence intervals) and uniformly (e.g., confidence bands) over evaluation points. The methods implemented are boundary adaptive whenever the data is compactly supported. The package also implements regularized conditional density estimation methods, ensuring the resulting density estimate is non-negative and integrates to one. We contrast the functionalities of lpcde with existing R packages for conditional density estimation, and showcase its main features using simulated data.</description>

      <title>CR-Lasso: Robust cellwise regularized sparse regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.05234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.05234v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cellwise contamination remains a challenging problem for data scientists, particularly in research fields that require the selection of sparse features. Traditional robust methods may not be feasible nor efficient in dealing with such contaminated datasets. We propose CR-Lasso, a robust Lasso-type cellwise regularization procedure that performs feature selection in the presence of cellwise outliers by minimising a regression loss and cell deviation measure simultaneously. To evaluate the approach, we conduct empirical studies comparing its selection and prediction performance with several sparse regression methods. We show that CR-Lasso is competitive under the settings considered. We illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method on real data through an analysis of a bone mineral density dataset.</description>

      <title>Simulation-based stacking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.17009v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Simulation-based inference has been popular for amortized Bayesian computation. It is typical to have more than one posterior approximation, from different inference algorithms, different architectures, or simply the randomness of initialization and stochastic gradients. With a consistency guarantee, we present a general posterior stacking framework to make use of all available approximations. Our stacking method is able to combine densities, simulation draws, confidence intervals, and moments, and address the overall precision, calibration, coverage, and bias of the posterior approximation at the same time. We illustrate our method on several benchmark simulations and a challenging cosmological inference task.</description>
