      <title>Anticorrelated stereodynamics of scattering and sticking of H2 molecules colliding with a reactive surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When hydrogen molecules collide with a surface, they can either scatter away from the surface or stick to the surface through a dissociation reaction which leaves two H atoms adsorbed on the surface. The relative probabilities of these two potential outcomes can depend on the rotational orientation of the impinging molecules, however, direct measurements of this dependence were not available due to the difficulty of controlling the rotational orientation of ground state H2 molecules. Here, we use magnetic manipulation to achieve rotational orientation control of the molecules just before they collide with the surface, and show that molecules approaching the surface in a helicopter orientation have a higher probability to react and dissociate, whereas those which approach in a cartwheel orientation are more likely to scatter.</description>

      <title>Sea Foam contains Hemoglycin from Cosmic Dust</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01043v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In-falling cosmic dust has left evidence of meteoritic polymer amide in stromatolites, both fossil and modern. In search of evidence for continued present day in-fall sea foam was collected from two beaches in Rhode Island and subjected to Folch extraction to concentrate amphiphilic components in a chloroform water-methanol interphase layer. Hemoglycin polymer amide molecules previously characterized by MALDI mass spectrometry in meteorites and stromatolites were identified in sea foam either directly, or via their fragmentation patterns. Residual isotope enrichment pointed to an extra-terrestrial origin. The unique resiliency of sea foam may be due to the formation of extended hemoglycin lattices that stabilize its closed-cell structure and its lightness can potentially be explained by photolytic hydrogen production.</description>

      <title>A semiclassical non-adiabatic phase-space approach to molecular translations and rotations: A new picture of surface hopping and electronic inertial effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel semiclassical phase-space surface hopping approach that goes beyond the Born-Oppenheimer approximation and all existing surface hopping formalisms. We demonstrate that working with a correct phase-space electronic Hamiltonian can capture electronic inertial effects during pure nuclear translational and rotational motion and completely eliminate (at least to very high order) non-adiabatic transitions between electronic eigenstates. This work opens many new avenues for quantitatively investigating complex phenomena, including angular momentum transfer between chiral phonons and electrons as well as chiral-induced spin selectivity effects.</description>

      <title>Self-replicating fuels via autocatalytic molecular bond fission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01282v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This computational study advances a theoretical framework for practical, electrochemical fuel generation displaying exponential product yields and product formation rates as functions of time. Exponential reaction scaling is simulated through an autocatalytic cycle that emulates the process of DNA replication facilitated by the well-known polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Here, an initial buildup of formate into a two-carbon chain through CO2 carboxylation forms oxalate. A subsequent, two-electron reduction yields glyoxylate, with base-mediated hydrolysis driving C-C bond fission of glyoxylate into two molecules of formate. These products are then recycled back to serve as reactants. This recursive process chemistry displays 2^n stoichiometries with respect to formate growth in the limit of ideal reaction selectivity. Each step of the proposed fuel cycle shows direct analogy to the steps of DNA annealing, nucleotide polymerization and hybridized strand fission that are responsible for the exponential product yields observed in PCR-mediated DNA synthesis. As a consequence of this replication behavior, rapid rates of fuel production are accessible even when the individual rate constants for the cycle's constituent processes are slow. Significant focus is placed on practical routes for realizing each of the three steps comprising this model case of formate replication, particularly the challenge of formate carboxylation and the corresponding energy demands and power constraints of the overall process.</description>

      <title>Atmospheric Pressure Ammonia Synthesis on AuRu Catalysts Enabled by Plasmon-Controlled Hydrogenation and Nitrogen-species Desorption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01300v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ammonia is a key component of fertilizer and a potential clean fuel and hydrogen carrier. The Haber-Bosch process for ammonia synthesis consumes more than half of industrial hydrogen and contributes up to ~3% of global greenhouse gas emissions. Light-driven reactions via surface plasmon resonances offer a less energy-intensive pathway for ammonia production by altering reaction intermediates. Here, we report gold-ruthenium plasmonic bimetallic alloys for ammonia synthesis at room temperature and pressure, driven by visible light. We use colloidal synthesis to create AuRu$_x$ alloys (x=0.1, 0.2, 0.3) and disperse these nanoparticles on MgO supports for gas-phase ammonia synthesis. We observe a ~60 $\mu$mol/g/h reactivity and ~0.12% external quantum efficiency on a AuRu$_0$$_.$$_2$ sample under 100 mW/cm$^2$ visible light. In-situ diffuse reflective infrared Fourier transform spectroscopic measurements show that hydrogenation of nitrogen adsorbates is accelerated under light compared to thermocatalysis. Combining wavelength-dependent reactivity and spectroscopic findings with semi-classical electromagnetic modeling, we show plasmonic bimetallic alloys expedite ammonia synthesis by aiding hydrogenation of adsorbed nitrogen species via plasmon-mediated hot electrons. Quantum mechanical calculations reveal hydrogen-assisted N$_2$ splitting in the excited state is key to activating the reaction under ambient conditions. Therefore, light or H$_2$ alone cannot dissociate N$_2$ -- the key bottleneck to breaking N$_2$'s triple bond. Our findings are consistent with recent hypotheses on how nitrogenase enzymes catalyze ammonia production at mild conditions and provide insights for sustainable photochemical transformations.</description>

      <title>Bending, breaking, and reconnecting of the electrical double layers at heterogeneous electrodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01339v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In electrochemical systems, the structure of electrical double layers (EDLs) near electrode surfaces is crucial for energy conversion and storage functions. While the electrodes in real-world systems are usually heterogeneous, to date the investigation of EDLs is mainly limited to flat model solid surfaces. To bridge this gap, here we image the EDL structure of an ionic liquid-based electrolyte at a heterogeneous graphite electrode using our recently developed electrochemical 3D atomic force microscopy. These interfaces feature the formation of thin, nanoscale adlayer/cluster domains that closely mimic the early-stage solid-electrolyte interphases in many battery systems. We observe multiple discrete layers in the EDL near the flat electrode, which restructures at the heterogeneous interphase sites. Depending on the local size of the interphase clusters, the EDLs exhibit bending, breaking, and/or reconnecting behaviors, likely due to the combined steric and long-range interaction effects. These results shed light on the fundamental structure and reconfiguration mechanism of EDLs at heterogeneous interfaces.</description>

      <title>How `Nonvariational' Are Approximate Coupled Cluster Methods In Practice?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While limited coupled cluster theory is \textit{formally} nonvariational, it is not broadly appreciated whether this is a major issue \textit{in practice}. We carried out a detailed comparison with \textit{de facto} full CI energies for a relatively large and diverse set of molecules. Fully iterative limited CC methods such as CCSDT, CCSDTQ, CCSDTQ5 do represent practical upper bounds to the FCI energy. While quasiperturbative approaches such as CCSD(T) and especially CCSDT(Q) may significantly over-correlate molecules if there is significant static correlation, this is much less of an issue with Lambda approaches such as CCSDT(Q)$\Lambda$.</description>

      <title>Phyllotactic structures in radially growing spatial symmetry breaking systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01596v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phyllotactic patterns, i.e. regular arrangements of leaves or seeds around a plant stem, are fascinating examples of complex structures encountered in Nature. In botany, their symmetries develop when a new primordium periodically grows in the largest gap left between the previous primordium and the apex. Experiments using ferrofluid droplets have also shown that phyllotactic patterns can spontaneously form when identical elements repulsing each other are periodically released at a given distance from an injection center and are advected radially at a constant speed. A central issue in phyllotaxis is to understand whether other self-organized mechanisms can generate such patterns. Here, we show that phyllotactic structures also develop in the large class of spatial symmetry-breaking systems giving spotted patterns with an intrinsic wavelength, in the case of radial growth. We evidence this experimentally on chemical precipitation patterns, and numerically on two different models describing reaction-driven phase transitions and spatial Turing patterns, respectively. A generalized method for the construction of this new family of phyllotactic structures is presented, which paves the way to discover them in large classes of systems ranging from spinodal decomposition, chemical, biological or optical Turing structures, and Liesegang patterns, to name a few.</description>

      <title>Short-time Accuracy and Intra-electron Correlation for Nonadiabatic Quantum-Classical Mapping Approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01640v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonadiabatic quantum-classical mapping approaches have significantly gained in popularity in the past several decades because they have acceptable accuracy while remaining numerically tractable even for large system sizes. In the recent few years, several novel mapping approaches have been developed that display higher accuracy than the traditional Ehrenfest method, linearized semiclassical initial value representation (LSC-IVR), and Poisson bracket mapping equation (PBME) approaches. While various benchmarks have already demonstrated the advantages and limitations of those methods, rigorous theoretical justifications of their short-time accuracy are still demanded. In this article, we systematically examine the intra-electron correlation, as a statistical measure of electronic phase space, which has been first formally proposed for mapping approaches in the context of the generalized discrete truncated Wigner approximation (GDTWA) and which is a key ingredient for the improvement of short-time accuracy of such mapping approaches. We rigorously establish the connection between short-time accuracy and intra-electron correlation for various widely used models. We find that LSC-IVR, PBME, and Ehrenfest methods fail to correctly reproduce the intra-electron correlation. While some of the traceless Meyer--Miller--Stock--Thoss (MMST) approaches, partially linearized density matrix (PLDM) approach, and spin partially linearized density matrix (Spin-PLDM) approach are able to sample the intra-electron correlation correctly, the spin linearized semiclassical (Spin-LSC) approach and the other traceless MMST approaches sample the intra-correlation faithfully only for two-level systems. Our theoretical analysis provides insights into the short-time accuracy of semiclassical methods and presents mathematical justifications for previous numerical benchmarks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.01761v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wavefunction forms based on products of electron pairs are usually constructed as closed-shell singlets, which is insufficient when the molecular state has a nonzero spin or when the chemistry is determined by $d$- or $f-$electrons. A set of two-electron forms are considered as explicit couplings of second-quantized operators to open-shell singlets. Geminal wavefunctions are constructed and their structure is elaborated. Numerical results for small model systems clearly demonstrate improvement over closed-shell singlet pairs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.01219v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: How long threadlike eukaryotic chromosomes fit tidily in the small volume of the nucleus without significant entanglement is just beginning to be understood, thanks to major advances in experimental techniques. Several polymer models, which reproduce contact maps that measure the probabilities that two loci are in spatial contact, have predicted the three-dimensional structures of interphase chromosomes. Data-driven approaches, using contact maps as input, predict that mitotic helical chromosomes are characterized by switch in handedness, referred to as "perversion". By using experimentally derived effective interactions between chromatin loci in simulations, structures of conventional and inverted nuclei have been accurately predicted. Polymer theory and simulations show that the dynamics of individual loci in chromatin exhibit subdiffusive behavior but the diffusion exponents are broadly distributed, which accords well with experiments. Although coarse-grained models are successful, many challenging problems remain, which require the creation of new experimental and computational tools to understand genome biology.</description>

      <title>Constant pH Simulation with FMM Electrostatics in GROMACS. (A) Design and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01626v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The structural dynamics of biological macromolecules, such as proteins, DNA/RNA, or complexes thereof, are strongly influenced by protonation changes of their typically many titratable groups, which explains their sensitivity to pH changes. Conversely, conformational and environmental changes of the biomolecule affect the protonation state of these groups. With few exceptions, conventional force field-based molecular dynamics (MD) simulations do not account for these effects, nor do they allow for coupling to a pH buffer.
  Here we present a GROMACS implementation of a rigorous Hamiltonian interpolation $\lambda$-dynamics constant pH method, which rests on GPU-accelerated Fast Multipole Method (FMM) electrostatics. Our implementation supports both CHARMM36m and Amber99sb*-ILDN force fields and is largely automated to enable seamless switching from regular MD to constant pH MD, involving minimal changes to the input files. Here, the first of two companion papers describes the underlying constant pH protocol and sample applications to several prototypical benchmark systems such as cardiotoxin V, lysozyme, and staphylococcal nuclease. Enhanced convergence is achieved through a new dynamic barrier height optimization method, and high p$K_a$ accuracy is demonstrated. We use Functional Mode Analysis and Mutual Information to explore the complex intra- and intermolecular couplings between the protonation states of titratable groups as well as those between protonation states and conformational dynamics. We identify striking conformation-dependent p$K_a$ variations and unexpected inter-residue couplings. Conformation-protonation coupling is identified as a primary cause of the slow protonation convergence notorious to constant pH simulations involving multiple titratable groups, suggesting enhanced sampling methods to accelerate convergence.</description>

      <title>Ionization energy: sd transfer error and Perdew-Zunger self-interaction correction energy penalty in 3d atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07438v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To accurately describe the energetics of transition metal systems, density functional approximations (DFAs) must provide a balanced description of s- and d- electrons. One measure of this is the sd transfer error, which has previously been defined as $E(\mathrm{3d}^{n-1} \mathrm{4s}^1) -E(\mathrm{3d}^{n-2} \mathrm{4s}^2)$. Theoretical concerns have been raised on the validity of these results owing to the evaluation of excited-state energies using ground-state DFAs. A more serious concern appears to be strong correlations in the $\mathrm{4s}^2$ configuration. Here we define a ground-state measure of the sd transfer error, based on the errors of s- and d-electron second ionization energies of the atoms, that effectively circumvents the aforementioned problems. We find an improved performance as we move from LSDA to PBE to r$^2$SCAN for first-row transition metal atoms. However, we found large (~ 2 eV) ground-state sd transfer errors when applying a Perdew-Zunger self-interaction correction. This is attributed to an "energy penalty" associated with the noded 3d orbitals. A local scaling of the self-interaction correction to LSDA results in a cancellation of s- and d-errors.</description>

      <title>Alchemical harmonic approximation based potential for all iso-electronic diatomics: Foundational baseline for $\Delta$-machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18007v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the alchemical harmonic approximation (AHA) of the absolute electronic energy for charge-neutral iso-electronic diatomics at fixed interatomic distance $d_0$. To account for variations in distance, we combine AHA with this Ansatz for the electronic binding potential, $E(d)=(E_{u}-E_s) \left(\frac{E_c-E_s}{E_u-E_s}\right)^{\sqrt{d/d_0}}+E_s$, where $E_u,E_c,E_s$ correspond to the energies of united atom, calibration at $d_0$, and sum of infinitely separated atoms, respectively. Our model covers the entire two-dimensional electronic potential energy surface spanned by distance and difference in nuclear charge from which only one single point (with elements of nuclear charge $Z_1,Z_2$ and distance $d_0$) is drawn to calibrate $E_c$. Using reference data from pbe0/cc-pVDZ, we present numerical evidence for the electronic ground-state of all neutral diatomics with 8, 10, 12, 14 electrons. We assess the validity of our model by comparison to legacy interatomic potentials (Harmonic oscillator, Lennard-Jones, and Morse) within the most relevant range of binding (0.7 - 2.5 A), and find comparable accuracy if restricted to single diatomics, and significantly better predictive power when extrapolating to the entire iso-electronic series. We also investigated $\Delta$-learning of the electronic absolute energy using our model as baseline. This baseline model results in a systematic improvement, effectively reducing training data needs for reaching chemical accuracy by up to an order of magnitude from $\sim$1000 to $\sim$100. By contrast, using AHA+Morse as a baseline hardly leads to any improvement, and sometimes even deteriorates the predictive power. Inferring the energy of unseen CO converges to a prediction error of $\sim$0.1 Ha in direct learning, and $\sim$0.04 Ha with our baseline.</description>

      <title>Enhancing the ODMR Signal of Organic Molecular Qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19249</link>

Abstract: In the fields of quantum information science and sensing, electron spins are often purified into a specific polarisation through an optical-spin interface, a process known as optically-detected magnetic resonance (ODMR). Diamond-NV centres and transition metals are both excellent platforms for these so-called colour centres, while metal-free molecular analogues are also gaining popularity for their extended polarisation lifetimes, milder environmental impacts, and reduced costs. In our earlier attempt at designing such organic high-spin $\pi$-diradicals, we proposed to spin-polarise by shelving triplet $M_{S}=\pm1$ populations as singlets. This was recently verified by experiments albeit with low ODMR contrasts of &lt;1% at temperatures above 5 K. In this work, we propose to improve the ODMR signal by moving singlet populations back into the triplet $M_{S}=0$ sublevel, designing a true carbon-based molecular analogue to the NV centre. To achieve both spin channels in $\pi$-diradicals, we leverage on weaker spin-orbit couplings beyond the nearest-neighbour approximation, made possible by careful control of orbital nodal structures and group-theoretical considerations. These analyses are further confirmed by ab initio calculations of a realistic trityl-based radical dimer. Microkinetic analyses point towards high ODMR contrasts of around 30% under experimentally-feasible conditions, a stark improvement from previous works. Finally, in our quest towards ground-state optically-addressable molecular spin qubits, we exemplify how our symmetry-based design avoids Zeeman-induced singlet-triplet mixings during electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) experiments, setting the scene for realising electron spin qubit gates.</description>

      <title>Solving Schr\"{o}dinger Equation Using Tensor Neural Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.12572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.12572v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a novel approach to solve the many-body Schrodinger equation by the tensor neural network. Based on the tensor product structure, we can do the direct numerical integration by using fixed quadrature points for the functions constructed by the tensor neural network within tolerable computational complexity. Especially, we design several types of efficient numerical methods to treat the variable-coupled Coulomb potentials with high accuracy. The corresponding machine learning method is built for solving many-body Schrodinger equation. Some numerical examples are provided to validate the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed algorithms.</description>

      <title>Symmetry Breaking in Chemical Systems: Engineering Complexity through Self-Organization and Marangoni Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18006v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Far from equilibrium, chemical and biological systems can form complex patterns and waves through reaction-diffusion coupling. Fluid motion often tends to disrupt these self-organized concentration patterns. In this study, we investigate the influence of Marangoni-driven flows in a thin layer of fluid ascending the outer surfaces of hydrophilic obstacles on the spatio-temporal dynamics of chemical waves in the modified Belousov-Zhabotinsky reaction. Our observations reveal that circular waves originate nearly simultaneously at the obstacles and propagate outward. In a covered setup, where evaporation is minimal, the wavefronts maintain their circular shape. However, in an uncovered setup with significant evaporative cooling, the interplay between surface tension-driven Marangoni flows and gravity destabilizes the wavefronts, creating distinctive flower-like patterns around the obstacles. Our experiments further show that the number of petals formed increases linearly with the obstacle's diameter, though a minimum diameter is required for these instabilities to appear. These findings demonstrate the potential to 'engineer' specific wave patterns, offering a method to control and direct reaction dynamics. This capability is especially important for developing microfluidic devices requiring precise control over chemical wave propagation.</description>

      <title>Viologen-based supramolecular crystal gels: gelation kinetics and sensitivity to temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15552v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Supramolecular crystal gels, a subset of molecular gels, form through self-assembly of low molecular weight gelators into interconnecting crystalline fibers, creating a three-dimensional soft solid network. This study focuses on the formation and properties of viologen-based supramolecular crystalline gels. It aims to answer key questions about the tunability of network properties and the origin of these properties through in-depth analyses of the gelation kinetics triggered by thermal quenching. Experimental investigations, including UV-Vis absorption spectroscopy, rheology, microscopy and scattering measurements, contribute to a comprehensive and self-consistent understanding of the system kinetics. We confirm that the viologen-based gelators crystallize by forming nanometer radius hollow tube that assemble into micro to millimetric spherulites. We then show that the crystallization follows the Avrami theory and is based on pre-existing nuclei. We also establish that the growth is interface controlled leading to the hollow tubes to branch into spherulites with fractal structures. Finally, we demonstrate that the gel properties can be tuned depending on the quenching temperature. Lowering the temperature results in the formation of denser and smaller spherulites. In contrast, the gels elasticity is not significantly affected by the quench temperature, leading us to hypothesize that the spherulites densification occurs at the expense of the connectivity between spherulite.</description>
