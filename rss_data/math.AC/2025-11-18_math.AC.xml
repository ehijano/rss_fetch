      <title>The Regular property of Invariant Rings over a Dedekind Domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12569v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $A$ be a Dedekind domain and let $K$ be its field of fractions. Let $G\subseteq GL_n(A)$ be a finite group. Let $G$ act linearly on $A[X_1,X_2,\dots, X_n]$ (fixing $A$). Assume that $|G|$ is invertible in $A$. We prove that if $G\subseteq GL_n(K)$ is generated by psuedo-reflections then $(A[X_1,X_2,\dots, X_n])^G$ is regular.</description>

      <title>Resurgence number of matroid configuration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12806v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article gives a new upper bound for the resurgence number of symbolic powers of matroidal configuration in the following situations: the height of the matroidal configuration is big, or the height is small, and the corresponding simplicial complex of the matroidal configuration is peaked. The Peaked simplicial complex is a generalization of bipartite graph. Furthermore, the article also gives a clean formula to compute the resurgence number and the strict containment of generalized uniform matroidal configuration which includes case of star configuration of hypersurfaces.</description>

      <title>Improved Bounds for the s-multiplicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12946v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let (RmR), (SmS) and (TmT) be Noetherian local rings sharing the same
  residue eld k and prime characteristic p &gt; 0. We establish some formulas relating the
  h-function and s-multiplicity of the ber product R T S in terms of the h-functions and
  s-multiplicities of R, T and S. Furthermore, we derive formulas that connect the h-function
  and s-multiplicity of the idealization ring R M to the corresponding invariants of R and M,
  where M is a nitely generated R-module. As applications of these results, we derive new
  estimates for the Taylor-Miller question and the Watanabe-Yoshida conjecture concerning
  s-multiplicity.</description>

      <title>Complexity and curvature of pairs of Burch modules and ideals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13258v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The complexity and curvature of a module were first introduced by Avramov to distinguish modules of infinite homological dimension. Later, Avramov-Buchweitz extended the notion of complexity from a single module to that of pairs of modules, which measures the polynomial growth rate of the minimal number of generators of their Ext modules. Dao studied a similar notion of Tor-complexity. Recently, Dey-Ghosh-Saha initiated the study of Ext and Tor curvature of a pair of modules, which measure the exponential growth rates of the corresponding Ext and Tor, respectively. On the other hand, the concept of Burch ideals was introduced by Dao-Kobayashi-Takahashi, motivated by classical work of Burch. This class includes several large and well-studied families of ideals in a Noetherian local ring $(R,\mathfrak{m},k)$. For example, every nonzero ideal of the form $\mathfrak{a}\mathfrak{m}$ (e.g., $\mathfrak{m}^n$ for $n\ge 1$), and under mild conditions every integrally closed ideal $I$ with $\mathrm{depth}(R/I)=0$, is a Burch ideal. Suppose $I$ and $J$ are Burch ideals such that $I$ is $\mathfrak{m}$-primary. One of the main results of this article is $\mathrm{cx}_R(I,J)=\mathrm{tcx}_R(I,J)=\mathrm{cx}_R(k)$. Moreover, we show that $R$ is complete intersection if and only if $\mathrm{cx}_R(I,J)$ or $\mathrm{tcx}_R(I,J)$ is finite if and only if $\mathrm{curv}_R(I,J)$ or $\mathrm{tcurv}_R(I,J)$ is at most $1$. We deduce these results from the corresponding more general results on Burch modules (in the sense of Dey-Kobayashi).</description>

      <title>Homological shifts of a complementary edge ideal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13267v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The homological shift algebra and the projective dimension function of complementary edge ideals are investigated. Let $G$ be a connected graph, and let $I$ be its complementary edge ideal. For bipartite graphs $G$, we show that the projective dimension of $I^s$ increases strictly with $s$ until reaching its maximum value. For trees and cycles, explicit expressions for the projective dimension of $I^s$ are provided, along with detailed descriptions of their homological shift algebras. In particular, it is shown that the $i$-th homological shift algebra of such ideals is generated in degree at most $i$. Additionally, we prove that if $G$ is a tree, then the homological shift ideal $\mathrm{HS}_i(I^i)$, when divided by a suitable monomial, becomes a Veronese-type ideal, and every Veronese-type ideal arises in this manner.</description>

      <title>$t$-Young complexes and squarefree powers of $t$-path ideals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a new class of simplicial complexes, called \emph{$t$-Young complexes}, arising from a Young diagram and a positive integer~$t$. We show that every $t$-Young complex is either contractible or homotopy equivalent to a wedge of spheres. A complete characterization of their vertex-decomposability is provided, and in several cases, we establish explicit formulas for their homotopy types. Interestingly, $t$-Young complexes naturally appear as the Alexander dual complexes of squarefree powers of $t$-path ideals of path graphs, as well as of certain ideals generated by subsets of their minimal generators. As an application, we derive formulas for the projective dimension and Krull dimension of these squarefree powers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.11783v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the aid of Hensel Lemma, we refine the 2-adic Newton polygon algorithm proposed by Magron, Koprowski, and Vaccon at ISSAC 2023 to express computationally a given positive univariate polynomial with rational coefficients as a sum of five squares of rational polynomials -the effective Pourchet's Theorem- and extend it to cover almost all the possible inputs. We also provide examples which are covered with our methods but cannot be detected by previous conjectural algorithms.</description>

      <title>Directed Hamiltonicity in Generalized Kneser Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12553v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that the canonical orientation of the generalized Kneser graph $KG(n,k,s)$ contains a directed Hamiltonian cycle for all integers $s \geq 3$ and $n&gt;sk$. Furthermore, we establish that the dichromatic number of this oriented graph is exactly $k$. As a special case, our results apply to the $s$-stable Kneser graphs $K_{s\text{-stab}}(n,k)$, resolving their directed Hamiltonicity and dichromatic number. Our proof adapts the class graph framework of Ledezma and Pastine to the directed setting, leveraging cyclic rotations and friend class adjacencies to construct a single directed cycle spanning all vertices. This work provides a unified and strengthened perspective on the Hamiltonian properties of Kneser-type graphs.</description>

      <title>Quiver semi-invariants and SAGBI bases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.17224v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a new combinatorial structure of linked tableaux, which generalize the semi-standard tableaux that index a SAGBI basis of the Pl\"ucker coordinate ring of a flag variety. We show that linked tableaux index Domokos-Zubkov semi-invariants, which span the semi-invariant ring of a quiver. The semi-invariant ring of a quiver coincides in many cases with the Cox ring of an associated quiver moduli space. We show that these semi-invariants satisfy straightening laws. In the case of the generalized Kronecker quiver, we prove that the semi-invariants associated to semi-standard linked tableaux are a (possibly infinite) SAGBI basis. For the generalized Kronecker quiver with dimension vector (2,2), we show that the SAGBI basis is finite and describe it explicitly.</description>

      <title>Symbolic powers via extension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22581v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article investigates under which conditions the symbolic powers of the extension of an ideal is the same as the extension of the symbolic powers. Our result generalizes the known scenarios. As an application, we prove formulas for the resurgence of sum of two homogeneous ideals in finitely generated k-algebra domains, where k is algebraically closed. Initially, these were known for ideals in polynomial rings.</description>
