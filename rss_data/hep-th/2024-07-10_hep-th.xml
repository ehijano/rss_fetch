      <title>Quantum Gravity as Gravitized Quantum Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06207v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Starting from a new understanding of the vacuum energy problem based on the combination of the phase space regularization and the holographic bound, we argue that quantum gravity should be understood as gravitized quantum theory, that is, quantum theory wherein the geometry and topology of the state-space if fully dynamical, in analogy with the dynamical nature of spacetime in Einstein's general relativity. Apart from the vacuum energy problem viewed as a quantum gravity problem, we discuss the "smoking gun" experiments involving higher order quantum interference, as well as experimental probes of the statistics of spacetime quanta. Finally, we address the conundrum of the intricately patterned spectrum of masses of elementary particles as well as their mixing angles, as another telltale problem of quantum gravity viewed as gravitized quantum theory.</description>

      <title>Cosmological cutting rules for Bogoliubov initial states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06258v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The field theoretic wavefunction in cosmological spacetimes has received much attention as a fundamental object underlying the generation of primordial perturbations in our universe. Assuming an initial Bunch-Davies state, unitary time evolution implies an infinite set of cutting rules for the wavefunction to all orders in perturbation theory, collectively known as the cosmological optical theorem. In this work, we generalise these results to the case of Bogoliubov initial states, accounting for both parity-even and parity-odd interactions. We confirm our findings in a few explicit examples, assuming IR-finite interactions. In these examples, we preserve scale invariance by adiabatically turning on interactions in the infinite past rather than imposing a Bogoliubov state at some finite initial time. Finally, we give a prescription for computing Bogoliubov wavefunction coefficients from the corresponding Bunch-Davies coefficients for both n-point contact and four-point exchange diagrams.</description>

      <title>The light we can see: Extracting black holes from weak Jacobi forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06260v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We quantify how constraints on light states affect the asymptotic growth of heavy states in weak Jacobi forms. The constraints we consider are sparseness conditions on the Fourier coefficients of these forms, which are necessary to interpret them as gravitational path integrals. Using crossing kernels, we extract the leading and subleading behavior of these coefficients and show that the leading Cardy-like growth is robust in a wide regime of validity. On the other hand, we find that subleading corrections are sensitive to the constraints placed on the light states, and we quantify their imprint on the asymptotic growth of states. Our approach is tested against the generating function of symmetric product orbifolds, where we provide new insights into the factors contributing to the asymptotic growth of their Fourier coefficients. Finally, we use our methods to revisit the UV/IR connection that relates black hole microstate counting to modular forms. We provide a microscopic interpretation of the logarithmic corrections to the entropy of BPS black holes in N = 2, 4 ungauged supergravity in four and five dimensions, and tie it to consistency conditions in AdS$_3$/CFT$_2$.</description>

      <title>Thermal False Vacuum Decay Is Not What It Seems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06263v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the decay of a thermally excited metastable vacuum in classical field theory using real-time numerical simulations. We find a lower decay rate than predicted by standard thermal theory. The discrepancy is due to the violation of thermal equilibrium during the critical bubble nucleation. It is reduced by introducing dissipation and noise. We propose a criterion for the system to remain in equilibrium during the nucleation process and show that it is violated in the Hamiltonian evolution of a single field. In the case of many fields, the fulfillment of the criterion is model-dependent.</description>

      <title>Discrete JT gravity as an Ising model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06266v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inspired by the program of discrete holography, we show that Jackiw-Teitelboim (JT) gravity on a hyperbolic tiling of Euclidean AdS$_2$ gives rise to an Ising model on the dual lattice, subject to a topological constraint. The Ising model involves an asymptotic boundary condition with spins pointing opposite to the magnetic field. The topological constraint enforces a single domain wall between the spins of opposite direction, with the topology of a circle. The resolvent of JT gravity is related to the free energy of this Ising model, and the classical limit of JT gravity corresponds to the Ising low-temperature limit. We study this Ising model through a Monte Carlo approach and a mean-field approximation. For finite truncations of the infinite hyperbolic lattice, the map between both theories is only valid in a regime in which the domain wall has a finite size. For the extremal cases of large positive or negative coupling, the domain wall either shrinks to zero or touches the boundary of the lattice. This behavior is confirmed by the mean-field analysis. We expect that our results may be used as a starting point for establishing a holographic matrix model duality for discretized gravity.</description>

      <title>Exploring Confinement in Anti-de Sitter Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06268v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study Yang-Mills theory on four dimensional Anti-de Sitter space. The Dirichlet boundary condition cannot exist at arbitrarily large radius because it would give rise to colored asymptotic states in flat space. As observed in [1] this implies a deconfinement-confinement transition as the radius is increased. We gather hints on the nature of this transition using perturbation theory. We compute the anomalous dimensions of the lightest scalar operators in the boundary theory, which are negative for the singlet and positive for non-trivial representations. We also compute the correction to the coefficient $C_J$ and we estimate that the singlet operator reaches marginality before the value of the coupling at which $C_J=0$. These results favor the scenario of merger and annihilation as the most promising candidate for the transition. For the Neumann boundary condition, the lightest scalar operator is found to have a positive anomalous dimension, in agreement with the idea that this boundary condition extrapolates smoothly to flat space. The perturbative calculations are made possible by a drastic simplification of the gauge field propagator in Fried-Yennie gauge. We also derive a general result for the leading-order anomalous dimension of the displacement operator for a generic perturbation in Anti-de Sitter, showing that it is related to the beta function of bulk couplings.</description>

      <title>D-instanton Induced Effective Action and its Gauge Invariance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06278v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The effect of D-instantons on closed string scattering amplitudes may be encoded into an effective action obtained by integrating out the (transient) open string fields. In order that this respects the gauge invariance of the theory, the sum of the perturbative closed string field theory action and the D-instanton induced effective action must satisfy the quantum Batalin-Vilkovisky master equation. In a previous paper this was proved for the effective action induced by up to two instantons. We generalize the proof for arbitrary number of D-instantons.</description>

      <title>Non-minimal couplings to $U(1)$-gauge fields and asymptotic symmetries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06376v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyse the asymptotic symmetries of electromagnetism non-minimally coupled to scalar fields, with non-minimal couplings of the Fermi type that occur in extended supergravity models. Our study is carried out at spatial infinity where minimal and non-minimal couplings exhibit very different asymptotic properties: while the former generically cannot be neglected at infinity, the latter can. Electromagnetic non-minimal couplings are in that respect similar to gravitational minimal couplings, which are also asymptotically subdominant. Because the non-minimally interacting model is asymptotic to the free one, its asymptotic symmetries are the same as the ones of the free theory, i.e., described by angle-dependent $u(1)$ gauge transformations. We also analyse the duality symmetry and show that it is broken to its compact subgroup by the asymptotic conditions. Finally, we consider logarithmic gauge transformations and use them to simplify the symmetry algebra.</description>

      <title>Origin of effective graviton mass from spontaneous symmetry breaking of scalar field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: General relativity and quantum field theory govern all fundamental physical processes, from nuclear and subatomic scales to the solar system, galactic, and cosmology. Both theories work remarkably well in their tested domains. However, there is minimal overlap between the two domains. Our work demonstrates that the non-overlapping of domains \emph{no longer} holds when non-perturbative effects are considered. We introduce a novel mechanism in which the gravitons acquire \emph{effective mass} due to the spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) of global or local symmetry of complex scalar field minimally coupled to gravity. In the flat space-time limit, we demonstrate that the resulting action for the graviton is identical to the extended Fierz-Pauli (FP) action, corresponding to the mass deformation parameter $\alpha = 1/2$. The extended FP action has 6 Degrees of freedom and no ghost. For local $U(1)$ SSB, we establish that the effective graviton mass is related to the mass of the gauge boson and the electric charge of the complex scalar field. Interestingly, our results indicate that the millicharged dark matter scalar fields, generating dark photons, can produce graviton mass of the same order as the Hubble constant $(H_0)$. Hence, we argue that the dark sector offers a natural explanation for the acceleration of the current Universe.</description>

      <title>New Integrable RG flows with Parafermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06582v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider irrelevant deformations of massless RSOS scattering theories by an infinite number of higher TTbar_{s+1} operators which introduce extra non-trivial CDD factors between left-movers and right-movers. It is shown that the resulting theories can be UV complete after bypassing typical Hagedorn-like singularities if the coefficients of the deformations are fine-tuned. In this way, we have discovered that only two new UV complete QFTs are associated with a M_p (p=3,4,...) minimal CFT based on the integrable structure of the RSOS scattering theory. One is the massless Z_{p-1} parafermionic sinh-Gordon models (PShG) with a self-dual coupling constant. This correspondence is confirmed by showing that the scale-dependent vacuum energies computed by the thermodynamic Bethe ansatz based on the S-matrices match those from the quantization conditions for the PShG models using the reflection amplitudes. The other UV QFT is reached from M_p by following the roaming trajectory of the Z_{p-1} parafermionic minimal series.</description>

Abstract: The Hamiltonian governing the gravitational interaction of N relativistic particles in a four-dimensional anti-de Sitter background is derived to leading order in Newton's constant. The resulting pairwise interactions, combined with the confining nature of motion in anti-de Sitter spacetime, are expected to lead to classical chaos. In the context of the AdS/CFT correspondence, the emergence of a chaotic classical limit on the gravity side has important implications for the dual three-dimensional conformal field theory, including that the spectrum of conformal primary operators at strong coupling should exhibit level repulsion in line with the Wigner surmise.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06900v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The giant graviton expansion of the line defect Schur index in four dimensional $\mathcal N=4$ $U(N)$ SYM was recently proposed in arXiv:2403.11543 to be captured in the dual string theory by counting fluctuations states of two half-infinite fundamental strings in $AdS_{5}\times S^{5}$ ending on the line defect and D3 brane giant. However, agreement with the gauge theory data for the defect line index at finite $N$ required the inclusion of ad hoc extra contributions with unclear origin. We discuss the large $N$ leading order contribution of the giant graviton expansion of the defect line index by a direct analysis of semiclassical string partition function in a twisted background. We discuss supersymmetric boundary conditions in the presence of the D3 brane and evaluate the quadratic fluctuations effective action by introducing a suitable projection of fluctuation modes. We show that the extra contributions to the single giant graviton correction found in arXiv:2403.11543 correspond to a supersymmetric Casimir energy contribution.</description>

      <title>Learning Group Invariant Calabi-Yau Metrics by Fundamental Domain Projections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06914v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present new invariant machine learning models that approximate the Ricci-flat metric on Calabi-Yau (CY) manifolds with discrete symmetries. We accomplish this by combining the $\phi$-model of the cymetric package with non-trainable, $G$-invariant, canonicalization layers that project the $\phi$-model's input data (i.e. points sampled from the CY geometry) to the fundamental domain of a given symmetry group $G$. These $G$-invariant layers are easy to concatenate, provided one compatibility condition is fulfilled, and combine well with spectral $\phi$-models. Through experiments on different CY geometries, we find that, for fixed point sample size and training time, canonicalized models give slightly more accurate metric approximations than the standard $\phi$-model. The method may also be used to compute Ricci-flat metric on smooth CY quotients. We demonstrate this aspect by experiments on a smooth $\mathbb{Z}^2_5$ quotient of a 5-parameter quintic CY manifold.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This chapter is an introduction to the Free Fermionic Formulation of String Theory, with emphasis on heterotic model building. After a brief review of bosonization in two dimensional conformal field theories, we discuss how internal bosonic string coordinates can be consistently replaced by free fermionic degrees of freedom. In this framework, worldsheet supersymmetry may be realized entirely among free fermions. Embedding this construction into string theory leads to a number of constraints arising from modular invariance at one and higher genera. The solution of these constraints takes the form of a small number of model building rules from which the string spectrum and interactions may be analyzed. We review some of the most well-studied models in the literature and their classification, with emphasis on the symmetric basis. The explicit map of free fermionic models to the orbifold construction is presented in some detail.</description>

      <title>Fuzzy Gravity: Four-Dimensional Gravity on a Covariant Noncommutative Space and Unification with Internal Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present work we present an extended description of the covariant noncommutative space, which accommodates the Fuzzy Gravity model constructed previously. It is based on the historical lesson that the use of larger algebras containing all generators of the isometry of the continuous one helped in formulating a fuzzy covariant noncommutative space. Specifically a further enlargement of the isometry group leads us, in addition to the construction of the covariant noncommutative space, also to the suggestion of the group that should be gauged on such a space in order to construct a Fuzzy Gravity theory. As a result, we obtain two Fuzzy Gravity models, one in de Sitter and one in anti-de Sitter space, depending on the extension of the isometry group, and we discuss their spontaneous symmetry breaking leading to fuzzy versions of the noncommutative $SO(1,3)$ gravity. In addition we discuss for the first time how to introduce fermions in the fuzzy gravity and even more importantly how to unify the constructed noncommutative-fuzzy gravity with internal interactions based on $SO(10)$ or $SU(5)$ as grand unified theories.</description>

      <title>Non-Standard Interactions of Supernova Neutrinos and Mass Ordering Ambiguity at DUNE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06251v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that non-standard neutrino interactions (NSI) can notably modify the pattern of resonant flavor conversion of neutrinos within supernovae and significantly impact the neutronization burst signal in forthcoming experiments such as the Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE). The presence of NSI can invert the energy levels of neutrino matter eigenstates and even induce a new resonance in the inner parts close to the proto-neutron star. We demonstrate how DUNE can use these new configurations of energy levels to have sensitivity to NSIs down to $\mathcal{O}(0.1)$. We also elucidate how the effect may result in a puzzling confusion of normal and inverted mass orderings by highlighting the emergence or vanishing of the neutronization peak, which distinguishes between the two mass orderings. Potential implications are analyzed thoroughly.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous CP Breaking in a QCD-like Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06252v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We examine the phase structure of a QCD-like theory at $\bar\theta =\pi$ obtained from supersymmetric $SU(N)$ QCD perturbed by a small amount of supersymmetry breaking via anomaly mediation (AMSB QCD). The spectrum of this theory matches that of QCD at the massless level, though the superpartners are not decoupled. In this theory it is possible to nail down the phase structure at $\bar\theta=\pi$ as a function of the quark masses and the number of flavors $F$. For one flavor we find that there is a critical quark mass, below which CP is unbroken, while above the critical mass CP is spontaneously broken. At the critical mass there is a second-order phase transition along with a massless $\eta'$. We are able to analytically solve for the minima and the critical mass for $N=2,3$ as well as for the large $N$ limit, while for other $N$ one can find numerical results. For two flavors, we find that CP is always broken as long as the quark masses are equal and non-zero, however there is a non-trivial phase boundary for unequal quark masses, which we find numerically. For $F\geq 3$ we obtain an intricate phase boundary which reproduces the various quark mass limits. All our results are in agreement with the predictions for ordinary QCD that were based on anomaly matching arguments for generalized symmetries and the effective chiral Lagrangian. We also briefly comment on the domain wall solutions first discussed by Draper, and are able to present analytic results for the simplest case of $SU(2)$ with one flavor.</description>

      <title>Four no-go theorems on the existence of spin and orbital angular momentum of massless bosons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06276v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Over the past thirty years there has been an ever-increasing interest in the so-called orbital angular momentum (OAM) of light, driven in large part by its diverse range of applications, from new imaging techniques to optical tweezers. However, there are fundamental theoretical issues with splitting the photon angular momentum operator into spin (SAM) and orbital angular momentum parts. While such an SAM-OAM splitting is simple and unambiguous for massive particles, there are many different proposed splittings for massless photons and no consensus about which is correct. Moreover, it has been explicitly shown that most of the proposed SAM and OAM operators do not satisfy the defining commutation relations of angular momentum operators and are thus not legitimate splittings. Here we prove that it is generally impossible to split the total angular momentum operator of massless bosons, like photons and gravitons, into spin and orbital parts. We show that the obstruction to such a splitting can be understood as both geometric and topological. We prove two additional no-go theorems which generalize this result, in particular showing that there are no SAM-OAM splittings even if (1) the SAM operator is allowed to represent non-internal symmetries or (2) if one allows the SAM and OAM operators to generate non-$\mathrm{SO}(3)$ symmetries. We show how gauge redundant descriptions of massless particles can suggest SAM-OAM splittings which are invalid once gauge-invariance is imposed.</description>

      <title>Net-Proton Number Cumulants in Strongly and Weakly Coupled QGP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06327v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide a unified description of the QCD phase diagram across different energy regimes. Without any adjustable free parameters fitted to lattice or experimental data, we demonstrate that the net-proton number cumulant ratios from the Beam Energy Scan-I (BES-I) central ($0-5\%$) Au+Au collision experiments at RHIC, for center-of-mass energies $\sqrt{s} \geq 39\,\text{GeV}$, are well described by the \textit{dynamical soft-wall} AdS black hole model, indicating the formation of a strongly coupled quark-gluon plasma (sQGP). We identify a critical point at \(\mu_B = 247\,\text{MeV}\) or \(\sqrt{s}=16\,\text{GeV}\) in this model, where net-proton cumulant ratios show non-monotonic variation. However, for $\sqrt{s} &lt; 39\,\text{GeV}$, the recent BES-II data does not exhibit the expected variation due to the critical point, suggesting instead a transition to a nearly-cold ($\mu_B \gg T$) weakly coupled QGP (wQGP) for $\sqrt{s} &lt; 7.7\,\text{GeV}$. This prediction can be tested by the upcoming STAR Fixed-Target experimental data.</description>

      <title>Higher-Dimensional MOG dark compact object: shadow behavior in the light of EHT observations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06393v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Consideration of extra spatial dimensions is motivated by the unification of gravity with other interactions, the achievement of the ultimate framework of quantum gravity, and fundamental problems in particle physics and cosmology. Much attention has been focused on the effect of these extra dimensions on the modified theories of gravity. Analytically examining astrophysical phenomena like black hole shadows is one approach to understand how extra dimensions would affect the modified gravitational theories. The purpose of this study is to derive a higher dimensional metric for a dark compact object in STVG theory and then examine the behavior of the shadow shapes for this solution in STVG theory in higher dimensions. We apply the Carter method to formulate the geodesic equations and the Hamilton Jacobi method to find photon orbits around this higher dimensional MOG dark compact object. We investigate the effects of extra dimensions and the STVG parameter alpha on the black hole shadow size. Next, we compare the shadow radius of this higher dimensional MOG dark compact object to the shadow size of the supermassive black hole M87, which has been realized by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) collaborations, in order to restrict these parameters. We find that extra dimensions in the STVG theory typically lead to a reduction in the shadow size of the higher dimensional MOG dark compact object, whereas the effect of parameter alpha on this black hole shadow is suppressible. Remarkably, given the constraints from EHT observations, we find that the shadow size of the four dimensional MOG dark compact object lies in the confidence levels of the EHT data. Finally, we investigate the issue of acceleration bounds in higher dimensional MOG dark compact object in confrontation with EHT data of M87.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06427v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the explicit breaking of a $SU(2)$ symmetry to a $U(1)$ subgroup employing the entanglement asymmetry, a recently introduced observable that measures how much symmetries are broken in a part of extended quantum systems. We consider as specific model the critical XXZ spin chain, which breaks the $SU(2)$ symmetry of spin rotations except at the isotropic point, and is described by the massless compact boson in the continuum limit. We examine the $U(1)$ subgroup of $SU(2)$ that is broken outside the isotropic point by applying conformal perturbation theory, which we complement with numerical simulations on the lattice. We also analyse the entanglement asymmetry of the full $SU(2)$ group. By relying on very generic scaling arguments, we derive an asymptotic expression for it.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic and two-photon transition form factors of the pseudoscalar mesons: An algebraic model computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06461v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compute electromagnetic and two-photon transition form factors of ground-state pseudoscalar mesons: $\pi,\,K,\,\eta_c,\,\eta_b$. To this end, we employ an algebraic model based upon the coupled formalism of Schwinger-Dyson and Bethe-Salpeter equations. Within this approach, the dressed quark propagator and the relevant Bethe-Salpeter amplitude encode the internal structure of the corresponding meson. Electromagnetic properties of the meson are probed via the quark-photon interaction. The algebraic model employed by us unifies the treatment of all ground-state pseudoscalar mesons. Its parameters are carefully fitted performing a global analysis of existing experimental data including the knowledge of the charge radii of the mesons studied. We then compute and predict electromagnetic and two-photon transition form factors for a wide range of probing photon momentum-squared which is of direct relevance to the experimental observations carried out thus far or planned at different hadron physics facilities such as the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility (JLab) and the forthcoming Electron-Ion Collider. We also present comparisons with other theoretical models and approaches and lattice quantum chromodynamics.</description>

      <title>Disordered Lattice Glass $\phi^{4}$ Quantum Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06569v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study numerically the three-dimensional $\phi^{4}$ spin glass, a prototypical disordered and discretized Euclidean field theory that manifests inhomogeneities in space and time but considers a homogeneous squared mass and lambda terms. The $\phi^{4}$ lattice glass field theory is a conceptual generalization of spin glasses to continuous degrees of freedom and we discuss the existence of a limit under which it formally reduces to the Edwards-Anderson model. By defining four variants of an order parameter which are suitable for continuous spin glasses, we verify numerically the emergence of an overlap in absence of the magnetization thus confirming the presence of a spin glass phase transition for a value of a critical squared mass. We conclude by discussing how the $\phi^{4}$ spin glass can be utilized to address assumptions of complete homogeneity in space or time and how, in parallel to statistical physics, provides a suitable framework to investigate the nonperturbative dynamics of machine learning algorithms from the perspective of disordered lattice and constructive field theory.</description>

      <title>Quantum coherence with generalized wave packets under Lorentz boost</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06599v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we consider a single particle, apin-momentum entangled state and measure the effect of relativistic boost on quantum coherence. The effect of the relativistic boost on single-particle generalized Gaussian wave packets is studied. The coherence of the wave function as measured by the boosted observer is studied as a function of the momentum and the boost parameter. Using various formulations of coherence, it is shown that in general the coherence decays with the increase in momentum of the state, as well as the boost applied to it. A more prominent loss of coherence due to relativistic boost is observed for a single particle electron than that of a neutron. The analysis is carried out with generalized Gaussian wave packet of the form $\sim p^n \exp(-\frac{p^2}{\sigma^2})$. We also obtain a bound on the unknown parameter $n$ appearing in the wave packet. It is found to have a dependence on the mass of the particle and the width of the Gaussian wave packet.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06618v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Finite modular family symmetry can emerge from top-down approaches based on heterotic string theory or Type IIB string theory. We show that, in addition to such approaches, it can also emerge from local F-Theory bottom-up constructions. As a first example of the new approach, we have analysed in detail a concrete F-Theory Fluxed $SU(5)$ Grand Unified Theory (GUT) with modular $S_4$ family symmetry. The model fits the fermion mass and mixing data very well and serves as a demonstration of the bottom-up approach to modular family symmetry in F-Theory fluxed GUTs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06737v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The classical conservation of the lepton number is an accidental symmetry present in the Standard Model (SM). Thus, we consider here a scenario where the SM is extended with a U(1) gauge group, promoting the lepton number to a local symmetry. The gauge anomaly cancellations necessitate the extension of the particle spectrum with several beyond the SM (BSM) particle fields. The extended lepton gauge group breaks around the TeV scale via spontaneous symmetry breaking, and a $Z_2$ symmetry remains, which ensures the stability of the light $Z_2$ odd BSM particles. Interestingly, the particle spectrum of the model has two distinct dark sectors, with one having a Dirac-type DM and the other one containing a Majorana-type DM, thus resulting in a multipartite dark matter scenario. We have explored the available parameter space consistent with the observed dark matter relic density and direct detection measurements for both of the DM particles. Having a Majorana dark matter, we have also studied for the gamma line signatures to constrain the parameter space from the indirect dark matter detection experiments like FermiLAT and CTA.</description>

      <title>Manipulation and trapping of magnetic skyrmions with domain walls in chiral magnetic thin films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06959v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article we use chiral domain walls to manipulate and trap magnetic skyrmion quasi-particles in chiral magnetic materials such as ultrathin Co/Pt films. The magnetic skyrmions can be orientated such that their interaction with domain walls is repulsive, allowing for them to be stored between domain walls. In certain orientations, the skyrmion can be absorbed into the domain wall, forming a domain wall kink. In other orientations, it can absorbed to form a kink-antikink domain wall with zero topological charge. The magnetic skyrmion can even be orientated in such a way that it remains trapped but creates a topological defect-antidefect pair in one of the walls. By altering the phases of one of the chiral domain walls, one can erase or store the magnetic skyrmion as an isolated soliton or as a domain wall skyrmion/antiskyrmion. This adds a valuable asset to an ever growing toolbox of spintronic nano-devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06973v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present selected examples demonstrating an alternative approach to contour deformation for numerically computing loop integrals in the Minkowski regime. This method focuses on identifying singular hypersurfaces (varieties of the $\mathscr{F}$ polynomial) and mapping them to known points which can then be resolved by employing blow-ups/sector decomposition techniques, thereby avoiding the need for contour deformation. Using this technique, we achieve improved convergence properties without the need for contour deformation, which is known to significantly increase the complexity of the integrand by introducing, for example, derivatives of the $\mathscr{F}$ polynomial and complicated Jacobians. We highlight that while we have only tested the approach on selected one-, two- and three-loop massless and one-loop massive examples, it shows promise for practical applications, offering potential benefits over the traditional approach. Evaluation times are compared with existing contour deformation implementations to illustrate the performance of this alternative method.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07010v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By constructing a model of spacetime having a strong curvature singularity in which causal geodesics are complete, but more generic causal curves are not, we explicitly show that some electrostatic field configurations on that background are regular everywhere, including \emph{there} where the spacetime ceases to be described by a pseudo-Riemannian manifold. Our calculations are performed using the analogue-gravity description provided by Plebanski and Tamm, according to which the characterization of the electromagnetic field on a generic curved background is equivalent to solving Maxwell's equations in flat space with a matter content verifying certain non-trivial constitutive relations. The regularity of the electric field in what could be considered the worst conceivable physical condition, opens the door to further investigation into the possibility of propagating signals capable of crossing a spacetime singularity.</description>

Additionally, we analyze the greybody factors, emission rate, and partial absorption cross section. We also examine the topological charge and its application to the deflection angle.

      <title>Pole-skipping of gravitational waves in the backgrounds of four-dimensional massive black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.15921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.15921v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Pole-skipping is a property of gravitational waves dictated by their behaviour at horizons of black holes. It stems from the inability to unambiguously impose ingoing boundary conditions at the horizon at an infinite discrete set of Fourier modes. The phenomenon has been best understood, when such a description exists, in terms of dual holographic (AdS/CFT) correlation function that take the value of '0/0' at these special points. In this work, we investigate details of pole-skipping purely from the point of view of classical gravity in 4d massive black hole geometries with flat, spherical and hyperbolic horizons, and with an arbitrary cosmological constant. We show that pole-skipping points naturally fall into two categories: the algebraically special points and a set of pole-skipping points that is common to the even and odd channels of perturbations. Our analysis utilises and generalises (to arbitrary maximally symmetric horizon topology and cosmological constant) the 'integrable' structure of the Darboux transformations, which relate the master field equations that describe the evolution of gravitational perturbations in the two channels. Finally, we provide new insights into a number of special cases: spherical black holes, asymptotically Anti-de Sitter black branes and pole-skipping at the cosmological horizon in de Sitter space.</description>

      <title>Substructures of the Weyl group and their physical applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05665v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study substructures of the Weyl group of conformal transformations of the metric of (pseudo)Riemannian manifolds. These substructures are identified by differential constraints on the conformal factors of the transformations which are chosen such that their composition is associative. Mathematically, apart from rare exceptions, they are partial associative groupoids, not groups, so they do not have an algebra of infinitesimal transformations, but this limitation can be partially circumvented using some of their properties cleverly. We classify and discuss the substructures with two-derivatives differential constraints, the most famous of which being known as the harmonic or restricted Weyl group in the physics literature, but we also show the existence of a lightcone constraint which realizes a proper subgroup of the Weyl group. We then show the physical implications that come from invariance under the two most important substructures, concentrating on classical properties of the energy-momentum tensor and a generalization of the quantum trace anomaly. We also elaborate further on the harmonic substructure, which can be interpreted as partial gauge fixing of full Weyl invariance using BRST methods. Finally, we discuss how to construct differential constraints of arbitrary higher-derivative order and present, as examples, generalizations involving scalar constraints with four and six derivatives.</description>

      <title>Diagnosing Emergent Isotropy in Anisotropic Holographic Systems using Quantum Information Measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11021v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study presents a comprehensive investigation of anisotropy in a holographic p-wave superconductor model, revealing novel insights into the behavior of quantum information measures in strongly coupled systems. Through rigorous semi-analytical methods, we uncover the existence of an isotropic point emerging at a critical temperature $T_{II}$, marking a significant transition in the system's anisotropic properties. We offer a systematic analysis of the mechanisms driving anisotropy and isotropy transitions, finding that this phenomenon is unique to the p-wave model and absent in other anisotropic systems like anisotropic axion models with metal-insulator transitions. We propose that the explicit component dependence of the vector field manifesting anisotropy is the key driver of the emergent isotropy. Our analysis of holographic entanglement entropy (HEE), entanglement wedge cross-section (EWCS), and butterfly velocity demonstrates their distinct sensitivities to bulk anisotropy, with EWCS and butterfly velocity emerging as superior probes for detecting the isotropic point.</description>

      <title>Duality constraints on thermal spectra of 3d CFTs and 4d quasinormal modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19790v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Thermal spectra of correlation functions in holographic 3d large-N CFTs correspond to quasinormal modes of classical gravity and other fields in asymptotically anti-de Sitter black hole spacetimes. Using general properties of such spectra along with constraints imposed by the S-duality (or the particle-vortex duality), we derive a spectral duality relation that all such spectra must obey. Its form is universal in that each such relation (expressed as an infinite product over QNMs) only depends on a single function of a spatial wavevector that corresponds to the bulk algebraically special frequencies. In the process, we also derive a new sum rule constraining products over QNMs. The spectral duality relation, which imposes an infinite set of constraints on the QNMs, is then investigated and a number of well-known holographic examples that demonstrate its validity are examined. Our results also allow us to understand several new aspects of the pole-skipping phenomenon.</description>

      <title>Janus Deformation of de Sitter Space and Transitions in Gravitational Algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04316v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a time-dependent $\mathcal{O}(1/G)$ deformation of pure de Sitter (dS) space in dS gravity coupled to a massless scalar field. It is the dS counterpart of the AdS Janus deformation and interpolates two asymptotically dS spaces in the far past and the far future with a single deformation parameter. The Penrose diagram can be elongated along the time direction indefinitely as the deformation becomes large. After studying the classical properties of the geometry such as the area theorem and the fluctuation by a matter field, we explore the algebraic structure of the field operators on the deformed spacetime. We argue that the algebra is a von Neumann factor of type II$_\infty$ for small deformations, but there occurs a transition to type I$_\infty$ as the deformation increases so that the neck region of the deformed space becomes a Lorentzian cylinder.</description>

      <title>Primordial black holes from null energy condition violation during inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.10933v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Primordial black holes (PBHs) and the violation of the null energy condition (NEC) have significant implications for our understanding of the very early universe. We present a novel approach to generate PBHs via the NEC violation in a single-field inflationary scenario. In our scenario, the universe transitions from a first slow-roll inflation stage with a Hubble parameter $H = H_{\text{inf}1}$ to a second slow-roll inflation stage with $H = H_{\text{inf}2}\gg H_{\text{inf}1}$, passing through an intermediate stage of NEC violation. The NEC violation naturally enhances the primordial scalar power spectrum at a certain wavelength, leading to the production of PBHs with masses and abundances of observational interest. We also investigate the phenomenological signatures of scalar-induced gravitational waves (SIGWs) resulting from the enhanced density perturbations. Our work highlights the potential of utilizing a combination of PBHs, SIGWs, and primordial gravitational waves as a valuable probe for studying NEC violation during inflation, opening up new avenues for exploring the early universe.</description>

      <title>Scalar fields around a rotating loop quantum gravity black hole: Waveform, quasi-normal modes and superradiance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.00253v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rotating loop quantum gravity black hole is a newly proposed non-singular black hole, which eliminates spacetime singularities when a regularization parameter is introduced through loop quantum corrections. This parameter is expected to give rise to observable effects. In this paper, the dynamical behavior of a scalar field near a rotating loop quantum gravity black hole is investigated. Given a small initial perturbation, we obtain the waveform of massless scalar fields evolving over time. By analyzing the waveform, we find that the regularization parameter only affects the damping oscillation of waveform, but not the initial outburst and late-time tail stages. This behavior is characterized by quasi-normal modes. Under scalar field perturbations, the loop quantum black holes remain stable. Moreover, we calculate the quasi-normal modes of massive scalar fields by three numerical methods, which are the Prony, WKB, and shooting methods, respectively. Our results indicate that the real part of quasi-normal modes depends only on the regularization parameter, while the imaginary part does not only on the regularization parameter but also on the angular momentum. Finally, we study the amplification effect of rotating black holes, i.e., the superradiance. Our analyses indicate the existence of stronger superradiance around loop quantum gravity black holes compared to Kerr ones.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian Form of Gravity around a Singularity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.00866v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the Hamiltonian form of gravity in terms of connection and densitized triad variables admits a simpler structure close to a (spacelike) curvature singularity. To define this regime, we construct a limit to a vanishing (spatial) metric determinant. The cosmological and black hole spacetime solutions that characterize such an approach to a singularity are obtained. We also elucidate the connection of this generic limit to the `Carroll' limit which could be interpreted as a special case.</description>

      <title>Dark matter from mediator decay in early matter domination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18557v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study dark matter production from mediator decays in scenarios with an epoch of early matter domination. Particles that mediate interactions between dark matter and the standard model particles are kinematically accessible to the thermal bath as long as their mass is below the reheating temperature of the Universe after inflation. Decay of on-shell mediators can then lead to copious production of dark matter during early matter domination or a preceding radiation-dominated phase. In particular, for mediators that are charged under the standard model, it can exceed the standard freeze-in channel due to inverse annihilations at much lower temperatures (often by many orders of magnitude). The requirement to obtain the correct relic abundance severely constrains the parameter space for dark matter masses above a few TeV.</description>
