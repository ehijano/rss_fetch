      <title>Twist-structures isomorphic to modal Nelson lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08109v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a new variety of Heyting algebras with two unary modal operators that are not interdefinable but satisfy the weakest condition necessary to define modal operators on Nelson lattices. To achieve this, we utilize the representation of Nelson lattices as twist structures over Heyting algebras and establish a categorical equivalence. Finally, we develop a topological duality for this new variety and apply it to derive a topological duality for modal Nelson lattices.</description>

      <title>Encoding argumentation frameworks with set attackers to propositional logic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Argumentation frameworks ($AF$s) have been a useful tool for approximate reasoning. The encoding method is an important approach to formally model $AF$s under related semantics. The aim of this paper is to develop the encoding method from classical Dung's $AF$s ($DAF$s) to $AF$s with set attackers ($AFSA$s) including higher-level argumentation frames ($HLAF$s), Barringer's higher-order $AF$s ($BHAF$s), frameworks with sets of attacking arguments ($SETAF$s) and higher-order set $AF$s ($HSAF$s). Regarding syntactic structures, we propose the $HSAF$s where the target of an attack is either an argument or an attack and the sources are sets of arguments and attacks. Regarding semantics, we translate $HLAF$s and $SETAF$s under respective complete semantics to {\L}ukasiewicz's 3-valued propositional logic system ($PL_3^L$). Furthermore, we propose complete semantics of $BHAF$s and $HSAF$s by respectively generalizing from $HLAF$s and $SETAF$s, and then translate to the $PL_3^L$. Moreover, for numerical semantics of $AFSA$s, we propose the equational semantics and translate to fuzzy propositional logic systems ($PL_{[0,1]}$s). This paper establishes relationships of model equivalence between an $AFSA$ under a given semantics and the encoded formula in a related propositional logic system ($PLS$). By connections of $AFSA$s and $PLS$s, this paper provides the logical foundations for $AFSA$s associated with complete semantics and equational semantics. The results advance the argumentation theory by unifying $HOAF$s and $SETAF$s under logical formalisms, paving the way for automated reasoning tools in AI, decision support, and multi-agent systems.</description>

      <title>Forcing Diamond and Applications to Iterability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08390v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that higher Sacks forcing at a regular limit cardinal and club Miller forcing at an uncountable regular cardinal both add a diamond sequence.
  We answer the longstanding question, whether $\kappa = \kappa^{&lt;\kappa} \geq\aleph_1$ implies that $\kappa$-supported iterations of $\kappa$-Sacks forcing do not collapse $\kappa^+$ and are $\kappa$-proper in the affirmative. The results pertain to other higher tree forcings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.08501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study definably primitive pseudo-finite permutation groups of finite $SU$-rank. We show that if $(G,X)$ is such a permutation group, then the rank of $G$ can be bounded in terms of the rank of $X$, providing an analogue of a theorem of Borovik and Cherlin in the setting of definably primitive permutation groups of finite Morley rank.</description>

      <title>Programs as Singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08075v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a correspondence between the structure of Turing machines and the structure of singularities of real analytic functions, based on connecting the Ehrhard-Regnier derivative from linear logic with the role of geometry in Watanabe's singular learning theory. The correspondence works by embedding ordinary (discrete) Turing machine codes into a family of noisy codes which form a smooth parameter space. On this parameter space we consider a potential function which has Turing machines as critical points. By relating the Taylor series expansion of this potential at such a critical point to combinatorics of error syndromes, we relate the local geometry to internal structure of the Turing machine.
  The potential in question is the negative log-likelihood for a statistical model, so that the structure of the Turing machine and its associated singularity is further related to Bayesian inference. Two algorithms that produce the same predictive function can nonetheless correspond to singularities with different geometries, which implies that the Bayesian posterior can discriminate between distinct algorithmic implementations, contrary to a purely functional view of inference. In the context of singular learning theory our results point to a more nuanced understanding of Occam's razor and the meaning of simplicity in inductive inference.</description>

      <title>A Proof-Theoretic Approach to the Semantics of Classical Linear Logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08349v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Linear logic (LL) is a resource-aware, abstract logic programming language that refines both classical and intuitionistic logic. Linear logic semantics is typically presented in one of two ways: by associating each formula with the set of all contexts that can be used to prove it (e.g. phase semantics) or by assigning meaning directly to proofs (e.g. coherence spaces).
  This work proposes a different perspective on assigning meaning to proofs by adopting a proof-theoretic perspective. More specifically, we employ base-extension semantics (BeS) to characterise proofs through the notion of base support.
  Recent developments have shown that BeS is powerful enough to capture proof-theoretic notions in structurally rich logics such as intuitionistic linear logic. In this paper, we extend this framework to the classical case, presenting a proof-theoretic approach to the semantics of the multiplicative-additive fragment of linear logic (MALL).</description>

      <title>Differential Geometry of Synthetic Schemes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.08495v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Synthetic algebraic geometry uses homotopy type theory extended with three axioms to develop algebraic geometry internal to a higher version of the Zariski topos. In this article we make no essential use of the higher structure and use homotopy type theory only for convenience. We define \'etale, smooth and unramified maps between schemes in synthetic algebraic geometry using a new synthetic definition. We give the usual characterizations of these classes of maps in terms of injectivity, surjectivity and bijectivity of differentials. We also show that the tangent spaces of smooth schemes are finite free modules. Finally, we show that unramified, \'etale and smooth schemes can be understood very concretely via the expected local algebraic description.</description>

      <title>Local finiteness in varieties of MS4-algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.16754v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is a classic result of Segerberg and Maksimova that a variety of $\mathsf{S4}$-algebras is locally finite iff it is of finite depth. Since the logic $\mathsf{MS4}$ (monadic $\mathsf{S4}$) axiomatizes the one-variable fragment of $\mathsf{QS4}$ (predicate $\mathsf{S4}$), it is natural to try to generalize the Segerberg--Maksimova theorem to this setting. We obtain several results in this direction. Our positive results include the identification of the largest semisimple variety of $\mathsf{MS4}$-algebras. We prove that the corresponding logic $\mathsf{MS4_S}$ has the finite model property. We show that both $\mathsf{S5}^2$ and $\mathsf{S4}_u$ are proper extensions of $\mathsf{MS4_S}$, and that a direct generalization of the Segerberg--Maksimova theorem holds for a family of varieties containing the variety of $\mathsf{S4}_u$-algebras. Our negative results include a translation of varieties of $\mathsf{S5}_2$-algebras into varieties of $\mathsf{MS4_S}$-algebras of depth 2, which preserves and reflects local finiteness. This, in particular, shows that the problem of characterizing locally finite varieties of $\mathsf{MS4}$-algebras (even of $\mathsf{MS4_S}$-algebras) is at least as hard as that of characterizing locally finite varieties of $\mathsf{S5}_2$-algebras -- a problem that remains wide open.</description>

      <title>Good Scales and Non-Compactness of Squares</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16071v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cummings, Foreman, and Magidor investigated the extent to which square principles are compact at singular cardinals. The first author proved that if $\kappa$ is a singular strong limit of uncountable cofinality, all scales on $\kappa$ are good, and $\square^*_\delta$ holds for all $\delta&lt;\kappa$, then $\square_\kappa^*$ holds. In this paper we will present a strongly contrasting result for $\aleph_\omega$. We construct a model in which $\square_{\aleph_n}$ holds for all $n&lt;\omega$, all scales on $\aleph_\omega$ are good, but in which $\square_{\aleph_\omega}^*$ fails and some weak forms of internal approachability for $[H(\aleph_{\omega+1})]^{\aleph_1}$ fail. This requires an extensive analysis of the dominating and approximation properties of a version of Namba forcing. We also prove some supporting results.</description>

Abstract: We study groups definable in existentially closed geometric fields with commuting derivations. Our main result is that such a group can be definably embedded in a group interpretable in the underlying geometric field. Compared to earlier work of the first two authors toguether with K. Peterzil, the novelty is that we also deal with infinite dimensional groups.</description>

      <title>Verified Program Extraction in Number Theory: The Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic and Relatives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03460v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article revisits standard theorems from elementary number theory through a constructive, algorithmic, and proof-theoretic perspective, within the theory of computable functionals. Key examples include B\'ezout's identity, the fundamental theorem of arithmetic, and Fermat's factorization method. All definitions and theorems are fully formalized in the proof assistant Minlog, laying the foundation for a comprehensive formal framework for number theory within Minlog. While formalization guarantees correctness, the primary emphasis is on the computational content of proofs. Leveraging Minlog's built-in program extraction, we obtain executable terms that are exported as Haskell code. The efficiency of the extracted programs plays a central role. We show how performance considerations influence even the initial formulation of theorems and proofs. In particular, we compare formalizations based on binary encodings of natural numbers with those using the traditional unary (successor-based) representation. We present several core proofs in detail and reflect on the challenges that arise from formalization in contrast to informal reasoning. The complete formalization is available online and linked for reference. Minlog's tactic scripts are designed to follow the structure of natural-language proofs, allowing each derivation step to be traced precisely and thus bridging the gap between formal and classical mathematical reasoning.</description>
