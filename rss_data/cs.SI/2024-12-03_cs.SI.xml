      <title>Mixture of Experts for Node Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00418v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nodes in the real-world graphs exhibit diverse patterns in numerous aspects, such as degree and homophily. However, most existent node predictors fail to capture a wide range of node patterns or to make predictions based on distinct node patterns, resulting in unsatisfactory classification performance. In this paper, we reveal that different node predictors are good at handling nodes with specific patterns and only apply one node predictor uniformly could lead to suboptimal result. To mitigate this gap, we propose a mixture of experts framework, MoE-NP, for node classification. Specifically, MoE-NP combines a mixture of node predictors and strategically selects models based on node patterns. Experimental results from a range of real-world datasets demonstrate significant performance improvements from MoE-NP.</description>

      <title>Garden city: A synthetic dataset and sandbox environment for analysis of pre-processing algorithms for GPS human mobility data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Human mobility datasets have seen increasing adoption in the past decade, enabling diverse applications that leverage the high precision of measured trajectories relative to other human mobility datasets. However, there are concerns about whether the high sparsity in some commercial datasets can introduce errors due to lack of robustness in processing algorithms, which could compromise the validity of downstream results. The scarcity of "ground-truth" data makes it particularly challenging to evaluate and calibrate these algorithms. To overcome these limitations and allow for an intermediate form of validation of common processing algorithms, we propose a synthetic trajectory simulator and sandbox environment meant to replicate the features of commercial datasets that could cause errors in such algorithms, and which can be used to compare algorithm outputs with "ground-truth" synthetic trajectories and mobility diaries. Our code is open-source and is publicly available alongside tutorial notebooks and sample datasets generated with it.</description>

      <title>Exploring Climate Change Discourse: Measurements and Analysis of Reddit Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01111v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Social media is very popular for facilitating conversations about important topics and bringing forth insights and issues related to these topics. Reddit serves as a platform that fosters social interactions and hosts engaging discussions on a wide array of topics, thus forming narratives around these topics. One such topic is climate change. There are extensive discussions on Reddit about climate change, indicating high interest in its various aspects. In this paper, we explore 11 subreddits that discuss climate change for the duration of 2014 to 2022 and conduct a data-driven analysis of the posts on these subreddits. We present a basic characterization of the data and show the distribution of the posts and authors across our dataset for all years. Additionally, we analyze user engagement metrics like scores for the posts and how they change over time. We also offer insights into the topics of discussion across the subreddits, followed by entities referenced throughout the dataset.</description>

      <title>Partitioning Message Passing for Graph Fraud Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00020v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Label imbalance and homophily-heterophily mixture are the fundamental problems encountered when applying Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to Graph Fraud Detection (GFD) tasks. Existing GNN-based GFD models are designed to augment graph structure to accommodate the inductive bias of GNNs towards homophily, by excluding heterophilic neighbors during message passing. In our work, we argue that the key to applying GNNs for GFD is not to exclude but to {\em distinguish} neighbors with different labels. Grounded in this perspective, we introduce Partitioning Message Passing (PMP), an intuitive yet effective message passing paradigm expressly crafted for GFD. Specifically, in the neighbor aggregation stage of PMP, neighbors with different classes are aggregated with distinct node-specific aggregation functions. By this means, the center node can adaptively adjust the information aggregated from its heterophilic and homophilic neighbors, thus avoiding the model gradient being dominated by benign nodes which occupy the majority of the population. We theoretically establish a connection between the spatial formulation of PMP and spectral analysis to characterize that PMP operates an adaptive node-specific spectral graph filter, which demonstrates the capability of PMP to handle heterophily-homophily mixed graphs. Extensive experimental results show that PMP can significantly boost the performance on GFD tasks.</description>

      <title>Attribute-Enhanced Similarity Ranking for Sparse Link Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00261v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Link prediction is a fundamental problem in graph data. In its most realistic setting, the problem consists of predicting missing or future links between random pairs of nodes from the set of disconnected pairs. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become the predominant framework for link prediction. GNN-based methods treat link prediction as a binary classification problem and handle the extreme class imbalance -- real graphs are very sparse -- by sampling (uniformly at random) a balanced number of disconnected pairs not only for training but also for evaluation. However, we show that the reported performance of GNNs for link prediction in the balanced setting does not translate to the more realistic imbalanced setting and that simpler topology-based approaches are often better at handling sparsity. These findings motivate Gelato, a similarity-based link-prediction method that applies (1) graph learning based on node attributes to enhance a topological heuristic, (2) a ranking loss for addressing class imbalance, and (3) a negative sampling scheme that efficiently selects hard training pairs via graph partitioning. Experiments show that Gelato outperforms existing GNN-based alternatives.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Interference Suppression for Radar and Communication Cohabitation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00697v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose the joint dynamic power allocation and multi-relay selection for the cohabitation of high-priority military radar and low-priority commercial 5G communication. To improve the 5G network performance, we design the full-duplex underlay cognitive radio network for the low-priority commercial 5G network, where multiple relays are selected for concurrently receive the signal from the source and send it to the destination. Then, we propose the interference suppression at the high-priority radar system by using both non-coherent and coherent relay cases. In particular, we formulate the optimization problem for maximizing the system rate, with the consideration of the power constraints at the 5G users and the interference constraint at the radar system. Then, we propose the mathematical analysis model to evaluate the rate performance, considering the impacts of self-interference at the relays and derive the algorithms of joint power allocation and relay selection. Our numerical results demonstrate the characteristic of the optimal configuration and the significant performance gain of coherent case with respect to the non-coherent case and the existing algorithms with single relay selections.</description>

      <title>TGTOD: A Global Temporal Graph Transformer for Outlier Detection at Scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00984v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While Transformers have revolutionized machine learning on various data, existing Transformers for temporal graphs face limitations in (1) restricted receptive fields, (2) overhead of subgraph extraction, and (3) suboptimal generalization capability beyond link prediction. In this paper, we rethink temporal graph Transformers and propose TGTOD, a novel end-to-end Temporal Graph Transformer for Outlier Detection. TGTOD employs global attention to model both structural and temporal dependencies within temporal graphs. To tackle scalability, our approach divides large temporal graphs into spatiotemporal patches, which are then processed by a hierarchical Transformer architecture comprising Patch Transformer, Cluster Transformer, and Temporal Transformer. We evaluate TGTOD on three public datasets under two settings, comparing with a wide range of baselines. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of TGTOD, achieving AP improvement of 61% on Elliptic. Furthermore, our efficiency evaluation shows that TGTOD reduces training time by 44x compared to existing Transformers for temporal graphs. To foster reproducibility, we make our implementation publicly available at https://github.com/kayzliu/tgtod.</description>

      <title>Su-RoBERTa: A Semi-supervised Approach to Predicting Suicide Risk through Social Media using Base Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01353v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent times, more and more people are posting about their mental states across various social media platforms. Leveraging this data, AI-based systems can be developed that help in assessing the mental health of individuals, such as suicide risk. This paper is a study done on suicidal risk assessments using Reddit data leveraging Base language models to identify patterns from social media posts. We have demonstrated that using smaller language models, i.e., less than 500M parameters, can also be effective in contrast to LLMs with greater than 500M parameters. We propose Su-RoBERTa, a fine-tuned RoBERTa on suicide risk prediction task that utilized both the labeled and unlabeled Reddit data and tackled class imbalance by data augmentation using GPT-2 model. Our Su-RoBERTa model attained a 69.84% weighted F1 score during the Final evaluation. This paper demonstrates the effectiveness of Base language models for the analysis of the risk factors related to mental health with an efficient computation pipeline</description>

      <title>Opinion Dynamic Under Malicious Agent Influence in Multi-Agent Systems: From the Perspective of Opinion Evolution Cost</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01524v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In human social systems, debates are often seen as a means to resolve differences of opinion. However, in reality, debates frequently incur significant communication costs, especially when dealing with stubborn opponents. Inspired by this phenomenon, this paper examines the impact of malicious agents on the evolution of normal agents' opinions from the perspective of opinion evolution cost, and proposes corresponding solutions for the scenario in which malicious agents hold different opinions in multi-agent systems(MASs). First, the paper analyzes the negative impact of malicious agents on the opinion evolution process, revealing the evolutionary cost they bring, which provides the theoretical foundation for the proposed solution. Next, based on the process of opinion evolution, a strategy is introduced where agents dynamically adjust trust values during the opinion evolution process, gradually isolating malicious agents and achieving this even when malicious agents are in the majority. Additionally, an evolution rate adjustment mechanism is introduced, allowing the system to flexibly regulate the evolution process in complex situations, effectively achieving the trade-off between opinion evolution rate and cost. Extensive numerical simulations demonstrate that the algorithm can effectively isolate the negative influence of malicious agents and achieve a balance between opinion evolution costs and convergence speed.</description>

      <title>Silenced Voices: Exploring Social Media Polarization and Women's Participation in Peacebuilding in Ethiopia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01549v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This exploratory study highlights the significant threats of social media polarization and weaponization in Ethiopia, analyzing the Northern Ethiopia (Tigray) War (November 2020 to November 2022) as a case study. It further uncovers the lack of effective digital peacebuilding initiatives. These issues particularly impact women, who bear a disproportionate burden in the armed conflict. These repercussions extend beyond the digital sphere, affecting women's socio-economic conditions, safety, and well-being. This reality was starkly evident during the war, where women faced gender-based and sexual violence. The research findings disclose the interface between social media polarization, conflict, and gender based violence. It also reveals the marginalization of women's voice in peacebuilding initiatives. This marginalization in peacebuilding efforts can be attributed to hostile online environments, the digital divide, cultural and societal norms, as well as top-down peace initiatives. The study highlights substantial gaps in leveraging digital media for sustainable peace and empowering women's participation. The unregulated landscape of social media in Ethiopia exacerbates these problems, necessitating heightened demands for accountability, especially from major social media platforms. The study recommends enhanced moderation and ethical considerations in algorithmic design gains traction, underlining the urgency for transparent and responsible social media frameworks. It is also recommended that digital peacebuilding initiatives should adopt a gender-sensitive and inclusive approach to address these complexities effectively and sustainably.</description>

      <title>Network Interventions: Applying Network Science for Pragmatic Action in Public Administration and Policy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.08197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2109.08197v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Public management and policy scholars have engaged in extensive development of theory and empirical study of networks and collaborative systems of governance. This scholarship has focused on understanding the mechanisms of network formation and the implications of network properties on individual and collective outcomes. Despite rich descriptive work and inferential analyses, little work has attempted to intervene in these systems. In this article, we develop the foundation for a new body of research in our field focused on network interventions. Network interventions are defined as the purposeful use of network data to identify strategies for accelerating behavior change, improving performance, and producing desirable outcomes (Valente, 2012). We extend network intervention strategies from the field of public health to public sector inter-organizational and governance networks. Public sector actors have an interest in network interventions based on the fundamental pursuit of efficiency, effectiveness, and equity. Network interventions can increase the uptake of an organizational change among employees, improve the performance of a governance system, or promote the spread of a successful policy across jurisdictions. We provide scholars and practitioners with a useful way to conceptualize where, why, and how network interventions might be deployed in the pursuit of public value.</description>

      <title>Roll in the Tanks! Measuring Left-wing Extremism on Reddit at Scale</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.06981v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Social media's role in the spread and evolution of extremism is a focus of intense study. Online extremists have been involved in the spread of online hate, mis- and disinformation, and real-world violence. However, most existing work has focuses on right-wing extremism. In this paper, we perform a first of its kind large-scale measurement study exploring left-wing extremism. We focus on "tankies," a left-wing community that first arose in the 1950s in support of hardline actions of the USSR and has evolved to support what they call "Actually Existing Socialist" countries, e.g., CCP-run China, the USSR, and North Korea. We collect and analyze 1.3M posts from 53K authors from tankie subreddits, and explore the position of tankies within the broader far-left community on Reddit. Among other things, we find that tankies are clearly on the periphery of the larger far-left community. When examining the contents of posts, we find misalignments and conceptual homomorphisms that confirm the description of tankies in the theoretical work. We also discover that tankies focus more on state-level political events rather than social issues. Our findings provide empirical evidence of the distinct positioning and discourse of left-wing extremist groups on social media.</description>

      <title>GCLS$^2$: Towards Efficient Community Detection Using Graph Contrastive Learning with Structure Semantics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11273v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Due to the power of learning representations from unlabeled graphs, graph contrastive learning (GCL) has shown excellent performance in community detection tasks. Existing GCL-based methods on the community detection usually focused on learning attribute representations of individual nodes, which, however, ignores structural semantics of communities (e.g., nodes in the same community should be structurally cohesive). Therefore, in this paper, we will consider the community detection under the community structure semantics and propose an effective framework for graph contrastive learning under structure semantics (GCLS$^2$) to detect communities. To seamlessly integrate interior dense and exterior sparse characteristics of communities with our contrastive learning strategy, we employ classic community structures to extract high-level structural views and design a structure semantic expression module to augment the original structural feature representation. Moreover, we formulate the structure contrastive loss to optimize the feature representation of nodes, which can better capture the topology of communities. To adapt to large-scale networks, we design a high-level graph partitioning (HGP) algorithm that minimizes the community detection loss for GCLS$^2$ online training. It is worth noting that we prove a lower bound on the training of GCLS$^2$ from the perspective of the information theory, explaining why GCLS$^2$ can learn a more accurate representation of the structure. Extensive experiments have been conducted on various real-world graph datasets and confirmed that GCLS$^2$ outperforms nine state-of-the-art methods, in terms of the accuracy, modularity, and efficiency of detecting communities.</description>

Abstract: Social dynamics are often driven by both pairwise (i.e., dyadic) relationships and higher-order (i.e., polyadic) group relationships, which one can describe using hypergraphs. To gain insight into the impact of polyadic relationships on dynamical processes on networks, we formulate and study a polyadic voter process, which we call the group-driven voter model (GVM), that incorporates the effect of group interactions by nonlinear interactions that are subject to a group (i.e., hyperedge) constraint. By examining the competition between nonlinearity and group sizes, we show that the GVM achieves consensus faster than standard voter-model dynamics, with an optimal minimizing exit time. We substantiate this finding by using mean-field theory on annealed uniform hypergraphs with $N$ nodes, for which the exit time scales as ${\cal A}\ln N$, where the prefactor ${\cal A}$ depends both on the nonlinearity and on group-constraint factors. Our results reveal how competition between group interactions and nonlinearity shapes GVM dynamics. We thereby highlight the importance of such competing effects in complex systems with polyadic interactions.</description>

      <title>UTG: Towards a Unified View of Snapshot and Event Based Models for Temporal Graphs</title>

Abstract: Many real world graphs are inherently dynamic, constantly evolving with node and edge additions. These graphs can be represented by temporal graphs, either through a stream of edge events or a sequence of graph snapshots. Until now, the development of machine learning methods for both types has occurred largely in isolation, resulting in limited experimental comparison and theoretical crosspollination between the two. In this paper, we introduce Unified Temporal Graph (UTG), a framework that unifies snapshot-based and event-based machine learning models under a single umbrella, enabling models developed for one representation to be applied effectively to datasets of the other. We also propose a novel UTG training procedure to boost the performance of snapshot-based models in the streaming setting. We comprehensively evaluate both snapshot and event-based models across both types of temporal graphs on the temporal link prediction task. Our main findings are threefold: first, when combined with UTG training, snapshot-based models can perform competitively with event-based models such as TGN and GraphMixer even on event datasets. Second, snapshot-based models are at least an order of magnitude faster than most event-based models during inference. Third, while event-based methods such as NAT and DyGFormer outperforms snapshot-based methods on both types of temporal graphs, this is because they leverage joint neighborhood structural features thus emphasizing the potential to incorporate these features into snapshotbased models as well. These findings highlight the importance of comparing model architectures independent of the data format and suggest the potential of combining the efficiency of snapshot-based models with the performance of event-based models in the future.</description>
