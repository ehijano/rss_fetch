      <title>To Each Their Own: Heterogeneity in Worker Preferences for Peer Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Peer information is pervasive in the workplace, but workers differ in whether and why they value such information. We develop a portable, theory-driven methodology to study heterogeneity in information preferences and the underlying mechanisms. In a real-effort experiment with 793 workers, we elicit willingness-to-pay for peer information delivered either before or after a task. We identify four worker types (indifferent, stress-avoidant, competitive, and learning-oriented) whose effort responses align with theoretical predictions. Workers' stated motivations in free-text responses strongly correlate with their revealed preferences and behavior, validating our classification. Notably, a nontrivial share (15%) strictly prefers to avoid information ex ante due to stress and exhibit no productivity gains from it. Tailoring the timing of information by worker type improves welfare by up to 48% relative to a uniform policy.</description>

      <title>Strategy Method Effects in Centipede Games: An Optimal Design Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06425v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the twin questions of when and why the strategy method creates behavioral distortions in the elicitation of choices in laboratory studies of sequential games. While such distortions have been widely documented, the theoretical forces driving these distortions remain poorly understood. In this paper, we compare behavior in six optimally designed centipede games, implemented under three different choice elicitation methods: the direct response method, the reduced strategy method and the full strategy method. These methods elicit behavioral strategies, reduced strategies, and complete strategies, respectively. We find significant behavioral differences across these elicitation methods -- differences that cannot be explained by standard game theory, but are consistent with the predictions of the Dynamic Cognitive Hierarchy solution (Lin and Palfrey, 2024), combined with quantal responses.</description>

      <title>Web3 x AI Agents: Landscape, Integrations, and Foundational Challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02773v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The convergence of Web3 technologies and AI agents represents a rapidly evolving frontier poised to reshape decentralized ecosystems. This paper presents the first and most comprehensive analysis of the intersection between Web3 and AI agents, examining five critical dimensions: landscape, economics, governance, security, and trust mechanisms. Through an analysis of 133 existing projects, we first develop a taxonomy and systematically map the current market landscape (RQ1), identifying distinct patterns in project distribution and capitalization. Building upon these findings, we further investigate four key integrations: (1) the role of AI agents in participating in and optimizing decentralized finance (RQ2); (2) their contribution to enhancing Web3 governance mechanisms (RQ3); (3) their capacity to strengthen Web3 security via intelligent vulnerability detection and automated smart contract auditing (RQ4); and (4) the establishment of robust reliability frameworks for AI agent operations leveraging Web3's inherent trust infrastructure (RQ5). By synthesizing these dimensions, we identify key integration patterns, highlight foundational challenges related to scalability, security, and ethics, and outline critical considerations for future research toward building robust, intelligent, and trustworthy decentralized systems with effective AI agent interactions.</description>
