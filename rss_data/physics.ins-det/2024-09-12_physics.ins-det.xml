      <title>Characterisation of analogue MAPS fabricated in 65 nm technology for the ALICE ITS3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07543v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ALICE ITS3 project foresees the use of ultra-light MAPS, developed in the 65 nm imaging process, for the vertex detector in the ALICE experiment at the LHC to drastically improve the vertexing performance. This new development, initiated by an international consortium of the ALICE ITS3 collaboration and the CERN EP R&amp;D project, enhances the overall MAPS performance. Small-scale prototypes are designed to study the analogue properties of the TPSCo 65 nm technology and compare the charge collection performance in different processes, pitches, pixel geometries, and irradiation levels. Recent results from lab and test-beam characterisation detailing the efficiency and the spatial resolution of the APTS with different pixel geometries and pitches satisfy the ALICE ITS3 requirements. A quantitative evolution of the charge collection and sharing among pixels is evident in the CE-65 with different in-pixel readouts. Attaining a spatial resolution better than 3 $\mu$m with a 10 $\mu$m pitch and over 99% efficiency in the moderate irradiation environment of ALICE also supports the viability of using 65 nm MAPS for FCC-ee vertex detectors.</description>

      <title>First results from a low cost software defined radio system monitoring VHF equatorial ionospheric scintillations in the Indian sector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07758v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scintillations of radio frequency signals due to the ionosphere, despite having been studied for decades, is still an active area of research. Of particular interest is the scintillations near the geomagnetic equator, where such scintillations can be strong enough to cause disruptions to satellite communications. In this paper, a low cost system to monitor VHF scintillations is described. The system called the Personal Ionospheric Experiment (PIE) makes use of a widely available software defined radio (SDR) to perform the measurements. The use of an SDR vastly enhances the flexibility, especially in environments with non-negligible radio frequency interference (RFI). A simple technique to effectively subtract out transient RFI commonly found in radio data is detailed, and tested with data collected over several months. The utility of the proposed system is demonstrated with the analysis of a night-time scintillation patch; a few daytime scintillations are also reported. Therefore this paper demonstrates the feasibility of conducting useful low-cost radio science experiments in semi-urban locations with RFI, encouraging similar citizen science initiatives.</description>

      <title>Surface and Near-Surface Positron Annihilation Spectroscopy at Very Low Positron Energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07952v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a monoenergetic positron beam specifically tailored to the needs of (near-) surface positron annihilation spectroscopy. The Setup for LOw-energy Positron Experiments (SLOPE) comprises a high-activity 22Na source, a tungsten moderator, electrostatic extraction and acceleration, magnetic beam guidance, as well as an analysis chamber with a movable sample holder and a {\gamma}-ray detection system. The tungsten moderator foil, biased between 0 and 30 V, in combination with the HV-biasable sample holder, enables positron implantation energies between 3 eV and 40 keV. At low energies (&lt;20 eV), the count rate typically amounts to 4400 counts per second, and the beam diameter is smaller than 12 +/- 3 mm. We conduct phase space simulations of the positron beam using COMSOL Multiphysics (c) to characterize the beam properties and compare the findings with the experimentally determined energy-dependent beam diameter. To showcase the capabilities of SLOPE, we perform studies of positronium (Ps) formation on boehmite and depth-resolved coincidence Doppler-broadening spectroscopy (CDBS) of copper. In particular, the Ps formation at the hydrogen-terminated surface of boehmite is found to be maximum at a positron implantation energy of 10 eV. The range of positron energies for which we observe Ps formation agrees with the hydrogen ionization energy.</description>

      <title>Advanced fabrication process for particle absorbers of highly pure electroplated gold for microcalorimeter applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07971v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic microcalorimeters (MMCs) have become a key technology for applications requiring outstanding energy resolution, fast signal rise time and excellent linearity. MMCs measure the temperature rise upon absorption of a single particle within a particle absorber by using a paramagnetic temperature sensor that is thermally coupled to the absorber. The design and fabrication of the particle absorber is key for excellent detector performance. Here, we present a microfabrication process for free-standing particle absorbers made of two stacked and independently electroplated high-purity Au layers. This enables, for example, embedding of radioactive sources within the absorber for realizing a 4$\pi$ detection geometry in radionuclide metrology or preparing detector arrays with variable quantum efficiency and energy resolution as requested for future applications in high energy physics. Due to careful optimization of photoresist processing and electroplating parameters, the Au films are of very high purity and record-breaking residual resistivity ratio values above 40, allowing for fast internal absorber thermalization.</description>

      <title>Characterisation of radioactive decay series by digital autoradiography, part 1: a theoretical approach using time and space coincidence (TSC) analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07999v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The three natural decay chains have short-lived daughter elements, and the existence of these radioelements makes it possible for alpha and beta particle emissions to be generated at the same place and the same time. We show theoretically that such time and space coincidences (TSCs) can be detected efficiently by suitable autoradiographic systems using an algorithm that is six times more efficient than an approach based on the classical slicing of space-time. Two types of TSC coexist: true TSCs, resulting from the decay of short-lived daughter elements, and random TSCs. True TSCs are predictable and their numbers vary linearly with activity; the prediction of true alpha/alpha and alpha/alpha/alpha TSCs of the 235U chain is presented. Random coincidences are also predictable using Poisson's law. They vary quadratically as a function of activity. Examination of the case of an uranium ore at secular equilibrium shows that the observed alpha/alpha coincidences result from the sum of random and true TSCs. For high uranium contents, random coincidences predominate. For uranium at secular equilibrium, the theoretical calculation shows that true TSCs predominate for contents below ~5000 ppm.</description>

      <title>Study of energy deposition in the coolant of LFR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08203v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The determination of the fraction of energy deposited in the coolant is required for the setup of accurate thermal-hydraulic calculations in reactor core analysis. This study focuses on assessing this fraction and analysing the neutronic and photonic processes contributing to energy deposition in Lead-cooled Fast Reactors (LFRs). Using OpenMC, coupled neutron-photon transport calculations were performed within a fuel pin cell geometry, representative of the one under development at \textsl{new}cleo. Additionally, the implementation of lattice geometry was tested to gauge the impact of reflective boundary conditions on computational efficiency. In the context of a surface-based algorithm, the pin geometry has proven to be computationally more cost-effective. The fraction of energy deposited in the LFR coolant was evaluated at $\sim5.6$\%, surpassing that of pressurised water Reactors ($\lessapprox 3\%$), with photon interactions emerging as the principal contributor. The influence of bremsstrahlung radiation was also considered, revealing minor impact compared to other photonic processes. Given the continuous exploration of various core designs and the expectation of diverse operational conditions, a parametric analysis was undertaken by varying the coolant temperature and pitch values. Temperature changes did not significantly affect the results, while modifying the pitch induced a rise in the fraction of deposited energy in lead, highlighting its dependence on the coolant mass. This mass effect was explored in various fuel assembly designs based on the ALFRED benchmark and on the typical assembly model proposed by \textsl{new}cleo, leading to a correlation function for the prediction of coolant heating in realistic assemblies from simple pin cell calculations.</description>

      <title>Gridded RF Gun Design for SRF Linac Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07548v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The thermionic gridded gun is described which generates short electron bunches for further acceleration in a Nb3Sn conduction cooled SRF linac. The gun is built into the first cavity of the 250 keV injector [1] for the 20 kW, 10 MeV, 1.3 GHz CW conduction cooled one-cavity linac. The beam current is 2 mA. The RF gun design is presented as well as the results of perveance measurements, which are in a good agreement with the design parameters. The design of the RF resonator of the gun is presented also. The beam generated by the gun is matched to the injector to provide lack of current interception in the SRF cavity.</description>

      <title>Proton discrimination in CLYC for fast neutron spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15730v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Cs$_2$LiYCl$_6$:Ce (CLYC) elpasolite scintillator is known for its response to fast and thermal neutrons along with good $\gamma$-ray energy resolution. While the $^{35}$Cl($n,p$) reaction has been identified as a potential means for CLYC-based fast neutron spectroscopy in the absence of time-of-flight (TOF), previous efforts to functionalize CLYC as a fast neutron spectrometer have been thwarted by the inability to isolate proton interactions from $^{6}$Li($n,\alpha$) and $^{35}$Cl($n,\alpha$) signals. This work introduces a new approach to particle discrimination in CLYC for fission spectrum neutrons using a multi-gate charge integration algorithm that provides excellent separation between protons and heavier charged particles. Neutron TOF data were collected using a $^{252}$Cf source, an array of EJ-309 organic liquid scintillators, and a $^6$Li-enriched CLYC scintillator outfitted with fast electronics. Modal waveforms were constructed corresponding to the different reaction channels, revealing significant differences in the pulse characteristics of protons and heavier charged particles at ultrafast, fast, and intermediate time scales. These findings informed the design of a pulse shape discrimination algorithm, which was validated using the TOF data. This study also proposes an iterative subtraction method to mitigate contributions from confounding reaction channels in proton and heavier charged particle pulse height spectra, opening the door for CLYC-based fast neutron and $\gamma$-ray spectroscopy while preserving sensitivity to thermal neutron capture signals.</description>

      <title>Characterization of 4H-SiC Low Gain Avalanche Detectors (LGADs)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12744v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: 4H-SiC low gain avalanche detectors (LGADs) have been fabricated and characterized. The devices employ a circular mesa design with low-resistivity contacts and an SiO$_2$ passivation layer. The I-V and C-V characteristics of the 4H-SiC LGADs are compared with complementary 4H-SiC PiN diodes to confirm a high breakdown voltage and low leakage current. Both LGADs and PiN diodes were irradiated with $\alpha$ particles from a $^{210}_{84}\rm{Po}$ source. The charge collected by each device was compared, and it was observed that low-gain charge carrier multiplication is achieved in the 4H-SiC LGAD.</description>
