      <title>Regulating protocols of globally coupled continuum systems: Effects on dynamics and thermodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08678v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Controlling and understanding phenomena in coupled systems remains a significant challenge across diverse fields. This study investigates a simple globally coupled chemical system that exhibits a range of rich collective dynamics, from coherence to chimera states, controllable by a system parameter. We explore the effects of altering this control parameter using two different protocols. In protocol-I, a continuous variation of the control parameter leads to memory effects, resulting in two distinct sets of phenomena in the forward and reverse directions. In contrast, protocol-II, which includes a resetting feature, yields an entirely distinct collection of behaviors. Additionally, we capture the evolution of key elements of nonequilibrium thermodynamics associated with these dynamical states under both protocols, revealing distinct signatures for each. This work highlights the complexity and uniqueness of regulating coupled systems via control parameters compared to corresponding single systems, and it carries potential implications for the manipulation and application of collective behaviors.</description>

      <title>Linear Nonreciprocal Dynamics of Coupled Modulated Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08533v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Waveguides subject to spatiotemporal modulations are known to exhibit nonreciprocal vibration transmission, whereby interchanging the locations of the source and receiver change the end-to-end transmission characteristics. The scenario of typical interest is unidirectional transmission in long, weakly modulated systems: when transmission is possible in one direction only. Here, with a view toward expanding their potential application as devices, we explore the vibration characteristics of spatiotemporally modulated systems that are short and strongly modulated. Focusing on two coupled systems, we develop a methodology to investigate the nonreciprocal vibration characteristics of both weakly and strongly modulated systems. In particular, we highlight the contribution of phase to nonreciprocity, a feature that is often overlooked. We show that the difference between the transmitted phases is the main contributor to breaking reciprocity in short systems. We clarify the roles of primary and side-band resonances, and their overlaps, in breaking reciprocity. We discuss the influence of modulation amplitude and wavenumber on the resonances of the modulated system.</description>

      <title>Tracing the nonlinear formation of an interfacial wave spectral cascade from one to few to many</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08842v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Far-from-equilibrium phenomena unveil the intricate principles of complex systems, including snowflake growth and fluid turbulence, with broad applications ranging from foreign exchange trading to climate modeling. A recurring feature across these systems is the emergence of a spectral cascade, where energy is transferred across the system's length scales, following a simple power law. The statistical theory of weak wave turbulence, in which only leading order interactions are considered, successfully predicts scaling laws for stationary states in idealised scenarios. Realistic conditions, such as finite size and amplitude effects, and strong dissipation, remain beyond our current understanding. Lacking comprehensive theoretical insight, we experimentally trace the formation of a spectral cascade under these conditions. Using an externally driven fluid-fluid interface, we successfully resolve individual wave modes and track their real-time evolution from one to few to many. This process culminates in a steady state whose power spectral density is fully characterised by a power-law scaling. We further quantify specific interactions through statistical correlations to reveal a hierarchy in the wave-mixing order, thus confirming a key assumption of weak-wave turbulence. We present a comprehensive time-evolution analysis that is crucial in identifying critical points where the interface undergoes significant changes. Our findings validate that the interfacial dynamics can be effectively modelled using a weakly nonlinear Lagrangian theory, enabling us to explore its applicability to other out-of-equilibrium systems. Notably, we uncover intriguing connections to reheating scenarios following cosmic inflation in the early universe.</description>
