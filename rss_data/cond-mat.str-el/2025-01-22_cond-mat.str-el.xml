      <title>Unraveling screening mechanisms in Kondo impurities using an NRG-MPS-based method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Kondo effect is a hallmark of strongly-correlated systems, where an impurity's local degrees of freedom are screened by conduction electrons, forming a many-body singlet. With increasing degrees of freedom in the impurity, theoretical studies face significant challenges in accurately identifying and characterizing the underlying mechanisms that screen the impurity. In this work, we introduce a straightforward yet powerful methodology for identifying the formation of Kondo singlets and their screening mechanisms, by utilizing the numerical renormalization group (NRG) combined with the matrix product states (MPS) technique. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on the single and two-level Anderson impurity models (AIM). Furthermore, we discuss potential generalizations of the method to multichannel and multiorbital Kondo impurities. Harnessing advanced tensor network techniques, our approach extends to complex impurity systems, offering a robust and versatile framework for studying Kondo physics.</description>

      <title>On the correlation between entanglement and the negative sign problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11022v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we study the correlation between entanglement and the negative sign problem in quantum Monte Carlo for the simulation of low-dimensional strongly correlated quantum many body systems. Entanglement entropy characterizes the difficulty of many-body simulation with tensor network state related methods, while the average sign measures the difficulty in many-body simulation for a variety of quantum Monte Carlo methods. Although there exist cases where one type of method works better than the other, it is desirable to find the possible correlation between entanglement and average sign for general hard strongly correlated systems regarding computational complexity. We take the doped two-dimensional Hubbard model as an example and numerically calculate the doping evolution of both the entanglement in the ground state with Density Matrix Renormalization Group and the average sign in the Auxiliary Field Quantum Monte Carlo simulation at low temperature. The results show that they are indeed correlated. The entanglement entropy (average sign) shows a peak (dip) around 20% doping, indicating that it is the difficult region for both methods. The vicinity of 20% doping is also the most intriguing region in both the Hubbard model and cuprate high-Tc superconductors where competing states with close energy intertwine with each other. Recognizing the correlation between entanglement and average sign provides new insight into our understanding of the difficulty in the simulation of strongly correlated quantum many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Frustrated magnetism in antiferromagnetic nonsymmorphic square-net lattice: NdSbSe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11038v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spintronics has emerged as a field of vast applicability, and layered magnetic materials have served as a ground for advancement in this direction. Here, we report the synthesis and detailed magnetic and specific heat studies on NdSbSe, (a ZrSiS-based structure) magnetic topological material. The temperature-dependent magnetization shows the presence of competing magnetic interactions ($T_N&lt;T&lt;150$ K) in addition to a long-range antiferromagnetic (AFM) ordering below 4.2~K. In the AFM state, the isothermal magnetization confirms spin reorientation to the critical magnetic field of 40 kOe. Frequency-dependent ac-susceptibility measurements have probed the nonequilibrium dynamics of frustrated magnetic moments (near 150 K). The $\lambda$-like peak at 3.8~K observed in the specific heat shifts to a lower temperature with applied magnetic fields and validates the AFM order. In addition, the specific heat does not exhibit any sign corresponding to the short-range magnetic order near 150 K (spin-glass-like memory effect). In addition, the derived parameters from specific heat suggest the presence of a strong electronic correlation in NdSbSe, resulting in a Kondo-like signature in temperature-dependent resistivity data.</description>

      <title>On the Topological Features of the Helical Phase Transition in MnSi</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many decades of study have revealed very unusual properties of the helical phase transition in MnSi. This situation is briefly described and illustrated in the present note. As one will be able to see, one peculiarity is that the phase transition point in MnSi is accompanied by extremes of different thermodynamic and kinetic quantities on the high temperature side of the transition, which look similar to a property of 2D systems. The whole situation can be tentatively described as a phase transformation of the helical phase of MnSi to the paramagnetic state, which occurs in two steps, first as a first order phase transition and then following a breakdown of topological objects such as spin vortices.</description>

      <title>One-dimensional confined Rashba states in a two-dimensional Si$_{2}$Bi$_{2}$ induced by vacancy line defects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advanced defect engineering techniques have enabled the creation of unique quantum phases from pristine materials. One-dimensional (1D) atomic defects in low-dimensional systems are particularly intriguing due to their distinct quantum properties, such as 1D Rashba states that allow for the generation of nondissipative spin currents, making them ideal for spintronic devices. Using density-functional calculations and model-based symmetry analysis, we report the emergence of 1D Rashba states in a two-dimensional Si$_{2}$Bi$_{2}$ monolayer (ML) with vacancy line defects (VLDs). We show that introducing VLDs in the Si$_{2}$Bi$_{2}$ ML induces 1D confined defect states near the Fermi level, which are strongly localized along the extended defect line. Notably, we observed 1D Rashba spin-split bands in these defect states with significant spin splitting originating mainly from the strong $p-p$ coupling orbitals between Si and Bi atoms near the defect sites. These spin-split defect states exhibit perfectly collinear spin polarization in momentum $\vec{k}$-space, which is oriented perpendicularly to the VLD orientation. Moreover, using $\vec{k}\cdot\vec{p}$ perturbation theory supplemented with symmetry analysis, we show that the 1D Rashba states with collinear spin polarization are enforced by the lowering of symmetry of the VLDs into the $C_{s}$ point group, which retains the $M_{xz}$ mirror symmetry along with the 1D nature of the VLDs. The observed 1D Rashba states in this system protect carriers against spin decoherence and support an exceptionally long spin lifetime, which could be promising for developing highly efficient spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Almost Strong Zero Modes at Finite Temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interacting fermionic chains exhibit extended regions of topological degeneracy of their ground states as a result of the presence of Majorana or parafermionic zero modes localized at the edges. In the opposite limit of infinite temperature, the corresponding non-integrable spin chains, obtained via generalized Jordan-Wigner mapping, are known to host so-called Almost Strong Zero Modes, which are long-lived with respect to any bulk excitations. Here, we study the fairly unexplored territory that bridges these two extreme cases of zero and infinite temperature. We blend two established techniques for states, the Lanczos series expansion and a tensor network ansatz, uplifting them to the level of operator algebra. This allows us to efficiently simulate large system sizes for arbitrarily long timescales and to extract the temperature-dependent decay rates. We observe that for the Kitaev-Hubbard model, the decay rate of the edge mode depends exponentially on the inverse temperature $\beta$, and on an effective energy scale $\Delta_{\rm eff}$ that is greater than the thermodynamic gap of the system $\Delta$.</description>

      <title>Quantum Criticality of Type-I and Critically Tilted Dirac Semimetals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11143v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the universality of an Ising symmetry breaking phase transition of tilted two-dimensional Dirac fermions, in the type-I phase as well as at the Lifshitz transition between a type-I and a type-II semimetal, where the Fermi surface changes from point-like to one with electron and hole pockets that touch at the overtilted Dirac cones. We compute the Landau damping of long-wavelength order parameter fluctuations by tilted Dirac fermions and use the resulting IR propagator as input for a renormalisation-group analysis of the resulting Gross-Neveu-Yukawa field theory. We first demonstrate that the criticality of tilted type-I fermions is controlled by a line of fixed points along which the poles of the renormalised Green function correspond to an untilted Dirac spectrum with varying anisotropy of Fermi velocities. At the phase transition the Lorentz invariance is restored, resulting in the same critical exponents as for conventional Dirac systems. The multicritical point is given by the endpoint of the fixed-point line. It can be approached along any path in parameter space that avoids the fixed point line of the critical type-I semimetal. We show that the critical exponents at the Lifshitz point are different and that Lorentz invariance is broken.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Hall effect driven by spin-charge-coupled motive force</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Parity-time-reversal symmetric ($\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric) magnets have garnered much attention due to their spin-charge coupled dynamics enriched by the parity-symmetry breaking. By real-time simulations, we study how localized spin dynamics can affect the nonlinear Hall effect in $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric magnets. To identify the leading-order term, we derive analytical expressions for the second-order optical response and classify the contributions by considering their transformation properties under $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry. Notably, our results reveal that the sizable contribution is attributed to the mixed dipole effect, which is analogous to the Berry curvature dipole term.</description>

      <title>Spin-phonon coupling and thermal Hall effect in Kitaev spin liquid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11272v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kitaev spin liquid (KSL), consisting of the bond direction-dependent spin interactions in the honeycomb lattice, attracts huge attention because of its exact solvability and prospect for applications to quantum computing. An important feature of KSL is the half-quantized thermal Hall conductivity (HQTHC) under the magnetic field perpendicular to the lattice, but HQTHC stands only at low temperatures. Here, in the temperature range beyond the HQTHC regime, we theoretically propose the extrinsic phonon contribution to thermal Hall Effect in KSL via the skew-scattering of chiral phonons by the scalar spin chirality, which was previously studied in Mott insulators. We show the emergence of the scalar spin chirality of fluctuating spins, estimate the emergent field strength and its symmetric form applied to the chiral phonons, and obtain the associated thermal Hall conductivity, which is semi-quantitatively consistent with the existing experiments. This work provides a basic understanding of the role of spin-phonon interactions in strongly correlated systems.</description>

      <title>Band representations in Strongly Correlated Settings: The Kitaev Honeycomb Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the study of quantum spin liquids, the Kitaev model plays a pivotal role due to the fact that its ground state is exactly known as well as the fact that it may be realized in strongly frustrated materials such as ${\alpha}$-RuCl${}_3$. While topological insulators and superconductors can be investigated by means of topological band theory -- in particular the topological quantum chemistry (TQC) formalism -- the Kitaev model evades such a treatment, as it is not possible to set up a proper single-particle Green's function for it. We instead associate spin operators with ``orbitals'' that give rise to a band structure. It is thereby possible to analyze the corresponding excitation spectrum engendered by these localized excitations by means of TQC. Special attention is given to the low-energy topological edge mode spectrum. Our work sheds light on the question how the TQC formalism may be generalized to strongly correlated and topologically ordered systems like the Kitaev model.</description>

      <title>Strain induced topological phase transitions in split and line graphs of bipartite lattices featuring flat bands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, materials with topological flat bands have attracted significant attention due to their association with extraordinary transport properties and strongly correlated electrons. This includes phenomena such as high-temperature superconductivity, magnetism, Wigner crystallization, and Mott-insulating behavior. Among these systems, two-dimensional (2D) materials are particularly compelling as they can host electronic states with unique band structures, such as dispersionless states alongside linearly dispersive Dirac cones. In this work, we use tight-binding models to comprehensively investigate a class of 2D lattices that generically support flat bands, and focus on the effects of strain on their electronic and topological properties. The studied lattices are constructed within a unifying graph-theoretic framework, whereupon split-graph and line-graph operations on bipartite square and hexagonal lattices are employed to generate new structures. In the absence of strain, the introduction of spin-orbit coupling (SOC) induces a bulk excitation gap, which transforms flat bands into quasi-flat bands with topologically nontrivial characteristics. By tuning system parameters and external strain, we observe the emergence of directional flat bands, and tilted and semi-Dirac cones. Remarkably, all lattices studied show phase transitions among trivial insulating, semimetallic, and topological phases. Our results highlight the potential of strain engineering as a versatile tool for manipulating electronic and topological phases in a wide variety of 2D materials.</description>

      <title>Hybridization induced quantum phase transition in bilayer Hubbard model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inspired by the recent experimental report on the pressure induced superconductor-insulator transition in cuprate superconductors as well as the superconductivity of the Ruddlesden-Popper-phase La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ under high pressure, we systematically investigated the single-orbital bilayer Hubbard model in the regime of large interlayer hybridization to mimic the pressure effects. We map out the phase diagram of interlayer hybridization versus density in the regime of intermediate to strong hybridization. In particular, we found that the sufficiently strong hybridization can destroy the $s^{\pm}$-wave pairing and induces its transition to correlated metallic, pseudogap, and Fermi liquid phases depending on the doping regime. The phase diagram hosted by the bilayer model implies its role as the versatile platform to explore the pressure effects on the two-dimensional to three-dimensional crossover physics of Hubbard-type models.</description>

      <title>Unusual magnetic order, field induced melting and role of spin-lattice coupling in 2D Van der Waals materials: a case study of CrSiTe3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12019v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) Van der Waals compounds exhibit interesting electronic and magnetic properties due to complex intra-layer and inter-layer interactions, which are of immense importance in realizing exotic physics as well as advanced technology. Various experimental and theoretical studies led to significantly different ground state properties often contrasting each other. Here, we studied a novel 2D material, CrSiTe3 employing magnetic, specific heat and Raman measurements. Experimental results reveal evidence of incipient antiferromagnetism below 1 kOe concomitant to ferromagnetic order at 33 K. Antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic interactions coexists at low field in the temperature regime, 15 - 33 K. Low field data reveal an additional magnetic order below 15 K, which melts on application of external magnetic field and remain dark in the heat capacity data. Raman spectra exhibit anomalies at the magnetic transitions; an evidence of strong spin-lattice coupling. Below 15 K, Eg modes exhibit hardening while Ag modes become significantly softer suggesting weakening of the inter-layer coupling at low temperatures which might be a reason for the unusual magnetic ground state and field induced melting of the magnetic order. These results reveal evidence of exceptional ground state properties linked to spin-lattice coupling and also suggest a pathway to study complex magnetism in such technologically important materials.</description>

      <title>On the pseudo-doublet ground state of the non-Kramers compound SrTm2O4 and its frustrated antiferromagnetic interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12035v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Here we present experimental evidence of the pseudo-doublet ground state of the non-Kramers compound SrTm2O4, based on specific heat, magnetic entropy and electron paramagnetic resonance. We demonstrate that the two crystallographic Tm3+ sites give rise to distinct single-ion anisotropies, and by extension, SrTm2O4 hosts two magnetic sublattices. Inelastic neutron scattering reveals low-lying dispersing crystal-field excitations, which we modelled using an effective charge model and mean field random phase approximation. The extracted magnetic exchange interactions are both antiferromagnetic and frustrated for both chains. Interchain magnetic exchange interactions are negligible. The strength of the magnetic exchange interactions in relation to the size of crystal field gaps, together with the frustration and low dimensionality, force the system to remain paramagnetic down to the lowest experimentally reachable temperature despite the pseudo-doublet nature of its ground state.</description>

Abstract: The experimental determination of the magnitude and momentum dependence of electron-phonon coupling (EPC) is an outstanding problem in condensed matter physics. Resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) has been previously employed to determine the EPC, since the intensity of phonon peaks in RIXS spectra has been directly related to the underlying EPC strength. In order to assess the limits of validity of such a relation, we compare experimental results and theoretical predictions for several high-T$_c$ superconducting cuprates. Namely, we investigate the intensity of the bond-stretching phonon mode in CaCuO$_2$, La$_2$CuO$_{4+\delta}$, La$_{1.84}$Sr$_{0.16}$CuO$_4$ and YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-\delta}$ along the high symmetry ($\zeta$,0), ($\zeta$,$\zeta$) directions and as a function of the azimuthal angle $\phi$ at fixed modulus of the in-plane momentum $\mathbf{q_\parallel}$. Using two different theoretical approaches for the description of the RIXS scattering from phonons, we find that the $\mathbf{q_\parallel}$-dependence of the RIXS intensity can be largely ascribed to the symmetry of the phonon mode, and that satisfactory prediction of the experimental results cannot be obtained without including realistic details of the electronic structure in the calculations. Regardless of the theoretical model, RIXS provides a reliable momentum dependence of EPC in cuprates and can be used to test advanced theoretical predictions.</description>

      <title>A glance to Luttinger liquid and its platforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The concept of a Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid (TLL) has been established as a fundamental theory for the understanding of one-dimensional quantum systems. Originally formulated as a replacement for Landau's Fermi-liquid theory, which accurately predicts the behaviour of most 3D metals but fails dramatically in 1D, the TLL description applies to a even broader class of 1D systems,including bosons and anyons. After a certain number of theoretical breakthroughs, its descriptive power has now been confirmed experimentally in different experimental platforms. They extend from organic conductors, carbon nanotubes, quantum wires, topological edge states of quantum spin Hall insulators to cold atoms, Josephson junctions, Bose liquids confined within 1D nanocapillaries and spin chains. In the ground state of such systems, quantum fluctuations become correlated on all length scales, but, counter-intuitively, no long-range order exists. In this respect, this review will illustrate the validity of conformal field theory for describing real-world systems, establishing the boundaries for its application and, on the other side will discuss the spectacular demonstration of how the quantum-critical TLL state governs the properties of many-body systems in one dimension.</description>

      <title>Magnetism in symmetry-enforced nodal-line semimetals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nodal-line semimetals (NLSMs) harbor a variety of novel physical properties owing to the particularities of the band degeneracies that characterize the spectrum of these materials. In symmetry-enforced NLSMs, band degeneracies, being imposed by symmetries, are robust to arbitrarily strong perturbations that preserve the symmetries. We investigate the effects of electron-electron interactions on a recently proposed vacancy-engineered NLSM known as holey graphene. Using mean-field calculations and quantum Monte Carlo simulation, we show that the Hubbard model on the depleted holey-graphene lattice at half-filling exhibits a transition from a NLSM to an insulating antiferromagnetic phase for an arbitrarily weak repulsive interaction $U$. In contrast to the semi-metal-insulator transition in the pristine honeycomb lattice, which occurs at a finite critical value of $U$, in the depleted lattice, the transition at $U=0$ is associated with a van Hove singularity arising from the crossing of accidental nodal lines enforced by symmetry. We also employ linear spin wave theory (LSWT) to the effective Heisenberg model in the strong-coupling limit and obtain the global antiferromagnetic order parameter $m_{\rm AFM} \approx 0.146$. The order parameters from both QMC and LSWT agree quantitatively. Our findings indicate that vacancy engineering offers an effective way to tailor the magnetic properties of quantum materials.</description>

      <title>Reply to comment on "Controlled bond expansion for Density Matrix Renormalization Group ground state search at single-site costs"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We reply to McCulloch and Osborne's recent comment on our manuscript (Phys. Rev. Lett. 130, 246402 (2023)) on controlled bond expansion (CBE) for density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) ground state search. We appreciate their suggestion to consider randomized SVD and address their constructive critique on the variational properties of CBE-DMRG. However, we strongly disagree with their proposal to omit the projection to the 2-site tangent space and explain its importance for efficient bond expansion. In particular, in the context of CBE applied to the time-dependent variational principle (TDVP), we show that omitting this projection can lead to avoidable errors. Lastly, we emphasize the complementary roles of 3S mixing and CBE, reiterating our recommendation from Phys. Rev. Lett. 130, 246402 (2023) to combine both methods (CBE+$\alpha$). We provide examples to demonstrate the superior efficiency and robustness of CBE+$\alpha$.</description>

      <title>Charge-density-wave quantum critical point under pressure in 2$H$-TaSe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12315v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Suppressing of an ordered state that competes with superconductivity is one route to enhance superconducting transition temperatures. Whereas the effect of suppressing magnetic states is still not fully understood, materials featuring charge-density waves and superconductivity offer a clearer scenario as both states can be associated with electron-phonon coupling. Metallic transition-metal dichalcogenides are prime examples for such intertwined electron-phonon-driven phases, yet, various compounds do not show the expected interrelation or feature additional mechanisms which makes an unambiguous interpretation difficult. Here, we report high-pressure X-ray diffraction and inelastic X-ray scattering measurements of the prototypical transition-metal dichalcogenide 2$H$-TaSe$_2$ and determine the evolution of the charge-density-wave state and its lattice dynamics up to and beyond its suppression at the critical pressure $p_c = 19.9(1)\,\rm{GPa}$ and at low temperatures. The high quality of our data allows the full refinement of the commensurate charge-density-wave superstructure at low pressure and we find the quantum critical point of the charge-density-wave to be in close vicinity to the reported maximum superconducting transition temperature $T_{sc} = 8.2\,\rm{K}$. $Ab-initio$ calculations corroborate that 2$H$-TaSe$_2$ is a reference example of order-suppressed enhanced superconductivity and can serve as a textbook case to investigate superconductivity near a charge-density-wave quantum critical point.</description>

      <title>Stability of the $\pi$-Flux Phase for $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ Lattice Gauge Theory Coupled to Fermionic Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10065v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the two-dimensional $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ Ising gauge theory coupled to fermionic matter. In absence of electric fields, we prove that, at half-filling, the ground state of the gauge theory coincides with the $\pi$-flux phase, associated with magnetic flux equal to $\pi$ in every elementary lattice plaquette, provided the fermionic hopping is large enough. This proves in particular the semimetallic behavior of the ground state of the model. Furthermore, we compute the magnetic susceptibility of the gauge theory, and we prove that it is given by the one of massless $2d$ Dirac fermions, thus rigorously justifying recent numerical computations. The proof is based on reflection positivity and chessboard estimates, and on lattice conservation laws for the computation of the transport coefficient.</description>

      <title>Parent Lindbladians for Matrix Product Density Operators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.10552v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding quantum phases of matter is a fundamental goal in physics. For pure states, the representatives of phases are the ground states of locally interacting Hamiltonians, which are also renormalization fixed points (RFPs). These RFP states are exactly described by tensor networks. Extending this framework to mixed states, matrix product density operators (MPDOs) which are RFPs are believed to encapsulate mixed-state phases of matter in one dimension. However, it remains an open question whether, by analogy, such MPDO RFPs can be realized as steady states of local Lindbladians. In this work, we resolve this question by analytically constructing parent Lindbladians for MPDO RFPs. These Lindbladians are local, frustration-free, and exhibit minimal steady-state degeneracy. Interestingly, we find that parent Lindbladians possess a rich structure, including non-commutativity for certain classes of RFPs, distinguishing them from their Hamiltonian counterparts.</description>

      <title>Staggered Fermions with Chiral Anomaly Cancellation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10837v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the implications of the quantized vectorial and axial charges in the lattice Hamiltonian of multi-flavor staggered fermions in $(1+1)$ dimensions. These lattice charges coincide with those of the $U(1)_V$ and $U(1)_A$ global symmetries of Dirac fermions in the continuum limit, whose perturbative chiral anomaly matches the non-Abelian Onsager algebra on the lattice. In this note, we focus on the lattice models that flow to continuum quantum field theories of Dirac fermions that are free from the perturbative chiral anomaly between $U(1)_V$ and $U(1)_A$. In a lattice model that flows to two Dirac fermions, we identify quadratic Hamiltonian deformations that can gap the system while fully preserving both the vectorial and axial charges on the lattice. These deformations flow to the usual symmetry-preserving Dirac mass terms in the continuum. Additionally, we propose a lattice model that flows to the chiral fermion $3-4-5-0$ model in the continuum by using these lattice charges, and we discuss the multi-fermion interactions that can generate a mass gap in the paradigm of symmetric mass generation.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian Lattice Gauge Theories: emergent properties from Tensor Network methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11115v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This thesis develops advanced Tensor Network (TN) methods to address Hamiltonian Lattice Gauge Theories (LGTs), overcoming limitations in real-time dynamics and finite-density regimes. A novel dressed-site formalism is introduced, enabling efficient truncation of gauge fields while preserving gauge invariance for both Abelian and non-Abelian theories. This formalism is successfully applied to SU(2) Yang-Mills LGTs in two dimensions, providing the first TN simulations of this system and revealing critical aspects of its phase diagram and non-equilibrium behavior, such as a Quantum Many-Body (QMB) scarring dynamics. A generalization of the dressed-site formalism is proposed through a new fermion-to-qubit mapping for general lattice fermion theories, revealing powerful for classical and quantum simulations. Numerical innovations, including the use of optimal space-filling curves such as the Hilbert curve to preserve locality in high-dimensional simulations, further enhance the efficiency of these methods. Together with high-performance computing techniques, these advances open current and future development pathways toward optimized, efficient, and faster simulations on scales comparable to Monte Carlo state-of-the-art.</description>

      <title>Electronic States and Mechanical Behaviors of Phosphorus Carbide Nanotubes -- Structural and Quantum Phase Transitions in a Quasi-one-dimensional Material</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11239v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quasi-one-dimensional (1D) materials can manifest exotic electronic properties in manners that are distinct from the bulk phase or other low-dimensional systems. Helical symmetries in such materials -- e.g., nanotubes with intrinsic or applied twist -- can simultaneously lead to strong electronic correlation and anomalous transport behavior. However, these materials remain underexplored, in part due to computational challenges. Using specialized symmetry-adapted first-principles calculations, we show that mono-layer $P_2C_3$ -- identified in a previous letter to possess ``double Kagome bands'' -- exhibits a number of striking properties when rolled up into phosphorous carbide nanotubes ($P_2C_3$NTs). Both armchair and zigzag $P_2C_3$NTs are stable at room temperature and display a degenerate combination of Dirac points and electronic flat bands at the Fermi level. Notably, these flat bands are highly resilient to elastic deformations. Large strains can transform the nanotube structure from honeycomb-kagome to ``brick-wall'', and trigger multiple quantum phase transitions. Edge states in $P_2C_3$NTs, spin-degeneracy lifting induced by vacancies and dopants, and strain-tunable magnetism are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Microscopic evidence of charge- and spin-density waves in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7-\delta}$ revealed by $^{139}$La-NQR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11248v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent discovery of superconductivity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7-\delta}$ with a transition temperature $T_c$ close to 80 K at high pressures has attracted significant attention, due particularly to a possible density wave (DW) transition occurring near the superconducting dome. Identifying the type of DW order is crucial for understanding the origin of superconductivity in this system. However, owing to the presence of La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ and other intergrowth phases in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7-\delta}$ samples, extracting the intrinsic information from the La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ phase is challenging. In this study, we employed $^{139}$La nuclear quadrupole resonance (NQR) measurements to eliminate the influence of other structural phases in the sample and obtain microscopic insights into the DW transition in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7-\delta}$. Below the DW transition temperature $T_{\rm DW} \sim$ 153K, we observe a distinct splitting in the $\pm$ 5/2 $\leftrightarrow$ $\pm$ 7/2 transition of the NQR resonance peak at the La(2) site, while only a line broadening is seen in the $\pm$ 3/2 $\leftrightarrow$ $\pm$ 5/2 transition peak. Through further analysis of the spectra, we show that the line splitting is due to the unidirectional charge modulation. A magnetic line broadening is also observed below $T_{\rm DW}$, accompanied by a large enhancement of the spin-lattice relaxation rate, indicating the formation of magnetic ordered moments in the DW state. Our results suggest the formation of charge- and spin-density wave order in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7-\delta}$ simultaneously, thereby offering critical insights into the electronic correlations in Ni-based superconductors.</description>

      <title>Optical control of the crystal structure in the bilayer nickelate superconductor La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ via nonlinear phononics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11377v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Superconductivity in the bilayer nickelate La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ occurs when the interlayer Ni-O-Ni bond angle becomes straight under pressure, suggesting a strong relationship between the crystal structure and the emergence of superconductivity. In this study, we theoretically propose a way to control the crystal structure of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ toward the tetragonal symmetry via light irradiation instead of pressure using the idea of nonlinear phononics. Here, resonant optical excitation of an infrared-active (IR) lattice vibration induces a nonlinear Raman-mode displacement through the anharmonic phonon-phonon coupling. We calculate the light-induced phonon dynamics on the anharmonic lattice potential determined by first-principles calculation. We find that the interlayer Ni-O-Ni bond angle gets slightly closer to straight when an appropriate IR mode is selectively excited. Our study suggests that light irradiation can be a promising way for structural control of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11519v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a new geometric characterization of generalized Landau levels (GLLs). The GLLs are a generalization of Landau levels to non-uniform Berry curvature, and are mathematically defined in terms of a holomorphic curve -- an ideal K\"ahler band -- and its associated unitary Frenet-Serret moving frame. Here, we find that GLLs are harmonic maps from the Brillouin zone to the complex projective space and they are critical points of the Dirichlet energy functional, as well as the static structure factor up to fourth order. We also find that filled GLLs exhibit quantized Hall viscosity, similar to the ordinary Landau levels. These results establish GLLs as a versatile generalization of Landau levels.</description>

      <title>Evidence of pseudogap and absence of spin magnetism in the time-reversal-symmetry-breaking state of Ba$_{1-x}$K$_x$Fe$_2$As$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11936v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Muon-spin-rotation ($\mu$SR) experiments and the observation of a spontaneous Nernst effect indicate time-reversal symmetry breaking (BTRS) at $T_{\rm c}^{\rm Z2}$ above the superconducting transition temperature $T_{\rm c}$ in Ba$_{1-x}$K$_x$Fe$_2$As$_2$, with $x\approx0.8$. Further studies have pointed out that BTRS is caused by the formation of a new state of matter associated with the condensation of pairs of electron pairs. Despite exhibiting multiple unconventional effects that warrant further investigation, the electronic spectral properties of this electron quadrupling state remain largely unexplored. Here, we present detailed $^{75}$As nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) measurements of Ba$_{1-x}$K$_x$Fe$_2$As$_2$, with $x = 0.77$, which has $T_{\rm c}^{\rm Z2}$ &gt; $T_{\rm c}$ according to measurements of the spontaneous Nernst effect. The NMR data obtained in this work provide the first direct electronic spectral characteristics of the electron quadrupling state by indicating that it evolves from a pseudogap that sets in at $T^*$ well above $T_{\rm c}^{\rm Z2}$. This pseudogap behavior is consistent with $\mu$SR Knight-shift, specific-heat, and transport data indicating the formation of a bound state of electrons. According to a theory of electron quadrupling condensates, such bound-state formations should precede the onset of BTRS correlations between pairs of electron pairs. The second important insight from NMR data is the absence of spin-related magnetism. The temperature dependence of the spin-lattice relaxation rate $1/T_1T$ and the evolution of the NMR linewidth prove the absence of a magnetic transition at $T_{\rm c}^{\rm Z2}$ and rule out even a proximity to some magnetic instability. This indicates that the spontaneous magnetic fields detected in this compound are not caused by spin magnetism but are associated with persistent real-space currents.</description>

      <title>Evaluating many-body stabilizer R\'enyi entropy by sampling reduced Pauli strings: singularities, volume law, and nonlocal magic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12146v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel quantum Monte Carlo scheme for evaluating the $\alpha$-stabilizer R\'enyi entropy (SRE) with any integer $\alpha\ge 2$. By interpreting $\alpha$-SRE as a ratio of generalized partition functions, we prove that it can be simulated by sampling reduced Pauli strings within a reduced configuration space. This allows for straightforward computation of the values and derivatives of $\alpha$-SRE using techniques such as reweight-annealing and thermodynamic integration. Moreover, our approach separates the free energy contribution in $\alpha$-SRE, thus the contribution solely from the characteristic function can be studied, which is directly tied to magic. In our applications to the ground states of 1D and 2D transverse field Ising (TFI) model, we reveal that the behavior of $2$-SRE is governed by the interplay between the characteristic function and the free energy contributions, with singularities hidden in both of their derivatives at quantum critical points. This indicates that $\alpha$-SRE does not necessarily exhibit a peak at the quantum critical point for a general many-body system. We also study the volume-law corrections to the ground-state magic. These corrections slightly violate the strict volume law and suggest discontinuity at quantum critical points, which we attribute to the abrupt change of the ground-state magical structure. Our findings suggest that volume-law corrections of magic are stronger diagnostics for criticalities than the full-state magic. Lastly, we study the finite-temperature phase transition of the 2D TFI model, where the $2$-SRE is not a well-defined magic measure. The nonphysical results we obtain also prove the ineffectiveness of $2$-SRE for mixed states. Our method enables scalable and efficient evaluation of $\alpha$-SRE in large-scale quantum systems, providing a powerful tool for exploring the roles of magic in many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Trampoline Resonators from (La,Sr)MnO3 Single-Crystal Thin Films</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.12177v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Micro-electro-mechanical resonators employing a magnetic element have been proposed for magnetic field sensing applications, but the integration of magnetic materials with standard semiconductor compounds is challenging and requires complex fabrication protocols. We present a different approach relying on (La0.7,Sr0.3)MnO3 (LSMO), an oxide compound that works both as structural element for the resonator and functional magnetic layer. Suspended trampolines are realized in a single step process from LSMO thin films and show quality factor up to 60k and fQ products reaching 10$^{10}$ Hz. Their magnetic properties are probed by a SQUID magnetometer and magnetic force microscopy, showing saturation magnetization of 240 kA/m at room temperature and in-plane magnetic domains with coercivity of 2.5 mT. Being entirely made from a magnetic material, these resonators exhibit a larger magnetic interaction volume compared to other solutions, making them ideal candidates as building blocks for high-sensitivity magnetic field sensors.</description>

Abstract: We introduce two disorder-free variants of the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model, demonstrate their integrability, and study their static and dynamical properties. Unlike diagrammatic techniques, the integrability of these models allows us to obtain dynamical correlation functions even when the number of Majorana fermions is finite. From the solutions, we find that out-of-time-order correlators (OTOCs) in these models exhibit exponential growth at early times, resembling that of quantum chaotic systems, such as those with disorder or external kick terms, despite their large $N$ behavior differing from that of typical chaotic systems. Conversely, our analysis shows no evidence of random-matrix behavior in level statistics or the spectral form factor. Our findings illustrate that the clean versions of the SYK models represent simple but nontrivial examples of disorder-free quantum many-body systems displaying chaos-like behavior of OTOCs.</description>

      <title>Magnon spectrum of altermagnets beyond linear spin wave theory: Magnon-magnon interactions via time-dependent matrix product states vs. atomistic spin dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.19433v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The energy-momentum dispersion of magnons, as collective low-energy excitations of magnetic material, is computed from an effective quantum spin Hamiltonian but simplified via linearized Holstein-Primakoff transformations to describe noninteracting magnons. The dispersion produced by such linear spin wave theory (LSWT) is then plotted as ``sharp bands'' of infinitely long-lived quasiparticles. However, magnons are prone to many-body interactions with other quasiparticles -- such as electrons, phonons or other magnons -- which can lead to shifting (i.e., band renormalization) and broadening of ``sharp bands'' as the signature of finite quasiparticle lifetime. The magnon-magnon interactions can be particularly important in antiferromagnets (AFs), and, therefore, possibly in newly classified altermagnets sharing many features of collinear AFs. Here, we employ nonperturbative quantum many-body calculations, via time-dependent matrix product states (TDMPS), to obtain magnon spectral function for RuO$_2$ altermagnet whose effective quantum spin Hamiltonian is put onto 4-leg cylinder. Its upper band is shifted away from upper ``sharp band'' of LSWT, as well as broadened, which is explained as the consequence of {\em hybridization} of the latter with three-magnon continuum. This implies that two-magnon Raman scattering spectra {\em cannot} be computed from LSWT bands, which offers a litmus test for the relevance of magnon-magnon interactions. Finally, we employ atomistic spin dynamics (ASD) simulations, based on classical Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (LLG) equation, to obtain magnon spectrum at finite temperature and/or at a fraction of the cost of TDMPS calculations. Despite including magnon-magnon interactions via nonlinearity of LLG equation, ASD simulations {\em cannot} match the TDMPS-computed magnon spectrum, thereby signaling {\em nonclassical} effects harbored by AFs and altermagnets.</description>

      <title>Signatures of spinon dynamics and phase structure of dipolar-octupolar quantum spin ices in two-dimensional coherent spectroscopy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01472v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study how sharp signatures of fractionalization emerge in nonlinear spectroscopy experiments on spin liquids with separated energy scales. Our model is that of dipolar-octupolar rare earth pyrochlore materials, prime candidates for realising quantum spin ice. This family of three dimensional quantum spin liquids exhibits fractionalization of spin degrees of freedom into spinons charged under an emergent $U(1)$ gauge field. We show that the technique of two dimensional coherent spectroscopy (2DCS) can identify clear signatures of fractionalised spinon dynamics in dipolar-octupolar quantum spin ices. However, at intermediate temperatures, spinon dynamics are heavily constrained in the presence of an incoherent spin background, leading to a broad 2DCS response. At lower temperatures, a sharp signal emerges as the system enters a coherent spin liquid state. This lower temperature signal can in turn distinguish between zero-flux and $\pi$-flux forms of quantum spin ice.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06816v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The properties and experimental identification of quantum spin liquids (QSLs) remain an important topic with many fundamental questions. Here, we explore the dynamics of a single charge dopant (hole) in a $t$-$J_{1}$-$J_{2}$ model on a square lattice, which realizes a gapless $\mathbb{Z}_2$ QSL at half filling. Using a field theory approach based on the parton construction, which includes an infinite number of scatterings between the low-energy quasiparticle excitations of the QSL via a self-consistent Born approximation, we calculate both the equilibrium and nonequilibrium properties of the hole for weak and strong interactions. Quasiparticle branches as well as stringlike excitations of the holon are identified, and we furthermore explore the time-dependent spreading of a hole throughout the QSL after it has been injected at a given lattice site. The final ballistic expansion speed is shown to exhibit a nonmonotonic behavior as a quantum phase transition between an antiferromagnetic and the QSL phase is crossed, which is caused by a qualitative change in the fundamental kinematics of the interactions between the hole and the surrounding spins. Our results demonstrate how charge dopants can be used as a quantum probe for QSLs and are directly relevant to optical lattice experiments with single site resolution.</description>

      <title>Induction of non-Fermi liquids by critical cavity photons at the onset of superradiance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10963v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the emergence of a non-Fermi liquid (NFL) at a putative quantum critical point signalling the onset of superradiance, in a set-up involving cavity quantum electrodynamics. Although the finiteness of the cavity, being bounded by reflecting mirrors, endows the cavity photons with an effective mass, they become massless at the continuous phase-transition point. We consider the matter part coming from the fermions hopping on a honeycomb lattice near half-filling, featuring doped Dirac cones at two sets of inequivalent valleys. This choice is dictated by the presence of a fermion-boson interaction vertex, which can give rise to Landau damping of the critical bosons, eventually leading to an NFL phase for the fermions. To set up the quantum effective action, we identify the hot-spots of the generically anisotropic (trigonally-warped) Fermi surfaces, which give the sets of points having parallel/antiparallel tangent vectors. The cavity photons act as charge density wave (CDW) order parameters, connecting pairs of hot-spots belonging to the Fermi surface of a single valley. With these ingredients, we set upon identifying NFL phases, using the tools of dimensional regularization and renormalization-group-flow equations. Our final results indicate that stable NFL phases exist in the low-energy limit, for the projections of the flows along the CDW coupling constant.</description>

      <title>Quantum-metric-induced giant and reversible nonreciprocal transport phenomena in chiral loop-current phases of kagome metals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.04233v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Rich spontaneous symmetry-breaking phenomena with nontrivial quantum geometric properties in metals represent central issues in condensed matter physics. In this context, the emergence of chiral loop-current order, accompanied by time-reversal symmetry-symmetry breaking in various kagome metals, has garnered significant attention. Particularly noteworthy is the giant electrical magnetochiral anisotropy (eMChA) in CsV3Sb5, which provides compelling evidence of time-reversal-symmetry and inversion-symmetry breakings. However, the underlying essence of this observation has remained obscured due to the lack of theoretical understanding. Here, we reveal that the loop-current order causes giant and reversible eMChA coefficient, $\gamma_{eM}$, is proportional to the loop-current-induced orbital magnetization $M_{orb}$ times the lifetime of conduction electrons $\tau$. In kagome metals, the derived $\gamma_{eM}$ is substantial and reversible by minute magnetic fields, due to the large $\tau (\gg a_0/v_{Fermi})$ and the field-induced reversal of $M_{orb}$. By considering the experimentally observed stripe charge-density wave, the loop-current state becomes non-centrosymmetric, thereby giving rise to the eMChA. Surprisingly, the quantum-metric, which defines a fundamental geometric aspect of Bloch wavefunctions, acquires significant momentum dependence in the loop-current phase, resulting in a dramatic enhancement of eMChA by $\sim100$ times. This research not only clarifies the fundamental symmetry-breaking states in kagome metals, but also opens a new path for exploring quantum-metric-induced phenomena arising from exotic quantum phase transitions in strongly correlated metals</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.13616v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In approximate ground states obtained from imaginary-time evolution, the spectrum of the state -- its decomposition into exact energy eigenstates -- falls off exponentially with the energy. Here we consider the energy spectra of approximate matrix product ground states, such as those obtained with the density matrix renormalization group. Despite the high accuracy of these states, contributions to the spectra are roughly constant out to surprisingly high energy, with an increase in the bond dimension reducing the amplitude but not the extent of these high-energy tails. The unusual spectra appear to be a general feature of compressed wavefunctions, independent of boundary or dimensionality, and are also observed in neural network wavefunctions. The unusual spectra can have a strong effect on sampling-based methods, yielding large fluctuations. The energy variance, which can be used to extrapolate observables to eliminate truncation error, is subject to these large fluctuations when sampled. Nevertheless, we devise a sampling-based variance approach which gives excellent and efficient extrapolations.</description>

Abstract: We present the theory of the longitudinal spin Seebeck effect between a Heisenberg spin-1/2 chain and a conductor. The effect consists of the generation of a spin current across the spin chain-conductor interface in response to the temperature difference between the two systems. In this setup, the current is given by the convolution of the local spin susceptibilities of the spin chain and the conductor. We find the spin current to be fully controlled, both in the magnitude and the sign, by the backscattering interaction between spinons, fractionalized spin excitations of the Heisenberg chain. In particular, it vanishes when the spinons form a non-interacting spinon gas. Our analytical results for the local spin susceptibility at the open end of the spin chain are in excellent agreement with numerical DMRG simulations.</description>

      <title>Tuning competition between charge order and superconductivity in the square-lattice $t$-$t'$-$J$ model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.15270v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, a flurry of works have found strong competition between charge density wave (CDW) and superconductivity (SC) in the doped Hubbard and $t$-$J$ models on the square lattice. Interestingly, some recent results suggest that the electron-phonon coupling may suppress CDW order and enhance SC. In this work, we consider the square-lattice Hubbard model with the Holstein or Su-Schrieffer-Heeger electron-phonon coupling at the large-$U$ and antiadiabatic (infinite phonon frequency) limit, which gives an effective $t$-$J$ model with either a density attractive interaction $V$ or a $J_P$ term that contributes a larger spin exchange and a density repulsive interaction. To explore how these effective couplings may suppress CDW and give a SC, we implement the density matrix renormalization group simulation on the $t$-$t'$-$J$ model with $V$ or $J_P$ coupling. We focus on the {\it six-leg} cylinder system with the next-nearest-neighbor hopping $t'$, which hosts partially filled stripe and $d$-wave SC in phase diagram. By tuning $t'/t &gt; 0$ and $V$ or $J_P$, we establish two quantum phase diagrams. In the SC phases, the increased $V$ or $J_P$ coupling can enhance the quasi-long-range SC order, consistent with some previous findings. Nonetheless, no SC emerges when the partially filled stripe phase disappears with increased $V$ or $J_P$. Instead, the system has a transition to either a phase-separation-like regime or a filled stripe phase. On the other hand, with increased $t'/t$, not only the partially filled stripe but the phase separation and filled stripe can also be tuned to SC phase. Our results suggest that although $V$ and $J_P$ couplings may strengthen hole binding, the hole dynamics controlled by $t'/t$ appears to play more crucial role for obtaining a SC in $t$-$J$ model.</description>

      <title>Deep Boundary Perturbations at a Quantum Critical Point</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12793v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we explore an unconventional class of problems in the study of (quantum) critical phenomena, termed "deep boundary criticality". Traditionally, critical systems are analyzed with two types of perturbations: those uniformly distributed throughout the bulk, which can significantly alter the bulk criticality by triggering a nontrivial bulk renormalization group flow, and those confined to a boundary or subdimensional defect, which affect only the boundary or defect condition. Here, we go beyond this paradigm by studying quantum critical systems with boundary perturbations that decay algebraically (following a power law) into the bulk. By continuously varying the decay exponent, such perturbations can transition between having no effect on the bulk and strongly influencing bulk behavior. We investigate this regime using two prototypical models based on (1+1)D massless Dirac fermions. Through a combination of analytical and numerical approaches, we uncover exotic scaling laws in simple observables and observe qualitative changes in model behavior as the decay exponent varies.</description>

Abstract: Motivated by the duality between elasticity and fracton gauge theory, we study an extension of the gauge group that includes the quadrupole moment. Remarkably, we find that spontaneous breaking of the quadrupole symmetry increases the number of massless excitations. This result appears to challenge the well-established paradigm, according to which gauge fields acquire mass through the Higgs mechanism, and the would-be Goldstone bosons are rendered massive. We refer to this phenomenon as the anti-Higgs mechanism. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the quadrupole gauge theory is dual to an exotic class of elastic systems, which we dub incompressible crystals. The anti-Higgs mechanism in the dual theory corresponds to a phase transition from the incompressible crystal state to an ordinary (compressible) solid.</description>

      <title>Infrared properties of two-dimensional $\mathrm{SU}(N)/H$ nonlinear $\sigma$ models at nonzero $\theta$ angles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17493v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A general strategy is proposed to explore the low-energy properties of two-dimensional nonlinear $\sigma$ models with $\theta$ terms. We demonstrate its application to nonlinear $\sigma$ models with the target space $\text{SU($N$)}$/H, which include $\mathbb{C}P^{N-1}$, complex Grassmannian manifolds as well as the flag $\text{SU($N$)}/\text{U(1)}^{N-1}$ and $\text{SU($N$)})/\text{SO($N$)}$ manifolds. By analyzing the symmetry and its anomaly content, we realize these nonlinear $\sigma$ models through perturbations added to the SU(N)$_1$ conformal field theory. For the flag-manifold $\text{SU($N$)}/\text{U(1)}^{N-1}$ and $\text{SU($N$)})/\text{SO($N$)}$ models, those perturbations are shown to correspond to the marginal current-current operator with the specific sign which leads to a massless renormalization group flow to the SU(N)$_1$ fixed point. In contrast, a massive regime with a two-fold ground-state degeneracy is found for the $\mathbb{C}P^{N-1}$ ($N &gt;2$) and Grassmannian nonlinear $\sigma$ models at $\theta=\pi$.</description>

      <title>Cascades in transport and optical conductivity of Twisted Bilayer Graphene</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.20855v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using a combined Dynamical Mean Field Theory and Hartree (DMFT+H) calculation we study the transport and optical properties of the 8-band heavy fermion model for Twisted Bilayer Graphene (TBG) in the normal state. We find resistive states around integer fillings which resemble the ones observed in transport experiments. From a Drude fitting of the low frequency optical conductivity, we extract a very strongly doping-dependent Drude weight and scattering rate, resetting at the integers. For most dopings, particularly above the integers, the Drude scattering rate is high but notably smaller than that of the local electrons. This highlights the important role of itinerant electrons in the transport properties, despite their limited spectral weight on the flat bands. At far infrared frequencies, the optical conductivity exhibits cascades characterized by highly asymmetric resets of the intensity and oscillations in the interband peak frequencies.</description>

      <title>Kitaev Quantum Spin Liquids</title>

Abstract: Quantum spin liquids (QSLs) represent exotic states of matter where quantum spins interact strongly yet evade long-range magnetic order down to absolute zero. Characterized by non-local quantum entanglement and resultant fractionalized excitations, QSLs have emerged as a frontier in condensed matter physics, bolstered by the recent identification of several candidate materials. This field holds profound implications for understanding strong correlations, topological order, and emergent phenomena in quantum materials. Among them, the spin-1/2 Kitaev honeycomb model, featuring bond-directional Ising interactions, provides a rare exactly solvable QSL example. Its ground state is a topological QSL, with spin degrees of freedom fractionalized into emergent Majorana fermions. Under an applied magnetic field, the Kitaev QSL transitions to a topologically non-trivial chiral spin liquid state with non-Abelian anyons, offering potential resources for topological quantum computation. The non-Abelian character of these anyons in the Kitaev QSL demonstrates a profound connection to certain topological superconductors and even-denominator fractional quantum Hall states. Since the theoretical prediction that the Kitaev model could manifest in spin-orbit-coupled materials such as honeycomb iridates and ruthenates, research has focused on identifying candidate compounds. In particular, experimental evidence suggests spin fractionalization and topological phenomena akin to the Kitaev model in the spin-orbit Mott insulator $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$. However, results and interpretations remain actively debated. This review presents a comprehensive survey of existing studies on Kitaev candidate materials, with a particular focus on $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$. Rather than offering conclusive remarks, our aim is to inspire future research by examining several key aspects of the current literature and perspectives.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.05825v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Time-resolved X-ray absorption can reveal the dynamical screening of the local Coulomb interaction in strongly correlated photo-excited materials. Here, we focus on the theoretical prediction of X-ray absorption in the presence of dynamical screening using the strong coupling expansion, i.e., an expansion around the isolated absorption site in terms of the retarded interaction. The evaluation of higher order diagrams is made numerically feasible by an approach based on the decomposition of the retarded interaction into complex exponentials. With this, we evaluate the strong coupling series to third order on an electron-boson model of Holstein type. We demonstrate that in relevant coupling regimes, even low orders of the strong coupling expansion can give a significant correction over the previously used lowest order approximation.</description>

      <title>Two-Peak Heat Capacity Accounts for $R\ln(2)$ Entropy and Ground State Access in the Dipole-Octupole Pyrochlore Ce$_2$Hf$_2$O$_7$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08327v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report new magnetic heat capacity measurements of a high quality single crystal of the dipole-octupole pyrochlore Ce$_2$Hf$_2$O$_7$ down to a temperature of $T = 0.02$ K, a factor of three lower than those previously reported. These show a two-peaked structure, with a Schottky-like peak at $T_1 \sim 0.065$ K, similar to what is observed in its sister Ce-pyrochlores Ce$_2$Zr$_2$O$_7$ and Ce$_2$Sn$_2$O$_7$. However a second, sharper peak is observed at $T_2 \sim 0.025$ K, which signifies the entrance to its ground state, as even the most abrupt low-temperature extrapolation to $C_P=0$ at $T = 0$ K gives a full accounting of $R\ln(2)$ in entropy, associated with the well isolated pseudospin-1/2 doublet for Ce$^{3+}$ in this environment. The ground state could be conventionally ordered, although theory predicts a much larger anomaly in $C_P$, at much higher temperatures than the measured $T_2$, for expectations from an all-in all-out ground state of the nearest-neighbor XYZ Hamiltonian for Ce$_2$Hf$_2$O$_7$. The sharp low-temperature peak could also signify a cross-over from a classical to a quantum spin liquid regime. The diffuse magnetic neutron scattering observed from Ce$_2$Hf$_2$O$_7$ at low temperatures between $T_2$ and $T_1$ resembles that observed from Ce$_2$Zr$_2$O$_7$, which is well established as a $\pi$-flux quantum spin ice.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.01921v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a tensor network library designed for classical and quantum physics simulations called Cytnx (pronounced as sci-tens). This library provides almost an identical interface and syntax for both C++ and Python, allowing users to effortlessly switch between two languages. Aiming at a quick learning process for new users of tensor network algorithms, the interfaces resemble the popular Python scientific libraries like NumPy, Scipy, and PyTorch. Not only multiple global Abelian symmetries can be easily defined and implemented, Cytnx also provides a new tool called Network that allows users to store large tensor networks and perform tensor network contractions in an optimal order automatically. With the integration of cuQuantum, tensor calculations can also be executed efficiently on GPUs. We present benchmark results for tensor operations on both devices, CPU and GPU. We also discuss features and higher-level interfaces to be added in the future.</description>

      <title>Topological Optical Pseudospin Injection Beyond Weyl Semimetals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09235v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Photoinduced effects are now reckoned to be important tools to reveal a rich gamut of entrancing physics in topological materials, which are normally inaccessible to conventional probes. Here we investigate one of these intriguing effects, namely, optical pseudospin injection (OPI) beyond ordinary Weyl semimetals (WSMs), specifically in multi-WSMs (mWSMs) and higher-order WSMs. Remarkably, we demonstrate that OPI in mWSMs is independent of the frequency of the light and linearly proportional to the quantized topological charge as a consequence of the inherent band linearity in their dispersions. Interestingly, while the response does not depend on the tilting of a type-I node, it is a decreasing function of the same in type-II mWSMs. We also reveal that the frequency independence can be destroyed either by going beyond a certain cutoff frequency under lattice regularization or by going to a higher-order Weyl phase. The predicted signatures of OPI beyond the ordinary WSM could be experimentally exploited, leading to effective access as well as distinguishing between different nontrivial Weyl topologies.</description>

      <title>Quantum many-body scars with unconventional superconducting pairing symmetries via multibody interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02914v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a systematic framework to construct model Hamiltonians that have unconventional superconducting pairing states as exact energy eigenstates, by incorporating multibody interactions (i.e., interactions among more than two particles). The multibody interactions are introduced in a form of the local density-density coupling in such a way that any pair configuration in real space has a constant interaction energy by canceling the two-body and multibody interactions. Our approach is applicable to both spinless and spinful models in any spatial dimensions and on any bipartite lattices, facilitating an exhaustive extension of Yang's $s$-wave $\eta$-pairing state to various other unconventional pairing symmetries ($p$-wave, $d$-wave, $f$-wave, etc.). Particularly, the constructed eigenstates have off-site pairs with finite center-of-mass momentum, which leads to superconducting states with either even-parity and spin-triplet or odd-parity and spin-singlet symmetry. We verify that the two-dimensional spinful Hubbard model on a square lattice with the multibody interactions has the spin-triplet $d$-wave pairing state as an energy eigenstate, which can be regarded as a quantum many-body scar state as evidenced from the numerical analysis of the pair correlation function, entanglement entropy, and level statistics. We also discuss other examples, including spin-triplet $f$-wave pairing states on a honeycomb lattice and spin-singlet $p$-wave pairing states in a one-dimensional chain. These findings open up the possibility of realizing nonequilibrium unconventional superconductivity in a long-lived manner protected against thermalization.</description>

      <title>Quasispins of vacancy defects and their interactions in disordered antiferromagnets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05845v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Vacancy defects in disordered magnetic materials are known to act as effective spins, ``quasispins'', in response to an external magnetic field. In the dilute limit, the contributions of such ``quasispins'' to the magnetic susceptibility $\chi_\text{vac}(T)\propto N_\text{vac}/T$ are singular in the limit of low temperatures $T$ and match those of free spins. With increasing the density of vacancies, their interactions may become essential. Motivated by frustrated and quasi-one-dimensional magnetic materials, we study analytically quasispins and their interactions in a generic system that has short-range antiferromagnetic order and lacks long-range order. We predict that if the vacancy defect does not disrupt the short-range antiferromagnetic order around it, the quasispin value matches the value of spins of the magnetic atoms in the material, and the correlators of the quasispins of different vacancies match the spin-spin correlators in the vacancy-free material. We confirm our conclusions by exact calculations for Ising chains with nearest-neighbour and next-to-nearest-neighbour interactions. We also compute the first virial correction to the susceptibility of a magnetic material due to the interactions of vacancy quasispins.</description>

      <title>Sign problem in tensor network contraction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.19023v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate how the computational difficulty of contracting tensor networks depends on the sign structure of the tensor entries. Using results from computational complexity, we observe that the approximate contraction of tensor networks with only positive entries has lower complexity. This raises the question how this transition in computational complexity manifests itself in the hardness of different contraction schemes. We pursue this question by studying random tensor networks with varying bias towards positive entries. First, we consider contraction via Monte Carlo sampling, and find that the transition from hard to easy occurs when the entries become predominantly positive; this can be seen as a tensor network manifestation of the Quantum Monte Carlo sign problem. Second, we analyze the commonly used contraction based on boundary tensor networks. Its performance is governed by the amount of correlations (entanglement) in the tensor network. Remarkably, we find that the transition from hard to easy (i.e., from a volume law to a boundary law scaling of entanglement) occurs already for a slight bias towards a positive mean, and the earlier the larger the bond dimension is. This is in contrast to both expectations and the behavior found in Monte Carlo contraction. We gain further insight into this early transition from the study of an effective statmech model. Finally, we investigate the computational difficulty of computing expectation values of tensor network wavefunctions, i.e., PEPS, where we find that the complexity of entanglement-based contraction always remains low. We explain this by providing a local transformation which maps PEPS expectation values to a positive-valued tensor network. This not only provides insight into the origin of the observed boundary law entanglement scaling, but also suggests new approaches towards PEPS contraction based on positive decompositions.</description>

      <title>Field-Dependent Metrics and Higher-Form Symmetries in Duality-Invariant Theories of Non-Linear Electrodynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17194v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that a $4d$ theory of non-linear electrodynamics has equations of motion which are equivalent to those of the Maxwell theory in curved spacetime, but with the usual metric $g_{\mu \nu}$ replaced by a unit-determinant metric $h_{\mu \nu} ( F )$ which is a function of the field strength $F_{\mu \nu}$, if and only if the theory enjoys electric-magnetic duality invariance. Among duality-invariant models, the Modified Maxwell (ModMax) theory is special because the associated metric $h_{\mu \nu} ( F )$ produces identical equations of motion when it is coupled to the Maxwell theory via two different prescriptions which we describe. We use the field-dependent metric perspective to analyze the electric and magnetic $1$-form global symmetries in models of self-dual electrodynamics. This analysis suggests that any duality-invariant theory possesses a set of conserved currents $j^\mu$ which are in one-to-one correspondence with $2$-forms that are harmonic with respect to the field-dependent metric $h_{\mu \nu} ( F )$.</description>

      <title>Entangling power, gate typicality, and measurement-induced phase transitions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17776v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When subject to a non-local unitary evolution, qubits in a quantum circuit become increasingly entangled. Conversely, measurements applied to individual qubits lead to their disentanglement from the collective system. The extent of entanglement reduction depends on the frequency of local projective measurements. A delicate balance emerges between unitary evolution, which enhances entanglement, and measurements which diminish it. In the thermodynamic limit, there is a phase transition from volume law entanglement to area law entanglement at a critical value of measurement frequency. This phenomenon, occurring in hybrid quantum circuits with both unitary gates and measurements, is termed as measurement-induced phase transition (MIPT). We study the behavior of MIPT in circuits comprising of two qubit unitary gates parameterized by Cartan decomposition. We show that the entangling power and gate typicality of the two-qubit local unitaries employed in the circuit can be used to explain the behavior of global bipartite entanglement the circuit can sustain. When the two qubit gate throughout the circuit is the identity and measurements are the sole driver of the entanglement behavior, we obtain analytical estimate for the entanglement entropy that shows remarkable agreement with numerical simulations. We also find that the entangling power and gate typicality enable the classification of the two-qubit unitaries by different universality classes of phase transitions that can occur in the hybrid circuit. For all unitaries in a particular universality class, the transition from volume to area law of entanglement occurs with same exponent that characterizes the phase transition.</description>

Abstract: Strange-metal behavior has been observed in superconductors ranging from cuprates to pressurized nickelates, but its relationship to unconventional superconductivity remains elusive. Here, we perform operando superfluid density measurements on ion-gated FeSe films. We observe for the first time a synchronized evolution of superconducting condensate and the strange-metal phase with electron doping. A linear scaling between zero-temperature superfluid density and the strange-metal resistivity coefficient is further established, which nails down a direct link between the formation of superfluid in the superconducting state and the scattering of carriers in the strange-metal normal state. Remarkably, the scaling also applies for different iron-based and cuprate superconductors despite their distinct electronic structures and pairing symmetries. Such a correlation can be reproduced in a theoretical calculation on the two-dimensional Yukawa-Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model by considering a cooperative effect of quantum critical fluctuation and disorder. These findings indicate a fundamental principle governing superconducting condensation and strange-metal scattering in unconventional superconductors.</description>

      <title>Variational formulation of dynamical electronic response functions in presence of nonlocal exchange interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22889v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the dynamical electronic response function in theoretical frameworks that include nonlocal exchange interactions, such as the Bethe-Salpeter equation with the frequency independent approximation of the screened interaction, Hartree-Fock, and range-separated Hybrid DFT approaches. Within these pictures, we demonstrate that any time-dependent electronic linear response function allows for a formulation which is variational in the electronic density matrix. To achieve our goal, we consider the usual form of a response function, written in terms of a screened and a bare electronic vertices (`bare-screen'), and perform an exact rewriting in terms of purely screened electronic vertices (`screen-screen'). Within the `screen-screen' formulation, the response function can be written as a stationary point of a functional of the exact density matrix. Further, we show that the imaginary part of any electronic response can be written in the form of a generalized Fermi Golden Rule, by introducing an exact complementary rewriting in terms of vertices related by complex conjugation (`screen*-screen'). The screen-screen formulation can be further extended partitioning the electronic interaction in separate contributions, expressing the response in terms of partially screened electronic vertices (`partial screen-partial screen'), preserving the stationary properties. We numerically validate the effectiveness of our formalism by calculating the optical conductivity of graphene, which exhibits strong excitonic effects. To do so, we solve the Bethe-Salpeter Equation on a tight-binding model, including exchange effects in the response of graphene. Our findings show the advantages of the variationality of the screen-screen formulation over the others both in convergence properties and robustness with density-matrix approximations.</description>

      <title>Periodically and aperiodically Thue-Morse driven long-range systems: from dynamical localization to slow dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19736v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the electric-field driven power-law random banded matrix(PLRBM) model where a variation in the power-law exponent $\alpha$ yields a delocalization-to-localization phase transition. We examine the periodically driven PLRBM model with the help of the Floquet operator. The level spacing ratio and the generalized participation ratio of the Floquet Hamiltonian reveal a drive-induced fractal phase accompanied by diffusive transport on the delocalized side of the undriven PLRBM model. On the localized side, the time-periodic model remains localized - the average spacing ratio corresponds to Poisson statistics and logarithmic transport is observed in the dynamics. Extending our analysis to the aperiodic Thue-Morse (TM) driven system, we find that the aperiodically driven clean long-range hopping model (clean counterpart of the PLRBM model) exhibits the phenomenon of \textit{exact dynamical localization} (EDL) on tuning the drive-parameters at special points. The disordered time-aperiodic system shows diffusive transport followed by relaxation to the infinite-temperature state on the delocalized side, and a prethermal plateau with subdiffusion on the localized side. Additionally, we compare this with a quasi-periodically driven AAH model that also undergoes a localization-delocalization transition. Unlike the disordered long-range model, it features a prolonged prethermal plateau followed by subdiffusion to the infinite temperature state, even on the delocalized side.</description>

      <title>Streamlined Krylov construction and classification of ergodic Floquet systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19797v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We generalize Krylov construction to periodically driven (Floquet) quantum systems using the theory of orthogonal polynomials on the unit circle. Compared to other approaches, our method works faster and maps any quantum dynamics to a one-dimensional tight-binding Krylov chain, which is efficiently simulated on both classical and quantum computers. We also suggest a classification of chaotic and integrable Floquet systems based on the asymptotic behavior of Krylov chain hopping parameters (Verblunsky coefficients). We illustrate this classification with random matrix ensembles, kicked top, and kicked Ising chain.</description>
