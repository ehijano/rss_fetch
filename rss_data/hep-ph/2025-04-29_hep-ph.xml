      <title>Holographic analysis of near-conformal dynamics and light dilaton</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18623v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We carry out a detailed analysis of the region slightly outside the conformal window of a non-trivial infrared fixed point in a generic bottom-up holographic setup. We focus on models, which study the dynamics of a scalar field, dual to quark degrees of freedom, in a (nearly) AdS geometry. Such models realize the picture expected for vector-like near-conformal theories from Dyson-Schwinger analysis. The analysis covers a toy model, which allows for analytic solutions, and a more general setup as well, which encompass a complete model for the ultraviolet physics. We analyze the conditions for the appearance of a parametrically light scalar state in the spectrum, which can act as a candidate for the Pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone boson arising from breaking of the approximate conformal symmetry. We also present detailed results for the vacuum structure, correlators, and Ward identities in the near-conformal regime.</description>

      <title>Targets for Flavor-Violating Top Decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18664v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Analyticity and unitarity constrain broad classes of new physics models by linking flavor-conserving and flavor-violating four-fermion interactions. In this work, we explore how these theoretical relations impact flavor-violating rare top quark decays. Building on our previous results, we present an updated analysis of the decays $t \to q \ell^+ \ell^-$ and identify interesting target branching ratios in the range of $10^{-7}$ to $10^{-6}$ once current experimental constraints from flavor-conserving processes are taken into account. We extend the analysis to top decays with lepton flavor violation, deriving correlations among the relevant Wilson coefficients and confronting them with existing limits from LEP and the LHC. Notably, we find that current searches for $t \to q e \mu$ are already probing theoretically motivated regions of parameter space. These results strongly support continued efforts to explore flavor-violating top decays as a powerful probe of new physics.</description>

      <title>A combined analysis of $Y(2240)$ in the $e^+ e^- \to K^+ K^-$ and $e^+ e^- \to K_S^0 K_L^0$ processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18797v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present work, we perform a combined analysis of the cross sections for $e^+ e^- \to K^+ K^-$ and $e^+ e^- \to K_S^0 K_L^0$ by including the interference between direct coupling process and resonance intermediate process. When setting the isospin factor as a free parameter, we can well reproduce the structures in the cross sections for $e^+ e^- \to K^+ K^-$ and $e^+ e^- \to K_S^0 K_L^0$, however, the isospin factor deviates with the isospin symmetry conservation predicted value of one. By fixing the isospin factor to be one, we find the cross sections for $e^+ e^-\to K^+ K^-$ can be accurately fitted, while the same model parameters fail to adequately reproduce the observed cross section for the process $e^+ e^- \to K_S^0 K_L^0$, which indicate that there should be contributions from other vector meson states, such as $\rho(2150)$ and $\omega(2220)$. More precise experimental measurement below 2.0 GeV and between $2.3\sim 2.5$ GeV may provide more information about the vector resonances in this energy range, which should be accessible for the BESIII collaboration.</description>

      <title>Geometric scaling of elastic $pp$ cross section at the LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18841v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that geometric scaling conjectured and observed at the ISR more than 50 years ago, still holds at the LHC. We discuss regularities of the dip-bump structures of the differential elastic cross sections, emphasizing the fact that the ratio of bump to dip positions is constant from the ISR to the LHC. Applying crossing and analyticity we identify imaginary and real parts of the scattering amplitude and compute the $\rho$ parameter and the ratio of bump to dip values of the differential $pp$ cross sections. We also discuss the energy dependence of the total elastic cross section and the violation of geometrical scaling outside the dip-bump region at the LHC.</description>

      <title>The moat regimes within $2+1$ flavor Polyakov-Quark-Meson model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18874v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To better understand recent predictions on the moat regime of quantum chromodynamics (QCD) matter, this paper extends the previous work within the two-flavor Quark-Meson (QM) model to the more realistic $2+1$ flavor Polyakov-Quark-Meson (PQM) model. Mainly, two effects are further taken into account: strange quark and confinement coded through Polyakov loop. Model parameters are chosen to consistently reproduce the pseudo-critical temperature from lattice QCD, $T_{\rm C}\sim 156~ {\rm MeV}$, and the baryon chemical potential at the critical end point (CEP) from FRG-QCD, $\mu_{\rm B(CEP)}\sim 635~ {\rm MeV}$. It is found that the basic features of moat regimes for $\sigma$ and $\pi$ mesons remain similar to those from QM model: Moat regimes cover the region where temperature or baryon chemical potential is large; reentrances occur around the critical baryon chemical potential of chiral transition at zero temperature. Thus, the FRG-QCD results can still not be well understood, especially why the CEP should locate at the entrances of moat regimes for $\sigma$ and $\pi$ mesons. Nevertheless, some basic features can be understood qualitatively, and it is consistent that the pole energies are increasing functions of momenta in the whole $T-\mu_{\rm B}$ plane. The moat regime and pole energy of $K$ mesons are also studied with the features similar.</description>

      <title>Lorentz and CPT violation and the (anti-)hydrogen molecular ion II -- hyperfine-Zeeman spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fundamental principles of quantum field theory such as Lorentz invariance, CPT symmetry and locality may be tested to extremely high precision in atomic and molecular spectroscopy. The narrow natural linewidth of rovibrational states in the hydrogen molecular ion $H_2^+$ and its antimatter counterpart $\bar{H}_2^-$, make these ideal candidates, and give $O(m_p/m_e)$ increased sensitivity to Lorentz and CPT violation in the proton sector compared to $H$ and $\bar{H}$ atoms. In a previous paper, we presented a detailed analysis of the rovibrational spectrum of $H_2^+$ and $\bar{H}_2^-$ in an effective QFT encoding Lorentz and CPT violation, focusing on spin-independent effects. Here, we extend this analysis to include the full hyperfine-Zeeman spectrum and include spin-dependent Lorentz and CPT violating operators in the effective theory. The results demonstrate how constraints on these symmetry-violating couplings may be extracted from specific rovibrational transitions between hyperfine-Zeeman states in the presence of an applied magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Searching for elusive dark Higgs boson in spin-1/2 inelastic dark matter models at Belle II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin-1/2 inelastic dark matter (DM) models are popular among sub-GeV to GeV thermal DM scenarios due to the dominant role of co-annihilation in determining the DM relic abundance. In these models, the dark Higgs boson plays a crucial role in generating the mass of the new gauge boson, the dark photon ($A^{'}$), and in establishing the mass splitting between the excited ($\chi_2$) and ground ($\chi_1$) states of DM. In particular, the Compton scattering $\chi_1 A' \rightarrow \chi_2^* \rightarrow \chi_1 A'$ and its $t$-channel crossed process, $\chi_1 \chi_1 \rightarrow A' A'$, remain unitary for high energy longitudunal dark photon, only if the contribution of the dark Higgs boson is included. However, experimental searches for the dark Higgs boson have received relatively little attention. In particular, when the dark Higgs boson mass exceeds twice that of the DM excited state, its decay signatures become semi-visible or invisible, making detection challenging with current light scalar search strategies. In this work, we explore the prospects for detecting the elusive dark Higgs boson in inelastic DM models at Belle II via dark Higgs-strahlung and rare $B$ meson decay processes. Our analysis indicates that both the inclusive signature of two displaced dilepton vertices and the additional missing energy from dark Higgs boson decays serve as robust indicators of its presence. Furthermore, we assess the future potential for detecting the dark Higgs boson with the proposed far detector related to Belle II, GAZELLE.</description>

      <title>A scale invariant extension of the Georgi Machacek model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a classically scale-invariant extension of the Georgi--Machacek model by augmenting its custodial \(SU(2)_L \times SU(2)_R\)-symmetric Higgs sector -- originally composed of a doublet and two triplets -- with a gauge-singlet scalar. Employing the Gildener--Weinberg formalism, we demonstrate that radiative symmetry breaking via the Coleman--Weinberg mechanism dynamically generates the electroweak scale along a flat direction. The scalar spectrum retains the quintet (\(H_5\)) and triplet (\(H_3\)) states of the original model while introducing three CP-even singlets: a pseudo-Goldstone boson (the \emph{scalon}), which acquires mass at one loop, and two additional massive scalars. One of these massive states corresponds to the observed \(125\,\mathrm{GeV}\) Higgs boson. We rigorously derive theoretical constraints from vacuum stability and perturbative unitarity, and we incorporate experimental bounds from electroweak precision tests (notably the \(S\) parameter) and Higgs signal strength measurements. Our parameter space analysis identifies viable regions where the scalon mass is below approximately \(200\,\mathrm{GeV}\) and the heavier scalar remains under \(600\,\mathrm{GeV}\). This framework addresses the hierarchy problem without fine-tuning, preserves custodial symmetry (with \(\rho \approx 1\) at tree level), and predicts testable deviations in Higgs couplings. Together with the extended scalar sector, these signatures provide promising avenues for direct investigation at collider experiments.</description>

      <title>Full analysis of CP violation induced by the decay angular correlations in four-body cascade decays of heavy hadrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The violation of the charge-parity (CP) transformation symmetry, which although has been observed in plenty of pure meson decay processes, was only confirmed just very recently by the LHCb collaboration in the four-body decay of the heavy baryon $\Lambda_b^0$, $\Lambda_b^0\to p K^- \pi^+ \pi ^-$, through a comparison of the decay branching ratio with that of the CP-conjugate process. However, the detailed dynamics behind this CP asymmetry is obviously far from clear. In this paper, we propose a formalism for the full analysis of the decay angular correlations in four-body cascade decays of heavy hadrons which can provide more information about the CP violation in these decays. To illustrate this, we apply the decay angular correlation analysis of CP violation to another four-body decay channel that involve baryons, $B^0\to p\bar{p}K^+\pi^-$, which has also been investigated by the LHCb collaboration with no evidence of CP violation being found. Surprisingly, with the event yield extracted inversely from the published data of LHCb, we obtain non-zero CP asymmetries of about $10\%$ corresponding to the decay angular correlations at larger than $5\sigma$ confidence level, which are considerably larger than the CPA asymmetries observed in the $\Lambda_b^0\to p K^- \pi^+ \pi ^-$ channel, indicating that CP violation could have been observed in processes involving baryons much earlier if the full analysis of angular correlations had been performed. We suggest our experimental colleagues to perform full decay angular correlation analyses of CP violation in four-body decays of heavy hadrons, including the above two decay channels.</description>

      <title>The influence of majorons on neutrino oscillations in the presence of a magnetic field and matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19296v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neutrino spin-flavour oscillations in the magnetic field, matter, and majoron fields are studied. The effective Lagrangian of Majorana neutrino interaction with a majoron field mediated by heavy neutrino is calculated. It is shown that the presence of a majoron field with a high energy density significantly shifts the resonances in neutrino oscillations, or even induces new resonances. The influence of the majoron suppresses oscillations for neutrino energies below 10 MeV. Additionally, the dependence of the oscillations probabilities on the Dirac and Majorana CP-violating phases becomes weaker under the influence of a dense majoron field. These findings can be applied to experiments that study neutrinos from supernovae, such as JUNO, DUNE, and the upcoming Hyper-Kamiokande experiment.</description>

      <title>Non-Markovian dynamics of bottomonia in the QGP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The evolution of quarkonia in the QGP medium can be described through the formalism of Open Quantum Systems (OQS). In previous works with OQS, the quarkonium evolution was studied by working in either quantum Brownian or optical regime. In this paper, we set up a general non-Markovian master equation to describe the evolution of the quarkonia in the medium. Due to the non-Markovian nature, it cannot be cast in Lindblad form which makes it challenging to solve. We numerically solve the master equation for $\Upsilon(1S)$ without considering stochastic jumps for Bjorken and viscous hydrodynamic background at energies relevant to LHC and RHIC. We quantify the effect of the hierarchy between the system time scale, $\tau_{\textrm{S}}\sim 1/E_b$, and the environment time scale, $\tau_{\textrm{E}}$, on quarkonium evolution and show that it significantly affects the nuclear modification factor. A comparison of our results with the existing experimental data from LHC and RHIC is presented.</description>

      <title>Exploring bottom-charmed molecular tetraquarks with complex scaling method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19462v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we analyze the $D^{(*)}_{(s)}B^{(*)}_{(s)}$ interactions by adopting the one boson exchange model from a coupled channel perspective. For $I(J^{P})=1(1^{+})$ $DB^{*}/D^*B/D^*B^{*}$ system, utilizing the complex scaling method, we obtain a loosely bound state and two resonant states below $DB^{*}$, $D^*B$, and $D^*B^{*}$ thresholds, respectively. Assuming that charmonium-like states $T_{c\bar{c}1}(3900)$, $T_{c\bar{c}1}(4020)$ and bottomonium-like states $T_{b\bar{b}1}(10610)$, $T_{b\bar{b}1}(10650)$ are molecular states near the corresponding thresholds, we suggest these predicted particles in $I(J^P)=1(1^+)$ system as their analogues. In addition, we extend our study to other $D^{(*)}_{(s)}B^{(*)}_{(s)}$ combinations with different quantum numbers. According to our estimations, there may exist some exotic structures in bottom-charmed sector. Finally, we collect the possible decay channels for future experimental observations. The $B_c/B_c^*$ plus a light meson are the ideal final state to search for the bound states, while the $D_{(s)}^{(*)}B_{(s)}^{(*)}$ channels are suitable for the resonances. We highly recommend that the future experiments hunt for these bottom-charmed exotic particles.</description>

      <title>Different scenarios of dynamical chiral symmetry breaking in the interacting instanton liquid model via flavor symmetry breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19469v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a type of dynamical chiral symmetry breaking (D$\chi$SB) for various current quark masses using the interacting instanton liquid model. The type of D$\chi$SB is classified based on the sign of the second derivative of the free energy density with respect to the quark condensate at the origin. We perform numerical simulations of the interacting instanton liquid model with the flavor SU(2) symmetric and (2+1)-flavor quarks. We find that the curvature is negative in the SU(2) case. This means the ordinary type of D$\chi$SB. In contrast, in the (2+1)-flavor case, a positive curvature is observed when the strange quark mass is as small as those of the up and down quarks. This suggests that the anomaly-driven type of D$\chi$SB can occur under the approximate flavor SU(3) symmetry. As the strange quark mass increases, the curvature gradually decreases and becomes negative when the strange quark mass is approximately three times larger than those of the light quarks. This difference can be understood in terms of the 't Hooft vertex which induces a six-quark interaction in the $N_f=3$ case and does a four-quark interaction in the $N_f=2$ case. Our results might indicate that the ratio between the strange and light quark masses plays a crucial role in understanding the microscopic relationship between D$\chi$SB and the anomaly effect.</description>

      <title>Properties of $X(3872)$ from hadronic potentials coupled to quarks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19471v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The concept of compositeness is used to quantitatively discuss the hadronic molecular nature in exotic hadrons. In this work, we develop a formulation to explicitly introduce the compact quark state contribution in the hadronic potentials together with the direct four-point interaction. We derive analytic expressions of the compositeness from the effective potential between hadrons when the system has a bound state. Applying this formulation to the $X(3872)$, we examine the variation of the compositeness with respect to the binding energy, energy of $\chi_{c1}(2P)$, cutoff momentum, and strength of the direct $D^0\bar{D}^{*0}$ interaction.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Supermassive black hole binary mergers serve as prominent sources of the stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB), detectable by pulsar timing arrays (PTAs). If dark matter-induced friction is present in the vicinity of these mergers, it can lead to suppression in the nanohertz frequency range of the SGWB spectrum. In particular, ultralight dark matter (ULDM) forming compact solitonic cores around supermassive black holes can imprint signatures in PTA observations. Our analysis places limits on the mass and self-interaction strength of ULDM, demonstrating that soliton-induced dynamical friction can significantly alter the SGWB spectrum. PTAs have the potential to exclude certain ULDM mass ranges while probing the effects of self-interactions, offering a novel avenue to investigate the fundamental properties of ULDM.</description>

      <title>The impact of the TMD shape function on matching the transverse momentum spectrum in $J/\psi$ production at the EIC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19617v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The impact of the inclusion of TMD shape functions on the transverse momentum spectrum in $J/\psi$ production at the EIC is investigated by considering the matching of the TMD factorization description at low transverse momentum with the collinear factorization description at high transverse momentum by means of the inverse-error weighting method. Despite large uncertainties from scale variations and the $J/\psi$ long-distance matrix elements, predictions for the differential cross section and its $\cos(2\phi_\psi)$ modulation are obtained. We find that physical constraints are satisfied in case a process-dependent term is included for color octet production, but not in all cases when it is excluded. These numerical results support the analytic calculations in \cite{Boer:2023zit}. Future experimental data can thus test the validity of TMD factorization in $J/\psi$ production and explore the presence of nontrivial process-dependent effects in the soft-gluon resummation. This will be crucial in the extraction of gluon unpolarized and linearly polarized TMD distributions of the proton. In addition, we suggest how the sign of the latter can be determined by investigating the presence of a node in the $\cos(2\phi_\psi)$ modulation as a function of transverse momentum.</description>

      <title>The asymmetry $A_{LL}^{\cos2\phi}$ in the polarized proton-proton Drell-Yan process within TMD factorization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19681v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the $\cos2\phi$ azimuthal asymmetry in doubly longitudinally polarized proton-proton Drell-Yan collisions within the transverse momentum dependent factorization framework. The asymmetry arises from the convolution of the longitudinal transversity distribution $h_{1L}^{\perp}$ for both protons. Using the Bacchetta-Delcarro-Pisano-Radici-Signori parametrization for the nonperturbative Sudakov form factor and the Wandzura-Wilczek approximation for the collinear $h_{1L}^{\perp}$, we predict the double spin asymmetry $A_{LL}^{\cos2\phi}$ at RHIC and NICA kinematics. Our results demonstrate sensitivity to sea quark distributions, with the asymmetry reaching up to $25\%$ for maximal sea quark contributions. These predictions highlight the potential of polarized Drell-Yan measurements to probe sea quark dynamics and advance our understanding of nucleon structure.</description>

      <title>Emerging Photon Jets in the Hadronic Calorimeter: A Novel Signature of Neutral Long-Lived Particles at the LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19693v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel collider signature for neutral long-lived particles (LLPs): the emerging photon jet in the hadronic calorimeter (HCAL). This signature arises when a neutral LLP decays into photons within the HCAL, producing an electromagnetic shower without associated charged tracks or energy deposits in the electromagnetic calorimeter (ECAL). To demonstrate the viability of this approach, we consider the fermiophobic Higgs boson $h_{\rm f}$ in the Type-I two-Higgs-doublet model as a representative scenario. In the ultralight regime ($m_{h_{\rm f}} &lt; 1$ GeV), $h_{\rm f}$ decays exclusively into a photon pair via loop-induced processes, resulting in a suppressed width and consequently a long lifetime. Focusing on the golden channel $pp \to H^\pm h_{\rm f} \to W^\pm h_{\rm f} h_{\rm f}$, we analyze the exotic final state in which one $h_{\rm f}$ decays in the ECAL and appears as a highly collimated photon jet (reconstructed as a single photon), while the other decays within the HCAL, producing an emerging photon jet. Through a detailed signal-to-background analysis incorporating realistic detector effects via fast simulation, we demonstrate that this signature achieves discovery-level sensitivity at the HL-LHC across a broad region of parameter space consistent with theoretical and experimental constraints. While our study focuses on the fermiophobic Higgs, the emerging photon jet in the HCAL constitutes a broadly applicable and previously unexplored strategy for detecting neutral LLPs decaying into photons, opening a new avenue in LLP searches at colliders.</description>

      <title>Rescuing leptogenesis in inverse seesaw models with the help of non-Abelian flavor symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The inverse seesaw (ISS) model provides an attractive framework that can naturally explain the smallness of neutrino masses while accommodating some sterile neutrinos potentially accessible at present or future experiments. However, in generic ISS models with hierarchical pseudo-Dirac (PD) sterile neutrino pairs, the generation of the observed baryon asymmetry of the Universe via the leptogenesis mechanism is extremely challenging. In this paper, we investigate rescuing leptogenesis in the ISS model with the help of non-Abelian flavor symmetries which have the potential to explain the observed peculiar neutrino mixing pattern: we first implement non-Abelian flavor symmetries to naturally enforce mass degeneracies among different pseudo-Dirac sterile neutrino pairs and then break them in a proper way so that resonant leptogenesis among different PD sterile neutrino pairs can arise, thus enhancing the generated baryon asymmetry. To be specific, we have considered the following two well-motivated approaches for generating the tiny mass splittings among different PD sterile neutrino pairs: one approach makes use of the renormalization-group corrections to the sterile neutrino masses, while the other approach invokes non-trivial flavor structure of the $\mu^{}_{\rm s}$ matrix. For these two scenarios, we aim to explore the viability of leptogenesis and to identify the conditions under which the observed baryon asymmetry can be successfully reproduced.</description>

      <title>Fast numerical evaluation of dark matter direct detection event rates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19714v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The mathematical expression for the dark matter nuclear recoil event rate in a detector consists of a six dimensional integral over the velocity distribution of dark matter in the detector frame, and over the recoil momentum of the nucleus. While a significant part of this integral can be solved in closed form under traditional assumptions of the standard halo model and/or isotropic detector response, analysis of alternate assumptions is conventionally impeded by the inefficiency of multidimensional numerical integration methods. In this work we introduce a novel, fast and efficient algorithm for direct detection event rate computations. This algorithm takes advantage of a closed form expression for the Radon transform of three dimensional Zernike functions, which are used as basis functions for the velocity distribution. We demonstrate an implementation of this algorithm ZebraDM (https://github.com/sebsassi/zebradm), which is typically faster than an optimized numerical integration approach by a factor between $10^2$ and $10^4$.</description>

      <title>Collision parameters needed to measure polarisation-dependent nonlinear pair creation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pair creation by a $\gamma$ ray in a high-intensity electromagnetic field (the nonlinear Breit-Wheeler process) is sensitive to the $\gamma$-ray polarisation. Here we study the stability required in order to measure this polarisation dependence in a head-on collision between a high-power linearly polarised laser and a relativistic electron beam, where the $\gamma$-rays produced via nonlinear Compton scattering are highly polarised. We find that the laser strength parameter $a_0$ has to be known to within a few per cent, and that the alignment of the laser and electron beam cannot fluctuate by more than half the spot size, in order to attribute the reduction in positron yield to polarisation effects. These collision parameters are difficult to achieve, but may be realised in future precision experiments that focus on beam stability.</description>

      <title>Meson scattering and tetraquarks in two-dimensional QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19809v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-quark--two-antiquark systems with four different quark flavors are considered in the framework of two-dimensional QCD, in the light-cone gauge, at leading orders of the $1/N_c^{}$ expansion. Introducing basis functions with color-singlet mesonic clusters, integral equations are established for the Green's functions and the related scattering amplitudes involved in the sectors of the direct and quark-exchange channels. The problem of infrared divergences is dealt with a systematic use of an infrared regulator cutoff introduced in the gluon propagator. It is shown that the on-mass shell scattering amplitudes are free of infrared divergences up to order $1/N_c^2$. In the limit of vanishing of the infrared cutoff, they can be represented by effective four-meson contact-type interaction terms with unitarity loops, calculable in terms of the meson wave functions and propagators. The results, obtained at order $1/N_c^2$, are summed with the constraint of unitarization. The unitarized scattering amplitudes are continued in the total mass-squared variable below the two-meson thresholds, leading to a tetraquark bound state equation, which generally has one solution. Spectroscopic applications of the above results are sketched and discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.19830v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study cosmic strings in the complex symmetron model, a scalar-tensor theory with a spontaneously broken local $U(1)$ symmetry in low matter density regions. Using numerical simulations, we show that these strings preferentially attach to matter halos, leading to the stabilization of string loops. While the requirement for screening of fifth-force interactions in the solar system limits observable signatures in theories with universal coupling to matter, analogous topological defects in the dark sector may still influence cosmic structure formation, offering a novel avenue to constrain dark-sector interactions.</description>

      <title>Pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone-boson Dark Matter from Three Complex Scalars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19886v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study explores a dark matter model in which a pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone boson arises as a viable dark matter candidate from the spontaneous and soft breaking of global $U(1)$ symmetries and stabilized by a residual $\mathbb{Z}_3$ discrete symmetry. The model introduces three complex scalar fields, singlets under the Standard Model gauge group, and charged under a dark $U(1)_V$ gauge symmetry together with a permutative exchange symmetry among three scalars. These features naturally suppress the dark matter--nucleon scattering cross section by its Nambu-Goldstone boson nature. In addition to conventional annihilation channels, the $\mathbb{Z}_3$ structure allows semi-annihilation processes, potentially leading to new phenomenological signatures. We analyze theoretical and experimental constraints, including relic abundance, Higgs invisible decays, and perturbative unitarity, and evaluate the elastic scattering cross section for boosted dark matter.</description>

      <title>Analytic reconstruction with massive particles: one-loop amplitudes for $0 \to \bar{q}qt\bar{t}H$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an analytic reconstruction of one-loop amplitudes for the process $0 \to \bar{q}qt\bar{t}H$. Our calculation is a novel use of analytic reconstruction, retaining explicit covariance in the massive spin states through the massive spinor-helicity formalism. The analytic reconstruction relies on embedding the massive five-point kinematics in a fully massless eight-point phase space while still building a minimal ansatz directly in the five-point phase space. In order to obtain compact analytic expressions it is necessary to identify suitable partial fraction decompositions and extract common numerator factors, which we achieve through careful inspection of limits in which pairs of denominators vanish. We find that the resulting amplitudes are more numerically efficient than ones computed using automatic methods but that the gains are not as significant as in the massless case, at least at present. The method opens the door to applications at two-loop order, where numerical efficiency and improvements in the reconstruction methodology are more crucial, especially with regards to the number of free parameters in the ansatz.</description>

      <title>How Charged Can Neutrinos Be?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate how neutrinos may acquire small electric charges within the Standard Model framework while preserving electromagnetic gauge invariance. Instead of gauging the standard hypercharge generator $Y$, a linear combination of $Y$ and a new generator $X$ from a gaugable global $U(1)_X$ symmetry is embedded, under which neutrinos transform non-trivially. We demonstrate that minimal scenarios based on flavor-dependent $U(1)_X$ symmetries, such as $X = L_\alpha - L_\beta$, are incompatible with current neutrino oscillation data. In contrast, we have shown that only flavor-universal $U(1)_X$ symmetries-such as $U(1)_{B-L}$, which shifts both quark and lepton charges, and $U(1)_L$, which modifies only the lepton sector-can generate tiny neutrino charges consistent with observed masses and mixing. We also discuss the necessary connection between such charges and the Dirac nature of neutrinos. By analyzing the phenomenological implications in detail, our findings emphasize that constraints on neutrino charges should be evaluated within the specific framework of the $U(1)_X$ symmetry under consideration, rather than assuming a generic approach, as is often the case.</description>

      <title>Up-type FCNC in presence of Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dark Matter (DM) is a known unknown. Apart, current experimental constraints on flavor-changing neutral current (FCNC) processes involving up-type quarks also provide scope to explore physics beyond the Standard Model (SM). In this article, we establish a connection between the flavor sector and the DM sector with minimal extension of the SM. Here a singlet complex scalar field, stable under $\mathbb{Z}_3$ symmetry, acts as DM and couples to SM up-type quarks through a heavy Dirac vector-like quark (VLQ), which shares the same $\mathbb{Z}_3$ charge as of the DM. The model thus addresses the observed $D^0-\bar{D^0}$ mixing, top-FCNC interactions, and $D^0$ meson decays, together with DM relic density, while evading the direct and indirect DM search bounds. The model can be probed at the future high-energy muon collider, through distinctive signatures of VLQ production, where the VLQ decays into DM and SM particles, abiding by the existing bounds.</description>

      <title>Asymmetric warm nuclear matter described by Gogny and Skyrme-version models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18701v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we perform a detailed study of the thermodynamical properties of asymmetric nuclear matter at finite temperatures by means of the Gogny force, with a particular focus on its D1 family. We emphasize the investigation of the liquid-gas phase transition with the respective analysis of phase-coexistence boundaries (binodal sections) and instability regions (spinodal contours). Furthermore, the phenomenon of isospin distillation, intrinsically related to the unstable part of the system, is also described. In order to estimate the impact of the finite range of the nuclear interaction, for each Gogny parametrization we provide a respective zero-range Skyrme version, for which the free parameters of the model are obtained with the aim of reproducing at zero temperature the same saturation density, binding energy, incompressibility, isoscalar effective mass, isovector effective mass, symmetry energy, and symmetry energy slope. As a main result, we verify systematic deviations between the Gogny models and their Skyrme-version models, particularly at higher temperatures, where the Skyrme-version parametrizations exhibit reduced binodal and spinodal regions.</description>

      <title>Symmetry Energy Expansion with Strange Dense Matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.18764v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Quantum Chromodynamics phase diagram at large densities and low temperature can be probed both by neutron stars and low-energy heavy-ion collisions. Heavy-ion collisions are nearly isospin symmetric systems whereas neutron stars are highly isospin asymmetric since they are neutron-rich. The symmetry energy expansion is used to connect these regimes across isospin asymmetry. However, the current symmetry energy expansion does not account for strange particles. Here we include a finite strangeness to calculate isospin asymmetry and find that the symmetry energy expansion has a skewness term in the presence of strangeness for the case of weak equilibrium.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.18935v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rotating primordial black holes (PBHs) in the early universe can emit particles through superradiance, a process particularly efficient when the particle's Compton wavelength is comparable to the PBH's gravitational radius. Superradiance leads to an exponential growth of particle occupation numbers in gravitationally bound states. We present an analysis of heavy bosonic dark matter (DM) production through three gravitational mechanisms: Hawking radiation, superradiant instabilities, and ultraviolet (UV) freeze-in. We consider PBHs that evaporate before Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN). For both scalar and vector DM, our analysis incorporates the evolution of a second superradiant mode. We demonstrate that the growth of a second superradiant mode causes the decay of the first mode, and thus the second mode cannot further enhance the DM abundance beyond that already achieved by the first mode. Our study also reveals that while superradiance generally enhances DM production, gravitational wave (GW) emission from the superradiant cloud may significantly modify this picture. For scalar DM, GW emission reduces the parameter space where superradiance effectively augments relic abundance. For vector DM, rapid GW emission from the superradiant cloud may yield relic abundances below those achieved through Hawking radiation alone. These findings demonstrate that multiple-mode effect and GW emission play critical roles in modeling DM production from PBHs in the early universe.</description>

      <title>Effective Field Theory of Chiral Gravitational Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19059v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When a (non-)Abelian gauge field acquires an isotropic background configuration during inflation, strong gravitational waves (GWs) with parity-violating polarization, known as chiral GWs, can be produced in addition to the intrinsic unpolarized GWs. However, previous studies have analyzed individual models, leaving the generality of this phenomenon unclear. To perform a model-independent analysis, we construct an effective field theory (EFT) of chiral GWs by extending the EFT of inflation and incorporating gauge fields. The resulting action unifies inflationary models with a $SU(2)$ gauge field, such as chromo-natural inflation and gauge-flation, and ones with a triplet of $U(1)$ gauge fields, systematically encompassing all possible GW production mechanisms consistent with the symmetry breaking induced by the gauge field background. We find that chiral GWs are generically and inevitably produced, provided that the effective energy density of the background gauge field is positive and the gauge kinetic function is not fine-tuned to a specific time dependence. This EFT offers a useful foundation for future phenomenological studies as well as for deepening our theoretical understanding of chiral GWs.</description>

      <title>Search for high energy 5.5 MeV solar axions with the complete Borexino dataset</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.19135v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A search for solar axions and axion-like particles produced in the $p+d\rightarrow\rm{^3He}+A~(5.5\rm{ ~MeV})$ reaction was performed using the complete dataset of the Borexino detector (3995 days of measurement live-time). The following interaction processes have been considered: axion decay into two photons $({\rm A}\rightarrow2\gamma)$, inverse Primakoff conversion on nuclei $({\rm A}+Z\rightarrow\gamma+Z$), the Compton conversion of axions to photons $({\rm A}+e\rightarrow e+\gamma)$ and the axio-electric effect $({\rm A}+e+Z\rightarrow e+Z$). Model-independent limits on axion-photon ($g_{A\gamma}$), axion-electron ($g_{Ae}$), and isovector axion-nucleon ($g_{3AN}$) couplings are obtained: $|g_{A\gamma}\times g_{3AN}| \leq 2.3\times 10^{-11} \rm{GeV}^{-1}$ and $|g_{Ae}\times g_{3AN}| \leq 1.9\times 10^{-13}$ at $m_A &lt;$ 1 MeV (90\% c.l.). The Borexino results exclude new large regions of $g_{A\gamma}$, and $g_{Ae}$ coupling constants and axion masses $m_A$, and leads to constraints on the products $|g_{A\gamma}\times m_A|$ and $|g_{Ae}\times m_A|$ for the KSVZ- and the DFSZ-axion models.</description>

      <title>Impact of Initial-State Nuclear and Sub-Nucleon Structures on Ultra-Central Puzzle in Heavy Ion Collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19208v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hydrodynamic models fail to describe the near-equal $v_2/v_3$ ratio observed in ultra-central heavy-ion collisions, despite their success in other centrality classes. This discrepancy stems from shear viscosity suppressing higher-order geometric eccentricities, resulting in underestimated $v_3$ when using the conventional QGP viscosity coefficient. We explore two initial-state modifications to resolve this puzzle: (1) enforcing a minimum nucleon separation distance to homogenize distributions, and (2) amplifying sub-nucleon structures to reduce initial eccentricity. Using TRENTo initial conditions and 3+1D viscous hydrodynamic model CLVisc, both approaches significantly lower geometric eccentricity, reduce required viscosity, and narrow the $v_2$-$v_3$ gap in ultra-central collisions. Our results implicate initial-state nuclear and sub-nucleon structures as critical factors in addressing this puzzle. Resolving it would advance nuclear structure studies and improve precision in extracting QGP transport coefficients (e.g., shear viscosity), bridging microscopic nuclear features to macroscopic quark-gluon plasma properties.</description>

Abstract: We elucidate the dynamics induced by a Wilson Line of charge $q$ and electron charge $e$ in $QED_4$ coupled to a real scalar via Yukawa interactions. We observe that there is a range of the fixed product $e^2 q$ with $e\rightarrow 0$ and $q\rightarrow \infty$ for which four-fermion operators play a dominant role for the dynamics of the theory. We uncover the fixed-point dynamics of the theory and analyze their critical behavior.</description>

      <title>Disentangling the global multiplicity and spectral shape fluctuations in radial flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20008v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Radial flow is a key collective phenomenon in heavy-ion collisions, manifests through event-by-event fluctuations in transverse momentum ($p_{\mathrm{T}}$) spectra. The $p_{\mathrm{T}}$-differential radial flow, $v_0(p_{\mathrm{T}})$, initially conceived to capture local spectral shape fluctuations, is influenced by global multiplicity fluctuations. Using the HIJING model, we explore how different definitions of event activity for centrality and spectral normalization schemes affect $v_0(p_{\mathrm{T}})$. We find these methodological variations induce a constant offset in $v_0(p_{\mathrm{T}})$ without altering its shape, indicating that the dynamic $p_{\mathrm{T}}$-differential information on radial flow remains robust, but its absolute magnitude is meaningful only up to a baseline offset dictated by global multiplicity fluctuations.</description>

      <title>Starlight from JWST: Implications for star formation and dark matter models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20043v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We confront the star formation rate in different dark matter (DM) models with UV luminosity data from JWST up to $z\simeq25$ and legacy data from HST. We find that a transition from a Salpeter population to top-heavy Pop-III stars is likely at $z\simeq10$ and that beyond $z=10-15$ the feedback from supernovae and active galactic nuclei is progressively reduced, so that at $z\simeq25$ the production of stars is almost free from any feedback. We compare fuzzy and warm DM models that suppress small-scale structures with the CDM paradigm, finding that the fuzzy DM mass $&gt; 4.5 \times 10^{-22}{\rm eV}$ and the warm DM mass $&gt; 1.5\, {\rm keV}$ at the 95\% CL. The fits of the star formation rate parametrization do not depend strongly on the DM properties within the allowed range. We find no preference over CDM for enhanced matter perturbations associated with axion miniclusters or primordial black holes. The scale of the enhancement of the power spectrum should be $&gt; 27\,{\rm Mpc}^{-1}$ at the 95\% CL, excluding axion miniclusters produced for $m_a &lt; 7.5 \times 10^{-17}\,{\rm eV}$ or heavy primordial black holes that constitute a fraction $f_{\rm PBH}$ of DM in the range $10^{-4} (m_{\rm PBH}/10^4 \,M_{\odot})^{-0.09} &lt; f_{\rm PBH} &lt; 8.7\times 10^{-3} (m_{\rm PBH}/10^4\, M_{\odot})^{-1}$.</description>

      <title>Tensor Reduction for Feynman Integrals with Lorentz and Spinor Indices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05137v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an efficient graphical approach to construct projectors for the tensor reduction of multi-loop Feynman integrals with both Lorentz and spinor indices in $D$ dimensions. An ansatz for the projectors is constructed making use of its symmetry properties via an orbit partition formula. The graphical approach allows to identify and enumerate the orbits in each case. For the case without spinor indices we find a 1 to 1 correspondence between orbits and integer partitions describing the cycle structure of certain bi-chord graphs. This leads to compact combinatorial formulae for the projector ansatz. With spinor indices the graph-structure becomes more involved, but the method is equally applicable. Our spinor reduction formulae are based on the antisymmetric basis of $\gamma$ matrices, and make use of their orthogonality property. We also provide a new compact formula to pass into the antisymmetric basis. We compute projectors for vacuum tensor Feynman integrals with up to 32 Lorentz indices and up to 4 spinor indices. We discuss how to employ the projectors in problems with external momenta.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09689v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Based on our recent analysis of the hadronic matrix element of the stress-energy tensor in covariant light front dynamics, we extract the charmonium gravitational form factor $D(Q^2)$ from shear stress $T^{12}$. This is in contrast to our recent work using the (light-front) energy density $T^{+-}$. Indeed, by comparing these two currents, we identify terms that are responsible for the violation of the current conservation. Numerical results based on basis light-front quantization show that the violation effects are small and the $D$-term extracted from the two currents are close to each other, hence validating our previous work using $T^{+-}$.</description>

      <title>An Extended Closure Relation by LightGBM for Neutrino Radiation Transport in Core-collapse Supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02719v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We developed a machine learning model using LightGBM, one of the most popular gradient-boosting decision tree methods these days, to predict the Eddington tensor, or the second-order angular moment, for neutrino radiation transport in core-collapse supernova simulations. We use not only the zeroth and first moments of the neutrino distribution function in momentum space as in ordinary closure relations but also information on the background matter configuration extensively. For training the model, we utilize some post-bounce snapshots from one of our previous Boltzmann radiation-hydrodynamics simulations; the Eddington tensor as well as the zeroth and first angular moments are calculated from the neutrino distribution function obtained in the simulation. LightGBM is light indeed, and its high efficiency in training enables us to feed a large number of features and figure out which features are more important than others. In this paper, we report the results of this feature engineering in addition to those of the training, validation, and generalization of our model. We find that the flux factor and non-local features are among the most relevant features; our LightGBM model can reproduce the Eddington factor better in general than the M1 closure relation, one of the most commonly employed algebraic closure relations at present; the generalization performance is also much improved from our previous model based on the deep neural network.</description>

      <title>Identifying Neutrino Mass Ordering with Cosmic Gravitational Focusing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.11115v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The cosmic gravitational focusing (CGF) of relic neutrinos can provide an independent measurement of the absolute neutrino masses $m_i$ with fourth-power dependence ($m^4_i$). We demonstrate in this paper for the first time how this can help identifying the neutrino mass ordering, using the fact that total mass falling below the inverted ordering threshold allows the discrimination of the inverted ordering. Upon incorporating the projected CGF sensitivity at DESI, the preference for the normal ordering with a prior $\sum m_i &gt; 0.059\,{\rm eV}$ would increase from the original 89.9\% of the existing matter clustering method with the DESI analysis to 98.2\% while the inverted ordering is further disfavored from 10.1\% to 1.8\%. We also show how this can affect the prospects of the neutrinoless double beta decay and single beta decay measurements.</description>

      <title>Investigating the Electroweak Phase Transition with a Real Scalar Singlet at a Muon Collider</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22700v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A strong first-order electroweak phase transition (SFOEWPT) is essential for explaining baryogenesis and for potentially generating observable gravitational waves. This study investigates the potential of a high-energy muon collider to examine the occurrence of SFOEWPT within the context of a Standard Model extended by a real scalar singlet (xSM). We analyzed all possible decay modes of the singlet to constrain the valid parameter space of SFOEWPT, which was extracted numerically at different renormalization scales to account for theoretical uncertainties, thereby determining the sensitivity of a muon collider to the production and decay channels of novel heavy scalar particles that emerge in the xSM. The findings demonstrate that a 3 TeV muon collider can directly examine the nature of electroweak symmetry breaking by efficiently detecting novel scalar particles associated with a first-order electroweak phase transition through jet-rich final states, thus complementing the indirect constraints from gravitational wave experiments.</description>

Abstract: A number of new balloon or space-based $\gamma$-ray observatories have been proposed to close a "MeV gap" in sensitivity to $\gamma$ rays in the MeV-GeV energy band. One aspect of the science case for these instruments is their ability to constrain or discover decaying or annihilating dark matter. In this work, we forecast the sensitivity of these instruments for dark matter annihilation or decay for a range of possible Standard Model final states and compare to existing bounds.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11433v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inspired by the experimental measurement of the charmed hadronic state X(6900), we calculate the mass spectra of tetraquark hybrid states with configuration of \([8_{c}]_{Q\bar{Q}} \otimes [8_{c}]_{G} \otimes [8_{c}]_{Q\bar{Q}}\) in color, by virtue of QCD sum rules. The two feasible types of currents with quantum numbers $J^{PC} = 0^{++}$ and $0^{-+}$ are investigated, in which the contributions from operators up to dimension six are taken into account in operator product expansion (OPE). In the end, we find that, in charm sector, the tetracharm hybrid states with quantum number \(0^{++}\) has a mass of about \(6.98^{+0.16}_{-0.14} \, \text{GeV}\), while \(0^{-+}\) state mass is about \(7.26^{+0.16}_{-0.15} \, \text{GeV}\). The results overlap with the experimental observations, suggesting potential tetracharm hybrid interpretations. In bottom sector, calculation shows that the masses of tetrabottom hybrid states with quantum numbers $0^{++}$ and $0^{-+}$ are \(19.30^{+0.16}_{-0.17} \, \text{GeV}\) and \(19.50^{+0.17}_{-0.17} \, \text{GeV}\), respectively, which are left for future experimental confirmation.</description>

      <title>Bayesian constraints on covariant density functional equations of state of compact stars with new NICER mass-radius measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16513v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advancements in astrophysical observations of compact stars, particularly the new and updated NICER constraints, have provided mass-radius ($M$-$R$) data for pulsars spanning masses from 1 to $2\,M_{\odot }$. These data offer a unique opportunity to test modern theories of dense matter using multi-messenger constraints. Covariant density functional (CDF) models of nuclear matter, which capture a broad range of nuclear and astrophysical phenomena, provide a robust theoretical framework to interpret these observations. This study applies the Bayesian framework to a class of CDF models with density-dependent meson-nucleon couplings, specifically those based on nucleonic degrees of freedom. By incorporating the latest multi-messenger constraints, we impose tighter limits on the parameter space of these models and assess their consistency with observational data. Our analysis advances previous efforts by refining the density-dependence parameterization and integrating recent $M$-$R$ ellipses. This enables more stringent evaluations of dense matter models in light of new astrophysical observations.</description>

      <title>TooLQit: Leptoquark Models and Limits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19729v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the leptoquark (LQ) toolkit, TooLQit, which includes leading-order FeynRules models for all types of LQs and a Python-based calculator, named CaLQ, to test if a set of parameter points are allowed by the LHC dilepton searches. The models include electroweak gauge interactions of the LQs and follow a set of intuitive notations. Currently, CaLQ can calculate the LHC limits on LQ ($S_1$ and $U_1$) couplings (one or more simultaneously) for any mass between $1$ and $5$ TeV using a $\chi^2$ method. In this manual for TooLQit, we describe the FeynRules models and discuss the techniques used in CaLQ. We outline the workflow to check parameter spaces of LQ models with an example. We show some illustrative scans for one- and multi-coupling scenarios for the $U_1$ vector LQ. The TooLQit code is available at https://github.com/rsrchtsm/TooLQit</description>

      <title>Improved global determination of two-meson distribution amplitudes from multi-body $B$ decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15150v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We improve the perturbative QCD (PQCD) formalism for multi-body charmless hadronic $B$ meson decays, such as $B\to VP_3\to P_1P_2P_3$, by resolving the possible discrepancy in parametrizing the contribution of the $P$-wave resonance $V$ to the two-meson distribution amplitudes (DAs) associated with the pairs $P_1P_2=\pi\pi, K\pi, KK$. The determination of the Gegenbauer moments in the two-meson DAs is then updated in the global fit of the improved PQCD factorization formulas at leading order in the strong coupling $\alpha_s$ to available data for branching ratios and polarization fractions of three- and four-body $B$ decays. The convergence of the Gegenbauer expansion of the resultant two-meson DAs is manifest. The satisfactory quality of the fit implies the consistency of the PQCD framework for multi-body $B$ decays and the universality of the nonperturbative two-meson DAs. In particular, the predicted longitudinal polarization fraction $f_0(B_s^0\to K^{*0} {\bar K}^{*0})=28.2^{+8.8}_{-9.5} \%$ with the updated Gegenbauer moments matches well the measurement. The observable $L_{K^{*0}{\bar K}^{*0}}=7.7^{+4.9}_{-3.8}$, defined as the ratio of the longitudinal amplitudes of the two $U$-spin related channels $B_s^0\to K^{*0} {\bar K}^{*0}$ and $B^0\to K^{*0} {\bar K}^{*0}$, accommodates the current data within errors. It is found that the direct $CP$ asymmetries ${\cal A}^{0,||,\bot}_{\rm CP}$ in the polarization states of some four-body decays $B\to V_1V_2\to (P_1P_2)(P_3P_4)$ might be large, but the destruction among them result in small net $CP$ violation. Our predictions can be confronted with LHCb and Belle-II data in the future.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.01088v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: LHCb Collaboration first observed a doubly charmed baryon $\Xi^{++}_{cc}$ in the $\Lambda^{+}_{c}K^{-}\pi^{+}\pi^{+}$ decay with a mass of $3621.40\pm0.78$ MeV. In this paper, we enumerated the mass spectra of the radial and orbital excited states for the doubly heavy $\Xi_{QQ^{\prime}}$ and $\Omega_{QQ^{\prime}}$ baryons using the Regge trajectory model and the scaling rules. Our studies suggest that $\Xi^{++}_{cc}$ can be grouped into the $1S$-wave state with the spin-parity quantum number $J^{P} = 1/2^{+}$. On the other hand, the mass of $\Xi_{cc}$ state with $J^{P} = 3/2^{+}$ is predicted to be $3699.69$ MeV. We also predict the mass spectra of the unknown ground and excited states for the doubly heavy $\Xi_{QQ^{\prime}}$ and $\Omega_{QQ^{\prime}}$ baryons, which provide useful references for the experimental test in the future.</description>

      <title>Custodial Naturalness</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.09699v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Custodial Naturalness is a new symmetry-based idea to explain the large separation between the electroweak (EW) scale and ultraviolet completions of the Standard Model (SM). Classical scale invariance is combined with an enhanced scalar-sector custodial symmetry and both are spontaneously broken by dimensional transmutation at a new intermediate scale. The SM-like Higgs boson is an elementary pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone-Boson (pNGB) of the extended custodial symmetry, which naturally explains the suppression of the EW scale without a little hierarchy problem. We explain details of the general mechanism, its minimal realization and simplest extensions which populate Higgs-, gauge-, and neutrino portals and introduce candidates for particle Dark Matter (DM). We show the stability of the mechanism under inclusion of new sources of explicit custodial symmetry violation, as well as under variations of boundary conditions at the high scale. Custodial Naturalness is experimentally testable - including a specific correlation between the Higgs and top quark masses, as well as by the prediction of a new heavy $Z'$ gauge boson and a new dilaton-like scalar which are well-motivated targets for future colliders and Higgs factories. The cosmological evolution features a strongly supercooled phase transition implying that consequences of Custodial Naturalness may also be tested by gravitational wave observatories.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.22170v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by the first observation of $CP$ violation in baryon decays, we study the topological amplitudes of bottom baryon decays in the $SU(3)_F$ limit. The topological diagrams of charmless two-body decays of bottom baryons are presented in detail. The linear relations between topologies and $SU(3)$ irreducible amplitudes are derived through tensor contraction and $SU(3)$ decomposition. It is found that there are thirteen independent amplitudes that contribute to charmless two-body decays of bottom baryons in the $SU(3)_F$ limit, and four amplitudes among them are critical in the $CP$ asymmetries.</description>

Abstract: We identify an observable that operates as a probe of the quark versus hadron content of a bath of quarks and gluons at finite temperature and chemical potential. To this purpose, we relate the Polyakov and anti-Polyakov loops, which determine how energetically costly it is to bring an external static quark or antiquark probe into the thermal bath, to the ability of that medium to provide the conditions for the formation of meson-like or baryon-like configurations that would screen the probes.</description>

      <title>Lattice calculation of the $\pi^0$, $\eta$ and $\eta^{\prime}$ transition form factors and the hadronic light-by-light contribution to the muon $g-2$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.04570v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we present a first ab-initio calculation of the $\pi^0$, $\eta$ and $\eta^{\prime}$ transition form factors performed with physical light-quark masses. We provide a complete parametrization of the form factors that includes both single and double-virtual kinematics. Our results are compared with experimental measurements of the form factors in the space-like region and with the measured two-photon decay widths. In a second step, our parametrizations of the transition form factors are used to compute the dominant pseudoscalar-pole contributions to the hadronic light-by-light scattering in the muon $g-2$. Our final result reads $a_{\mu}^{\rm hlbl, ps-pole} = (85.1 \pm 5.2) \times 10^{-11}$. Although the pion-pole is dominant, we confirm that, together, the $\eta$ and $\eta^{\prime}$ provide roughly half of its contribution.</description>

      <title>Too Hot to Handle: Searching for Inflationary Particle Production in Planck Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03738v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Non-adiabatic production of massive particles is a generic feature of many inflationary mechanisms. If sufficiently massive, these particles can leave features in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) that are not well-captured by traditional correlation function analyses. We consider a scenario in which particle production occurs only in a narrow time-interval during inflation, eventually leading to CMB hot- or coldspots with characteristic shapes and sizes. Searching for such features in CMB data is analogous to searching for late-Universe hot- or coldspots, such as those due to the thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (tSZ) effect. Exploiting this data-analysis parallel, we perform a search for particle-production hotspots in the Planck PR4 temperature dataset, which we implement via a matched-filter analysis. Our pipeline is validated on synthetic observations and found to yield unbiased constraints on sufficiently large hotspots across $\approx 60\%$ of the sky. After removing point sources and tSZ clusters, we find no evidence for new physics and place novel bounds on the coupling between the inflaton and massive particles. These bounds are strongest for larger hotspots, produced early in inflation, whilst sensitivity to smaller hotspots is limited by noise and beam effects. Through such methods we can constrain particles with masses $\mathcal{O}(100)$ times larger than the inflationary Hubble scale, which represents possibly the highest energies ever directly probed with observational data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19896v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The formations of the $K(\bar{K})$, $D(\bar{D})$, and $B(\bar{B})$ meson-nucleus bound states in ${\rm{^{16}O}}$, ${\rm{^{40}Ca}}$, ${\rm{^{90}Zr}}$, ${\rm{^{197}Au}}$, and ${\rm{^{208}Pb}}$ nucleus are investigated using the quark meson coupling model. The model relies on a mean field description of non-overlapping nucleon bags bound by the self-consistent interactions of scalar ($\sigma$, $\delta$) and vector ($\omega$, $\rho$) mesons with the (anti)quarks inside the bags, which is further extended to explore the properties of nuclei. We estimate the meson-nucleus bound state energies by solving the Klein-Gordon equations with the real potentials calculated self-consistently within the model, using a coordinate space approach. The calculations are carried out for different nuclear interactions. The effects of Coulomb interaction are considered in the present study for the charged mesons. Our study indicates the formation of rather deeply bound $B$-mesic states at the very central region of the nuclei, compared to the $D$ and $K$ mesons, offering a more promising probe to explore subtle nuclear medium effects. The investigations of such bound states are of particular interest for the upcoming $\rm{\bar{P}ANDA}$ at FAIR, J-PARC-E29, and JLab experiments.</description>

      <title>Impact of relativistic waveforms in LISA's science objectives with extreme-mass-ratio inspirals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17310v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Extreme-Mass-Ratio Inspirals (EMRIs) are one of the key targets for future space-based gravitational wave detectors, such as LISA. The scientific potential of these sources can only be fully realized with fast and accurate waveform models. In this work, we extend the \textsc{FastEMRIWaveform} (\texttt{FEW}) framework by providing fully relativistic waveforms at adiabatic order for circular, equatorial orbits in Kerr spacetime, for mass ratios up to $10^{-3}$. We investigate the significance of including relativistic corrections in the waveform for both vacuum and non-vacuum environments. Specifically, we develop relativistic non-vacuum EMRI waveforms including two different environmental effects in the EMRI waveforms: power-law migration torques, and superradiance scalar clouds. For EMRIs in vacuum, we find that non-relativistic waveforms incorrectly estimate the predicted source's horizon redshift by approximately $35\%$ error. Our analysis shows that incorporating relativistic corrections enhances constraints on accretion disks, modeled through power-law torques, and improves the constraints on disk parameter estimates (error $\simeq 8\%$), representing a significant improvement over previous estimates. Additionally, we assess the evidence for models in a scenario where ignoring the accretion disk biases the parameter estimation (PE), reporting a $\log_{10}$ Bayes factor of $1.1$ in favor of the accretion disk model. In a fully relativistic setup, we also estimate the parameters of superradiant scalar clouds with relative errors $\simeq 0.3\%$ for the scalar cloud's mass. These results demonstrate that incorporating relativistic effects is essential for LISA science objectives with EMRIs.</description>

      <title>Consistency of EFT illuminated via relative entropy: A case study in scalar field theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21062v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Relative entropy is a non-negative quantity and offers a powerful means of achieving a unified understanding of fundamental properties in physics, including the second law of thermodynamics and positivity bounds on effective field theories (EFTs). We analyze the relative entropy in scalar field theories and show that the non-negativity of relative entropy is potentially violated in perturbative calculations based on operator and loop expansions. Conversely, this suggests that the consistency of the EFT description in the scalar field theory can be identified by the sign of the relative entropy. In fact, we revisit an EFT of single-field inflation and present a relation between its non-linear parameter $f_{\rm NL}$ and the consistency condition of the EFT description derived from the relative entropy method. We find that interesting regions of $f_{\rm NL}$ that are observationally allowed can be constrained from the relative entropy by imposing the consistency of the EFT description when the EFT is generated via the interaction with heavy fields in UV theories.</description>

      <title>A rich structure of renormalization group flows for Higgs-like models in 4 dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07476v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider $2$ coupled Higgs doublets which transform in the usual way under SU(2)$\otimes$U(1). By constructing marginal operators which satisfy an operator product expansion based on the SU(2) Lie algebra, we can obtain a rich pattern of renormalization group (RG) flows which includes lines of fixed points and more interestingly, cyclic RG flows which are unavoidable in this model. The hamiltonian is pseudo-hermitian, $H^\dagger = {\cal K} H {\cal K}^\dagger $ with ${\cal K}$ unitary satisfying ${\cal K}^2 =1$, thus the model is non-unitary. The hamiltonian still has real eigenvalues, but the non-unitarity is manifested in negative norm states. One can use the operator ${\cal K}$ to define projection operators onto positive norm states, and in this sub-Hilbert space the time evolution is unitary with positive probabilities. Upon spontaneous symmetry breaking, the Higgs fields have an infinite number of vacuum expectation values $v_n$ which satisfy ``Russian Doll" scaling $v_n \sim e^{2 n \lambda}$ where $n=1,2,3,\ldots$ and $\lambda$ is the period of one RG cycle which is an RG invariant. We speculate that this Russian Doll RG flow can perhaps resolve the so-called hierarchy problem and may shed light on the origin of ``families" in the Standard Model of particle physics</description>

Abstract: We present a systematic ab initio study of the low-lying states in beryllium isotopes from 7Be to 12Be using nuclear lattice effective field theory with the N3LO interaction. Our calculations achieve good agreement with experimental data for energies, radii, and electromagnetic properties. We introduce a novel, model-independent method to quantify nuclear shapes, uncovering a distinct pattern in the interplay between positive and negative parity states across the isotopic chain. By combining Monte Carlo sampling of the many-body density operator with a novel nucleon-grouping algorithm, the prominent two-center cluster structures, the emergence of one-neutron halo, complex nuclear molecular dynamics such as {\pi} orbital and {\sigma} orbital, emerge naturally.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19868v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In relativistic heavy-ion collisions, electromagnetic (EM) radiation has been used as a sensitive probe of Quark Gluon Plasma (QGP) properties, owing to the smaller EM coupling relative to QCD coupling. To better understand the constraining power of EM emissions on transport properties of the QGP, a deeper understanding of both the theory and phenomenology of EM signals is required. A selection of recent developments in those two areas of QGP EM probes is discussed, with an outlook on how Bayesian model-to-data comparisons can help further quantify our understanding of QGP transport coefficients.</description>

      <title>Lorentz and CPT violation and the (anti-)hydrogen molecular ion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09730v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The extremely narrow natural linewidths of rovibrational energy levels in the molecular hydrogen ion $\textrm{H}_2^{\,+}$, and the prospect of synthesising its antimatter counterpart $\overline{\textrm{H}}_2^{\,-}$, make it a promising candidate for high-precision tests of fundamental symmetries such as Lorentz and CPT invariance. In this paper, we present a detailed analysis of the rovibrational spectrum of the (anti-)hydrogen molecular ion in a low-energy effective theory incorporating Lorentz and CPT violation. The focus is on the spin-independent couplings in this theory, for which the best current bounds come from measurements of the 1S-2S transition in atomic hydrogen and antihydrogen. We show that in addition to the improvement in these bounds from the increased precision of the transition frequencies, potentially reaching 1 part in $10^{17}$, rovibrational transitions have an enhanced sensitivity to Lorentz and CPT violation of $O(m_p/m_e)$ in the proton (hadron) sector compared to atomic transitions.</description>

      <title>$B \to \rho \ell \bar{\nu}$ resonance form factors from $B \to \pi\pi \ell \bar{\nu}$ in lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00903v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The decay $B \to \rho \ell \bar{\nu}$ is an attractive process for determining the magnitude of the smallest CKM matrix element, $|V_{ub}|$, and can provide new insights into the origin of the long-standing exclusive-inclusive discrepancy in determinations of this Standard-Model parameter. This requires a nonperturbative QCD calculation of the $B \to \rho$ form factors $V$, $A_0$, $A_1$, and $A_{12}$. The unstable nature of the $\rho$ resonance has prevented precise lattice QCD calculations of these form factors to date. Here, we present the first lattice QCD calculation of the $B \to \rho$ form factors in which the $\rho$ is treated properly as a resonance in $P$-wave $\pi \pi$ scattering. To this end, we use the Lellouch-L\"uscher finite-volume formalism to compute the $B \to \pi \pi$ form factors as a function of both momentum transfer and $\pi \pi$ invariant mass, and then analytically continue to the $\rho$ resonance pole. This calculation is performed with $2+1$ dynamical quark flavors at a pion mass of approximately 320 MeV, and demonstrates a clear path toward results at the physical point.</description>

      <title>Chiral condensates and screening masses of neutral pseudoscalar mesons from lattice QCD at physical quark masses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11262v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the effects of temperature $T$ and external magnetic fields $eB$ on the chiral condensates and screening masses of neutral pseudoscalar mesons, including $\pi^0$, $K^0$, and $\eta_{s\bar{s}}^0$, in (2+1)-flavor lattice QCD with physical quark masses. The chiral condensates are intrinsically connected to the screening masses via Ward-Takahashi identities, with the latter characterizing the inverse of the spatial correlation length in the pseudoscalar channel. Using highly improved staggered quarks, we perform simulations on lattices with temporal extents $N_\tau = 8, 12, 16$ and an aspect ratio of 4, covering five temperatures from 145 MeV to 166 MeV. For each temperature, eight magnetic field strengths are simulated, reaching up to $eB \sim 0.8$ GeV$^2$. These simulations allow us to provide continuum estimates for the chiral condensates and screening masses. We observe intricate behavior in the light ($ud$), strange-light ($ds$) and strange ($s$) quark condensates as functions of the magnetic field and temperature, reflecting the competition between magnetic catalysis and inverse magnetic catalysis effects. This complex behavior is also mirrored in the screening masses of the neutral pseudoscalar mesons. Notably, the screening masses of $\pi^0$ and $K^0$ exhibit a non-monotonic dependence on $eB$, closely following the variations in their corresponding chiral condensates. Meanwhile, the screening mass of $\eta_{s\bar{s}}^0$ decreases monotonically with increasing $eB$. These findings provide valuable insights for understanding the behavior of QCD in a thermomagnetic medium and can serve as benchmarks for low-energy QCD models and effective theories.</description>

      <title>Black Holes Rule Out Heavy Tachyons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11606v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present direct observational constraints on tachyons; particles with group velocity greater than $c$ in vacuum in a Lorentz invariant theory. Since tachyons may have no direct couplings to Standard Model particles, the most robust and model independent constraints come from gravitational effects, especially black holes. We compute the Hawking radiation of tachyons from black holes, finding it to be significantly enhanced in the presence of heavy tachyons. For a black hole of mass $M$ and tachyons of mass $m$ with $g$ degrees of freedom, the black hole lifetime is found to be $t_{bh} \approx 192 \pi \hbar M/(g c^2 m^2)$ (or doubled for fermions). This implies that the observation of black holes of a few solar masses, with lifetime of several billion years, rules out tachyons of mass $m &gt; 3 \times 10^9$ GeV. This means there cannot exist any tachyons associated with unification scales or quantum gravity. So while there already exists theoretical reasons to be skeptical of tachyons, our work provides a complementary direct observational constraint.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.14864v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Sun can efficiently capture leptophilic dark matter that scatters with free electrons. If this dark matter subsequently annihilates into leptonic states, it can produce a detectable neutrino flux. Using 10 years of Super-Kamiokande observations, we set constraints on the dark-matter/electron scattering cross-section that exceed terrestrial direct detection searches by more than an order of magnitude for dark matter masses below 100 GeV, and reach cross-sections as low as $\sim$4$\times$10$^{-41}$cm$^{-2}$.</description>

      <title>Single versus multifield scalar potentials from string theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17775v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the properties of string effective theories with scalar field(s) and a scalar potential. We first claim that in most examples known, such theories are multifield, with at least 2 non-compact field directions; the few counter-examples appear to be very specific and isolated. Such a systematic multifield situation has important implications for cosmology. Characterising properties of the scalar potential $V$ is also more delicate in a multifield setting. We provide several examples of string effective theories with $V&gt;0$, where the latter admits an asymptotically flat direction along an off-shell field trajectory: in other words, there exists a limit $\varphi \rightarrow \infty$ for which $\frac{|\partial_{\varphi} V|}{V} \rightarrow 0$. It is thus meaningless to look for a lower bound to this single field quantity in a multifield setting; the complete gradient $\nabla V$ is then better suited. Restricting to on-shell trajectories, this question remains open, especially when following the steepest descent or more generally a gradient flow evolution. Interestingly, single field statements in multifield theories seem less problematic for $V&lt;0$.</description>

      <title>Abundance and properties of dark radiation from the cosmic microwave background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04671v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the cosmological signatures of new light relics that are collisionless like standard neutrinos or are strongly interacting. We provide a simple and succinct rephrasing of their physical effects in the cosmic microwave background, as well as the resulting parameter degeneracies with other cosmological parameters, in terms of the total radiation abundance and the fraction thereof that freely streams. In these more general terms, interacting and noninteracting light relics are differentiated by their respective decrease and increase of the free-streaming fraction, and, moreover, the scale-dependent interplay thereof with a common, correlated reduction of the fraction of matter in baryons. We then derive updated constraints on various dark-radiation scenarios with the latest cosmological observations, employing this language to identify the physical origin of the impact of each dataset. The "PR4" reanalyses of Planck CMB data prefer a larger primordial helium yield and therefore also slightly more radiation than the 2018 analysis; we investigate the differences between the two releases that drives these shifts. Smaller free-streaming fractions are disfavored by the excess lensing of the CMB measured in lensing reconstruction data from Planck and the Atacama Cosmology Telescope. On the other hand, baryon acoustic oscillation measurements from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument drive marginal detections of new, strongly interacting light relics due to that data's preference for lower matter fractions. Finally, we forecast measurements from the CMB-S4 experiment.</description>

      <title>Investigating the correlation between ZTF TDEs and IceCube high-energy neutrinos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09426v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The main contributors of the IceCube diffuse neutrino flux remain unclear. Tidal disruption events (TDEs) have been proposed as potential emitters of the high-energy neutrinos detected by IceCube. Therefore, investigating the correlation between the TDE population and IceCube neutrinos could help us better understand whether the TDE population could be potential high-energy neutrino emitters. In this paper, we perform a systematic search for TDEs that are associated with neutrinos in a sample including 143 IceCube neutrino alert events and 56 TDEs classified by the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) - Bright Transient Survey (BTS). Furthermore, considering that the TDEs/TDE candidates reported as potential IceCube neutrino emitters are all accompanied by infrared (IR) observations, we further select the TDEs with IR observations from these 56 TDEs as a subsample to examine the correlation with neutrinos. Based on the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) mission database, eight TDEs are identified as having IR observations. Since good spatial localization is crucial for association analysis, we employ two methods to handle alert events with large error radii in our sample. Then we employ Monte Carlo simulations to quantify the correlation between the TDE sample/subsample and IceCube neutrinos. Finally, after considering spatial and temporal criteria, the eight TDEs with IR echoes show the most significant correlation at a 2.37$\sigma$ confidence level. If we tentatively further take the time delay factor into account in the weighting scheme, the correlation enhances to 2.65$\sigma$ confidence level.</description>

      <title>Transverse-momentum-dependent pion structures from lattice QCD: Collins-Soper kernel, soft factor, TMDWF, and TMDPDF</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04625v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the first lattice quantum chromodynamics (QCD) calculation of the pion valence-quark transverse-momentum-dependent parton distribution function (TMDPDF) within the framework of large-momentum effective theory (LaMET). Using correlators fixed in the Coulomb gauge (CG), we computed the quasi-TMD beam function for a pion with a mass of 300 MeV, a fine lattice spacing of $a = 0.06$ fm and multiple large momenta up to 3 GeV. The intrinsic soft functions in the CG approach are extracted from form factors with large momentum transfer, and as a byproduct, we also obtain the corresponding Collins-Soper (CS) kernel. Our determinations of both the soft function and the CS kernel agree with perturbation theory at small transverse separations ($b_\perp$) between the quarks. At larger $b_\perp$, the CS kernel remains consistent with recent results obtained using both CG and gauge-invariant TMD correlators in the literature. By combining next-to-leading logarithmic (NLL) factorization of the quasi-TMD beam function and the soft function, we obtain $x$-dependent pion valence-quark TMDPDF for transverse separations $b_\perp \gtrsim 1$ fm. Interestingly, we find that the $b_\perp$ dependence of the phenomenological parameterizations of TMDPDF for moderate values of $x$ are in reasonable agreement with our QCD determinations. In addition, we present results for the transverse-momentum-dependent wave function (TMDWF) for a heavier pion with 670 MeV mass.</description>

      <title>[C II]-deficit caused by self-absorption in an ionized carbon-filled bubble in RCW79</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08976v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent spectroscopic observations of the [C II] 158$\,\mathrm{\mu m}$ fine-structure line of ionized carbon (C$^+$), using the Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy (SOFIA), have revealed expanding [C II] shells in Galactic H II regions. We report the discovery of a bubble-shaped source (S144 in RCW79), associated with a compact H II region, excited by a single O7.5--9.5V/III star, which is consistent with a scenario that the bubble is still mostly ``filled'' with C$^+$. This indicates most likely a very early evolutionary state, in which the stellar wind has not yet blown material away, as it is the case for more evolved H II regions. Using the SimLine non-LTE radiative transfer code, the [C II] emission can be modeled to originate from three regions. First, a central H II region with little C$^+$ in the fully ionized phase, followed by two layers with gas density around $2500\,\mathrm{cm^{-3}}$ of partially photo-dissociated gas. The second layer is a slowly expanding [C II] shell with an expansion velocity of $\sim\,$$2.6\,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$. The outermost layer exhibits a temperature and velocity gradient that produces the observed self-absorption features in the optically thick [C II] line ($\tau \sim 4$) leading to an apparent deficit in [C II] emission and a low ratio of [C II] to total far-infrared (FIR) emission. We developed a procedure to approximate the missing [C II] flux and find a linear correlation between [C II] and FIR without a [C II]-deficit. This demonstrates that at least some of the [C II]-deficit found in Galactic H II bubbles can be attributed to self-absorption.</description>

      <title>Non-perturbative renormalization group for Higgs-like models in 4D</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09327v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We recently defined a model of 2 coupled SU(2) Higgs-like doublets which revealed an interesting structure of renormalization group flows to 1-loop when the SU(2) is broken to U(1). In this article we compute the beta functions to 3 loops and show that the 1-loop structure of flows persists to higher orders. For SU(2) broken to U(1), we conjecture a beta function to all orders. The flows can be extended to large coupling using a strong-weak coupling duality $g \to 1/g$. One finds a line of fixed points which are new conformal field theories in 4 spacetime dimensions which are non-unitary due to negative norm states but still have real eigenvalues. We also find massless flows between 2 non-trivial fixed points, and a regime with a cyclic RG flow. For the flows between points on the critical line, we compute the anomalous dimensions of the perturbations in the UV and IR, and identify some special points where anomalous dimensions are rational numbers. The model is non-unitary since the hamiltonian is pseudo-hermitian, $H^\dagger = {\cal K} H {\cal K}^\dagger$. The unitary operator ${\cal K} $ satisfies $ {\cal K}^2 =1$ and this allows a projection onto positive norm states with a unitary time evolution with positive probabilities. We also provide some evidence for a hidden SL(2,Z) symmetry.</description>
