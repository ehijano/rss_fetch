      <title>Explicit conserved operators for a class of integrable bosonic networks from the classical Yang-Baxter equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00483v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $B$ denote the weighted adjacency matrix of a balanced, symmetric, bipartite graph. We define a class of bosonic networks given by Hamiltonians whose hopping terms are determined by $B$. We show that each quantum Hamiltonian is Yang-Baxter integrable, admitting a set of mutually commuting operators derived through a solution of the classical Yang-Baxter equation. We discuss some applications and consequences of this result.</description>

      <title>Soliton hierarchies associated with Lie algebra sp(6)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, by selecting appropriate spectral matrices within the loop algebra of symplectic Lie algebra sp(6), we construct two distinct classes of integrable soliton hierarchies. Then, by employing the Tu scheme and trace identity, we derive the Hamiltonian structures of the aforementioned two classes of integrable systems. From these two classes of integrable soliton hierarchies, we select one particular hierarchy and employ the Kronecker product to construct an integrable coupling system.</description>

      <title>Motion in time of a swinging Atwood machine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00058v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An exact solution for the motion in time of the swinging Atwood machine is presented. The trajectories of the so called teardrop-heart orbits are obtained considering an extended Hamiltonian and a time transformation first introduced by Poincare. The motion is isochronous with respect to the launch angle.</description>

      <title>Inelastic Scattering, Emergent Interactions of Solitons in the Zakharov-Kuznetsov Equation through Conservative and non-Conservative Physics-Informed Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20027v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Zakharov-Kuznetsov equation, originally a three dimensional mathematical model of plasma with a uniform magnetic field, is a direct extension of the KdV equation into higher dimensions and is a typical quasi-integrable system. Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) are used to study the collision of soliton solutions in the 2+1 dimensional Zakharov-Kuznetsov equation. PINNs are able to successfully solve the equations in the forward process, and the solutions are obtained using a mesh-free approach and automatic differentiation, taking into account conservation laws. In the inverse process, the proper form of the equation can be successfully derived from a given training data. However, the situation becomes intractable in the collision process. The forward analysis result no longer adheres to the laws of conservation, and is better described as a dynamically incompatible field configuration (DIFC) than a solution to the system. Conservative PINNs have thus been introduced for this purpose, and in this paper we succeed in obtaining solutions that satisfy conservation laws. The inverse analysis suggests a different equation in which the coefficients exhibit significant changes, implying an emergence of temporary interactions. With these modulated coefficients, we recalculate the equation and confirm that the adherence to the laws of conservation has unquestionably improved.</description>

      <title>Bennett Vorticity: A family of nonlinear Shear-Flow Stabilized Z-pinch equilibria</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05727v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Bennett profile is a classic form for the plasma number density of an equilibrium Z-pinch that has been studied for almost a century by plasma physicists interested in nonlinear plasma pinch science, and fusion energy. By transferring the nonlinearity entirely from the number density to the plasma flow velocity the current density of the resulting flowing Z-pinch equilibrium remains unchanged whilst now being defined by a vortical flow which previously did not exist in the classic case. Due to the positive-definite structure of the nonlinearity's first derivative, in the ideal limit this equilibrium conforms globally to the validity criterion for a shear-flow stabilized Z-pinch when the form of the temperature profile satisfies certain constraints.</description>
