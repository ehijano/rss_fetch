      <title>Mehta's eigenvectors for the finite Hartely transform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach for evaluating analytical eigenfunctions of the finite Hartley transform. The approach is based on the use of $N=1/2$-supersymmetric quantum mechanics as a fundamental tool, which builds on the key observation that the Hartley transform commutes with the supercharge operator. Using the intertwining operator between the Hartley transform and the finite Hartley transform, our approach provides an overcomplete basis of eigenvectors expressed in terms of supersymmetric Hermite polynomials.</description>

      <title>Price-Wharton Constrained Colliders: Co-Causation or No Causation?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19419v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Price and Wharton have recently suggested that "constrained retrocausal collider bias is the origin of entanglement." In this paper, we argue that their connection across a constrained collider (CCC) for the V-shaped case with the Bell states is not "a mechanism for entanglement," providing a negative answer to the title of arXiv:2406.04571. Rather, CCC should be viewed as a novel approach to the causal modeling of entanglement, providing a perspectival co-causal relationship between the two wings of the experiment that does not violate locality or statistical independence. The key is to accept that quantum mechanics is complete, so the Bell states provide the "mechanism for entanglement" and CCC provides a causal model of entanglement per causal perspectivalism in accord with the different subjective spacetime models of the experiment. When combined into an objective spacetime model of the experiment, the subjective co-causation disappears leaving an objective acausal view of entanglement in accord with the quantum reconstruction program. Essentially, the quantum reconstruction program has rendered quantum mechanics a principle theory based on the observer-independence of Planck's constant h as justified by the relativity principle ("no preferred reference frame" NPRF), exactly as special relativity is a principle theory based on the observer-independence of the speed of light c as justified by the relativity principle. Thus, NPRF + c is an adynamical global constraint on the configuration of worldtubes for the equipment in the experiment while NPRF + h is an adynamical global constraint on the distribution of quantum detection events in that context. Accordingly, CCC then provides a new way to understand causation subjectively per causal perspectivalism in this objectively acausal spacetime model of the experiment.</description>

      <title>The Kepler problem on the lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19423v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the motion of a particle in a 3-dimensional lattice in the presence of a Coulomb potential, but we demonstrate semiclassicaly that the trajectories will always remain in a plane which can be taken as a rectangular lattice. The Hamiltonian model for this problem is the conservative tight-binding one with lattice constants a, b and hopping elements A, B in the XY axes, respectively. We use the semiclassical and quantum formalisms; for the latter we apply the pseudo-spectral algorithm to integrate the Schroedinger equation. Since the lattice discrete subspace is not isotropic, the angular momentum is not conserved, which has interesting consequences as chaotic trajectories and precession trajectories, similar to the astronomical precession trajectories due to non-central gravitational forces, notably, the non-relativistic Mercury's perihelion precession. Although the elements of the mass tensor are naturally different in a rectangular lattice, these can be chosen to be still different in the continuum, which permits to study the motion with the usual Newtonian kinetic energies. We calculate also the contour plots of an initial Gaussian wavepacket as it moves in the lattice and we propose an "intrinsec angular momentum" associated to its asymmetrical deformation, such that the quantum and semiclassical angular momenta could be simply related.</description>

      <title>Bell vs Bell: a ding-dong battle over quantum incompleteness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19426v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Does determinism (or even the incompleteness of quantum mechanics) follow from locality and perfect correlations? In a 1964 paper John Bell gave the first demonstration that quantum mechanics is incompatible with local hidden variables. Since then a vigorous debate has rung out over whether he relied on an assumption of determinism or instead, as he later claimed in a 1981 paper, derived determinism from assumptions of locality and perfect correlation. This paper aims to bring clarity to the debate via simple examples and rigorous results. It is first recalled, via quantum and classical counterexamples, that the weakest statistical form of locality consistent with Bell's 1964 paper (parameter independence) is insufficient for the derivation of determinism. Attention is then turned to critically assess Bell's appealing to the Einstein-Rosen-Podolsky incompleteness argument to support his claim. It is shown this argument is itself incomplete, via counterexamples that expose two logical gaps. However, closing these gaps via a strong ``counterfactual'' reality criterion enables a rigorous derivation of each of quantum incompleteness, determinism and parameter independence, and in this sense justifies Bell's claim. Consequences for quantum interpretations are briefly discussed.</description>

      <title>Radiation from Dirac fermions caused by a projective measurement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19429v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The theory of radiation of photons from Dirac particles caused by a projective measurement is developed. The explicit expressions for the inclusive probability to record a chain of events that the Dirac fermion had been measured in a certain state and after that the photon was recorded are derived. Stimulated and spontaneous radiations are considered. It is shown that in both cases the properties of radiation due to measurement resembles the properties of edge or transition radiation. In the case of stimulated radiation from a single particle, its wave function creates photons coherently as a charged fluid, i.e., the amplitudes of radiation from the points of the particle wave packet are summed. In the case of spontaneous radiation, the radiation of photons is incoherent, i.e., the probabilities of radiation from the points of the particle wave packet are added up. It is shown that stimulated radiation due to measurement can be used to trace the dynamics and collapse of the wave function of the Dirac particle. A systematic procedure taking into account a finiteness of the measurement time is presented. It is established that radiation due to measurement can be used as a source of hard photons, but the finiteness of the measurement time imposes an upper bound on the energy of radiated photons: the measurement time must be smaller than the radiation formation time, the latter being in inverse proportion to the photon energy. In the ultrarelativistic limit, the radiation formation time can be rather large. Several examples of radiation due to measurement of the state of free Dirac particles are investigated in detail. Namely, we scrutinize the radiation due to measurement of the spin projection, of the momentum, and of the coordinate for a general initial state of Dirac particles. The particular cases of uncorrelated and entangled particles in the beam are considered.</description>

      <title>The sum of entanglement and subsystem coherence is invariant under quantum reference frame transformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19448v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent work on quantum reference frames (QRFs) has demonstrated that superposition and entanglement are properties that change under QRF transformations. Given their utility in quantum information processing, it is important to understand how a mere change of perspective can produce or reduce these resources. Here we find a trade-off between entanglement and subsystem coherence under a QRF transformation, in the form of a conservation theorem for their sum, for two pairs of measures. Moreover, we find a weaker trade-off for any possible pair of measures. Finally, we discuss the implications of this interplay for violations of Bell's inequalities, clarifying that for any choice of QRF, there is a quantum resource responsible for the violation. These findings contribute to a better understanding of the quantum information theoretic aspects of QRFs, offering a foundation for future exploration in both quantum theory and quantum gravity.</description>

      <title>Magic phase transition and non-local complexity in generalized $W$ State</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19457v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We employ the Stabilizer Renyi Entropy (SRE) to characterize a quantum phase transition that has so far eluded any standard description and can thus now be explained in terms of the interplay between its non-stabilizer properties and entanglement. The transition under consideration separates a region with a unique ground state from one with a degenerate ground state manifold spanned by states with finite and opposite (intensive) momenta. We show that SRE has a jump at the crossing points, while the entanglement entropy remains continuous. Moreover, by leveraging on a Clifford circuit mapping, we connect the observed jump in SRE to that occurring between standard and generalized $W$-states with finite momenta. This mapping allows us to quantify the SRE discontinuity analytically.</description>

      <title>$N$-bein formalism for the parameter space of quantum geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19468v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work introduces a geometrical object that generalizes the quantum geometric tensor; we call it $N$-bein. Analogous to the vielbein (orthonormal frame) used in the Cartan formalism, the $N$-bein behaves like a ``square root'' of the quantum geometric tensor. Using it, we present a quantum geometric tensor of two states that measures the possibility of moving from one state to another after two consecutive parameter variations. This new tensor determines the commutativity of such variations through its anti-symmetric part. In addition, we define a connection different from the Berry connection, and combining it with the $N$-bein allows us to introduce a notion of torsion and curvature \`{a} la Cartan that satisfies the Bianchi identities. Moreover, the torsion coincides with the anti-symmetric part of the two-state quantum geometric tensor previously mentioned, and thus, it is related to the commutativity of the parameter variations. We also describe our formalism using differential forms and discuss the possible physical interpretations of the new geometrical objects. Furthermore, we define different gauge invariants constructed from the geometrical quantities introduced in this work, resulting in new physical observables. Finally, we present two examples to illustrate these concepts: a harmonic oscillator and a generalized oscillator, both immersed in an electric field. We found that the new tensors quantify correlations between quantum states that were unavailable by other methods.</description>

      <title>A Traveling-Wave Parametric Amplifier and Converter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-fidelity qubit measurement is a critical element of all quantum computing architectures. In superconducting systems, qubits are typically measured by probing a readout resonator with a weak microwave tone which must be amplified before reaching the room temperature electronics. Superconducting parametric amplifiers have been widely adopted as the first amplifier in the chain, primarily because of their low noise performance, approaching the quantum limit. However, they require isolators and circulators to route signals up the measurement chain, as well as to protect qubits from amplified noise. While these commercial components are wideband and very simple to use, their intrinsic loss, size, and magnetic shielding requirements impact the overall measurement efficiency while also limiting prospects for scalable readout in large-scale superconducting quantum computers. Here we demonstrate a parametric amplifier that achieves both broadband forward amplification and backward isolation in a single, compact, non-magnetic circuit that could be integrated on chip with superconducting qubits. It relies on a nonlinear transmission line which supports traveling-wave parametric amplification of forward propagating signals, and isolation via frequency conversion of backward propagating signals. This kind of traveling-wave parametric amplifier and converter is poised to reduce the readout hardware overhead when scaling up the size of superconducting quantum computers.</description>

      <title>Testing quantum theory on curved space-time with quantum networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19533v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum technologies present new opportunities for fundamental tests of nature. One potential application is to probe the interplay between quantum physics and general relativity - a field of physics with no empirical evidence yet. Here we show that quantum networks open a new window to test this interface. We demonstrate how photon mediated entanglement between atomic or atom-like systems can be used to probe time-dilation induced entanglement and interference modulation. Key are non-local measurements between clocks in a gravitational field, which can be achieved either through direct photon interference or by using auxiliary entanglement. The resulting observable depends on the interference between different proper times, and can only be explained if both quantum theory and general relativity are taken into account. The proposed protocol enables clock interferometry on km-scale separations and beyond. Our work thus shows a realistic experimental route for a first test of quantum theory on curved space-time, opening up new scientific opportunities for quantum networks.</description>

      <title>Experimental observation of spontaneous symmetry breaking in a quantum phase transition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19624v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) plays a central role in understanding a large variety of phenomena associated with phase transitions, such as superfluid and superconductivity. So far, the transition from a symmetric vacuum to a macroscopically ordered phase has been substantially explored. The process bridging these two distinct phases is critical to understanding how a classical world emerges from a quantum phase transition, but so far remains unexplored in experiment. We here report an experimental demonstration of such a process with a quantum Rabi model engineered with a superconducting circuit. We move the system from the normal phase to the superradiant phase featuring two symmetry-breaking field components, one of which is observed to emerge as the classical reality. The results demonstrate that the environment-induced decoherence plays a critical role in the SSB.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19628v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The emergence of classical behaviour in quantum theory is often ascribed to the interaction of a quantum system with its environment, which can be interpreted as environmental monitoring of the system. As a result, off-diagonal elements of the density matrix of the system are damped in the basis of a preferred observable, often taken to be the position, leading to the phenomenon of decoherence. This effect can be modelled dynamically in terms of a Lindblad equation driven by the position operator. Here the question of decoherence resulting from a monitoring of position and momentum, i.e. a phase-space measurement, by the environment is addressed. There is no standard quantum observable corresponding to the detection of phase-space points, which is forbidden by Heisenberg's uncertainty principle. This issue is addressed by use of a coherent-state-based positive operator-valued measure (POVM) for modelling phase-space monitoring by the environment. In this scheme, decoherence in phase space implies the diagonalisation of the density matrix in both position and momentum representations. This is shown to be linked to a Lindblad dynamics where position and momentum appear as two independent Lindblad operators.</description>

      <title>Saturation Dynamics in Non-Hermitian Topological Sensing Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19629v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A class of non-Hermitian topological sensors (NTOSs) was recently proposed in which the NTOS comprises a non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger chain with a measurant-dependent coupling between the two ends of the chain. The smallest eigenenergy of the system, which serves as the readout signal, has an exponential dependence on the system size at small system sizes but saturates above a critical size. In this study, we further elucidate the dependence of the sensor sensitivity and saturation behavior on the system parameters. We explain how the behavior of the NTOS is characterized by a winding number, which indicates whether the smallest eigenenergy decreases to zero exponentially with the system size or grows exponentially up to a critical size. Interestingly, we further show that by imposing unidirectionality on the coupling between the two ends of a sensor, we can flip the size dependence of the smallest eigenenergy value from an exponentially increasing trend to an exponentially decreasing one. Our findings provide important insights into the saturation phenomenon and the impact of terminal couplings on the sensing characteristics of NTOSs.</description>

      <title>Unified Framework for Calculating Convex Roof Resource Measures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19683v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum resource theories (QRTs) provide a comprehensive and practical framework for the analysis of diverse quantum phenomena. A fundamental task within QRTs is the quantification of resources inherent in a given quantum state. In this letter, we introduce a unified computational framework for a class of widely utilized quantum resource measures, derived from convex roof extensions. We establish that the computation of these convex roof resource measures can be reformulated as an optimization problem over a Stiefel manifold, which can be further unconstrained through polar projection. Compared to existing methods employing semi-definite programming (SDP), gradient-based techniques or seesaw strategy, our approach not only demonstrates superior computational efficiency but also maintains applicability across various scenarios within a streamlined workflow. We substantiate the efficacy of our method by applying it to several key quantum resources, including entanglement, coherence, and magic states. Moreover, our methodology can be readily extended to other convex roof quantities beyond the domain of resource theories, suggesting broad applicability in the realm of quantum information theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19730v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a world where elections touch every aspect of society, the need for secure voting is paramount. Traditional safeguards, based on classical cryptography, rely on complex math problems like factoring large numbers. However, quantum computing is changing the game. Recent advances in quantum technology suggest that classical cryptographic methods may not be as secure as we thought. This paper introduces a quantum voting protocol, a blend of quantum principles (entanglement and superposition), blockchain technology, and digital signatures, all powered by $\log_2{n}$ qubits, and designed for approval voting with n candidates. The result is a symphony of security features - binding, anonymity, non-reusability, verifiability, eligibility, and fairness - that chart a new course for voting security. The real world beckons, as we tested this protocol on IBM quantum hardware, achieving impressively low error rates of just 1.17% in a four-candidate election.</description>

Abstract: Entanglement is a key resource for a wide range of tasks in quantum information and computing. Thus, verifying availability of this quantum resource is essential. Extensive research on entanglement detection has led to no-go theorems (Lu et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett., 116, 230501 (2016)]) that highlight the need for full state tomography (FST) in the absence of adaptive or joint measurements. Recent advancements, as proposed by Zhu, Teo, and Englert [Phys. Rev. A, 81, 052339, 2010], introduce a single-parameter family of entanglement witness measurements which are capable of conclusively detecting certain entangled states and only resort to FST when all witness measurements are inconclusive. We find a variety of realistic noisy two-qubit quantum states $\mathcal{F}$ that yield conclusive results under this witness family. We solve the problem of detecting entanglement among $K$ quantum states in $\mathcal{F}$, of which $m$ states are entangled, with $m$ potentially unknown. We recognize a structural connection of this problem to the Bad Arm Identification problem in stochastic Multi-Armed Bandits (MAB). In contrast to existing quantum bandit frameworks, we establish a new correspondence tailored for entanglement detection and term it the $(m,K)$-quantum Multi-Armed Bandit. We implement two well-known MAB policies for arbitrary states derived from $\mathcal{F}$, present theoretical guarantees on the measurement/sample complexity and demonstrate the practicality of the policies through numerical simulations. More broadly, this paper highlights the potential for employing classical machine learning techniques for quantum entanglement detection.</description>

      <title>Mixing of counterpropagating signals in a traveling-wave Josephson device</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19751v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Light waves do not interact in vacuum, but may mix through various parametric processes when traveling in a nonlinear medium. In particular, a high-amplitude wave can be leveraged to frequency convert a low-amplitude signal, as long as the overall energy and momentum of interacting photons are conserved. These conditions are typically met when all waves propagate in the medium with identical phase velocity along a particular axis. In this work, we investigate an alternative scheme by which an input microwave signal propagating along a 1-dimensional Josephson metamaterial is converted to an output wave propagating in the opposite direction. The interaction is mediated by a pump wave propagating at low phase velocity. In this novel regime, the input signal is exponentially attenuated as it travels down the device. We exploit this process to implement a robust on-chip microwave isolator that can be reconfigured into a reciprocal and tunable coupler. The device mode of operation is selected in situ, along with its working frequency over a wide microwave range. In the 5.5-8.5 GHz range, we measure an isolation over 15 dB on a typical bandwidth of 100 MHz, on par with the best existing on-chip isolators. Substantial margin for improvement exists through design optimization and by reducing fabrication disorder, opening new avenues for microwave routing and processing in superconducting circuits.</description>

      <title>A Traveling Wave Parametric Amplifier Isolator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superconducting traveling-wave parametric amplifiers have emerged as highly promising devices for near-quantum-limited broadband amplification of microwave signals and are essential for high quantum-efficiency microwave readout lines. Built-in isolation, as well as gain, would address their primary limitation: lack of true directionality due to potential backward travel of electromagnetic radiation to their input port. Here, we demonstrate a Josephson-junction-based traveling-wave parametric amplifier isolator. It utilizes third-order nonlinearity for amplification and second-order nonlinearity for frequency upconversion of backward propagating modes to provide reverse isolation. These parametric processes, enhanced by a novel phase matching mechanism, exhibit gain of up to 20~dB and reverse isolation of up to 30~dB over a static 3~dB bandwidth greater than 500~MHz, while keeping near-quantum limited added noise. This demonstration of a broadband truly directional amplifier ultimately paves the way towards broadband quantum-limited microwave amplification lines without bulky magnetic isolators and with inhibited back-action.</description>

      <title>Unveiling photon-photon coupling induced transparency and absorption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19771v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents the theoretical foundations of an analogous electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) and absorption (EIA) which we are referring as coupling induced transparency (CIT) and absorption (CIA) respectively, along with an exploration of the transition between these phenomena. We provide a concise phenomenological description with analytical expressions for transmission spectra and dispersion elucidating how the interplay of coherent and dissipative interactions in a coupled system results in the emergence of level repulsion and attraction, corresponding to CIT and CIA, respectively. The model is validated through numerical simulations using a hybrid system comprising a split ring resonator (SRR) and electric inductive-capacitive (ELC) resonator in planar geometry. We analyse two cases while keeping ELC parameters constant; one involving a dynamic adjustment of the SRR size with a fixed split gap, and the other entailing a varying gap while maintaining a constant SRR size. Notably, in the first case, the dispersion profile of the transmission signal demonstrates level repulsion, while the second case results in level attraction, effectively showcasing CIT and CIA, respectively. These simulated findings not only align with the theoretical model but also underscore the versatility of our approach. Subsequently, we expand our model to a more general case, demonstrating that a controlled transition from CIT to CIA is achievable by manipulating the dissipation rate of individual modes within the hybrid system, leading to either coherent or dissipative interactions between the modes. The results provide a pathway for designing hybrid systems that can control the group velocity of light, offering potential applications in the fields of optical switching and quantum information technology.</description>

      <title>Asymmetries of thermal processes in open quantum systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An intriguing phenomenon in non-equilibrium quantum thermodynamics is the asymmetry of thermal processes. Relaxation to thermal equilibrium is the most important dissipative process, being a key concept for the design of heat engines and refrigerators, contributing to the study of foundational questions of thermodynamics, and being relevant for quantum computing through the process of algorithmic cooling. Despite the importance of this kind of processes, their dynamics are far from being understood. We show that the free relaxation to thermal equilibrium follows intrinsically different paths depending on whether the temperature of the system increases (heating up) or decreases (cooling down), being faster in the first case. Our theory is exemplified using the recently developed thermal kinematics based on information geometry theory, utilizing three prototypical examples: a quantum two-level system, the quantum harmonic oscillator, and a trapped quantum Brownian particle, including both analytic results and numerical simulations. For this, we have extended the thermal kinematic approach to open quantum systems. Additionally, we offer a simple theoretical explanation in the case of a two level system and a more general picture for the other two systems based on the spectral decomposition of the Liouvillian and the spectral gap of reciprocal processes.</description>

      <title>Predicting Topological Entanglement Entropy in a Rydberg analog simulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19872v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Predicting the dynamical properties of topological matter is a challenging task, not only in theoretical and experimental settings, but also numerically. This work proposes a variational approach based on a time-dependent correlated Ansatz, focusing on the dynamical preparation of a quantum-spin-liquid state on a Rydberg-atom simulator. Within this framework, we are able to faithfully represent the state of the system throughout the entire dynamical preparation protocol. The flexibility of our approach does not only allow one to match the physically correct form of the Rydberg-atom Hamiltonian but also the relevant lattice topology. This is unlike previous numerical studies which were constrained to simplified versions of the problem through the modification of both the Hamiltonian and the lattice. Our approach further gives access to global quantities such as the topological entanglement entropy ($\gamma$), providing insight into the topological properties of the system. This is achieved by the introduction of the time-dependent variational Monte Carlo (t-VMC) technique to the dynamics of topologically ordered phases. Upon employing a Jastrow variational Ansatz with a scalable number of parameters, we are able to efficiently extend our simulations to system sizes matching state-of-the-art experiments and beyond. Our results corroborate experimental observations, confirming the presence of topological order during the dynamical state-preparation protocol, and additionally deepen our understanding of topological entanglement dynamics. We show that, while the simulated state exhibits (global) topological order and local properties resembling those of a resonating-valence-bond (RVB) state, it lacks the latter's characteristic topological entanglement entropy signature $\gamma = \ln(2)$, irrespective of the degree of adiabaticity of the protocol.</description>

      <title>From Problem to Solution: A general Pipeline to Solve Optimisation Problems on Quantum Hardware</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19876v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With constant improvements of quantum hardware and quantum algorithms, quantum advantage comes within reach. Parallel to the development of the computer at the end of the twentieth century, quantum software development will now also rapidly gain in importance and scale. On account of the inherent complexity and novelty of quantum computing (QC), as well as the expected lack of expertise of many of the stakeholders involved in its development, QC software development projects are exposed to the risk of being conducted in a crowded and unstructured way, lacking clear guidance and understanding. This paper presents a comprehensive quantum optimisation development pipeline, novel in its depth of 22 activities across multiple stages, coupled with project management insights, uniquely targeted to the late noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) [1] and early post-NISQ eras. We have extensively screened literature and use-cases, interviewed experts, and brought in our own expertise to develop this general quantum pipeline. The proposed solution pipeline is divided into five stages: Use-case Identification, Solution Draft, Pre-Processing, Execution and Post-Processing. Additionally, the pipeline contains two review points to address the project management view, the inherent risk of the project and the current technical maturity of QC technology. This work is intended as an orientation aid for all stakeholders involved in the development of QC applications and should therefore increase the chances of success of quantum software projects. We encourage researchers to adapt and extend the model where appropriate, as technological development also continues.</description>

      <title>A perturbative approach to the solution of the Thirring quantum cellular automaton</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19917v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Thirring Quantum Cellular Automaton (QCA) describes the discrete time dynamics of local fermionic modes that evolve according to one step of the Dirac cellular automaton followed by the most general on-site number-preserving interaction, and serves as the QCA counterpart of the Thirring model in quantum field theory. In this work, we develop perturbative techniques for the QCA path-sum approach, expanding both the number of interaction vertices and the mass parameter of the Thirring QCA. By classifying paths within the regimes of very light and very heavy particles, we computed the transition matrices in the two- and three-particle sectors to the first few orders. Our investigation into the properties of the Thirring QCA, addressing the combinatorial complexity of the problem, yielded some useful results applicable to the many-particle sector of any on-site number-preserving interactions in one spatial dimension.</description>

      <title>Optimization of Static Potentials for Large Delocalization and Non-Gaussian Quantum Dynamics of Levitated Nanoparticles Under Decoherence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19932v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Levitated nanoparticles provide a controllable and isolated platform for probing fundamental quantum phenomena at the macroscopic scale. In this work, we introduce an optimization method to determine optimal static potentials for the generation of largely delocalized and non-Gaussian quantum states of levitated nanoparticles. Our optimization strategy accounts for position-dependent noise sources originating from the fluctuations of the potential. We provide key figures of merit that allow for fast computation and capture relevant features of the dynamics, mitigating the computational demands associated with the multiscale simulation of this system. Specifically, we introduce coherence length and coherent cubicity as signatures of large delocalization and quantum non-Gaussian states, respectively. We apply the optimization approach to a family of quartic potentials and show that the optimal configuration depends on the strength and nature of the noise in the system. Additionally, we benchmark our results with the full quantum dynamics simulations of the system for the optimal potentials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19961v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cycle scenarios are a significant class of contextuality scenarios, with the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) scenario being a notable example. While binary outcome measurements in these scenarios are well understood, the generalization to arbitrary outcomes remains less explored, except in specific cases. In this work, we employ homotopical methods in the framework of simplicial distributions to characterize all contextual vertices of the non-signaling polytope corresponding to cycle scenarios with arbitrary outcomes. Additionally, our techniques utilize the bundle perspective on contextuality and the decomposition of measurement spaces. This enables us to extend beyond scenarios formed by gluing cycle scenarios and describe contextual extremal simplicial distributions in these generalized contexts.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Assisted Squeezed States of Light in All Fiber Form-Factor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19991v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Squeezed light sources, featuring significant degrees of squeezing, flexible time-frequency attributes, and a compact salable form factor, serve as crucial building blocks in an expanding range of applications, spanning from quantum computing to quantum sensing and communications. In this study, we introduce and demonstrate a novel approach to generating squeezed light that exclusively employs standard telecommunication fiber-optic components. The technique leverages the entanglement properties of spontaneous four-wave mixing (SFWM) to generate high squeezing with flexible time-frequency properties. Notably, a record squeezing of 7.5 \(\pm\)0.1 dB is measured within an all-fiber, all-guided-wave platform. The entanglement-assisted squeezing methodology empowers the attainment of squeezing for arbitrary time-frequency modes within the SFWM phase-matching bandwidth, extending beyond coherent laser modes, for the first time. In particular, we measured 5.1 dB and 1.1 dB squeezing on partially coherent and chaotic time-frequency modes that are defined by randomly modulated laser sources and filtered amplified spontaneous emission light, respectively.</description>

      <title>Integrating Quantum Algorithms Into Classical Frameworks: A Predictor-corrector Approach Using HHL</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19996v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The application of quantum algorithms to classical problems is generally accompanied by significant bottlenecks when transferring data between quantum and classical states, often negating any intrinsic quantum advantage. Here we address this challenge for a well-known algorithm for linear systems of equations, originally proposed by Harrow, Hassidim and Lloyd (HHL), by adapting it into a predictor-corrector instead of a direct solver. Rather than seeking the solution at the next time step, the goal now becomes determining the change between time steps. This strategy enables the intelligent omission of computationally costly steps commonly found in many classical algorithms, while simultaneously mitigating the notorious readout problems associated with extracting solutions from a quantum state. Random or regularly performed skips instead lead to simulation failure. We demonstrate that our methodology secures a useful polynomial advantage over a conventional application of the HHL algorithm. The practicality and versatility of the approach are illustrated through applications in various fields such as smoothed particle hydrodynamics, plasma simulations, and reactive flow configurations. Moreover, the proposed algorithm is well suited to run asynchronously on future heterogeneous hardware infrastructures and can effectively leverage the synergistic strengths of classical as well as quantum compute resources.</description>

      <title>Perfect cheating is impossible for single-qubit position verification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.20022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.20022v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In quantum position verification, a prover certifies her location by performing a quantum computation and returning the results (at the speed of light) to a set of trusted verifiers. One of the very first protocols for quantum position verification was proposed in (Kent, Munro, Spiller 2011): the prover receives a qubit $Q$ from one direction, receives an orthogonal basis $\{ v, v^\perp \}$ from the opposite direction, then measures $Q$ in $\{ v, v^\perp \}$ and broadcasts the result. A number of variants of this protocol have been proposed and analyzed, but the question of whether the original protocol itself is secure has never been fully resolved. In this work we show that there is no perfect finite-dimensional cheating strategy for the original KMS measurement protocol. Our approach makes use of tools from real algebraic geometry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.20039v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By use of the recently derived $universal$ discrete imaginary-time propagator of the harmonic oscillator, both thermodynamic and Hamiltonian energies can be given analytically, and evaluated numerically at each imaginary time step, for $any$ short-time propagator. This work shows that, using only currently known short-time propagators, the Hamiltonian energy can be optimized to the twelfth order, converging to the ground state energy of the harmonic oscillator in as few as three beads. This study makes it absolutely clear that the widely used second-order primitive approximation propagator, when used in computing the thermodynamic energy, converges extremely slowly with increasing number of beads.</description>

      <title>Dawn of a nuclear clock: frequency ratio of the $^{229m}$Th isomeric transition and the $^{87}$Sr atomic clock</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18719v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optical atomic clocks$^{1,2}$ use electronic energy levels to precisely keep track of time. A clock based on nuclear energy levels promises a next-generation platform for precision metrology and fundamental physics studies. Thorium-229 nuclei exhibit a uniquely low energy nuclear transition within reach of state-of-the-art vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) laser light sources and have therefore been proposed for construction of the first nuclear clock$^{3,4}$. However, quantum state-resolved spectroscopy of the $^{229m}$Th isomer to determine the underlying nuclear structure and establish a direct frequency connection with existing atomic clocks has yet to be performed. Here, we use a VUV frequency comb to directly excite the narrow $^{229}$Th nuclear clock transition in a solid-state CaF$_2$ host material and determine the absolute transition frequency. We stabilize the fundamental frequency comb to the JILA $^{87}$Sr clock$^2$ and coherently upconvert the fundamental to its 7th harmonic in the VUV range using a femtosecond enhancement cavity. This VUV comb establishes a frequency link between nuclear and electronic energy levels and allows us to directly measure the frequency ratio of the $^{229}$Th nuclear clock transition and the $^{87}$Sr atomic clock. We also precisely measure the nuclear quadrupole splittings and extract intrinsic properties of the isomer. These results mark the start of nuclear-based solid-state optical clock and demonstrate the first comparison of nuclear and atomic clocks for fundamental physics studies. This work represents a confluence of precision metrology, ultrafast strong field physics, nuclear physics, and fundamental physics.</description>

Abstract: We focus on the potential possibilities for supporting Scanning Probe Microscopy measurements, emphasizing the application of Artificial Intelligence, especially Machine Learning as well as quantum computing. It turned out that Artificial Intelligence can be helpful in the experimental processes automation in routine operations, the algorithmic search for good sample regions, and shed light on the structure property relationships. Thus, it contributes to increasing the efficiency and accuracy of optical nanoscopy scanning probes. Moreover, the combination of Artificial Intelligence based algorithms and quantum computing may have a huge potential to increase the practical application of Scanning Probe Microscopy. The limitations were also discussed. Finally, we outline a research path for the improvement of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Kramers Nonlinearity in PT Symmetric Magnets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19444v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Kramers degeneracies play an essential role in the spectrum of electronic materials. Here we argue that beyond spectral properties, Kramers degeneracy plays a critical role in the nonlinear response of PT symmetric magnets. In particular, we uncover a class of second-order Kramers nonlinearities that only arise in the presence of Kramers degeneracy, vanishing in non-degenerate PT symmetric materials. Kramers nonlinearties depend on a circular dichroism between PT related Kramers states and enable to trace out the quantum geometry of the degenerate band structure. We find pronounced Kramers nonlinearitites in the nonlinear polarization responses of even layer antiferromagnetic MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ that enable to identify its antiferromagnetic order. This provides novel means for diagnosing Kramers pairs and addressing the internal Kramers degree of freedom.</description>

      <title>Interplay between local and non-local frustration in the 1D ANNNI chain I -- The even case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19449v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the effects of the competition between different sources of frustration in 1D spin chains through the analysis of the paradigmatic ANNNI model, which possesses an extensive amount of frustration of local origin due to the competition between nearest and next-to-nearest neighbor interactions. An additional, non-extensive amount of topological frustration can be added by applying suitable boundary conditions, and we show that this seemingly subdominant contribution significantly affects the model. Choosing periodic boundary conditions with an {\it even} number of sites not divisible by 4 and using the entanglement entropy as a probe, we demonstrate that in one of the model's phases, the ground state can be characterized as hosting two (almost) independent excitations. Thus, not only do we show an intriguing interplay between different types of frustration, but also manage to propose a non-trivial quasi-particle interpretation for it.</description>

Abstract: We define a $\mathbb{Z}_2$-valued index for stably short-range entangled states of two-dimensional fermionic lattice systems with charge conservation and time reversal symmetry. The index takes its non-trivial value precisely if the `fluxon', the state obtained by inserting a $\pi$-flux through the system, transforms under time reversal as part of a Kramers pair. This index extends the Fu-Kane-Mele index of free fermions to interacting systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19565v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We calculate the properties of a 1D $Z_2$ lattice gauge theory in different Gauss law sectors, corresponding to different configurations of static charges set by the orientations of the gauge spins. Importantly, in quantum simulator experiments these sectors can be accessed without adding any additional physical particles or changing the Hamiltonian: The Gauss law sectors are simply set by the initial conditions. We study the interplay between conservation laws and interactions when the static charges are chosen to form periodic patterns. We classify the different Gauss law sectors and use the density matrix renormalization group to calculate the ground state compressibility, density profiles, charge density wave order parameters, and single particle correlation functions as a function of matter density. We find confined and deconfined phases, charge density waves, correlated insulators, and supersolids.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19713v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a refined version of the string-net model which assigns a different energy cost to each plaquette excitation. Using recent exact calculations of the energy-level degeneracies we compute the partition function of this model and investigate several thermodynamical quantities. In the thermodynamic limit, we show that the partition function is dominated by the contribution of special particles, dubbed pure fluxons, which trivially braid with all other (product of) fluxons. We also analyze the behavior of Wegner-Wilson loops associated to excitations and show that they obey an area law, indicating confinement, for any finite temperature except for pure fluxons that always remain deconfined. Finally, using a recently proposed conjecture, we compute the topological mutual information at finite temperature, which features a nontrivial scaling between system size and temperature.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear interferometry-based metrology of magneto-optical properties at infrared wavelengths</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19813v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magneto-optical properties of materials are utilized in numerous applications both in scientific research and industries. The novel properties of these materials can be further investigated by performing metrology in the infrared wavelength range, thereby enriching their potential applications. However, current infrared metrology techniques can be challenging and resource-intensive due to the unavailability of suitable components. To address these challenges, we propose and demonstrate a set of measurements based on nonlinear interferometry, which allows us investigating magneto-optical properties of materials at infrared wavelength range by performing optical detection at the visible range. For a proof-of-principle study, we measure the Verdet constant of a bismuth-iron-garnet, over a spectral bandwidth of 600 nm in the near-IR range.</description>

Abstract: Thouless pumping enables the transport of particles in a one-dimensional periodic potential if the potential is slowly and periodically modulated in time. The change in the position of particles after each modulation period is quantized and depends solely on the topology of the pump cycle, making it robust against perturbations. Here, we demonstrate that Thouless pumping also allows for the realization of topologically protected quantized changes of the distance between atoms if the atomic s-wave scattering length is properly modulated in time.</description>

Abstract: The Bell-CHSH inequality in the vacuum state of a relativistic scalar quantum field is analyzed. Using Weyl operators built with smeared fields localized in the Rindler wedges, the Bell-CHSH inequality is expressed in terms of the Lorentz invariant inner products of test functions. A numerical framework for these inner products is devised. Causality is also explicitly checked by a numerical evaluation of the Pauli-Jordan function. Violations of the Bell-CHSH inequality are reported for different values of the particle mass parameter.</description>

Abstract: The required precision to perform quantum simulations beyond the capabilities of classical computers imposes major experimental and theoretical challenges. The key to solving these issues are precise means of characterizing analog quantum simulators. Here, we robustly estimate the free Hamiltonian parameters of bosonic excitations in a superconducting-qubit analog quantum simulator from measured time-series of single-mode canonical coordinates. We achieve high levels of precision in estimating the Hamiltonian parameters by exploiting a priori knowledge, making it robust against noise and state-preparation and measurement (SPAM) errors. Importantly, we are also able to obtain tomographic information about those SPAM errors from the same data, crucial for the experimental applicability of Hamiltonian learning in dynamical quantum-quench experiments. Our learning algorithm is scalable both in terms of the required amounts of data and post-processing. To achieve this, we develop a new super-resolution technique coined tensorESPRIT for frequency extraction from matrix time-series. The algorithm then combines tensorESPRIT with constrained manifold optimization for the eigenspace reconstruction with pre- and post-processing stages. For up to 14 coupled superconducting qubits on two Sycamore processors, we identify the Hamiltonian parameters -- verifying the implementation on one of them up to sub-MHz precision -- and construct a spatial implementation error map for a grid of 27 qubits. Our results constitute an accurate implementation of a dynamical quantum simulation that is characterized using a new diagnostic toolkit for understanding, calibrating, and improving analog quantum processors.</description>

      <title>Direct pulse-level compilation of arbitrary quantum logic gates on superconducting qutrits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.04261v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Advanced simulations and calculations on quantum computers require high-fidelity implementations of quantum operations. The universal gateset approach builds complex unitaries from a small set of primitive gates, often resulting in a long gate sequence which is typically a leading factor in the total accumulated error. Compiling a complex unitary for processors with higher-dimensional logical elements, such as qutrits, exacerbates the accumulated error per unitary, since an even longer gate sequence is required. Optimal control methods promise time and resource efficient compact gate sequences and, therefore, higher fidelity. These methods generate pulses that can directly implement any complex unitary on a quantum device. In this work, we demonstrate any arbitrary qubit and qutrit gate can be realized with high-fidelity, which can significantly reduce the length of a gate sequence. We generate and test pulses for a large set of randomly selected arbitrary unitaries on several quantum processing units (QPUs): the LLNL Quantum Device and Integration Testbed (QuDIT) standard QPU and three of Rigetti QPUs: Ankaa-2, Ankaa-9Q-1, and Aspen-M-3. On the QuDIT platform's standard QPU, the average fidelity of random qutrit gates is 97.9+-0.5% measured with conventional QPT and 98.8+-0.6% from QPT with gate folding. Rigetti's Ankaa-2 achieves random qubit gates with an average fidelity of 98.4+-0.5% (conventional QPT) and 99.7+-0.1% (QPT with gate folding). On Ankaa-9Q-1 and Aspen-M-3, the average fidelities with conventional qubit QPT measurements were higher than 99%. We show that optimal control gates are robust to drift for at least three hours and that the same calibration parameters can be used for all implemented gates. Our work promises the calibration overheads for optimal control gates can be made small enough to enable efficient quantum circuits based on this technique.</description>

Abstract: The ZX calculus and ZH calculus use diagrams to denote and compute properties of quantum operations, using `rewrite rules' to transform between diagrams which denote the same operator through a functorial semantic map. Different semantic maps give rise to different rewrite systems, which may prove more convenient for different purposes. Using discrete measures, we describe semantic maps for ZX and ZH diagrams, well-suited to analyse unitary circuits and measurements on qudits of any fixed dimension D&gt;1 as a single `ZXH-calculus'. We demonstrate rewrite rules for the `stabiliser fragment' of the ZX calculus and a `multicharacter fragment' of the ZH calculus.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.12399v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Theoretical spin properties of the Kapitza-Dirac effect beyond the plane-wave description are not known in detail. We develop a method for computing electron diffraction of the two-photon Kapitza-Dirac effect in a two-dimensional Gaussian beam standing light wave within a relativistic formulation. The solutions are computed on the basis of time-dependent perturbation theory, where a momentum space formulation with the use of a Fourier transformation of the external potential allows for the solving the perturbative time-integrals. An iteration over each possible quantum state combination leads to a quadratic scaling of our method with respect to spacial grid resolution, where time-stepping does not occur in the numeric implementation. The position- and momentum space grids are adapted to the two-photon interaction geometry at low resolution, for which our study only finds partial convergence of the simulated diffraction pattern. Further, the method has the advantage of having an easy implementable parallelization layout.</description>

Abstract: In this work we present a proposal for realising non-Abelian anyons on a NISQ device. In particular we explore the feasibility of implementing the quantum double model $D(D_4)$. We propose techniques to drastically simplify the circuits for the manipulation and measurements of anyons. Numerical simulations with realistic noise models suggest that current NISQ technology is capable of probing signatures of non-Abelian anyons far beyond elemental properties such as the non-commutativity of braids. In particular, we conclude that experimentally measuring the full modular data of the model is feasible.</description>

      <title>Backpropagation scaling in parameterised quantum circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.14962v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The discovery of the backpropagation algorithm ranks among one of the most important moments in the history of machine learning, and has made possible the training of large-scale neural networks through its ability to compute gradients at roughly the same computational cost as model evaluation. Despite its importance, a similar backpropagation-like scaling for gradient evaluation of parameterised quantum circuits has remained elusive. Currently, the most popular method requires sampling from a number of circuits that scales with the number of circuit parameters, making training of large-scale quantum circuits prohibitively expensive in practice. Here we address this problem by introducing a class of structured circuits that are not known to be classically simulable and admit gradient estimation with significantly fewer circuits. In the simplest case -- for which the parameters feed into commuting quantum gates -- these circuits allow for fast estimation of the gradient, higher order partial derivatives and the Fisher information matrix. Moreover, specific families of parameterised circuits exist for which the scaling of gradient estimation is in line with classical backpropagation, and can thus be trained at scale. In a toy classification problem on 16 qubits, such circuits show competitive performance with other methods, while reducing the training cost by about two orders of magnitude.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.14424v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum computers are now on the brink of outperforming their classical counterparts. One way to demonstrate the advantage of quantum computation is through quantum random sampling performed on quantum computing devices. However, existing tools for verifying that a quantum device indeed performed the classically intractable sampling task are either impractical or not scalable to the quantum advantage regime. The verification problem thus remains an outstanding challenge. Here, we experimentally demonstrate efficiently verifiable quantum random sampling in the measurement-based model of quantum computation on a trapped-ion quantum processor. We create and sample from random cluster states, which are at the heart of measurement-based computing, up to a size of 4 x 4 qubits. By exploiting the structure of these states, we are able to recycle qubits during the computation to sample from entangled cluster states that are larger than the qubit register. We then efficiently estimate the fidelity to verify the prepared states -- in single instances and on average -- and compare our results to cross-entropy benchmarking. Finally, we study the effect of experimental noise on the certificates. Our results and techniques provide a feasible path toward a verified demonstration of a quantum advantage.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.14881v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum gates are the building blocks of quantum circuits, which in turn are the cornerstones of quantum information processing. In this work, we theoretically investigate a single-step implementation of both a universal two- (CNOT) and three-qubit (quantum Fredkin) gates in a cross-cavity setup coupled to a $\Lambda$-type three-level atom. Within a high-cooperativity regime, the system exhibits an atomic-state-dependent $\pi$-phase gate involving the two-mode single-photon bright and dark states of the input light pulses. This allows for the controlled manipulation of light states by the atom and vice versa. Our results indicate these quantum gates can be implemented with high probability of success using the state-of-the-art parameters, either for the weak- or strong-coupling regime, where the quantum interference is due to an electromagnetically-induced-transparency-like phenomenon and the Autler-Townes splitting, respectively. This work not only paves the way for implementing quantum gates in a single step using simple resources, thus avoiding the need to chain basic gates together in a circuit, but it also endorses the potential of cross-cavity systems for realizing universal quantum computation.</description>

Abstract: We showed in a recent article (Lawrence et. al., 2023, Quantum 7, 1015), that relative facts (outcomes), a central concept in Relational Quantum Mechanics, are inconsistent with Quantum Mechanics. We proved this by constructing a Wigner-Friend type sequential measurement scenario on a Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state of three qubits, and making the following assumption: "if an interpretation of quantum theory introduces some conceptualization of outcomes of a measurement, then probabilities of these outcomes must follow the quantum predictions as given by the Born rule." Our work has been criticized by Cavalcanti, Di Biagio, and Rovelli (CDR). In this note we show that their critique is invalid, and that their specific arguments raise questions of principle.</description>

Abstract: This paper calls attention to the current state of the probability (P) domain which presents weak points at the mathematical level and more significant flaws at the application level. Popper notices how fundamental issues raised in quantum mechanics (QM) directly derive from unresolved probabilistic questions. Endless philosophical debates create more problems than solutions, so the author of this research suggests going directly to the root of the issues and searching for the probability theory which formalizes the multifold nature of P. This paper offers a brief overview of the structural theory of probability, recently published in a book, and applies it to QM in order to show its completeness. The whole probability-based interpretation of QM goes beyond the limits of a paper and these pages condense a few aspects of this theoretical scheme. The double slit experiment is used to corroborate the theorems presented here.</description>

      <title>Many-body entropies and entanglement from polynomially-many local measurements</title>

Abstract: Estimating global properties of many-body quantum systems such as entropy or bipartite entanglement is a notoriously difficult task, typically requiring a number of measurements or classical post-processing resources growing exponentially in the system size. In this work, we address the problem of estimating global entropies and mixed-state entanglement via partial-transposed (PT) moments, and show that efficient estimation strategies exist under the assumption that all the spatial correlation lengths are finite. Focusing on one-dimensional systems, we identify a set of approximate factorization conditions (AFCs) on the system density matrix which allow us to reconstruct entropies and PT moments from information on local subsystems. This yields a simple and efficient strategy for entropy and entanglement estimation. Our method could be implemented in different ways, depending on how information on local subsystems is extracted. Focusing on randomized measurements (RMs), providing a practical and common measurement scheme, we prove that our protocol only requires polynomially-many measurements and post-processing operations, assuming that the state to be measured satisfies the AFCs. We prove that the AFCs hold for finite-depth quantum-circuit states and translation-invariant matrix-product density operators, and provide numerical evidence that they are satisfied in more general, physically-interesting cases, including thermal states of local Hamiltonians. We argue that our method could be practically useful to detect bipartite mixed-state entanglement for large numbers of qubits available in today's quantum platforms.</description>

      <title>On the bias in iterative quantum amplitude estimation</title>

Abstract: Quantum amplitude estimation (QAE) is a pivotal quantum algorithm to estimate the squared amplitude $a$ of the target basis state in a quantum state $|\Phi\rangle$. Various improvements on the original quantum phase estimation-based QAE have been proposed for resource reduction. One of such improved versions is iterative quantum amplitude estimation (IQAE), which outputs an estimate $\hat{a}$ of $a$ through the iterated rounds of the measurements on the quantum states like $G^k|\Phi\rangle$, with the number $k$ of operations of the Grover operator $G$ (the Grover number) and the shot number determined adaptively. This paper investigates the bias in IQAE. Through the numerical experiments to simulate IQAE, we reveal that the estimate by IQAE is biased and the bias is enhanced for some specific values of $a$. We see that the termination criterion in IQAE that the estimated accuracy of $\hat{a}$ falls below the threshold is a source of the bias. Besides, we observe that $k_\mathrm{fin}$, the Grover number in the final round, and $f_\mathrm{fin}$, a quantity affecting the probability distribution of measurement outcomes in the final round, are the key factors to determine the bias, and the bias enhancement for specific values of $a$ is due to the skewed distribution of $(k_\mathrm{fin},f_\mathrm{fin})$. We also present a bias mitigation method: just re-executing the final round with the Grover number and the shot number fixed.</description>

      <title>Non-Hermitian generalizations of the Yao-Lee model augmented by SO(3)-symmetry-breaking terms</title>

Abstract: We investigate non-Hermitian versions of the Yao-Lee model, supplemented by various kinds of SO(3)-symmetry-breaking terms, preserving the solvability of the model. The parent model hosts three species of Majorana fermions, thereby serving as an extension of the two-dimensional Kitaev model on the honeycomb lattice. The non-Hermitian couplings represent generic situations when the system is coupled to the environment and, thus, undergoes dissipation. The resulting eigenvalue spectrum and the eigenmodes show a rich structure of exceptional points as well as non-Hermitian skin effects. We chart out such exotic behaviour for some representative parameter regimes.</description>

      <title>Markovian to non-Markovian phase transition in the operator dynamics of a mobile impurity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.17066v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a random unitary circuit model of an impurity moving through a chaotic medium. The exchange of information between the medium and impurity is controlled by varying the velocity of the impurity, $v_d$, relative to the speed of information propagation within the medium, $v_B$. Above supersonic velocities, $v_d&gt; v_B$, information cannot flow back to the impurity after it has moved into the medium, and the resulting dynamics are Markovian. Below supersonic velocities, $v_d&lt; v_B$, the dynamics of the impurity and medium are non-Markovian, and information is able to flow back onto the impurity. We show the two regimes are separated by a continuous phase transition with exponents directly related to the diffusive spreading of operators in the medium. This is demonstrated by monitoring an out-of-time-order correlator (OTOC) in a scenario where the impurity is substituted at an intermediate time. During the Markovian phase, information from the medium cannot transfer onto the replaced impurity, manifesting in no significant operator development. Conversely, in the non-Markovian phase, we observe that operators acquire support on the newly introduced impurity. We also characterize the dynamics using the coherent information and provide two decoders which can efficiently probe the transition between Markovian and non-Markovian information flow. Our work demonstrates that Markovian and non-Markovian dynamics can be separated by a phase transition, and we propose an efficient protocol for observing this transition.</description>

      <title>The Fate of Entanglement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.06677v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum entanglement is a fundamentally non-local correlation between particles. In its simplest realisation, a measurement on one particle is affected by a prior measurement on its partner, irrespective of their separation. For multiple particles, purely collective types of entanglement exist but their detection, even theoretically, remains an outstanding open question. Here, we show that all forms of multipartite entanglement entirely disappear during the typical evolution of a system as it heats up, evolves in time, or as its parts become separated. These results follow from the nature of the entanglement-free continent in the space of physical states, and hold in great generality. We illustrate these phenomena with a frustrated molecular quantum magnet in and out of equilibrium. In contrast, if the particles are fermions, such as electrons, another notion of entanglement exists that protects bipartite quantum correlations. However, truly collective fermionic entanglement disappears during typical evolution, thus sharing the same fate as in bosonic systems. These findings provide fundamental knowledge about the structure of entanglement in quantum matter and architectures, paving the way for its manipulation.</description>

      <title>Quantum computation of conical intersections on a programmable superconducting quantum processor</title>

Abstract: Conical intersections (CIs) are pivotal in many photochemical processes. Traditional quantum chemistry methods, such as the state-average multi-configurational methods, face computational hurdles in solving the electronic Schr\"odinger equation within the active space on classical computers. While quantum computing offers a potential solution, its feasibility in studying CIs, particularly on real quantum hardware, remains largely unexplored. Here, we present the first successful realization of a hybrid quantum-classical state-average complete active space self-consistent field method based on the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE-SA-CASSCF) on a superconducting quantum processor. This approach is applied to investigate CIs in two prototypical systems - ethylene (C2H4) and triatomic hydrogen (H3). We illustrate that VQE-SA-CASSCF, coupled with ongoing hardware and algorithmic enhancements, can lead to a correct description of CIs on existing quantum devices. These results lay the groundwork for exploring the potential of quantum computing to study CIs in more complex systems in the future.</description>

      <title>Quantum error cancellation in photonic systems -- undoing photon losses</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.05252v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Real photonic devices are subject to photon losses that can decohere quantum information encoded in the system. In the absence of full fault tolerance, quantum error mitigation techniques have been introduced to help manage errors in noisy quantum devices. In this work, we introduce an error mitigation protocol inspired by probabilistic error cancellation (a popular error mitigation technique in discrete variable systems) for continuous variable systems. We show that our quantum error cancellation protocol can undo photon losses in expectation value estimation tasks. To do this, we analytically derive the (non-physical) inverse photon loss channel and decompose it into a sum over physically realisable channels with potentially negative coefficients. The bias of our ideal expectation value estimator can be made arbitrarily small at the cost of increasing the sampling overhead. The protocol requires a noiseless amplification followed by a series of photon-subtractions. While these operations can be implemented probabilistically, for certain classes of initial state one can avoid the burden of carrying out the amplification and photon-subtractions by leveraging Monte-Carlo methods to give an unbiased estimate of the ideal expectation value. We validate our proposed mitigation protocol by simulating the scheme on squeezed vacuum states, cat states and entangled coherent states.</description>

      <title>On noise in swap ASAP repeater chains: exact analytics, distributions and tight approximations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07146v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Losses are one of the main bottlenecks for the distribution of entanglement in quantum networks, which can be overcome by the implementation of quantum repeaters. The most basic form of a quantum repeater chain is the swap ASAP repeater chain. In such a repeater chain, elementary links are probabilistically generated and deterministically swapped as soon as two adjacent links have been generated. As each entangled state is waiting to be swapped, decoherence is experienced, turning the fidelity of the entangled state between the end nodes of the chain into a random variable. Fully characterizing the (average) fidelity as the repeater chain grows is still an open problem. Here, we analytically investigate the case of equally-spaced repeaters, where we find exact analytic formulae for all moments of the fidelity up to 25 segments. We obtain these formulae by providing a general solution in terms of a generating function; a function whose n'th term in its Maclaurin series yields the moments of the fidelity for n segments. We generalize this approaches as well to a global cut-off policy -- a method for increasing fidelity at the cost of longer entanglement delivery times -- allowing for fast optimization of the cut-off parameter by eliminating the need for Monte Carlo simulation. We furthermore find simple approximations of the average fidelity that are exponentially tight, and, for up to 10 segments, the full distribution of the delivered fidelity. We use this to analytically calculate the secret-key rate when the distributed entanglement is used for quantum-key distribution, both with and without binning methods. In follow-up work we exploit a connection to a model in statistical physics to numerically calculate quantities of interest for the inhomogeneous multipartite case.</description>

      <title>QuTracer: Mitigating Quantum Gate and Measurement Errors by Tracing Subsets of Qubits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.19712v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum error mitigation plays a crucial role in the current noisy-intermediate-scale-quantum (NISQ) era. As we advance towards achieving a practical quantum advantage in the near term, error mitigation emerges as an indispensable component. One notable prior work, Jigsaw, demonstrates that measurement crosstalk errors can be effectively mitigated by measuring subsets of qubits. Jigsaw operates by running multiple copies of the original circuit, each time measuring only a subset of qubits. The localized distributions yielded from measurement subsetting suffer from less crosstalk and are then used to update the global distribution, thereby achieving improved output fidelity. Inspired by the idea of measurement subsetting, we propose QuTracer, a framework designed to mitigate both gate and measurement errors in subsets of qubits by tracing the states of qubit subsets throughout the computational process. In order to achieve this goal, we introduce a technique, qubit subsetting Pauli checks (QSPC), which utilizes circuit cutting and Pauli Check Sandwiching (PCS) to trace the qubit subsets distribution to mitigate errors. The QuTracer framework can be applied to various algorithms including, but not limited to, VQE, QAOA, quantum arithmetic circuits, QPE, and Hamiltonian simulations. In our experiments, we perform both noisy simulations and real device experiments to demonstrate that QuTracer is scalable and significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches.</description>

Abstract: Quantum contextuality describes situations where the statistics observed in different measurement contexts cannot be explained by a measurement independent reality of the system. The most simple case is observed in a three-dimensional Hilbert space, with five different measurement contexts related to each other by shared measurement outcomes. The quantum formalism defines the relations between these contexts in terms of well-defined relations between operators, and these relations can be used to reconstruct an unknown quantum state from a finite set of measurement results. Here, I introduce a reconstruction method based on the relations between the five measurement contexts that can violate the bounds of non-contextual statistics. A complete description of an arbitrary quantum state requires only five of the eight elements of a Kirkwood-Dirac quasi probability, but only an overcomplete set of eleven elements provides an unbiased description of all five contexts. A set of five fundamental relations between the eleven elements reveals a deterministic structure that links the five contexts. As illustrated by a number of examples, these relations provide a consistent description of contextual realities for the measurement outcomes of all five contexts.</description>

Abstract: Coherent photon sources are key elements in different applications, ranging from quantum sensing to quantum computing. In the context of circuit quantum electrodynamics, there have been multiple proposals for potential coherent sources of photons, but a well established candidate is still missing. The possibility of designing and engineering superconducting circuits behaving like artificial atoms supports the realization of quantum optics protocols, including microwave photons generation. Here we propose and theoretically investigate a new design that allows a tunable photon injection directly on-chip. The scheme is based on initiating a population inversion in a superconducting circuit that will act as the photon source of one or multiple target resonators. The key novelty of the proposed layout consists in replacing the usual capacitive link between the source and the target cavity with a tunable coupler, with the advantage of having on-demand control on the injected steady-state photons. We validate the dynamical control of the generated coherent states under the effect of an external flux threading the tunable coupler and discuss the possibility of employing this scheme also in the context of multiple bosonic reservoirs.</description>

Abstract: We explore the utility of quantum spin squeezing in quantum magnetometry, focusing on three-level (qutrit) Nitrogen-Vacancy (NV) centers within diamond, utilizing a standard Ramsey interferometry pulse protocol. Our investigation incorporates the effects of dephasing and relaxation on NV centers' dynamics during Ramsey measurements, modeled via the Lindblad quantum master equation. We conduct a comparative analysis between the metrological capabilities of a single NV center and a pair of NV centers, considering Quantum Fisher Information both with and without spin squeezing. The quantum correlations between NV centers are assessed through the evaluation of the Kitagawa-Ueda spin squeezing parameter within a two-level manifold. Additionally, parallel calculations are conducted using a two-level model (qubit) for NV centers. Our findings reveal that leveraging qutrits and spin squeezing yields enhanced magnetometric precision, albeit constrained by dephasing effects. Nevertheless, even in the absence of dynamical decoupling methods to mitigate environmental noise, strategic timing of squeezing and free evolution can sustain the advantages of qutrit-based magnetometry.</description>

Abstract: A theory of the absorption of a laser field by an atomic or condensed matter medium is presented for the case where the medium is also interacting with a strong electromagnetic field. The rotating wave approximation is not assumed for the latter. It is shown that in the weak probe limit the Lindblad master equation reduces to a smaller system of linear equations for the relevant steady state coherences. In this limit, the complex susceptibility of the medium can be expressed in terms of individual contributions of decaying dressed states, the latter being eigenstates of a non-Hermitian Floquet Hamiltonian.</description>

      <title>Epistemic Horizons From Deterministic Laws: Lessons From a Nomic Toy Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17581v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum theory has an epistemic horizon, i.e. exact values cannot be assigned simultaneously to incompatible physical quantities. As shown by Spekkens' toy theory, positing an epistemic horizon akin to Heisenberg's uncertainty principle in a classical mechanical setting also leads to a plethora of quantum phenomena. We introduce a deterministic theory - nomic toy theory - in which information gathering agents are explicitly modelled as physical systems. Our main result shows the presence of an epistemic horizon for such agents. They can only simultaneously learn the values of observables whose Poisson bracket vanishes. Therefore, nomic toy theory has incompatible measurements and the complete state of a physical system cannot be known. The best description of a system by an agent is via an epistemic state of Spekkens' toy theory. Our result reconciles us to measurement uncertainty as an aspect of the inseparability of subjects and objects. Significantly, the claims follow even though nomic toy theory is essentially classical. This work invites further investigations of epistemic horizons, such as the one of (full) quantum theory.</description>

Abstract: We present the Quantum Virtual Machine (QVM), an end-to-end generic system for scalable execution of large quantum circuits with high fidelity on noisy and small quantum processors (QPUs) by leveraging gate virtualization. QVM exposes a virtual circuit intermediate representation (IR) that extends the notion of quantum circuits to incorporate gate virtualization. Based on the virtual circuit as our IR, we propose the QVM compiler - an extensible compiler infrastructure to transpile a virtual circuit through a series of modular optimization passes to produce a set of optimized circuit fragments. Lastly, these transpiled circuit fragments are executed on QPUs using our QVM runtime - a scalable and distributed infrastructure to virtualize and execute circuit fragments on a set of distributed QPUs. We evaluate QVM on IBM's 7- and 27-qubit QPUs. Our evaluation shows that using our system, we can scale the circuit sizes executable on QPUs up to double the size of the QPU while improving fidelity by 4.7$\times$ on average compared to larger QPUs and that we can effectively reduce circuit depths to only 40\% of the original circuit depths.</description>

      <title>Hidden orders and phase transitions for the fully packed quantum loop model on the triangular lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.04472</link>

Abstract: Quantum loop and dimer models are prototypical correlated systems with local constraints, which are not only intimately connected to lattice gauge theories and topological orders but are also widely applicable to the broad research areas of quantum materials and quantum simulation. Employing our sweeping cluster quantum Monte Carlo algorithm, we reveal the complete phase diagram of the triangular-lattice fully packed quantum loop model. Apart from the known lattice nematic (LN) solid and the even $\mathbb{Z}_2$ quantum spin liquid (QSL) phases, we discover a hidden vison plaquette (VP) phase, which had been overlooked and misinterpreted as a QSL for more than a decade. Moreover, the VP-to-QSL continuous transition belongs to the $(2+1)$D cubic* universality class, which offers a lattice realization of the (fractionalized) cubic fixed point that had long been considered as irrelevant towards the O($3$) symmetry until corrected recently by conformal bootstrap calculations. Our results are therefore of relevance to recent developments in both experiments and theory, and facilitate further investigations of hidden phases and transitions.</description>

      <title>The inertia bound is far from tight</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.04925v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The inertia bound and ratio bound (also known as the Cvetkovi\'c bound and Hoffman bound) are two fundamental inequalities in spectral graph theory, giving upper bounds on the independence number $\alpha(G)$ of a graph $G$ in terms of spectral information about a weighted adjacency matrix of $G$. For both inequalities, given a graph $G$, one needs to make a judicious choice of weighted adjacency matrix to obtain as strong a bound as possible.
  While there is a well-established theory surrounding the ratio bound, the inertia bound is much more mysterious, and its limits are rather unclear. In fact, only recently did Sinkovic find the first example of a graph for which the inertia bound is not tight (for any weighted adjacency matrix), answering a longstanding question of Godsil. We show that the inertia bound can be extremely far from tight, and in fact can significantly underperform the ratio bound: for example, one of our results is that for infinitely many $n$, there is an $n$-vertex graph for which even the unweighted ratio bound can prove $\alpha(G)\leq 4n^{3/4}$, but the inertia bound is always at least $n/4$. In particular, these results address questions of Rooney, Sinkovic, and Wocjan--Elphick--Abiad.</description>

      <title>Realizing Altermagnetism in Fermi-Hubbard Models with Ultracold Atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.10151v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Altermagnetism represents a new type of collinear magnetism distinct from ferromagnetism and conventional antiferromagnetism. In contrast to the latter, sublattices of opposite spin are related by spatial rotations and not only by translations and inversions. As a result, altermagnets have spin split bands leading to unique experimental signatures. Here, we show theoretically how a d-wave altermagnetic phase can be realized with ultracold fermionic atoms in optical lattices. We propose an altermagnetic Hubbard model with anisotropic next-nearest neighbor hopping and obtain the Hartree-Fock phase diagram. The altermagnetic phase separates in a metallic and an insulating phase and is robust over a large parameter regime. We show that one of the defining characteristics of altermagnetism, the anisotropic spin transport, can be probed with trap-expansion experiments.</description>

      <title>From square plaquettes to triamond lattices for SU(2) gauge theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.14570v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Lattice gauge theory should be able to address significant new scientific questions when implemented on quantum computers. In practice, error-mitigation techniques have already allowed encouraging progress on small lattices. In this work we focus on a truncated version of SU(2) gauge theory, which is a familiar non-Abelian step toward quantum chromodynamics. First, we demonstrate effective error mitigation for imaginary time evolution on a lattice having two square plaquettes, obtaining the ground state using an IBM quantum computer and observing that this would have been impossible without error mitigation. Then we propose the triamond lattice as an expedient approach to lattice gauge theories in three spatial dimensions and we derive the Hamiltonian. Finally, error-mitigated imaginary time evolution is applied to the three-dimensional triamond unit cell, and its ground state is obtained from an IBM quantum computer. Future work will want to relax the truncation on the gauge fields, and the triamond lattice is increasingly valuable for such studies.</description>

      <title>Entanglement signatures of a percolating quantum system</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.15541v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Entanglement measures have emerged as one of the versatile probes to diagnose quantum phases and their transitions. Universal features in them expand their applicability to a range of systems, including those with quenched disorder. In this work, we show that when the underlying lattice has percolation disorder, free fermions at a finite density show interesting entanglement properties due to massively degenerate ground states. We define and calculate appropriate entanglement measures such as typical, annealed, and quenched entanglement entropy in both one and two dimensions, showing they can capture both geometrical aspects and electronic correlations of the percolated quantum system. In particular, while typical and annealed entanglement show volume law character directly dependent on the number of zero modes in the system, quenched entanglement is generally area law albeit showing characteristic signatures of the classical percolation transition. Our work presents an exotic interplay between the geometrical properties of a lattice and quantum entanglement in a many-body quantum system.</description>

      <title>Low-loss liquid metal interconnects for superconducting quantum circuits</title>

Abstract: Building a modular architecture with superconducting quantum computing chips is one of the means to achieve qubit scalability, allowing the screening, selection, replacement, and integration of individual qubit modules into large quantum systems. However, the nondestructive replacement of modules within a compact architecture remains a challenge. Liquid metals, specifically gallium alloys, can be alternatives to solid-state galvanic interconnects. This is motivated by their self-healing, self-aligning, and other desirable fluidic properties, potentially enabling the nondestructive replacement of modules at room temperatures, even after operating the entire system at millikelvin regimes. In this study, we present coplanar waveguide resonators (CPWRs) interconnected by gallium alloy droplets, achieving high internal quality factors up to nearly one million and demonstrating performance on par with the continuous solid-state CPWRs. Leveraging the desirable fluidic properties of gallium alloys at room temperature and their compact design, we envision a modular quantum system enabled by liquid metals.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01669v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: What can be measured by an observer in our universe? We address this question by constructing an algebra of gravitationally-dressed observables accessible to a comoving observer in FLRW spacetimes that are asymptotically de Sitter in the past, describing an inflationary epoch. An essential quantized degree of freedom is the zero-mode of the inflaton, which leads to fluctuations in the effective cosmological constant during inflation and prevents the existence of a maximum entropy state in the semiclassical limit. Due to the inaccessibility of measurements beyond our cosmological horizon, we demonstrate that all states are mixed with well-defined von Neumann entropy (up to a state-independent constant). For semiclassical states, the von Neumann entropy corresponds to the generalized entropy of the observer's causal diamond, a fine-grained quantity that is sensitive to the initial conditions of the universe.</description>

      <title>Collinear three-photon excitation of a strongly forbidden optical clock transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07902v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The ${{^1\mathrm{S}_0}\!-\!{^3\mathrm{P}_0}}$ clock transition in strontium serves as the foundation for the world's best atomic clocks and for gravitational wave detector concepts in clock atom interferometry. This transition is weakly allowed in the fermionic isotope $^{87}$Sr but strongly forbidden in bosonic isotopes. Here we demonstrate coherent excitation of the clock transition in bosonic ${}^{88}$Sr using a novel collinear three-photon process in a weak magnetic field. We observe Rabi oscillations with frequencies of up to $50~\text{kHz}$ using $\text{W}/\text{cm}^{2}$ laser intensities and Gauss-level magnetic field amplitudes. The absence of nuclear spin in bosonic isotopes offers decreased sensitivity to magnetic fields and optical lattice light shifts, enabling atomic clocks with reduced systematic errors. The collinear propagation of the laser fields permits the interrogation of spatially separated atomic ensembles with common laser pulses, a key requirement for dark matter searches and gravitational wave detection with next-generation quantum sensors.</description>

      <title>Bell nonlocality and entanglement in $e^{+}e^{-} \rightarrow Y\bar{Y}$ at BESIII</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16298v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Bell nonlocality and entanglement are two kinds of quantum correlations in quantum systems. Due to the recent upgrade in Beijing Spectrometer III (BESIII) experiment, it is possible to explore the nonlocality and entanglement in hyperon-antihyperon systems produced in electron-positron annihilation with high precision data. We provide a systematic method for studying quantum correlations in spin-1/2 hyperon-antihyperon systems through the measures for the nonlocality and entanglement. We find that with nonvanishing polarizations of the hyperon and its antihyperon, the kinematic region of nonlocality in the hyperon-antihyperon system is more restricted than the $\tau^{+}\tau^{-}$ system in which polarizations of $\tau$ leptons are vanishing. We also present an experimental proposal to probe the nonlocality and entanglement in hyperon-antihyperon systems at BSEIII.</description>
