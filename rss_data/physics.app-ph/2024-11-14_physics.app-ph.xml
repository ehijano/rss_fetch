      <title>Optimizing Phononic Crystal Waveguides for Acoustically Induced Spin Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08125v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Through the use of strain and induced piezoelectric fields, surface acoustic waves have been shown to control quantum information processes, such as single photon emission and the coherent transport of electron spins. Regarding the latter, systems using plane surface waves have provided suitable demonstration systems, but to build complexity, more control over the acoustic wave may be required. One method for acoustic control is the use of phononic crystals consisting of periodic arrays of nanofabricated holes on the surface of a device. These inclusions form a metamaterial-like layer with properties different from the normal material to dictate the physics of wave motion. Exploiting these surface properties can lead to acoustic waveguides, which can be designed to control the path of the surface acoustic waves. The design parameters of a new type of phononic crystal waveguide is explored that uses 2-fold elliptical cylinder inclusions to create a slow region that also limits coupling and radiative loss to bulk acoustic modes. Such a waveguide would be the foundational piece in an acoustic circuit that could then mediate complex spin transport geometries.</description>

      <title>Flexible Thermoelectric Active Cooling Garment to Combat Extreme Heat</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the increasing frequency, intensity, and duration of extreme heat events due to climate change, heat-related diseases or even mortality have become more prevalent. An efficient personal cooling strategy can mitigate heat stress by regulating the skin temperature within the thermal comfort zone. However, lightweight, wearable, and sustainable cooling garments are unavailable today. Here, we developed a TED-based cooling garment and demonstrated its effectiveness in active personal cooling. The garment is shown to maintain the skin temperature within its thermal comfort zone in a hot environment of up to 40 oC under mild forced convection conditions (air flow speed of 2.2 m s-1). Furthermore, we demonstrated a portable cooling system with less than 700 grams of total weight, which includes the TED-based garment, a battery pack, and a temperature controller. The system showed long-term cooling on the skin with varying ambient temperatures from 35 to 40 oC. With the advantages of lightweight, flexible, controllable and long-term effective cooling, the TED cooling garments described in this work can contribute to enhanced health and comfort in an increasingly hotter climate.</description>

      <title>Intelligent Adaptive Metasurface in Complex Wireless Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08538v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The programmable metasurface is regarded as one of the most promising transformative technologies for next-generation wireless system applications. Due to the lack of effective perception ability of the external electromagnetic environment, there are numerous challenges in the intelligent regulation of wireless channels, and it still relies on external sensors to reshape electromagnetic environment as desired. To address that problem, we propose an adaptive metasurface (AMS) which integrates the capabilities of acquiring wireless environment information and manipulating reflected electromagnetic (EM) waves in a programmable manner. The proposed design endows the metasurfaces with excellent capabilities to sense the complex electromagnetic field distributions around them and then dynamically manipulate the waves and signals in real time under the guidance of the sensed information, eliminating the need for prior knowledge or external inputs about the wireless environment. For verification, a prototype of the proposed AMS is constructed, and its dual capabilities of sensing and manipulation are experimentally validated. Additionally, different integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) scenarios with and without the aid of the AMS are established. The effectiveness of the AMS in enhancing communication quality is well demonstrated in complex electromagnetic environments, highlighting its beneficial application potential in future wireless systems.</description>

      <title>Concurrent operando neutron imaging and diffraction analysis revealing spatial lithiation phase evolution in an ultra-thick graphite electrode</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08476v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Energy efficient, safe and reliable Li-ion batteries (LIBs) are required for a wide range of applications. Charging capabilities of thick electrodes still holding their stored high-energy is a most desirable characteristic in future advanced LIBs. The introduction of ultra-thick graphite anode meets limitations in internal electrode transport properties, leading to Li-ion gradients with detrimental consequences for battery cell performance and lifetime. Yet, there is a lack of experimental tools capable of providing a complete view of local processes and evolving gradients within such thick electrodes. Here, we introduce a multi-modal operando measurement approach, enabling quantitative spatio-temporal observations of Li concentrations and intercalation phases in ultra-thick, graphite electrodes. Neutron imaging and diffraction concurrently provide correlated information from the macroscopic scale of the cell and electrode down to the crystallographic scale portraying the intercalation and deintercalation processes. In particular, the evolving formation of the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI), observation of gradients in total lithium content, as well as in the formation of ordered LixC6 phases and trapped lithium have been mapped throughout the first charge-discharge cycle of the cell. Different lithiation stages co-exist during charging and discharging of an ultra-thick composite graphite-based electrode; delayed lithiation and delithiation processes are observed at the central region of the electrode, while the SEI formation, potential plating and dead lithium are predominantly found closer to the interface with the separator. The study furthermore emphasizes the potential of the method to study Li ion diffusion and the kinetics of lithiation phase formation in advanced ultra-thick electrodes.</description>

      <title>Effect of Top Al$_2$O$_3$ Interlayer Thickness on Memory Window and Reliability of FeFETs With TiN/Al$_2$O$_3$/Hf$_{0.5}$Zr$_{0.5}$O$_2$/SiO$_x$/Si (MIFIS) Gate Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08558v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the effect of top Al2O3 interlayer thickness on the memory window (MW) of Si channel ferroelectric field-effect transistors (Si-FeFETs) with TiN/Al$_2$O$_3$/Hf$_{0.5}$Zr$_{0.5}$O$_2$/SiO$_x$/Si (MIFIS) gate structure. We find that the MW first increases and then remains almost constant with the increasing thickness of the top Al2O3. The phenomenon is attributed to the lower electric field of the ferroelectric Hf$_{0.5}$Zr$_{0.5}$O$_2$ in the MIFIS structure with a thicker top Al2O3 after a program operation. The lower electric field makes the charges trapped at the top Al2O3/Hf0.5Zr0.5O$_2$ interface, which are injected from the metal gate, cannot be retained. Furthermore, we study the effect of the top Al$_2$O$_3$ interlayer thickness on the reliability (endurance characteristics and retention characteristics). We find that the MIFIS structure with a thicker top Al$_2$O$_3$ interlayer has poorer retention and endurance characteristics. Our work is helpful in deeply understanding the effect of top interlayer thickness on the MW and reliability of Si-FeFETs with MIFIS gate stacks.</description>

      <title>RSFQ All-Digital Programmable Multi-Tone Generator For Quantum Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08670v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the most important and topical challenges of quantum circuits is their scalability. Rapid Single Flux Quantum (RSFQ) technology is at the forefront of replacing current standard CMOS-based control architectures for a number of applications, including quantum computing and quantum sensor arrays. By condensing the control and readout to SFQ-based on-chip devices that are directly connected to the quantum systems, it is possible to minimise the total system overhead, improving scalability and integration. In this work, we present a novel RSFQ device that generates multi tone digital signals, based on complex pulse train sequences using a Circular Shift Register (CSR) and a comb filter stage. We show that the frequency spectrum of the pulse trains is dependent on a preloaded pattern on the CSR, as well as on the delay line of the comb filter stage. By carefully selecting both the pattern and delay, the desired tones can be isolated and amplified as required. Finally, we propose architectures where this device can be implemented to control and readout arrays of quantum devices, such as qubits and single photon detectors.</description>

      <title>Ferroelectric HfO$_2$-ZrO$_2$ multilayers with reduced wake-up</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08683v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Since the discovery of ferroelectricity in HfO$_2$ thin films, significant research has focused on Zr-doped HfO$_2$ and solid solution (Hf,Zr)O$_2$ thin films. Functional properties can be further tuned via multilayering, however, this approach has not yet been fully explored in HfO$_2$-ZrO$_2$ films. This work demonstrates ferroelectricity in a 50 nm thick, solution-processed HfO$_2$-ZrO$_2$ multilayer film, marking it as the thickest such film to date exhibiting ferroelectric properties. The multilayer structure was confirmed through transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy, with high-resolution TEM revealing grain continuity across multiple layers. This finding indicates that a polar phase in the originally paraelectric ZrO$_2$ layer, can be stabilized by the HfO$_2$ layer. The film attains a remanent polarization of 8 uC/cm$^2$ and exhibits accelerated wake-up behavior, attributed to its higher breakdown strength resulting from the incorporation of multiple interfaces. These results offer a faster wake-up mechanism for thick ferroelectric hafnia films.</description>

      <title>The effect of dataset size and the process of big data mining for investigating solar-thermal desalination by using machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.12594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.12594v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Machine learning's application in solar-thermal desalination is limited by data shortage and inconsistent analysis. This study develops an optimized dataset collection and analysis process for the representative solar still. By ultra-hydrophilic treatment on the condensation cover, the dataset collection process reduces the collection time by 83.3%. Over 1,000 datasets are collected, which is nearly one order of magnitude larger than up-to-date works. Then, a new interdisciplinary process flow is proposed. Some meaningful results are obtained that were not addressed by previous studies. It is found that Radom Forest might be a better choice for datasets larger than 1,000 due to both high accuracy and fast speed. Besides, the dataset range affects the quantified importance (weighted value) of factors significantly, with up to a 115% increment. Moreover, the results show that machine learning has a high accuracy on the extrapolation prediction of productivity, where the minimum mean relative prediction error is just around 4%. The results of this work not only show the necessity of the dataset characteristics' effect but also provide a standard process for studying solar-thermal desalination by machine learning, which would pave the way for interdisciplinary study.</description>

      <title>RCS prediction and optimization for anomalous reflection metasurfaces using Floquet analysis: measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.00858v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This letter proposes the design and measurement of a periodic metasurface that achieves anomalous reflection with reduced RCS in a given parasitic direction. A previous study proposed a semi-analytical model to predict the RCS behaviour of such a metasurface. However, this first study did not include any experimental exploration to verify the theoretical results. To complete this study, this work presents an experimental validation of the proposed design, with a focus on manufacturing and measurement issues. The synthesis, design specifications, fabrication method and experimental setup are presented and discussed. Measurement results are also examined in detail, highlighting some limitations in metasurfaces RCS measurements. The proposed metasurface effectively achieves the predicted RCS level reduction in the considered parasitic direction. The agreement between simulation and experimental results demonstrates the accuracy of the modelling and the efficiency of the optimisation procedure.</description>

      <title>Pulsed Vector Atomic Magnetometer Using an Alternating Fast-Rotating Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.00214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.00214v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a vector atomic magnetometer based on applying a fast-rotating magnetic field to a pulsed $^{87}$Rb scalar atomic magnetometer. This method enables simultaneous measurements of the total magnetic field and two polar angles relative to the plane of magnetic field rotation. Using two channels in a gradiometer mode, it provides simultaneous measurements of the total field gradient with a sensitivity of 35 $\mathrm{fT/\sqrt{Hz}}$ (0.7 part per billion), as well as two polar angles with resolutions of 6 $\mathrm{nrad/\sqrt{Hz}}$ at 50 $\mu$T Earth field strength. The noise spectrums of these measurements are flat down to 1 Hz and 0.1 Hz, respectively. Crucially, this approach avoids several metrological difficulties associated with vector magnetometers and gradiometers. We detail the fundamental, systematic, and practical limits of such vector magnetometers. Notably, we provide a comprehensive study of the systematic effects of vector atomic magnetometers. We introduce a new concept of dynamic heading error and investigate several other systematic effects. A unique peak-altering fast rotating field modulation is proposed to cancel out these systematics. Additionally, we derive fundamental limits on the sensitivity of such sensors and demonstrate that the vector sensitivity of the sensor can approach its scalar sensitivity while retaining the accuracy and metrological advantages of scalar sensors. This high-dynamic-range vector magnetometer, with ultrahigh resolution and inherent calibration, is suitable for a wide array of applications.</description>
